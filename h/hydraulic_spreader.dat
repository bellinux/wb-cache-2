This is done {{to ensure that the}} jade meets requirements. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>spreaders</b> are then inserted into cleavage points in the rock so that the jade can be broken away. Once the boulders are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws. The jade is then loaded onto trucks and transported to the proper storage facilities.|$|R

The accident scene is surveyed, {{and in the case}} of several injured persons, a triage process or other recognition of patients’ states is done. The most critically injured patients get more, faster, and better quality attention and treatment. In the case of a patient underneath a tram, lifting bags or hydraulic jacks brought by fire brigades can be used to elevate the tram and release the patient (see lifting points in [...] and a tow car lifting a tram in [...] A crane can be used to lift a tram, too, or an overturned tram. If a patient is trapped inside crushed structures, various kinds of extrication tools, like <b>hydraulic</b> <b>spreaders,</b> rams, cutters, and circular saws can be used. In some cases, it is also possible to drive the tram backwards, but in most cases this would only cause more injuries to the victim. While cutting, lifting or turning an overturned tram or vehicle, structures often have to be stabilized to avoid the movement of the vehicle, to prevent the risk of movements of suspension, and to avoid falling of lifted vehicles on the patient or the members of the rescue crew.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> rescue <b>spreaders</b> {{are used}} by {{emergency}} response personnel to extricate occupants from a vehicle crash. A lighter and more portable rescue spreader is required for better usability and to enable utilization {{in a variety of}} scenarios. To meet this requirement, topological synthesis, dimensional synthesis, and an optimization were used to develop a solution linkage. The topological synthesis technique demonstrates that ten links are the minimum possible number that achieves the desired motion without depending primarily on rotation of the spreader jaws. A novel integrated kinematic-structural dimensional synthesis technique is presented and used in a grid-search optimizing the linkage dimensions to minimize linkage mass. The resulting ten-bar linkage meets or exceeds the kinematic performance parameters while simultaneously achieving a near-optimum predicted mass...|$|R

Hurst Performance began to export parts to a European company, Zumro ResQtec, to avoid import duty. Zumro ResQtec {{was interested in}} developing these tools for use in auto racing, with ResQtec targeting the European market and Hurst targeting the American market. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>spreader</b> was originally developed in 1972 by Tim Smith and Mike Brick, who later developed a cutter and a hydraulic ram. When an occupant is trapped the tool is used to pry or cut the car to remove the occupant. It takes about two minutes to take the roof off a car. Mike Brick coined the phrase [...] "Jaws of Life" [...] after he observed people saying that their new device [...] "snatched people from the jaws of death". Later Brick went on to develop a single rescue tool that could perform all the functions of rescue—push, pull, cut and spread. His patent for this unique design {{eventually led to the}} Phoenix Rescue tool, which incorporates his design to this day.|$|E

While {{the design of}} mechanisms is a well-studied field, current optimization techniques generally focus on the kinematics and dynamics and relegate {{other aspects of the}} analysis to separate stages of the overall design process, resulting in a loss of optimality when the entire multi-domain system is considered. This thesis presents a general method by which a mechanism optimization problem may be efficiently formulated and solved, considering multiple competing design objectives across multiple analysis domains. Two case studies illustrate the practical application of this general method. The first is the kinematic-structural optimization of a <b>hydraulic</b> rescue <b>spreader</b> ("jaws of life"). The second is the kinematic-dynamic-thermodynamic optimization of a novel six-bar linkage for an internal combustion engine. A variety of powerful general-purpose multi-objective algorithms are available from the literature. In particular, genetic algorithms are well-suited to multi-objective problems, and the NSGA-II algorithm from this category is employed here. Three strategies are presented to formulate multi-domain mechanism optimizations in a way that can be solved efficiently by a multi-objective genetic algorithm and is free of explicit constraint functions even for complex problems. First, it is shown that the use of non-traditional design variables, such as angles and adaptive interpolations, can result in smaller design spaces to be searched and can guarantee that all optima lie within the selected range of a given design variable. It is also shown that traditional precision-position synthesis techniques can in some cases be employed in a preliminary analysis to reduce the dimension of the design space. Finally, a nested optimization structure is proposed in which kinematic design variables and objectives are optimized in an outer loop, with the non-kinematic problem being optimized in an inner loop at every outer loop iteration, improving the efficiency and stability of the optimization process. These techniques were applied to the <b>hydraulic</b> rescue <b>spreader</b> problem in order to design a six-bar mechanism that could exert a 10, 000 pound force through a pair of jaws over a 24 inch spreading distance while maintaining performance-critical kinematic behavior and remaining light and compact enough to be a handheld tool. The structural stresses in each part of the linkage were modeled, using a combination of analytical methods and finite element analysis. The final optimization result was superior to a similar commercially available model with respect to all four kinematic and structural objectives. Having successfully optimized a low-speed mechanism with a structural motivation, the method was also applied to a high-speed mechanism with a thermodynamic motivation. A Stephenson-III six-bar linkage was developed in order to optimize the motion of the piston in an internal combustion engine and achieve a cylinder volume as a function of time most conducive to efficient combustion. A number of mechanical objectives relating to balancing and mechanism size were used in order to find a solution capable of practical implementation. A slight increase in thermal efficiency over a purely sinusoidal piston motion was obtained, along with satisfactory values of the mechanical objectives...|$|R
