5|$|Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit {{declared}} August 19, 2007 to be {{a national}} day of prayer and thanks-giving. The destruction of 546 residences forced approximately 1,000people into 100 shelters. A USAID disaster specialist liaised with the Dominican Office of Disaster Management and arraigned for assistance to the order of US$60,648 of relief supplies and $25,000 of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Shelter</b> supplies.|$|E
5|$|By one {{day after}} the storm, power {{companies}} restored electricity to 151,000 customers. Citizens in Montegut circulated a petition for a class-action lawsuit in response to the levee failure. The American Red Cross set up a church in Reserve as an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter.</b> Only five people stayed the first night, resulting in the organization to convert it to a family services center. Over 100families asked for food assistance. The Red Cross also set up a shelter in Houma, where 14people stayed.|$|E
5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared {{to pose a}} threat to Bermuda, its government issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a school to be used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter,</b> though few people used it.|$|E
50|$|In many {{counties}} and cities, the local <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> programs along with pet co-sheltering (Animal Response Teams) are trained and organized by Citizen Corps. Some <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> programs work with local Red Cross districts, along with various NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations, such as community centers and Faith-based {{groups such as}} Churches). By coordinating <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> programs at local Emergency Management Offices or EOCs (Emergency Operations Centers), efforts are efficient and save everyone money and time.|$|R
40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> is a {{temporary}} source of safety and support for people affected by disasters. People access <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> just prior to or soon after a disaster; therefore they are often scared, stressed, and/or experiencing loss/grief. The gathering of people in shelters also increases several environmental health risks. Therefore ensuring <b>emergency</b> <b>shelters</b> contain adequate facilities (permanent or temporary) and are well managed is essential in providing immediate support to disaster-affected communities and providing a level of assurance that the agencies involved are capable of supporting them through the recovery process. This paper will be presented by representatives of Australian Red Cross and Environmental Health Australia (Queensland), which both {{have an interest in}} <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> in Queensland. The paper will cover the development, content and application of the ‘Preferred <b>Sheltering</b> Practices for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Sheltering</b> in Australia’ and the roles of various organisations in relation to <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering.</b> The importance of or- ganisational collaboration will also be discussed, with a focus on the experience of the two organisations fol- lowing the 2011 floods in Queensland and how they are collaborating to improve future operations in evacu- ation centres, which are a common form of <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering</b> in Queensland. The organisations are con- tinuing to work together with the ultimate goal of improving services to disaster-affected communities and supporting such communities to start the recovery process...|$|R

5|$|Late on August17, the {{government}} of Jamaica issued a hurricane watch for the island, due to anticipated strengthening. The next day, it was upgraded to a hurricane warning briefly before being amended to a tropical storm warning, due to the storm's weakening in the central Caribbean. In the country, officials advised fishermen to return to harbor, while some flights into Norman Manley International Airport were canceled. A tropical storm warning was also issued for the Cayman Islands, where an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> was opened. There, tourists were recommended to temporarily leave the islands.|$|E
5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier. In {{the aftermath of the}} storm, disaster aid was delivered to the victims of Osea. President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter,</b> though the house itself sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|The ruined {{walls of}} the {{observatory}} are a prominent feature on the summit. An <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> has been built {{on top of the}} observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather. Although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain, the roof of the shelter overtops the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A war memorial to the dead of World War II is located next to the observatory.|$|E

5|$|There {{were about}} 578,424 {{sheltered}} and unsheltered homeless {{persons in the}} U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> or transitional housing program. In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns {{at some point during}} the year, and most cases were not chronic. According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Osea was {{extremely}} destructive {{to some of}} the islands in French Polynesia. Over 700homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs were blown off of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% of the infrastructure was destroyed. The town hall, twoschools, and an airfield were destroyed. The town hall was originally being used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter,</b> but was later evacuated due to strong winds and was later destroyed. Furthermore, many roadways and highways were blocked due to flooding. In addition, 77homes on the island were destroyed. All but threehomes that belonged to Mormons on the island were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of Bermuda issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} island on September 8, which {{was followed by a}} tropical storm warning on September 9. These were replaced by a hurricane warning on September 10, coinciding with the storm's strengthening to hurricane intensity. The government urged the potentially impacted citizens to take preparations for the storm, many of whom bought supplies at local hardware stores. Residents installed storm shutters, while boat owners moved their yachts to safer locations. An <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> was prepared on the island. Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials canceled bus and ferry service, and also closed all schools and {{government of}}fices on the day of impact. The Bermuda International Airport was also closed.|$|E
5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Babs {{entered the}} PAGASA area of responsibility, {{government}} workers began closely tracking {{the storm and}} warned residents to be prepared. PAGASA issued a Public Storm Warning Signal #4 for Catanduanes, with lower warnings issued throughout Luzon and the Visayas. Metro Manila was placed under Public Storm Warning Signal #3 on October22. In Catanduanes, evacuees utilized public schools as an <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter,</b> although many rode out the storm in their homes. The storm halted ferry service throughout the region, stranding thousands. Many residents in Samar slept in buses and cars for two days due to the cancellations. Bus service to the region was also halted. The stock and currency exchanges were closed during the storm. Officials advised residents in Metro Manila to remain indoors; government buildings and schools were closed, while Ninoy Aquino International Airport halted all domestic flights. In addition, 14international flights were canceled. Manila South Harbor also kept all boats at port. Across the Philippines, Babs forced about 400,000people to leave their houses. Many families waited to evacuate until the onslaught of the strongest winds, resulting in additional casualties.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, one oil company {{evacuated}} its oil rigs off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter, {{with several other}} companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers. Ultimately, 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms. The threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port. Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed, and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas. An <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations. An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas living in an area below 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana. In all, about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
