5000|$|The {{velocity}} of the siphon is thus driven solely by the height difference between {{the surface of the}} upper reservoir and the <b>drain</b> <b>point.</b> The height of the intermediate high point, hB, does not affect the {{velocity of}} the siphon. However, as the siphon is a single system, vB = vC and the intermediate high point does limit the maximum velocity.

50|$|The {{concrete}} floor in most basements is structurally {{not part of}} the foundation; only the basement walls are. If there are posts supporting a main floor beam to form a post and beam system, these posts typically go right through the basement floor to a footing underneath the basement floor. It is the footing that supports the post and the footing is part of the house foundation. Load-bearing wood-stud walls rest directly on the {{concrete floor}}. Under the concrete floor is typically gravel or crushed stone to facilitate draining. The floor is typically four inches (100 mm) thick and it rests on top of the foundation footings. The floor is typically sloped towards a <b>drain</b> <b>point,</b> in case of leaks.|$|E
40|$|Perfect imaging of {{electromagnetic}} waves using the Maxwell ﬁsh eye (MFE) requires a new concept: a point called the perfect drain {{that we shall}} call the perfect <b>point</b> <b>drain.</b> From the mathematical point of view, a perfect <b>point</b> <b>drain</b> is just like an ideal point source, except that it drains power from the electromagnetic ﬁeld instead of generating it. We introduce here the perfect drain for the MFE as a dissipative region of non-zero size that completely drains the power from the point source. To accomplish this goal, the region must have a precise complex permittivity that depends on its size {{as well as on}} the frequency. The perfect <b>point</b> <b>drain</b> is obtained when the diameter of the perfect drain tends to zero. This interpretation of the perfect <b>point</b> <b>drain</b> is connected well with common concepts {{of electromagnetic}} theory, opening up both modeling in computer simulations and experimental veriﬁcation of setups containing a perfect <b>point</b> <b>drain...</b>|$|R

40|$|A set of GIS tools {{has been}} {{developed}} (Road Sediment Analysis Model, RSAM) to analyze and quantify the impacts of forest roads on forested watersheds. RSAM is organized into three modules. In the first module sediment production for each road segment is calculated from slope, length, road surface condition and road side drain vegetation. A GPS gathered road condition inventory provides surface and drain conditions, locations of drain points, information on connectivity between drain points and streams, and information on road stream crossings. Slope is obtained from the GIS by overlaying the road path on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Road sediment production is accumulated at each <b>drain</b> <b>point</b> by adding the sediment production draining to each <b>drain</b> <b>point</b> from different road segments. These <b>drain</b> <b>point</b> sediment loadings are then coupled with a DEM model for surface flow and used as inputs to a weighted flow accumulation function to calculate sediment load inputs to stream segments, also delineated based on the DEM. An option allows accumulation of all sediment produced or only sediment produced from drain points inventoried as connected to the stream. The second module analyzes the impact of forest roads on terrain stability. Terrain stability is assessed by calculating the specific discharge due to road drainage and using this, together with slope, as inputs to an infinite plane slope stability model. In the final module the inventory information on the fish passage status of stream crossings is used to demarcate contiguous clusters of stream habitat and {{assess the impact of}} fish passage barriers on the fragmentation of stream habitat. A map showing possible fish habitat clusters is obtained from the analysis. To ensure referential integrity between road segments, drain points and the stream network attributes, and to validate the road inventory dataset a relational database model framework is used. Preprocessing software {{has been developed}} to load the road inventory data into this framework and fulfill initial quality control and data validation functions. The sediment production, terrain stability and habitat cluster contiguity analyses then works off data from the relational database...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} first step in managing forest roads for improved water quality and aquatic habitat is the performance of an inventory. The Geomorphic Roads Analysis and Inventory Package (GRAIP) was developed {{as a tool for}} making a comprehensive inventory and analysis of the effects of forest roads on watersheds. This manual describes the data analysis and process of a GRAIP road inventory study using GRAIP v. 1. 0. 8 and the field data dictionary INVENT 5. 0. GRAIP uses field data collected with a GPS and a specific data dictionary that is imported into ArcGIS as shapefiles. The data are corrected and then run through the GRAIP toolbar, which also uses inputs from TauDEM (for stream network delineation) and SINMAP (for landslide risk). GRAIP estimates the quantity of sediment generated for each road segment by modifying a base erosion rate with road slope, segment length, flow path vegetation, and road surface type. The sediment at each <b>drain</b> <b>point</b> is routed to the stream network based on field observations of delivery, and output as accumulated sediment in the entire network, direct sediment for each stream segment, and specific sediment per unit contributing area. Observations of delivery at each drainage feature {{can also be used to}} calculate road-stream hydrologic connectivity. GRAIP calculates landslide risk associated with additional water from road network drainage...|$|E

These small-scale motions {{are thought to be}} determinant in the evolution of magnetic footpoints and their interaction with plasma and therefore likely {{to play a role in}} heating the upper solar atmosphere by twisting magnetic flux tubes. We report the observation of magnetic concentrations being dragged towards the center of a convective vortex motion in the solar photosphere from high- resolution ground-based and space-borne data. We describe this event by analyzing a series of images at different solar atmospheric layers. By computing horizontal proper motions, we detect a vortex whose center appears to be the <b>draining</b> <b>point</b> for the magnetic concentrations detected in magnetograms and well-correlated with the locations of bright points seen in G-band and CN images.
