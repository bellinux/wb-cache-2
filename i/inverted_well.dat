40|$|Barind Tract of Bangladesh {{is one of}} the driest {{parts of}} the region where surface water {{supplies}} are limited. Large parts of this tract used to be fallow land because there were no major irrigation facilities until mid 1980 s. A detailed hydro geological and groundwater survey of Bangladesh was implemented by UNDP in February 1978; Barind was described as follows, “the zone lie on the western Rajshahi known as Barind Tract. Thick clay deposits have been proven by test drilling which indicates that the main aquifer does not exist in the upper 300 m. Therefore groundwater potential is limited to development from relatively thin, fine grained sand zones that appear within the clay sequence. The aquifer is capable of supporting only small domestic needs”. The above mentioned theoretical study result of UNDP is surpassed by the innovation of “INVERTED WELL”. This was the outcome of the actual field trials to meet the local need and match available aquifer conditions that was not suitable for conventional well design. However, desired improved yield from aquifers of limited saturated thickness using <b>inverted</b> <b>wells</b> were achieved. Despite initial surveys which indicated the non-availability of major groundwater resources, till to-date there are around 6625 successful drilled wells are irrigating about 400, 000 acres producing approximately one million metric ton of cereals food.

40|$|Information about {{reservoir}} properties {{usually comes}} from two sources: seismic data and well logs. The former provide an indirect, low resolution image of rock velocity and density. The latter provide direct, high resolution (but laterally sparse) sampling {{of these and}} other rock parameters. An important problem in reservoir characterization is how best to combine these data sets, allowing the well information to constrain the seismic inversion and, conversely, using the seismic data to spatially interpolate and extrapolate the well logs. We develop a seismic/well log inversion method that combines geostatistical techniques for well log interpolation (i. e., kriging) with a Monte Carlo search method for seismic inversion. We cast our inversion procedure {{in the form of a}} Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in which the prior is iteratively modified so that the algorithm converges to the model that maximizes the likelihood function. We follow the approach used by Haas and Dubrule (1994) in their sequential inversion algorithm. Kriging is applied to the well data to obtain velocity estimates and their covariances for use as a priori constraints in the seismic inversion. Inversion of a complete 3 -D seismic section is performed one trace at a time. The velocity profiles derived from previous seismic traces are incorporated as "pseudo well logs" in subsequent applications of kriging. Our version of this algorithm employs a more efficient Monte Carlo search method in the seismic inversion, and moves sequentially away from the wells so as to minimize the kriging variance at each step away from the <b>inverted</b> <b>wells.</b> Numerical experiments with synthetic data demonstrate the viability of our seismic/ well data inversion scheme.

40|$|In {{two-dimensional}} topological insulators, such as <b>inverted</b> HgTe/CdTe quantum <b>wells,</b> helical quantum spin Hall (QSH) states persist even at finite {{magnetic fields}} below a critical magnetic field B_c, above which only quantum Hall (QH) states can be found. Using linear-response theory, we theoretically investigate the magneto-optical properties of <b>inverted</b> HgTe/CdTe quantum <b>wells,</b> both for infinite two-dimensional and finite-strip geometries, and possible signatures {{of the transition}} between the QSH and QH regimes. In the absorption spectrum, several peaks arise due to non-equidistant Landau levels in both regimes. However, in the QSH regime, we find an additional absorption peak at low energies in the finite-strip geometry. This peak arises due {{to the presence of}} edge states in this geometry and persists for any Fermi level in the QSH regime, while in the QH regime the peak vanishes if the Fermi level is situated in the bulk gap. Thus, by sweeping the gate voltage, it is possible to experimentally distinguish between the QSH and QH regimes due to this signature. Moreover, we investigate the effect of spin-orbit coupling and finite temperature on this measurement scheme. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Most {{medium to}} high quality digital cameras (DSLRs) acquire images at a spatial rate which is several times below the ideal Nyquist rate. For this reason only aliased {{versions}} of the cameral point-spread function (PSF) can be directly observed. Yet, it can be recovered, at a sub-pixel resolution, by a numerical method. Since the ac-quisition system is only locally stationary, this PSF esti-mation must be local. This paper presents a theoretical study proving that the sub-pixel PSF estimation problem is well-posed even with a single well chosen observation. Indeed, theoretical bounds show that a near-optimal accu-racy can be achieved with a calibration pattern mimicking a Bernoulli(0. 5) random noise. The physical realization of this PSF estimation method is demonstrated in many com-parative experiments. We use an algorithm to accurately es-timate the pattern position and its illumination conditions. Once this accurate registration is obtained, the local PSF can be directly computed by <b>inverting</b> a <b>well</b> conditioned linear system.

We consider a specialized {{case in which the}} length of the discrete wavelet transform is not much longer than the length of the filter used in its construction. For this case, we prove the existence of additional degrees of freedom in the system of equations used {{in the construction of the}} aforementioned orthogonal filters.

We show that friend faces are recognized more quickly than unfamiliar faces in upright but not in inverted orientations, suggesting that configural processing underlies this particular advantage.
