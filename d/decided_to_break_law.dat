40|$|Health {{conscientious}} objection in Spain: nature and exercise Conscientious objection is conceived as the infringement {{of a legal}} duty, peacefully and morally motivated, which aims to safeguard the own moral integrity against a heteronomous imperative judged as unfair. Generally, there is social agreement concerning some justice principles that generate group-shared laws. However, there can be disagreement {{among some of the}} members of the group, which can lead them <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the <b>law.</b> The aim of this paper is to reflect on the social and juridical legitimacy of an individual’s moral obligation to disobey a rule that is incompatible with his or her personal options, in order to assert that faculty and base it on the existence of a {{conscientious objection}} right.

In an interview, Mark MacPhail Jr. said of his father, [...] "He gave his life for the community and now I'm trying to help out his name and help him in some way." [...] Of the appeals process, he says, [...] "The past two years we've had countless appeals and it just keeps on getting drug out." [...] Of Davis, MacPhail said, [...] "He <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the <b>law.</b> And our law says, you kill an officer of the law, who tries to uphold it, you must be punished." [...] The 11th Circuit issued an order extending the stay of execution for 30 days to allow Davis the opportunity to file a habeas corpus petition with the U.S. Supreme Court. Davis filed a petition for habeas corpus with the U.S. Supreme Court on May 19, 2009.|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{articles}} I have explained the relevance of sociological theory to crime policy. Specifically I have sought to use a sociological explanation of why certain areas have high crime rates in order to make crime policy recommendations. The theory on which I have relied, social disorganization theory, postulates that the structural and cultural organization of neighborhoods can either facilitate or hinder crime occurrence. By paying attention to these phenomena, I have argued that the state, through its criminal policy, can usefully harness norms in order to help residents of high-crime communities help themselves resist and control crime. Because social organization theory focuses on places and not people, missing from this theory is an explanation of why individuals <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the <b>law</b> in the first place. Social organization theory focuses on the infrastructure of relationships in a community (what I have referred to elsewhere as norm highways), and it specifies how ideas, norms, and values that are centered around compliance can be promoted and promulgated. But social organization theory 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of crime persistence in certain areas does not specify the content of the norms, values, and ideas pertaining to compliance that are facilitated by certain organizational structures. The content of the norms of compliance must be supplied elsewhere...|$|R
