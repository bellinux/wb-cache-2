5|$|Zell {{lived at}} the same orphanage {{as many of the}} other protagonists; this is where Seifer first began to bully him. He was later adopted by the Dincht family in the town of Balamb. <b>His</b> <b>motivation</b> for enrolling at Garden is {{to live up to the}} memory of his grandfather, a famous soldier.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors who gave the credit to Numa explained <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens a gym in the building, which intrigues Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who's {{been looking}} to lose weight. However, Dwight's gym is only filled with his farming {{equipment}} as exercising equipment. Darryl says he needs actual equipment, which Dwight finally gets, but sees that Darryl is barely using it. Dwight asks more employees to join to help motivate Darryl to exercise harder. During a bench-press, Dwight refuses to spot Darryl unless he says <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> to work out.

5|$|Minor Crusading efforts lingered {{into the}} 14thcentury, and several Crusades were {{launched}} during the 14th and 15th centuries {{to counter the}} expansion of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. In 1309 as many as 30,000 peasants gathered from England, north-eastern France, and Germany proceeded as far as Avignon but disbanded there. Peter I of Cyprus captured and sacked Alexandria in 1365 in {{what became known as the}} Alexandrian Crusade; <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> was as much commercial as religious. LouisII led the 1390 Barbary Crusade against Muslim pirates in North Africa; after a ten-week siege, the Crusaders signed a ten-year truce.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. <b>His</b> <b>motivation</b> for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} of time in her efforts on behalf of the OSA agents, Christman felt {{conflicted}} in her activities, because she supported freedom of speech and she felt her activities constituted censorship. The operator of Xenu.net, Andreas Heldal-Lund, saw Christman's posts on ARS and reached out to her via email on July 14, 2000. The two engaged in communication, and Heldal-Lund explained to Christman <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> for managing the Operation Clambake site. Christman identified with Heldal-Lund's ideals of free speech, and on July 20, 2000, she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS. She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions, and asked Heldal-Lund for help; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the Lisa McPherson Trust (LMT) who were based in Clearwater, Florida. The LMT was started by Robert Minton and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member, Lisa McPherson.|$|E

5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and <b>his</b> <b>motivation.</b> He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|Make Way for Ducklings, {{published}} in 1941, was McCloskey's second book {{and was the}} winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov, a {{conflicted}} former student, {{lives in}} a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg. He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. <b>His</b> <b>motivation</b> comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, {{there is a danger}} of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
25|$|John Jr. {{transferred}} all {{his title}} to the family property to his mother in January 1865. That act may have additional implications. A traitor's property could be seized, and John's knowledge was certainly <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> for relinquishing his {{title to the}} houses and land. Mary may have known of <b>his</b> <b>motivation</b> as well or at least suspected. If she did, she would have possessed at least de facto knowledge of the conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|The former {{policeman}} Tsuda {{was sent}} to prison near Kushiro, Hokkaidō, and died of an illness in September of the same year. <b>His</b> <b>motivation</b> for the attack remains unclear with explanations ranging from mental derangement to hatred of foreigners.|$|E

25|$|Whatever <b>his</b> <b>motivation,</b> {{the fact}} that Rivers's {{interests}} lay in neurology and psychology became evident in this period.
