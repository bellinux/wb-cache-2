5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with <b>knowing</b> <b>all</b> {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E

25|$|A Venetian {{ambassador}} of {{that time}} praised Marguerite as <b>knowing</b> <b>all</b> the secrets of diplomatic art, hence {{to be treated with}} deference and circumspection. Marguerite's most remarkable adventure involved freeing her brother, King Francis I, who had been held prisoner in Spain by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor after being captured in the Battle of Pavia, Italy, 1525. During a critical period of the negotiations, Queen Marguerite rode horseback through wintry woods, twelve hours a day for many days, to meet a safe-conduct deadline, while writing her diplomatic letters at night.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. IGN reporter Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating ("Good"), commenting that [...] "what really made me enjoy 'The Great Wife Hope' were the peripheral bits, characters and jokes outside the main storyline. There were many, {{and they were}} funny." [...] Canning wrote that the weakest part about the episode was the underdevelopment of Englebrit, but that [...] "there were plenty of other things squeezed in around this bout to make the episode an enjoyable watch"—these included Ralph Wiggum {{being used as a}} bell for Bart and Nelson's fight, Nelson wanting to be an event planner, and Carl's line about not <b>knowing</b> <b>all</b> African Americans in the world simply because he is one himself.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} beginning, Chibnall envisaged Ianto meeting Tanizaki {{at an airport}} and then escorting him to a hotel before {{entering}} the Hub, however that was cut from the final draft {{as it would be}} an expensive sequence to film. Chibnall wanted the episode to take place several weeks after the previous episode, [...] "Ghost Machine", as to show Gwen <b>knowing</b> <b>all</b> the protocols and how to handle weapons, where as in the last episode, Gwen was still considered a rookie. Despite the episode being about stopping Lisa, Chibnall still wanted the beginning to be a love story between her and Ianto, and show the audience that a half-converted Lisa is still human and the girlfriend Ianto loves. Also, because Ianto is [...] "fundamentally wrong" [...] about thinking Lisa can be saved, Chibnall wanted the audience to sympathise with the character and his motives.|$|E

[...] Unaware of this, Rincewind and Twoflower take the place of the two cosmonauts and 'escape' to the spacecraft, which they accidentally launch, catapulting them off the rim.

500|$|The {{estimation}} of stature by anthropologists {{is based on}} a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds. Stature is given as a range of possible values, in centimeters, and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg. The three bones that are used are the femur, the tibia, and the fibula. In addition to the leg bones, the bones of the arm, the humerus, ulna, and radius can be used. The formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual. Sex, ancestry, and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height, if possible. This is due to the differences that occur between populations, sexes, and age groups. By <b>knowing</b> <b>all</b> the variables associated with height, a more accurate estimate can be made. For example, a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is [...] A female of the same ancestry would use the formula, [...] It is also important to note an individual's approximate age when determining stature. This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages. After age 30, a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of <b>knowing</b> <b>all</b> the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E
