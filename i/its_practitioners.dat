According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement. <b>Its</b> <b>practitioners</b> model their faith on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} {{has been a}} recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of <b>its</b> <b>practitioners</b> turned their attention from developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad, leading {{to the birth of}} international emergency medicine. They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E

5|$|Fascism {{has been}} {{prescribed}} dubious stances on feminism by <b>its</b> <b>practitioners</b> and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform {{presented in the}} Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary {{groups such as the}} fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetics}} of film noir {{are influenced by}} German Expressionism, an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who {{had been involved in}} the Expressionist movement or studied with <b>its</b> <b>practitioners.</b> M (Fritz Lang 1931), shot only a few years before his departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (mise-en-scène), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, <b>its</b> <b>practitioners</b> may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E

Black's resources—more queenside space for example—are not to be underestimated. In fact, this asymmetry often leads to violent middlegames and neatly constructed mating nets involving sacrifices.|$|R

25|$|Theological views within Wicca are diverse, and the {{religion}} encompasses theists, atheists, and agnostics, with some viewing {{the religion}}'s deities as entities with a literal existence and others viewing them as Jungian archetypes or symbols. Even among theistic Wiccans, there are divergent beliefs, and Wicca includes pantheists, monotheists, duotheists, and polytheists. Common to these divergent perspectives, however, is that Wicca's deities {{are viewed as}} forms of ancient, pre-Christian divinities by <b>its</b> <b>practitioners.</b>|$|E

Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings.|$|R

A few virtuoso players are known by their reputation, such as Andrey Sychra (from Lithuania), and the Widort family, originally from Austria but active in Ukraine since the late 18th century. The Widort family produced three generations of torban players: Gregor Widort, his son Cajetan, and grandson Franz.|$|E

First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{transition}} {{was not without}} its difficulties, and during this period {{the belief in the}} effectiveness of the older methods of memory training (to say nothing of the esteem in which <b>its</b> <b>practitioners</b> were held) steadily became occluded. In 1584, a huge controversy over the method broke out in England when the Puritans attacked the art as impious because it was thought to excite absurd and obscene thoughts; this was a sensational, but ultimately not a fatal skirmish. Erasmus of Rotterdam and other humanists, Protestant and Catholic, had also chastised practitioners of the art of memory for making extravagant claims for its efficacy, although they themselves believed firmly in a well-disposed, orderly memory as an essential tool of productive thought.|$|E
25|$|Poetic modernism was an overtly revolutionary {{literary}} movement, a 'revolution of the word', and, for {{a number}} of <b>its</b> <b>practitioners,</b> this interest in radical change spilled over into politics. A number of the leading early modernists became known for their right-wing views; these included Eliot, who once described himself as a Royalist, Stein, who supported the Vichy government for a time at least, and, most notoriously, Pound, who, after moving to Italy in the early 1930s, openly admired Benito Mussolini and began to include anti-Semitic sentiments in his writings. He was arrested towards the end of World War II on charges of treason arising out of broadcasts he made on Italian radio during the war but never faced trial because of his mental health.|$|E
