50|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{operated}} by an engine-driven cam, {{and the position}} of the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is set so that it opens (and hence generates a spark) at exactly the correct moment needed to ignite the fuel {{at the top of the}} piston's compression stroke. The <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is usually mounted on a plate that is able to rotate relative to the camshaft operating it. The plate is rotated by a centrifugal mechanism, thus advancing the ignition timing (making the spark occur earlier) at higher revolutions. This gives the fuel time to burn so that the resulting gases reach their maximum pressure at the same time as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder. The plate's position can also be moved a small distance using a small manifold vacuum-operated servomechanism, providing advanced timing when the engine is required to speed up on demand. This helps to prevent pre-ignition (or pinging).|$|R
50|$|The {{distributor}} shaft has a cam that operates the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> (also called points). Opening the points causes a high induction voltage in the system's ignition coil.|$|R
50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of using}} a mechanical switch {{as part of the}} ignition timing {{is that it is not}} very precise, needs regular adjustment of the dwell (contact) angle, and at higher revolutions, its mass becomes significant, leading to poor operation at higher engine speeds. These effects can largely be overcome using electronic ignition systems, where the <b>contact</b> <b>breakers</b> are retrofitted by a magnetic (Hall effect) or optical sensor device. However, because of their simplicity, and since <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points gradually degrade instead of catastrophically failing, they are still used on aircraft engines.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> (or [...] "points") {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} switch, and the term typically refers to the switching device found in the distributor of the ignition systems of spark-ignition internal combustion engines.|$|R
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{spark ignition}} is that using a magneto. The engine spins a magnet inside a coil, or, {{in the earlier}} designs, a coil inside a fixed magnet, and also operates a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker,</b> interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap. The spark plugs are connected directly from the magneto output. Early magnetos had one coil, with the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> (sparking plug) inside the combustion chamber. In about 1902, Bosch introduced a double-coil magneto, with a fixed sparking plug, and the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> outside the cylinder. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as those found in mopeds, lawnmowers, snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where a battery-based electrical system is not present for any combination of necessity, weight, cost, and reliability reasons. [...] They are also used on piston-engined aircraft engines. [...] Although an electrical supply is available, magneto systems are used mainly because of their higher reliability.|$|R
25|$|The {{system is}} powered by a {{lead-acid}} battery, which is charged by the car's electrical system using a dynamo or alternator. The engine operates <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points, which interrupt the current to an induction coil (known as the ignition coil).|$|R
50|$|A simpler device, the {{low tension}} coil, {{was already in}} use for {{stationary}} engines and spark-ignition gas engines. This was a simple iron-core inductor, used with a battery and a switch called a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker.</b> It had a single winding and so was not a transformer like the trembler coil. When the piston was at the right point, the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> opened, breaking the battery current. Self-induction due to the collapsing magnetic field generated a high voltage pulse in the coil, which {{was applied to the}} spark plug. The drawback of the low tension coil was that the high ignition voltage was generated in the same circuit as the low voltage battery current flowed in.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981 Both models see {{a series}} of improvements, {{including}} an automatic choke unit, a more rugged kick starter to replace the wind up starter, and a solid state Capacitor discharge ignition {{in place of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> based system. The Express II also receives an automatic two-speed transmission.|$|R
50|$|Wasted spark systems still {{require a}} timing {{signal from the}} crankshaft. In a {{conventional}} four-stroke engine, this signal must also observe the phase of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft, so <b>contact</b> <b>breakers</b> are normally driven from the camshaft and distributor drive. With a wasted spark, the crankshaft can be used instead, as the system fires on both revolutions. It simplifies the mechanical arrangements {{since there is no}} distributor drive and the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> cam can be fixed to the crankshaft. Although a 2:1 reduction gear is still required to operate the camshaft and valves, the precision of this drive is now less critical (ignition timing is more critical for engine performance than valve timing): engines continue to run adequately even with worn camshaft drives and imprecise timing.|$|R
50|$|The T140 {{features}} a standard Lucas 12 volt electrical system, early models were positive earth {{with a change}} to negative earth from 1979 onwards. Zener diodes are used for voltage regulation. Early engines used <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> point <b>ignition</b> with electronic ignition becoming standard fitment on all Triumph's 750cc twins from 1979-on.|$|R
50|$|Boxer-twin {{engines are}} {{well suited to}} the wasted spark {{ignition}} system, a distributor-less ignition system using a double-ended coil firing both spark plugs on each revolution, that is, on both the compression stroke and the exhaust stroke. This system requires only a single <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> and single coil to run two cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The Triumph worker's {{co-operative}} at the Meriden factory re-introduced the Thunderbird {{model name}} to their range in April 1981. The Triumph TR65 Thunderbird 650 cc parallel-twin was a short-stroke {{version of the}} 750 cc T140 Bonneville engine and was the cheapest model in Triumph's range with budget features such as a drum rather than disc rear brake, {{the absence of a}} tachometer, a siamesed exhaust system, painted rather than polished alloy and economy Dunlop Gold Seal tyres. Moreover, whereas Triumph's 750cc range had electronic ignition, the TR65 was fitted with <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points. Respecting its lineage, the model retained the Turner-designed 'paper dart' logo on its side panels but with a different, updated 'Thunderbird' script. The TR65 was priced upon introduction at £1829.82.The economy finish was upgraded for 1982 'export' models although the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points and drum rear brake remained.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the spark}} voltage is also {{dependent}} on contact effectiveness, and poor sparking {{can lead to}} lower engine efficiency. A mechanical <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> system cannot control an average ignition current of more than about 3 A while still giving a reasonable service life, and this may limit {{the power of the}} spark and ultimate engine speed.|$|R
50|$|In older vehicles, {{a single}} coil would serve all the spark plugs via the {{ignition}} distributor. Notable exceptions are the Saab 92, some Volkswagens, and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder. The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> in a wasted spark system.|$|R

25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the points (or <b>contact</b> <b>breaker)</b> closed. A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed breaker points and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil's core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir {{that will be used}} to drive the ignition spark.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is to {{interrupt}} the current flowing in the primary circuit of the ignition coil. When this occurs, the collapsing current induces a high voltage in the secondary winding of the coil, which has many more windings. This causes a very high voltage to appear at the coil output for a short period—enough to arc across the electrodes of a spark plug.|$|R

25|$|A distributor-based {{system is}} not greatly {{different}} from a magneto system except that more separate elements are involved. There are also advantages to this arrangement. For example, {{the position of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points relative to the engine angle can be changed a small amount dynamically, allowing the ignition timing to be automatically advanced with increasing revolutions per minute (RPM) or increased manifold vacuum, giving better efficiency and performance.|$|R
50|$|A {{successor}} to the C11, the C15 had a completely redesigned frame and 250 cc engine. The bike proved to need careful maintenance, being prone to oil leaks, electrical faults, gearbox problems, valve-gear failures, a weak big-end, and clutch adjustment problems.Initially, the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> housing protruded {{at the rear of}} the cylinder above the gearbox, but was later relocated to the right-side crankcase, accessed via a circular plate.|$|R

50|$|The term Renix {{also has}} a number of applications. In certain {{carburetor}} equipped Renault and Volvo models, it provides an electronic ignition system, consisting of an engine control unit (ECU) to replace the job of <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points in the distributor. The system uses an angle sensor and a number of fuel sensors to provide a maintenance-free ignition system. The ECU is sealed and cannot be serviced, and the EPROM cannot be re-programmed.|$|R
50|$|The bike was silently {{launched}} in India {{in the late}} 1970s by Ideal Jawa and was a rare sight even in those days. The bike had a prominent petrol/fuel tank and the colour was Jawa Maroon and sometimes in black and gold pinstripe, priced slightly higher than the best selling Classic and CL II models. The troublesome <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>ignition</b> was later replaced in 1993. Until 1989, the RoadKings had a provision for adjusting the front fork dampers.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, in {{an effort}} to {{increase}} fuel efficiency and to solve starting problems the CB or <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> <b>ignition</b> units were replaced with CDI electronic ignition units. The electrics were changed to 12 volt from 6 volt. The livery was also changed with some new graphics. The fuel efficiency was increased by 30%, but still its competitors were getting better and with rising fuel prices the sales plummeted down until finally it ceased operations in 1997.|$|R
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} breaker points to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|R
50|$|Rooster Booster is {{also the}} name {{for a range of}} Electronic Ignition Systems made by Rooster Ignitions in the United Kingdom. They produce {{universal}} and custom ignition modules for Classic Vehicles and Motorcycles. The Range includes the Rooster Booster Junior for small Flywheel Magneto fired engines and the RB1 which is a points assisted transistorised Electronic Ignition module for most other petrol engines. They also make modules for vehicles with two or more sets of <b>contact</b> <b>breakers.</b> This company sells systems worldwide.|$|R

50|$|Since {{they open}} and close several times with every turn of the engine, <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points and cam {{follower}} suffer from wear—both mechanical and pitting caused by arcing across the contacts. This latter effect is largely prevented by placing a capacitor parallel across the contact breaker—this is usually referred to by the more old fashioned term condenser by mechanics. As well as suppressing arcing, it helps boost the coil output by creating a resonant LC circuit with the coil windings.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and computer}} engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and {{are increasingly being}} incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker (points), and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with <b>contact</b> <b>breakers</b> to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems {{at about the same}} time.|$|R
5000|$|As well as Bishop Brennan in Father Ted, Norton {{also played}} Albert Einstein in two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation; as the {{librarian}} Lieutenant James Porteous in an {{edition of the}} highly acclaimed 1970s British television drama series Colditz; Harrister, a criminal involved in an intricate bank robbery in The Sweeney episode; <b>Contact</b> <b>Breaker,</b> as O'Brady in Minder, [...] episode; National Pelmet and Rory, a roguish but genteel Irishman, who is diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in The Royal episode; Beggars and Choosers.|$|R
