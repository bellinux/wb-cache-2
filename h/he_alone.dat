5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. After {{a long pause}} due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> who decided territorial divisions.|$|E

5|$|Mulder is {{reunited with}} his sister Samantha (Megan Leitch) in his new life. He marries Fowley and they have children. The years pass quickly; he grows older and Fowley dies. Mulder is {{revealed}} to be dreaming everything: in reality {{he is in a}} government facility being tended to by doctors while The Smoking Man and Fowley watch. The Smoking Man is preparing to have portions of Mulder's cranial tissue—which have been infected and activated because of the alien virus—implanted into himself. During the operation, The Smoking Man admits that he believes that Mulder has become an alien-human hybrid, and that by taking Mulder's genetic material <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> will survive the coming alien onslaught.|$|E
5|$|The third story {{describes}} Parvati being banished by Shiva {{when she}} becomes momentarily distracted {{while listening to}} his explanation of the Vedas. Parvati, now born as Kayarkanni, {{is the daughter of}} a fisherman. When playing with her friends, Shiva approaches {{in the guise of a}} fisherman and flirts with her, despite her disapproval. The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (which is actually Nandi in disguise) and remarries Parvati.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of General Hermann Balck, the cities of Zhytomyr and Korosten were retaken in mid-November, but after receiving reinforcements Vatutin resumed the offensive on 24 December 1943, and the Red Army continued its successful advance. Manstein's repeated requests to Hitler for more reinforcements were turned down. On 4 January 1944 Manstein met with Hitler {{to tell him that}} the Dnieper line was untenable and that he needed to retreat in order to save his forces. Hitler refused, and Manstein again requested changes in {{the highest levels of the}} military leadership, but was turned down, as Hitler believed that <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> was capable of managing the wider strategy.|$|E

5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with tears in his eyes asked him why <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E
5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E

5|$|The Final Cut is {{the twelfth}} studio album by the English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and on 2 April by Columbia Records in the United States. It was Pink Floyd's last studio album to include founding member, bass guitarist and songwriter Roger Waters, and their only album on which <b>he</b> <b>alone</b> is credited for writing and composition. It {{was also the}} only Pink Floyd album that does not feature keyboardist Richard Wright. Waters originally planned The Final Cut as a soundtrack album for the 1982 film Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of the}} Falklands War, he rewrote it as a concept album, exploring what he considered the betrayal of his father, who died serving in the Second World War. Waters sings most of the lyrics; lead guitarist David Gilmour provides lead vocals on only one track. The packaging, also designed by Waters, reflects the album's war theme.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. <b>He</b> <b>alone</b> possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
