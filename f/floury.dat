5|$|The <b>floury</b> {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little <b>floury</b> baker) by {{the structure of the}} male genitalia and an audibly distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it is clearly wider than the costal vein.|$|E
5|$|The <b>floury</b> {{baker is}} solitary and occurs in low densities. Individuals {{typically}} {{emerge from the}} soil through a three-month period from late November to late February, and can be encountered until May. The <b>floury</b> baker is found {{on a wide variety}} of trees, with some preference for species of paperbark (Melaleuca). It is a relatively poor flier, preyed upon by cicada killer wasps and a wide variety of birds, and can succumb to a cicada-specific fungal disease.|$|E
5|$|German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar {{described}} the <b>floury</b> baker in 1834 as Cicada curvicosta.

40|$|Abstract—Global motion {{estimation}} aims at estimating the whole image changes causing by camera moving. This paper presents a global {{motion estimation}} method based on Fourier-Mellin and Phase-Correlation. Rotational angle and scaling factor are acquired by Phase-Correlation between Fourier-Mellin transform {{images of the}} reference and current image. Log-Polar coordinates are used to the <b>Flourier</b> amplitude spectrum. Translational parameter is obtained using sub-block based on Phase- Correlation.

5|$|The <b>floury</b> {{baker is}} found from the Daintree River in North Queensland to Bendalong in {{southern}} New South Wales. It is a highland {{species in the}} northern part of its range, restricted to the Atherton Tableland and Eungella National Park to the west of Mackay, but more a lowland species in the remainder of its range. It may be found in varied habitats, from rainforest margins to suburbs, even in the centre of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult <b>floury</b> baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found {{on a wide variety}} of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E
5|$|The <b>floury</b> baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E

While the vibration torque signal is annihilated by lots of noise, a de-noising scheme based on wavelet transform is constructed. The actual signal is decomposed with wavelet Sym 8, then processed by half soft threshold, and reconstructed signal finally.

40|$|The diffuse {{reflectance}} infrared <b>flourier</b> transform spectroscopic technique {{has been applied}} to analyse the adsorbed surface complexes, formed in the oxidation of acetaldehyde, by comparing the DRIFT-spectra of the reaction intermediates to hose of four different solid silver compounds.

This comparative analysis of the spectra for the intermediates strongly suggests the existence of at least three different species. 0 ne of the species can certainly be assigned to a silver acetate form. Based on the transient response data, it has been evaluated that the silver acetate form intermediate gives a surface coverage of more than θ= 0. 5 to 1. 3 at 160 ℃ depending on the reaction conditions.

5|$|Prominent Swedish {{entomologist}} Carl Stål {{named the}} genus Abricta in 1866, {{and it was}} either treated as a subgenus of the genus Tibicen or a genus in its own right. Thus it became known as Tibicen curvicostus, and Abricta curvicosta from 1906. French entomologist Jean Baptiste Boisduval described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as Cicada tephrogaster (later Tibicen tephrogaster) in 1835; this has long been considered a junior synonym. However, {{a review of the}} genus in 2003 showed Abricta to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members were moved to other genera. Max Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region. Of the 15Australian species, the <b>floury</b> baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14species, and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta, while most of the others were placed in the genus Tryella. The morphological distinction between Aleeta and Tryella is based on two factors: A.curvicosta has a larger forewing size– rarely less than 3.2cm (1.3in) and usually over 4cm (1.6in), whereas Tryella is never above 3.2cm (1.3in); the uncal lobes of Aleetas distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends, whereas those of Tryella are upturned. The name Aleeta is derived from the Greek aleton meaning flour or meal.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland, a dish {{was made}} by soaking the husks from oats for a week, so the fine, <b>floury</b> part of the meal {{remained}} as sediment to be strained off, boiled and eaten.

25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. <b>Floury,</b> or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|E
40|$|Cadmium (II) is an {{important}} element used in various industries, however, it is a poisonous element that affects the health of plants, animals and humans alike. It’s very important to remove this element from contaminated waters. This study aims at synthesizing zero valent silver nanoparticles by environmentally ecofriendly method without using hazardous compounds (via green approach). In this work, silver nanoparticles were prepared using hot water for the Ficus tree (Ficus Benjamina) leaf extract (FBLE). The size of crystalline for AgNPs was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy and <b>flourier</b> transform infrared (FTIR). The properties of nano-silver particles (AgNPs) have been studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The capability of nanoparticles to remove Cd 2 + from contaminated solution was then studied. Parameter like adsorbent dose, heavy metal concentration, pH, agitation speed and contact time were studied. Cadmium removal increased when the dosage of biosorbent increases, pH increased from 1 to 6, contact time from 5 to 40 and initial concentration of Cd decrease.

40|$|Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) was {{incorporated}} into as-synthesized mesoporous silica MSU- 1 with cheap sodium silicate as silica source to create TEPA/MSU- 1, an adsorbent having high adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide. The adsorbents were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N- 2 adsorption/desorption, thermogravimetry (TG), and <b>Flourier</b> transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. The XRD {{results indicated that the}} adsorbents preserved the mesostructure of MSU- 1 after TEPA was loaded. However, the surface area decreased dramatically, indicating that the pores are occupied by amine. TG patterns showed that the adsorbents are thermally unstable at temperatures above 200 degrees C. The FTIR results suggested that CO 2 interacts with TEPA to form alkalammonium carbamate. CO 2 adsorption isotherms measured at different temperatures revealed that the optimal adsorption temperature is 75 degrees C. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO 2 showed that the desorption of CO 2 achieved maximal desorption rate at about 100 degrees C, and so is appropriate for thermal swing adsorption of CO 2 from flue gas. The adsorption capacity of TEPA/MSU- 1 with a different TEPA content was calculated through CO 2 breakthrough curves. As a result, 50 wt% of TEPA supported on as-synthesized MSU- 1 achieved the highest capacity at 3. 87 mmol/g. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of curing agent molecular structure on the tribological and corrosion behaviors of epoxy resin (EP) coatings, EP coatings were cured by three kinds of curing agents with different molecular structures including diethylenetriamine (DETA), isophorone diamine (IPDA) and m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA). The curing degree of EP coatings was identified by <b>flourier</b> transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The element composition and chemical bond structure of the as-prepared coatings were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The tribological properties of the as-prepared coatings were assessed by UMT- 3 multi-functional tribology test equipment and surface profiler. The anti-corrosion behaviors of the coatings were evaluated by an electrochemistry workstation in 3. 5 wt% NaCl. The internal structure and wear trace morphologies of the coatings were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using of curing agents with different molecular structures resulted in different tribological and anti-corrosion properties for EP coating. While the coefficient of friction (COF) of EP coating cured by m-PDA was the highest, the one cured by DETA was the lowest, which {{may be due to}} the linear and flexible chain offered less resistance during the sliding process and hence it displayed the lowest COF. Besides, the anti-corrosion performance of EP coating cured by IPDA was the best and the one cured by m-PDA was the poorest, which may be attributed to molecular structure and molecular weight which can influence the crosslink network and interface structure of EP coatings significantly. At last, the tribological and anti-corrosion mechanisms of EP coatings with different molecular structures were discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of high digestible grain sorghum (HDGS) with a modified starch protein endosperm matrix to replace corn in ethanol production was investigated using dry grind simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Preliminary experiments showed that HDGS yielded higher amounts of glucose and ethanol than normal digestible grain sorghum (NDGS) and corn {{particularly in the}} first 48 hrs of fermentation. It was hypothesized that fast conversion of starch to glucose and ethanol during hydrolysis and fermentation are results of improved protein digestibility of HDGS. The invagination of protein structures in HDGS produced a <b>flourier</b> endosperm texture, softer kernels and lower starch content than the normal digestible protein (ND) lines. Highly digestible protein (HD) lines have better pasting properties (significantly lower pasting temperature, faster rate of gelatinization and higher peak viscosity) than ND lines based on the RVA profile. Increasing protein digestibility of the HDGS improved starch digestibility (increased rate of glucose conversion and total glucose yield during saccharification), which is supported by highly significant correlation of turbidity with rate of glucose conversion and efficiency of enzymatic conversion. The efficiency of ethanol conversion is significantly correlated with starch digestibility, pasting properties, and protein digestibility. Results also showed that HD sorghum lines had significantly faster rate of conversion and shorter reaction time needed to achieve completion than ND sorghum lines and corn. Increasing the dry solid concentration from 22 % to 30 % (w/v) increased the ethanol yield from 8 % v/v to 13 %v/v. This will allow considerable saving of water, reduced distillation cost and increased ethanol production for a given plant capacity and labor cost. Fineness of grind influences the amount of sugar formed due to variation in surface area of the flour. The hypothesis that finer particles has faster and higher glucose yield, defined as g of glucose converted per g of theoretical glucose, is supported by highly significant correlation of mass fraction of 3 to 60 mu m size range and mass median diameter (MMD) of 60 to 1000 mu m size range with glucose conversion efficiency and glucose conversion rate during saccharification and fermentation...|$|R

500|$|The {{abdominal}} tracheal {{air sacs}} surround the sound muscles and extend into the abdomen, acting as resonant chambers to amplify sound.

2500|$|It {{was also}} {{discovered}} that if the paste was rolled into balls before drying the resulting gunpowder absorbed less water from the air during storage and traveled better. The balls were then crushed in a mortar by the gunner immediately before use, with the old problem of uneven particle size and packing causing unpredictable results. If the right size particles were chosen, however, {{the result was a}} great improvement in power. [...] Forming the damp paste into corn-sized clumps by hand or {{with the use of a}} sieve instead of larger balls produced a product after drying that loaded much better, as each tiny piece provided its own surrounding air space that allowed much more rapid combustion than a fine powder. [...] This [...] "corned" [...] gunpowder was from 30% to 300% more powerful. An example is cited where 34 pounds of serpentine was needed to shoot a 47-pound ball, but only 18 pounds of corned powder. The optimum size of the grain depended on its use; larger for large cannon, finer for small arms. [...] Larger cast cannons were easily muzzle-loaded with corned powder using a long-handled ladle. Corned powder also retained the advantage of low moisture absorption, as even tiny grains still had much less surface area to attract water than a <b>floury</b> powder.|$|E
