6000|$|In {{the mean}} time, a new leader, {{with a fresh}} horde of Danes, had landed in England. His name was Halfden. Halfden came with a {{considerable}} fleet of ships, and, after landing his men, and performing various exploits and encountering various adventures {{in other parts of}} England, he began to turn his thoughts toward Alfred's dominions. Alfred did not pay particular attention to Halfden's movements at first, as he supposed that his treaty with Hubba had bound the whole nation of the Danes not to encroach upon his realm, whatever they might do in respect to the other Saxon kingdoms. Alfred had a famous castle at Wareham, on the southern coast of the island. It was situated on a bay which lies in what is now Dorsetshire. This castle was the strongest place in his dominions. It was garrisoned and guarded, but not with any special vigilance, as no one expected an attack upon it. Halfden brought his fleet to the southern shore of the island, and, organizing an expedition there, he put to sea, and before any one suspected his design, he entered the bay, surprised and attacked Wareham Castle, and took it. Alfred and the people of his realm were not only astonished and alarmed at the loss of the castle, but they were filled with indignation at the treachery of the Danes in violating their treaty by attacking it.

40|$|The EC’s {{implementation}} {{record in}} the WTO seems to reflect an attitude that, {{in accordance with the}} view traditionally maintained by the European Court of Justice from International Fruit to Portugal, finds its cornerstone in the principle of negotiations with a view to achieving mutually satisfactory solutions, even beyond the limits set by the DSU. Following these premises, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the impact that has been exercised on the EC’s contentious practice by interpretations of the WTO system given by the EC courts, in fine tuning with the stand taken by the EC’s political bodies. After having considered the legal and political reasons behind the case-law of the Community’s courts on ‘direct effect’, the paper attempts to analyse to what extent the EC’s conduct in the framework of the WTO dispute settlement process has been influenced by the ‘scope for manoeuvre’ argument, devised by the ECJ in the Portugal ruling. It will become clear that an approach mainly aimed at preserving the balance of mutual advantages among the WTO Members queries the role played in the dispute settlement mechanism by the agreements between parties. An analysis is submitted of four different categories of agreements concluded by the EC in the framework of the dispute settlement mechanism, also in cases not expressly provided by the DSU. On a higher level of investigation, the ‘scope for manoeuvre’ approach is strictly connected with another widely discussed issue, namely the nature of the legal <b>obligations</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> by WTO Member States. The study aims to demonstrate that WTO rules are a source of rights and obligations that are disposable in nature for Member Parties...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This article {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} {{available on the}} treatment of older prisoners within England and Wales who are the fastest growing group within prisons. It concentrates {{on the lack of}} available social care facilities for older prisoners. Many older prisoners have special needs that are not met within prison, mainly because of the 'sameness' principle that is applied. Social care is as important to older prisoners as their health care. Although some social care may be available to older prisoners, it is not provided within the legal framework that applies to older people outside of prison. This article argues that the general legal obligation to provide social care (imperfect though it may be), should also be applied within the prison setting. Findings: Based on the evidence available, older prisoners are often unable to access social care services within prison. This is a breach of international <b>obligations</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> by the United Kingdom. It may also breach the European Convention of Human Rights. The article argues that existing legislation does not prevent older prisoners from accessing social care services. The sameness principle discriminates against older prisoners. Mental health, physical disability, and incontinence are all areas where older prisoners lack access to services available to older people outside of prison. Applications: Considerable {{progress has been made in}} raising the profile of older prisoners. However, more needs to be done to embed the social care needs older prisoners may have into the prison system. The ordinary residence rule, the National Service Framework and the Fair Access to Care guidance must be adapted to meet the needs of serving prisoners as well as those preparing for release. Attitudes need to change. There also needs to be a willingness to meet the international and domestic legal obligations towards older prisoners. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{notification}} {{of the level}} of domestic support to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is intended to reflect compliance with <b>obligations</b> <b>entered</b> <b>into</b> {{at the time of the}} Uruguay Round. WTO members have often been slow to provide {{notification of}} domestic support levels. This makes the process of notification less useful as an indicator of the degree to which changes in policy have or have not benefited the trade system as a whole and exporting countries in particular. The notification of domestic support in the E. U. illustrates the value of a measure that reflects current policies and can therefore act as a basis for negotiation of further disciplines where these are necessary. The E. U. has made major changes in its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) over the period since 1992 when the MacSharry reforms were implemented. Payments originally notified in the blue box (related to supply control) have over time been changed until in their present form they are unrelated to current production or price levels, and hence can satisfy the criteria for the green box. The E. U. has therefore much more latitude in trade talks to agree to reductions in the allowable trade-distorting support. This paper reproduced the E. U. notifications relating to 2003 / 04 and extends these with official statistics to the year 2006 / 07. It then projects forward the components of domestic support until the year 2013 / 14, based on forecasts of future production and estimates of policy parameters. The impact of a successful Doha Round is simulated, showing that the constraints envisaged in the WTO draft modalities document of May 19, 2008, would be binding by the year 2013, at about the time the next budget cycle in the E. U. starts. Without the Doha Round constraints, further reform might still happen for domestic reasons, but the framework provided by the WTO for domestic policy spending would be less relevant. In that case, much could hinge on the legitimacy of the Single Farm Payment system under the current rules governing the green box.

The dissertation analyses in order interpretative techniques, conflict resolution tools available in general international law, as expressed in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and finally express clauses in international investment agreements. The dissertation includes the review of some relevant case law arising from investment agreements in investment treaty tribunals, to discover how in practice these conflict resolution tools are applied and to assess their effectiveness. This dissertation places itself squarely within the debate between the unity and the fragmentation of international law; therefore it tackles the issue of normative conflicts resolution in a dispute settlement environment with the view of gauging their value in maintaining the unity of international law and defuse the risk of fragmentation. The dissertation can only conclude that much work remains to be done, including by providing a more comprehensive taxonomy of possible interventions, both on the legal and political sphere...|$|R

40|$|Ad {{options are}} a recent {{development}} in online advertising which provide advertis-ers with greater flexibility related to buying their guaranteed deliveries in the future. In short, an ad option is a contract {{in which an}} online publisher (or search engine) grants an advertiser the right but not <b>obligation</b> to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> transactions to purchase impressions or clicks from a specific online ad slot at a pre-specified price on a specific delivery date. Previous studies on the ad option pricing models are mostly restricted to the situation where the underlying price follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). However, {{it has been shown}} that GBM only happens in less than 20 % of the stochastic movements of ad auction prices. In this paper, we address this issue by employing a stochastic volatility (SV) model to describe the evolution of the underlying price which does not rely on the assumption of GBM. The computational tractability is solved by approximating the SV model with a proposed censored binomial lattice. Our develop-ments are validated by experiments with the real advertising data. We find that the SV model has a better fitness to the real adverting data; with the real data, we demonstrate that advertisers are able flexibly to manage their guaranteed deliveries by using the pro-posed options. We also demonstrate that publishers will have increased revenue when some of their inventories are sold via ad options...|$|R

Arbitration clauses in various forms are often an integral part of trade agreements but are also regularly included in consumer contracts such as loan or insurance agreements. The first part of the thesis provides a general overview of the financial market regulation which serves as the common framework allowing various legal entities to operate within the local market environment. The topic of regulation is discussed within the second section of the thesis which is structured into 4 stand-alone chapters. These chapters describe the institute of arbitration, its requisites and the various forms of arbitration agreements while also analyzing the changes of the statutory legal framework in the context of the current amendment which came into effect in April 2012.
