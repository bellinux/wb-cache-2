5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke after they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> about things {{they had done}} while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E

25|$|In January 1684, Edmond Halley, Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> {{in which}} Hooke claimed {{to not only}} have derived the inverse-square law, but also all the laws of {{planetary}} motion. Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.|$|E
25|$|His {{commentary}} {{touched on}} many of the day's important issues. Following a 1966 trip to South Vietnam, he commented that prolonging the war would be unwise and that the US would be better off pursuing a negotiated settlement. He also helped keep alive another Murrow tradition at CBS that began with the interview show Person to Person. On Conversations with Eric Sevareid, he interviewed such famous newsmakers as West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, novelist Leo Rosten and others. In somewhat of a spoof of this tradition he also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with King George III, portrayed by Peter Ustinov, titled The Last King in America.|$|E

DeVincentis and Steve Pink adapt the book. She had worked previously with them on Grosse Pointe Blank and {{felt that they had}} the right sensibilities for the material. According to Cusack, DeVincentis is the closest to the record-obsessive characters in the film, owning 1,000 vinyl records and thousands of CDs and tapes. They wrote a treatment that was immediately greenlit by Roth.|$|E
25|$|As {{liaison officer}} to the 11th Indian Division, Moses twice {{narrowly}} escaped ambushes. On 11 February 1942, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Bennett's aide, Lieutenant G. H. Walker, {{in which he}} {{expressed a desire to}} escape if Singapore fell, as seemed likely at that point. Five days later, Moses, Bennett and Walker escaped from Singapore in a sampan, and made their way to Sumatra. They crossed Sumatra to Padang, on its west coast, from whence they flew to Java. In Batavia, Moses was knocked down by a taxi, fracturing his ribs. He was diagnosed with scrub typhus, and placed on the dangerously ill list. He was evacuated by a Dutch freighter and taken to Perth where he was hospitalised at the 110th and 113th General Hospitals. After the war he strongly supported Bennett's decision to escape from Singapore.|$|E

Even though 50 Cent confirmed Chris Brown was {{on the album}}, Banks later denied this {{in an interview with}} XXL. In an interview with XXL, Banks confirmed that he had wanted to have Prodigy on the track with Styles P on the album.

25|$|That same month, {{during one}} of Genian's bombing runs over Germany, his plane was hit by German ground fire. Genian's plane had one of its two engines knocked out {{and was forced to}} make an {{emergency}} landing at an airstrip under Russian control. Russian soldiers rushed out, picked up the American airmen and took them to an Army camp. Genian was put in a cabin until the Russians contacted the U.S. Air Force Headquarters to notify them of the crew's internment. During his internment, Genian had the opportunity to meet with Soviet Armenian General Marshal Baghramyan. At that time, Baghramyan had become the commander of the 1st Baltic Front (later known as the Samland group). After the war, he was appointed Commander of the Baltic Military District. After Baghramyan and Genian <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in Armenian, the general ordered his aide to inform the camp commander that every camp courtesy be given to the American airmen.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} Suzuki spent {{a short time}} in the {{hospital}} with tuberculosis, but soon recovered. In 1927 an important chapter in Suzuki's life was turned. He went to visit a teacher in England he had at Komazawa named Miss Nona Ransom, a woman who had taught English to such people as the last emperor of China, Pu-yi, and more so his wife, the last empress of China, Jigoro Kano (the Founder of Judo), the children of Chinese president Li Yuanhong, and some members of the Japanese royal family. She hired him that day to be a translator and to help with errands. Through this period he realized she was very ignorant of Japanese culture and the religion of Buddhism. She respected it very little and saw it as idol worship. But one day, when there were no chores to be done, the two <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> on Buddhism that changed her mind. She even let Suzuki teach her zazen meditation. This experience is significant in that Suzuki realized that Western ignorance of Buddhism could be transformed.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

[...] "If we did have His perspective, we'd wish we could have it {{for long periods of}} time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning." [...] He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] with Ingram. Prior to recording What If We, Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album, and although the song was not his top favorite, he noted that [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was [...] "one of the first that really stuck out." ...|$|E
500|$|Clark {{has said}} that he began to truly define his {{politics}} only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were [...] "starting to go wrong" [...] with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks but did not support the Iraq War. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on CNN that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was [...] "never ... WMD or regime change" [...] and believes [...] "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown." ...|$|E
500|$|Box Car Racer was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge and formed {{during a break}} from touring. The trio's European tour {{in the winter of}} 2001 was delayed {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks, and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's back problems, the result of a herniated disc. He began taking painkillers and developed [...] "neurosis-inducing side effects." [...] DeLonge had felt [...] "bummed out" [...] and creatively stifled while recording the group's previous album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. On the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer Travis Barker would jam [...] "every day," [...] and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music. [...] DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like Fugazi, Quicksand, Rocket from the Crypt, and Pitchfork. He began writing heavier-sounding guitar riffs; the first riff he created became part of the song [...] "All Systems Go". Barker, in his 2015 memoir Can I Say, maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. [...] "I honestly thought that Tom had already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with [...] about this. They were so tight—inseparable—I couldn't imagine Mark didn't know," [...] Barker writes.|$|E
