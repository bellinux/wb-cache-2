5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is <b>galena</b> (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} <b>galena</b> in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO4, {{is a product of}} <b>galena</b> oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of <b>galena.</b> Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Galena</b> {{remained}} on the James River after the battle and returned to City Point. She shelled Confederate soldiers along the river banks and bombarded City Point to cover a landing force which {{set fire to the}} depots. On 27 June, Major General McClellan came aboard the ship to locate a new camp which was later established near Harrison's Landing. On 30 June, McClellan was compelled to withdraw down the James, covered by gunfire from <b>Galena</b> and the other gunboats. They continued to support his forces until they were transferred to Northern Virginia. <b>Galena</b> patrolled the river to defend transports and supply ships against Confederate raids and ambushes until she was detached from the James River Flotilla in September 1862 <b>Galena</b> and Monitor were retained at Newport News, Virginia, in case the Confederate ironclads building at Richmond sortied into Hampton Roads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Galena</b> was {{decommissioned}} {{there on}} 17 June {{until she was}} recommissioned on 9 April 1869 for transfer to back to Hampton Roads, where she was again decommissioned on 2 June. Condemned by survey in 1870, <b>Galena</b> was broken up in 1872 at the Norfolk Navy Yard.|$|E

5|$|His mother visited Hamilton at Hamilton's Diggings {{during the}} winter of 183738. During the same period, Hamilton briefly owned the Mineral Point Miners' Free Press; he sold it to a group from <b>Galena</b> and the paper became known as the <b>Galena</b> Democrat.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1832, {{a supply}} wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from <b>Galena</b> arrived at Apple River Fort around noon. Around this time, Black Hawk and his 200-man war party also {{en route to}} the fort, had {{gathered}} at a gap in Terrapin Ridge. Black Hawk's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire. At around 4 p.m. four couriers from <b>Galena</b> bound for the army camp at Dixon's Ferry arrived at the fort. The fort's occupants were eager to hear their news from <b>Galena</b> and of the conflict with Black Hawk.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson was well-connected, and {{received}} letters from prominent people, including Jefferson Davis in 1834. That same year, Stephenson {{was elected to}} his first public office, the Illinois State Senate, after which he sought an appointment to the Land Office in <b>Galena.</b> From December 1834 until April 1835 Stephenson was absent from <b>Galena.</b> He spent time in St. Louis, where he married Ellen Kyle in December, then traveled on to Edwardsville and Vandalia, Illinois; the couple eventually had two children. In April 1835 the couple returned to <b>Galena</b> where James took office as Register of Lands at <b>Galena</b> and Chicago, and they lived an elegant lifestyle.|$|E
50|$|Following a {{sharp decline}} in the demand for lead (which had been the city's chief income source during the early 19th century), <b>Galena's</b> {{population}} dropped from 14,000 in the mid-19th century, to 3,396 in the early 21st century.|$|R
40|$|New lead Isotope {{results for}} twenty-four <b>galenas</b> of the Linares-La Carolina mining {{district}} (Jaén, Spain) are reported. While two. mineralization types, one near Linares (where filons with low Ag content crosscut the Linares and/or Guadalén-Arquillos plutons) and another at La Carolina (Ag-rich filons cut the Santa Elena granite or its host-rocks) may be distinguished, the Pb isotopic compositions of the <b>galenas</b> from both areas are similar and very homogeneous: mPbl 204 Pb = 18. 236 ± 0. 036, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 615 ± 0. 014 and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 38. 347 ± 0. 046, giving a model age of 324 ± 18 Ma. These results {{are very different}} from the Pb isotopic compositions and model ages recorded on <b>galenas</b> from the nearby El Zumajo vein within the Los Pedroches batholith main body. Notwithstanding, since the p 2 calculated values from El Zumajo and Linares-La Carolina district are very similar, it is argued that a genetical relationship must exist between the mineralizations of the Los Pedroches batholith and those of Linares-La Carolina.

5|$|<b>Galena</b> {{intermittently}} bombarded Fort Morgan {{until it}} surrendered on 23 August and sailed from Mobile Bay on 31 August to temporarily {{serve as a}} part of the East Gulf Blockading Squadron at Key West, Florida. The transfer was made permanent on 24 September and she was ordered to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repair a month later. The ship did not arrive until 4 November and repairs did not begin until 22 November. <b>Galena</b> was recommissioned on 29 March 1865 and was reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She reached Newport News on 2 April where the ship patrolled the mouth of the Nansemond River and in the James River until her departure on 6 June for Portsmouth, New Hampshire.|$|E

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{origin of}} the Ba-Zn-Pb deposit of Chaudfontaine is supported by S-isotopic measurements on baryte. However, the Pb-isotopic data on <b>galenas</b> are not obviously consistent with this conclusion.

5|$|The Plum River raid was a bloodless {{skirmish}} {{that occurred}} at present-day Savanna, Illinois, on May 21, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. Most of the settlement's inhabitants, except for a few defenders, had fled for <b>Galena,</b> Illinois, before the raid happened. A small band of Native Americans, either Sauk or Fox, attacked the settlement while only three of the six defenders were present. The men who were present fell back to the blockhouse and a firefight ensued for about one hour, after which the attackers withdrew. No one was killed or injured during the attack, but in its aftermath Colonel James M. Strode dispatched a detachment of militia to Savanna. They returned to <b>Galena</b> without incident and the settlement at Savanna was temporarily abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{known to}} be {{potentially}} dangerous include Aconitum, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata), certain fungi, Aristolochia, Aconitum, Arsenic sulfide (Realgar), mercury sulfide, and cinnabar. Asbestos ore (Actinolite, Yang Qi Shi, 阳起石) is used to treat impotence in TCM. Due to <b>galena's</b> (litharge, lead(II) oxide) high lead content, it is {{known to be}} toxic. Lead, mercury, arsenic, copper, cadmium, and thallium have been detected in TCM products sold in the U.S. and China.|$|R

5|$|The {{attack at}} Sinsinawa Mound, {{compounded}} by other incidents around the region, helped {{contribute to the}} fear gripping the settlers. The people of Platteville, in present-day Wisconsin, contemplated fleeing to <b>Galena,</b> about 25 miles (40 km) south, {{as a direct result}} of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American Ho-Chunk tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from <b>Galena</b> further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.|$|E

When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to <b>Galena</b> without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E

5|$|USS <b>Galena</b> was a wooden-hulled {{broadside}} ironclad {{built for}} the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The ship was initially assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and supported Union forces during the Peninsula Campaign in 1862. She was damaged during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff because her armor was too thin to prevent Confederate shots from penetrating. Widely regarded as a failure, <b>Galena</b> was reconstructed without most of her armor in 1863 and transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in 1864. The ship participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay and the subsequent Siege of Fort Morgan in August. She was briefly transferred to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron in September before she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs in November.|$|E
