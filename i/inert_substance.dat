The finished product is brittle and will fracture, unless laminated or specially treated, but is extremely durable under most conditions. It erodes very slowly and can mostly withstand the action of water. It is mostly resistant to chemical attack, does not react with foods, and is an ideal material for the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs and most chemicals. Glass is also a fairly <b>inert</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contact beds were tanks {{containing}} the <b>inert</b> <b>substance,</b> such as stones or slate, that maximized {{the surface area}} available for the microbial growth {{to break down the}} sewage. The sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground. This method quickly became widespread, especially in the UK, where it was used in Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. The bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by Joseph Corbett as Borough Engineer in Salford and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better {{for longer periods of time}} than could be achieved by the contact bed.|$|E

A wide range of organs can be protected by these <b>inert</b> <b>substances,</b> in particular cardiac and neuronal tissue. In this review we summarize the data on noble gas-induced cardioprotection, focusing on the underlying protective mechanisms.

50|$|An osmotic {{diuretic}} {{is a type}} of diuretic that inhibits reabsorption {{of water}} and sodium (Na). They are pharmacologically <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> that are given intravenously. They increase the osmolarity of blood and renal filtrate.|$|R
2500|$|Similar to {{the placebo}} effect, inert {{substances}} {{have the potential}} to cause negative effects via the [...] "nocebo effect" [...] (Latin nocebo = [...] "I will harm"). In this effect, giving an <b>inert</b> <b>substance</b> has negative consequences.|$|E
2500|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{opposite to}} {{the placebo effect}} has also been observed. When an inactive substance or treatment is administered to a recipient who has an expectation of it having a negative impact, this intervention {{is known as a}} nocebo (Latin nocebo = [...] "I shall harm"). A nocebo effect occurs when the recipient of an <b>inert</b> <b>substance</b> reports a negative effect and/or a worsening of symptoms, with the outcome resulting not from the substance itself, but from negative expectations about the treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{placebo effect}} has {{sometimes}} been defined as a physiological effect caused by the placebo, but Moerman and Jonas {{have pointed out that}} this seems illogical, as a placebo is an <b>inert</b> <b>substance</b> that does not directly cause anything. Instead they introduced the term [...] "meaning response" [...] for the meaning that the brain associates with the placebo, which causes a physiological placebo effect. They propose that the placebo, which may be unethical, could be avoided entirely if doctors comfort and encourage their patients' health. Ernst and Resch also attempted to distinguish between the [...] "true" [...] and [...] "perceived" [...] placebo effect, as they argued that some of the effects attributed to the placebo effect could be due to other factors.|$|E

The color of Mummy brown can vary from yellow to red to dark violet, the latter usually called [...] "Mummy Violet".|$|R
2500|$|They indeed {{found the}} long carbon chains {{they were looking}} for, but also found an {{unexpected}} product that had 60 carbon atoms. [...] Over the course of 11 days, the team studied and determined its structure and named it buckminsterfullerene after noting its similarity to the geodesic domes for which the architect Buckminster Fuller was known. This discovery was {{based solely on the}} single prominent peak on the mass spectrograph, implying a chemically <b>inert</b> <b>substance</b> that was geometrically closed with no dangling bonds. Curl was responsible for determining the optimal conditions of the carbon vapor in the apparatus, and examining the spectrograph. [...] Curl noted that James R. Heath and Sean C. O'Brien deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto. [...] The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this. [...] Later experiments confirmed their proposed structure, and the team moved on to synthesize endohedral fullerenes that had a metal atom inside the hollow carbon shell. [...] The fullerenes, a class of molecules of which buckminsterfullerene was the first member discovered, are now considered to have potential applications in nanomaterials and molecular scale electronics. Robert Curl's 1985 paper entitled [...] "C60: [...] Buckminsterfullerine", published with colleagues H. Kroto, J. R. Heath, S. C. O’Brien, [...] and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015. The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society at the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in Houston, Texas.|$|E

6000|$|... 2. That {{though the}} living tissue whereof an {{individual}} organism consists, forms a continuous mass, the living {{elements of a}} society do not form a continuous mass; but {{are more or less}} widely dispersed over some portion of the Earth's surface. This, which at first sight appears to be an absolute distinction, is one which yet to a great extent fades when we contemplate all the facts. For, in the lower divisions of the animal and vegetal kingdoms, there are types of organization much more nearly allied, in this respect, to the organization of a society, than might be supposed--types in which the living units essentially composing the mass, are dispersed through an <b>inert</b> <b>substance,</b> that can scarcely be called living in the full sense of the word. It is thus with some of the Protococci and with the Nostoceæ, which exist as cells imbedded in a viscid matter. It is so, too, with the Thalassicollæ--bodies made up of differentiated parts, dispersed through an undifferentiated jelly. And throughout considerable portions of their bodies, some of the Acalephæ exhibit more or less this type of structure. Now this is very much the case with a society. For we must remember that though the men who make up a society are physically separate, and even scattered, yet the surface over which they are scattered is not one devoid of life, but is covered by life of a lower order which ministers to their life. The vegetation which clothes a country makes possible the animal life in that country; and only through its animal and vegetal products can such a country support a society. Hence the members of the body-politic are not to be regarded as separated by intervals of dead space, but as diffused through a space occupied by life of a lower order. In our conception of a social organism, we must include all that lower organic existence on which human existence, and therefore social existence, depend. And when we do this, we see that the citizens who make up a community may be considered as highly vitalized units surrounded by substances of lower vitality, from which they draw their nutriment: much as in the cases above instanced.|$|E
30|$|One {{approach}} {{to solve the}} problems was suggested by an industry working group in the course of project work for the new EU chemical legislation REACH. The so-called 'poorly solubles approach' [2] {{is based on the assumption}} that highly lipophilic and poorly soluble substances have a low concentration in the aqueous phase of waterbodies resulting in a low exposure to aquatic organisms. Subsequent to an extensive analysis of ecotoxicological data, De Wolf et al. [3] proposed a concentration threshold in the aqueous phase, the aquatic exposure threshold of no ecotoxicological concern (ETNCaqu), for <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> with a narcotic mode of action. For the examined substances with a narcotic mode of action [4, 5] it is suggested with a high probability (95 percentile), that neither acute nor long-term adverse effects to aquatic organisms might be expected below this threshold concentration. For <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> with a narcotic mode of action (baseline toxicity) this threshold was estimated as ETNCaqu = 1.9 μg/l. Inert chemicals are not reactive when considering overall acute effects and do not interact with specific receptors in an organism and have therefore a narcotic mode of action [5].|$|R
50|$|Cheek {{implants}} {{can be made}} of {{a variety}} of materials. The most common material is solid silicone. In addition, two popular options are high-density porous polyethylene, marketed as Medpor, and ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), better known as Gore-Tex. Both Medpor and ePTFE are <b>inert</b> <b>substances,</b> providing better integration with the underlying tissue and bone than solid silicone. However, in the case of Medpor, the implants' integration and ingrowth with the underlying tissue causes difficulty removing the implant if revisions are needed.|$|R

5000|$|Plombage was a {{surgical}} method used {{prior to the}} introduction of anti-tuberculosis drug therapy to treat cavitary tuberculosis of the upper lobe of the lung.

25|$|Aprotic {{solvents}} are neutral, chemically <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> such as benzene and chloroform. They {{have a low}} dielectric constant, do {{not react}} with either acids or bases and therefore do not favor ionization. The fact that picric acid gives a colorless solution in benzene which becomes yellow on adding aniline shows that picric acid is not dissociated in benzene solution and also that {{in the presence of}} the base aniline it functions as an acid, the development of yellow color being due to formation of the picrate ion.|$|R
25|$|Formulation studies involve {{developing}} a {{preparation of the}} drug which is both stable and acceptable to the patient. For orally administered drugs, this usually involves incorporating the drug into a tablet or a capsule. It is important to make the distinction that a tablet contains {{a variety of other}} potentially <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> apart from the drug itself, and studies have to be carried out to ensure that the encapsulated drug is compatible with these other substances {{in a way that does}} not cause harm, whether direct or indirect.|$|R

40|$|Excipients {{have been}} defined in many ways, {{including}} as <b>inert</b> <b>substances</b> used as vehicles and diluents for drugs.

These range from a mild rash to a potentially life-threatening reaction. Different brands of the same drug may contain different excipients, especially preservatives and colourants.

50|$|Strong metal-support {{interaction}} is another case highlighting the oversimplification that heterogeneous catalysts are merely supported on an <b>inert</b> <b>substance.</b> The original evidence {{was provided by}} the finding that particles of platinum bind H2 with the stoichiometry PtH2 for each surface atom regardless of whether the platinum is supported or not. When, however, supported on titanium dioxide, Pt no longer binds with H2 with the same stoichiometry. This difference is attributed to the electronic influence of the titania on the platinum, otherwise called strong metal-support interaction.|$|E

A pragmatic registration procedure is proposed taking into account the use of a fungus based product in relation to its natural distribution and behaviour. On the one hand, the use of a fungus naturally occurring on the target host does not need a sophisticated registration procedure. On the other hand, however, a genetically altered fungus applied against a non natural host in a non natural habitat needs very careful examination...|$|R
