40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of synergistic drug combinations against the in vitro replication of poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) (PV- 1) {{had been established}} in our previous work. The objective {{of the present study}} was to test the combined effects of the different drugs against another representative of the enterovirus genus, i. e. Coxsackievirus B 1 (CBV- 1). Dual combinations of enviroxime, <b>disoxaril,</b> arildone, PTU- 23, HBB and S- 7 were evaluated. The susceptibility of CBV- 1 to the individual effects of the inhibitors was compared to that of PV- 1. CBV- 1 was more sensitive to enviroxime, S- 7, PTU- 23 and HBB and less sensitive to the effects of <b>disoxaril</b> and arildone. The effect of most dual drug combinations tested against CBV- 1 replication was additive or synergistic. Enviroxime and S- 7, enviroxime and PTU- 23, <b>disoxaril</b> and HBB, <b>disoxaril</b> and PTU- 23, arildone and HBB, arildone and PTU- 23, S- 7 and HBB revealed a strong synergistic effect. Synergy against CBV- 1 replication was stronger as compared to that noted for the same drug combinations against PV- 1 replication...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDisoxaril {{inhibits}} enterovirus replication by binding to the hydrophobic pocket {{within the}} VP 1 coat protein, thus stabilizing the virion and blocking its uncoating. Disoxaril-resistant (RES) mutants of the Coxsackievirus B 1 (CVB 1 /RES) {{were derived from}} the wild disoxaril-sensitive (SOF) strain (CVB 1 /SOF) using a selection approach. A disoxaril-dependent (DEP) mutant (CVB 1 /DEP) was obtained following nine consecutive passages of the disoxaril-resistant mutant {{in the presence of}} <b>disoxaril.</b> Phenotypic characteristics of the <b>disoxaril</b> mutants were investigated. A timing-of-addition study of the CVB 1 /DEP replication demonstrated that in the absence of <b>disoxaril</b> the virus particle assembly stopped. VP 1 RNA sequences of <b>disoxaril</b> mutants were compared with the existing Gen Bank CVB 1 reference structure. The amino acid sequence of a large VP 1 196 - 258 peptide (disoxaril-binding region) of CVB 1 /RES was significantly {{different from that of the}} CVB 1 /SOF. Crucially important changes in CVB 1 /RES were two point mutations, M 213 H and F 237 L, both in the ligand-binding pocket. The sequence analysis of the CVB 1 /DEP showed some reversion to CVB 1 /SOF. The amino acid sequences of the three VP 1 proteins are presented...|$|E

The new derivatives were tested for antiviral activity against various human rhinovirus (HRV) serotypes. The best activity was {{exhibited by the}} ethoxycarbonyl derivatives, whereas the oxazoline counterparts were less active and the cyano derivatives totally inactive. 5 -[4 -(4, 5 -Dihydro- 2 -oxazolyl) phenoxy]- 1 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) pentan- 1 -one and ethyl 4 -[5 -(4 -methylthiophenyl) - 5 -oxopentoxy] benzoate were more active than, and as active as, <b>disoxaril,</b> respectively, against HRV- 14. Moreover, they were 10 times less cytotoxic...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining of {{substances}} suppressing replication of caliciviruses is {{of special interest}} due to their particular role in the veterinary and human infectious pathology. Investigations for development of effective anti-calicivirus chemotherapy are important {{due to lack of}} specific means for calicivirus infections treatment. Caliciviridae possess a RNA(+) genome and similar structure as Picornaviridae, but reveal a different genome strategy. In a view of some similarities, a screening for anti-calicivirus activity of several highly efficient inhibitors of picornavirus replication was carried out. Research was carried out with Feline calicivirus (FCV), Crandell’s Feline Kidney cell line (CrFK) and the following compounds: Arildone, <b>Disoxaril,</b> S- 7, Guanidine hydrochloride, PTU- 23, HBB, Ribavirin and Oxoglaucine. Anti-calicivirus activity and citotoxicity were tested through CPE inhibition test and neutral red uptake assay (vs. virus inoculating doses ranging within 1 and 10 000 CCID 50). Significant effects of HBB, PTU- 23, Ribavirin and Oxoglaucine and a slight activity of S- 7 were indicated, while Arildone, <b>Disoxaril</b> and Guanidine hydrochloride did not show influence...|$|E

Becausethese infectionsare rarelycured by passiveadminis-tration of antibody, a chemotherapeutic approach would be advantageous. In this study, the efficacyof the antienterovirus(and antipicornavirus) drug disoxarilwasdemonstrated in a murine model of persistent enterovirusinfection. Disoxarilis a hydrophobic antiviral compound that blocks picornavirus uncoating. The W- 2 strain of human poliovirus type 2 (PV 2) persists in the CNS of immunosuppressed mice and causes late paralysis. Mice were inoculated intracerebrally with PV 2, immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, and treated intragastrically with disoxarilat 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg per day in two divided doses beginning on postinfection day 20. At 2 oomg/kg per day, <b>disoxaril</b> significantly decreased the incidence of clinical disease, i. e., paralysis and death. Assays for virus re-vealed more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS in the drug-treated group. No drug-associated toxicitywas observed. Residual isolates of virus werenot drug-resistant, sug-gesting that the appearance of drug resistance during prolonged treatment {{may not be a}} clinical problem...|$|E
40|$|Picornaviridae {{represent}} {{a very large}} family of small RNA viruses, {{some of which are}} the cause of important human and animal diseases. Since no specific therapy against any of these viruses currently exists, palliative symptomatic treatments are employed. The early steps of the picornavirus replicative cycle seem to be privileged targets for some antiviral compounds like <b>disoxaril</b> and pirodavir. Pirodavir’s main weakness is its cytotoxicity on cell cultures at relatively low doses. In this work some original synthetic compounds were tested, in order to find less toxic compounds with an improved protection index (PI) on infected cells. Using an amino group to substitute the oxygen atom in the central chain, such as that in the control molecule pirodavir, resulted in decreased activity against Rhinoviruses and Polioviruses. The presence of an -ethoxy-propoxy- group in the central chain (as in compound I- 6602) resulted in decreased cell toxicity and in improved anti-Rhinovirus activity. This compound actually showed a PI > 700 on HRV 14, while pirodavir had a PI of 250. These results demonstrate that modification of pirodavir’s central hydrocarbon chain can lead to the production of novel derivatives with low cytotoxicity and improved PI against some strains of Rhinoviruses...|$|E
40|$|Picornaviruses, {{particularly}} human rhinoviruses cause {{approximately one}} half of all cases of respiratory tract infections (common colds). No effective anti-rhinoviruses therapy is currently available although {{during the past decade}} some antiviral active compounds are reported like <b>disoxaril</b> and pirodavir. (1, 2) The published information about the structure/activity relationships of HRV indicates that the most active compounds have general formula 1, wherein the group designed as Het can be a wide range of heterocycles and the central flexible group R and the phenyl ring substituents can be variable. The published information about the structure/activity relationships of HRV indicates that the most active compounds have general formula 1, wherein the group designed as Het can be a wide range of heterocycles and the central flexible group R and the phenyl ring substituents can be variable. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated by measuring the effect produced on cell morphology and cell growth in vitro. The antiviral activity was studied on Human Rhinoviruses 14 (group A) and 39 (group B). The results indicate that compounds 8 (Ar = p-COCH 3 -C 6 H 4), 9 (Ar = 3, 4 -methylendioxy-C 6 H 3) and 10 (n = 1,R = p-COCH 3) were highly active against HRV 14, whilst 7 (Ar = p-CN-C 6 H 4), 8 and 10 were able to inhibit HRV 39 at non-toxic doses...|$|E
40|$|The binding affinities (Kds) and {{the rates}} of {{association}} and dissociation of members of a chemical class of antiviral compounds at their active sites in human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV- 14) were determined. On the basis of analysis by LIGAND, a nonlinear curve-fitting program, of saturation binding experiments with HRV- 14, the Kds for Win 52084, Win 56590, <b>disoxaril</b> (Win 51711), and Win 54954 {{were found to be}} 0. 02, 0. 02, 0. 08, and 0. 22 microM, respectively. The independently determined kinetic rates of association and dissociation resulted in calculated Kd values which were in agreement with the Kd values determined in saturation binding experiments. Scatchard plots of each of four compounds for the binding data indicated that approximately 40 to 60 molecules were bound per HRV- 14 virion. Hill plots showed no evidence of cooperativity in binding. Furthermore, the antiviral activities (MICs in plaque reduction assays with HRV- 14) for this limited series of compounds (n = 4) correlated well (r = 0. 997) with the observed Kds. Likewise, the absence of detectable binding of Win 54954 to the drug-resistant mutant HRV- 14 (Leu- 1188) corresponded to a lack of antiviral activity. The positive relationship between the antiviral activities and the Kds that were determined may have implications for the molecular design of capsid-binding antirhinovirus drugs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHuman enteroviruses {{distributed}} worldwide are causative {{agents of}} {{a broad spectrum of}} diseases with extremely high morbidity, including a series of severe illnesses of the central nervous system, heart, endocrine pancreas, skeleton muscles, etc., as well as the common cold contributing to the development of chronic respiratory diseases, and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The above diseases along with significantly high morbidity and mortality in children, in the high-risk populations (immunodeficiencies, neonates) definitely formulate the chemotherapy as the main tool for the control of enterovirus infections. At present, clinically effective antivirals for use in the treatment of enteroviral infection do not exist, in spite of the lots of work carried out in this field. The main reason for this is the development of drug resistance. The monotherapy courses were the only approach used till now. For {{the first time in the}} research for anti-enterovirus antivirals our team introduced the testing of combination effect of the selective inhibitors of enterovirus replication with different mode of action. We studied alongside the process of development of resistance to the strongest inhibitors of enteroviruses, WIN compounds (VP 1 protein hydrophobic pocket blockers), especially in the models in vivo, CVB infections in mice. We introduced the tracing of a panel of phenotypic markers (MIC 50 value, plaque shape and size, stability at 50 o C, pathogenicity in mice) for characterization the drug-mutants (resistant and dependent) as a very important stage in the study of enterovirus inhibitors. Moreover, as a result of VP 1 RNA sequence analysis performed on the model of <b>disoxaril</b> mutants of CVB 1, we determined the molecular basis of the drug-resistance, two point mutations - M 213 H and F 237 L, both in the ligand-binding pocket. The sequence analysis of the drug-dependent mutant showed some reversion to the wild drug-sensitive virus strain. A large-scale study of the combined effect of a series of anti-enteroviral agents with different modes of action resulted in the selection of a number of very effective in vitro double combinations revealing synergistic character of the combination effect and a broad spectrum of sensitive enteroviruses. Two antivirals developed in our previous studies were involved in these studies, PTU- 23 and oxoglaucine. The most prospective attainment in our study in this field was the development of a novel scheme for the combined application of anti-enteroviral substances in coxsackievirus B 1 neuroinfection in newborn mice. It consisted of a consecutive, alternating and non-simultaneous, administration of the substances in the combination. A triple combination - disoxaril-guanidine. HCl-oxoglaucine (DGO), showing good efficacy was selected. Its effectiveness was expressed in a marked reduction of mortality rate in infected mice as compared both to the placebo group, and to the partner compounds used alone every day, and to the same combination applied simultaneously every day. Studies of the drug sensitivity of viral brain isolates from mice, treated with DGO combination showed not only preserved, but even increased sensitivity to the drugs included in the combination. Obviously, the consecutive alternating administration of anti-enteroviral substances hinders the occurrence of drug-resistance in the course of the experimental enteroviral infections in mice...|$|E
