30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the advantages and}} limitation of the displacement map technique for generating 3 D maps, consider the following example. An aerial-view photograph is recorded of {{a room full of}} people with a distribution <b>of</b> <b>heights,</b> colored in grey-scale according to the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> each person. It is not a simple task to draw conclusions on the relative <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> different people, especially without reference to the color scale, however, it is of course much easier to obtain knowledge on the relative <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the people when viewing from the side. The extra dimension allows the potential for insight into the height distribution to increase. The absolute <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> each individual could also be obtained by directly measuring them, however if this were time consuming the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> a subsection {{of the people in the}} room could be measured, and provided that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> throughout the population were homogeneous and random, data from that subsection could be applied to approximate the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the group. Thus, the relative <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the people are accurately represented, and their absolute heights are approximated in a short time. Provided one keeps in mind the limitations of the technique, this can be a highly effective tool in analyzing large populations of data.|$|R
