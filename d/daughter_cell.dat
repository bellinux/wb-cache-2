5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a <b>daughter</b> <b>cell,</b> the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a <b>daughter</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
50|$|Green algae can {{divide into}} more than two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> The exact number of <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> depends on the species of algae and is an effect of {{temperature}} and light.|$|R
50|$|After the tetrads of {{homologous}} chromosomes are separated in meiosis I, the sister chromatids from each pair are separated. The two haploid(because the chromosome no. has reduced to half. Earlier {{two sets of}} chromosomes were present, but now each set exists in two different <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> that have arisen from the single diploid parent cell by meiosis I) <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> resulting from meiosis I undergo another cell division in meiosis II but without another round of chromosomal replication. The sister chromatids in the two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> are pulled apart during anaphase II by nuclear spindle fibers, resulting in four haploid <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|When E. coli {{undergoes}} cell division, the two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> {{inherit the}} long-lived hok toxin from the parent cell. Due {{to the short}} half-life of the sok antitoxin, <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> inherit only small amounts and it quickly degrades.|$|R
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
25|$|Merotelic {{attachment}} {{occurs when}} one kinetochore {{is attached to}} both mitotic spindle poles. One <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> would have a normal complement of chromosomes; the second would lack one. A third <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> may {{end up with the}} 'missing' chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Monopolar spindle: only {{a single}} spindle pole forms. This {{produces}} a single <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> with its copy number doubled.|$|E
5000|$|Rotational {{cleavage}} {{involves a}} normal first division along the meridional axis, {{giving rise to}} two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> The way in which this cleavage differs {{is that one of}} the <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially.|$|R
5000|$|Some protozoans {{reproduce}} by {{yet another}} mechanism of fission called as plasmotomy.In {{this type of}} fission, a multinucleate adult parent undergoes cytokinesis to form two multinucleate( [...] or coenocytic) <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> so produced undergo karyokinesis, further.|$|R
50|$|Under ideal growth conditions, cells may {{sometimes}} undergo {{two or three}} rounds of mitosis before the <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> are released from the old cell wall into the medium. Thus, a single growth step may result in 4 or 8 <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> per mother cell.|$|R
25|$|Completely {{inactive}} mitotic checkpoints {{may cause}} non-disjunction at multiple chromosomes, possibly all. Such a scenario {{could result in}} each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> possessing a disjoint set of genetic material.|$|E
25|$|Obligatory {{asymmetric}} replication: a {{stem cell}} divides into one mother cell that {{is identical to}} the original stem cell, and another <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> that is differentiated.|$|E
25|$|Multipolar spindles: {{more than}} two spindle poles form. Such a mitotic {{division}} would result in one <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> for each spindle pole; each cell may possess an unpredictable complement of chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Interphase is {{followed}} by meiosis I and then meiosis II. Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, each still made up of two sister chromatids, into two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells,</b> thus reducing the chromosome number by half. During meiosis II, sister chromatids decouple and the resultant daughter chromosomes are segregated into four <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> For diploid organisms, the <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> resulting from meiosis are haploid and contain only one copy of each chromosome. In some species, cells enter a resting phase known as interkinesis between meiosis I and meiosis II.|$|R
50|$|Chromatin {{bridge is}} a mitotic {{occurrence}} that forms when telomeres of sister chromatids fuse together {{and fail to}} completely segregate into their respective <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> Because this event is most prevalent during anaphase, the term anaphase bridge is often used as a substitute. After the formation of individual <b>daughter</b> <b>cells,</b> the DNA bridge connecting homologous chromosomes remains fixed. As the <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> exit mitosis and re-enter interphase, the chromatin bridge becomes known as an interphase bridge. These phenomena are usually visualized using the laboratory techniques of staining and fluorescence microscopy.|$|R
40|$|Cell division, {{during which}} a mother cell usually divides into two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> during one cell cycle, {{is the most}} {{important}} physiological event of cell biology. We observed one-to-four cell division during imaging of live SW 1736 human thyroid anaplastic carcinoma cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the hybrid protein of green fluorescent protein and histone 2 B (plasmid eGFP-H 2 B). Analysis of the images revealed a mother cell divided into four <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> And one of the abnormally divided <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> subsequently formed a dinucleate cell...|$|R
25|$|Nondisjunction usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not lined up on the mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate at all. This would generate a <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> lacking a copy and a <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> with an extra copy.|$|E
25|$|In {{single-celled}} algae, chloroplast {{division is}} the only way new chloroplasts are formed. There is no proplastid differentiation—when an algal cell divides, its chloroplast divides along with it, and each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> receives a mature chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|Wee1 is a {{component}} of this checkpoint. It is a kinase determining the timepoint of entry into mitosis, thus influencing {{the size of the}} daughter cells. Loss of Wee1 function will produce smaller than normal <b>daughter</b> <b>cell,</b> because cell division occurs prematurely.|$|E
50|$|Binary fission or budding {{into two}} <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Binary fission occurs twice, {{yielding}} four identical <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} sister chromatids have differing epigenetic signatures, thereby also differing expression regulation. When replication occurs, non-random segregation of sister chromatids ensures the fates of the <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> Assessing {{the validity of}} this hypothesis would require a joint analysis of Strand-seq and gene expression profiles for both <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|C. uncinata {{goes through}} asexual {{reproduction}} for cell division and duplication called amitosis. As C. uncinata has two nuclei, {{it goes through}} two different styles of division of the nuclei. The germ-line nucleus goes through mitosis during asexual division while the somatic nucleus undergoes amitosis. Amitosis is a stochastic process where unlike in mitosis, there is no spindle formation to segregate chromosomes during nuclear division. Instead, the chromosomes within the somatic nucleus are duplicated, and the nucleus goes through binary division. The precise mechanism is unknown, but {{it is believed that}} somatic chromosomes that are located {{on one side of the}} dividing somatic nucleus are distributed to one <b>daughter</b> <b>cell,</b> and the somatic chromosomes on the other side of the nucleus are distributed to the other <b>daughter</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{replisome}} {{is responsible}} for copying the entirety of genomic DNA in each proliferative cell. This process allows for the high-fidelity passage of hereditary/genetic information from parental cell to <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> and is thus essential to all organisms. Much of the cell cycle is built around ensuring that DNA replication occurs without errors.|$|E
25|$|In {{species of}} algae that contain a single chloroplast, {{regulation}} of chloroplast division {{is extremely important}} to ensure that each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> receives a chloroplast—chloroplasts can't be made from scratch. In organisms like plants, whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts, coordination is looser and less important. It is likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat synchronized, though the mechanisms for it are mostly unknown.|$|E
40|$|During cell {{division}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mother <b>cells</b> produce buds (<b>daughter</b> <b>cells)</b> which are smaller and have longer cell cycles. We performed experiments to compare the lengths of cell cycle phases in mothers and daughters. As anticipated from earlier indirect observations, the longer cell cycle time of <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> is accounted for by a longer G 1 interval. The S-phase and the G 2 -phase are of the same duration in mother and <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> An analysis of five isogenic strains shows that cell cycle phase lengths are independent of cell ploidy and mating type...|$|R
40|$|Stem cells self-renew {{but also}} {{give rise to}} <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> that are {{committed}} to lineage-specific differentiation. To achieve this remarkable task, they can undergo an intrinsically asymmetric cell division whereby they segregate cell fate determinants into {{only one of the}} two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b> Alternatively, they can orient their division plane so that only one of the two <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> maintains contact with the niche and stem cell identity. These distinct pathways have been elucidated mostly in Drosophila. Although the molecules involved are highly conserved in vertebrates, the way they act is tissue specific and sometimes very different from invertebrates...|$|R
50|$|Plant {{cytokinesis}} {{differs from}} animal cytokinesis, {{partly because of}} the rigidity of plant cell walls. Instead of plant cells forming a cleavage furrow such as develops between animal <b>daughter</b> <b>cells,</b> a dividing structure known as the cell plate forms in the cytoplasm and grows into a new, doubled cell wall between plant <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|Chloroplasts {{are highly}} dynamic—they {{circulate}} and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally pinch {{in two to}} reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, contain their own DNA, which {{is thought to be}} inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> during cell division.|$|E
25|$|In G1 {{phase of}} the cell cycle, many of the DNA {{replication}} regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, {{the vast majority of}} DNA synthesis occurs during S {{phase of the}} cell cycle, and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G2, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand.|$|E
25|$|When a cell enters in mitosis, it duplicates all {{the genetic}} {{information}} {{stored in the}} chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication. At {{the end of this}} process, each chromosome includes two sister chromatids, which are two complete and identical DNA molecules. Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until anaphase, when chromosome segregation occurs. If chromosome segregation happens correctly, each <b>daughter</b> <b>cell</b> receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each sister chromatid has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed amphitelic or bi-orientation.|$|E
30|$|To date, {{it still}} remains unknown {{to what degree}} the {{functions}} and mechanisms of fate determinants and adaptors in asymmetric division of NSCs are conserved in CSCs. Rare examples of molecules known to be unequally segregated into <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> include midbody derivatives (MBds), a group of proteins contained in a large proteinaceous organelle, called the midbody (Kuo et al. 2011). The midbody is localized in an intercellular bridge during cytokinesis and thought {{to play a role}} in maintaining the stemness of <b>daughter</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Following asymmetric division, the midbody is normally degraded by <b>daughter</b> <b>cells</b> destined to differentiation. In <b>daughter</b> stem <b>cells,</b> however, it is protected from such autophagic degradation, leading to selective accumulation of MBds. As a consequence, MBds are selectively inherited to <b>daughter</b> stem <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|In biology, {{homolysis}} {{means that}} dividing cell gives two equal-size <b>daughter</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
