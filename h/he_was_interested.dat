5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, {{as they could be}} manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E

5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order.

Mostly, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in his career.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to England in 1897, Chamberlain became a successful businessman {{in his home}} city of Birmingham. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in social affairs, and successfully stood for Birmingham City Council in 1911. He became Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1915. His second term was interrupted in December 1916 when Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked him to become Director of National Service. Chamberlain received little support from Lloyd George in the post, and his eight-month tenure sparked a hatred between the two which lasted Chamberlain's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Demos {{of the new}} {{material}} were sent to British producer Ken Nelson (Coldplay, Gomez). The band members considered him to be an unattainable candidate as a producer, but he responded favourably. Upon learning that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in working with them, they moved to London. At the time, Nelson was occupied working with Coldplay. For eight to ten months, the band lived in adverse conditions in one room {{in a house in}} London. During this period, the members took up menial employment opportunities.

5|$|Despite {{having the}} better chances, York drew 0–0 {{at home with}} Cambridge United, before being beaten 3–1 away by Wrexham, in which Wilkinson scored a late {{consolation}} goal. The club made an attempt to re-sign former striker Clayton Donaldson on loan from Crewe Alexandra, but were told to make an inquiry four weeks later, due to him being injured. York's first double of the season came with a 2–0 away win over Woking, the goals coming from Wilkinson and McBreen. Iyseden Christie's loan spell at Kettering from Stevenage was to be terminated for a loan move to York to go ahead, but this deal fell through. Walker revealed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in signing striker Bruce Dyer, shortly after he played against York's reserve team for Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not alone in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E
