5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E

25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, that if I want {{to arrive at}} the next block, for <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.|$|E

For <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic <b>example</b> <b>I</b> know in modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. We sense throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already over and done with, but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{presents}} several {{perspectives on}} the topic. One point he makes {{is that it is}} incoherent to talk of knowing that one is in some particular mental state. Whereas others can learn of my pain, for <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> simply have my own pain; it follows that one does not know of one's own pain, one simply has a pain. For Wittgenstein, this is a grammatical point, part {{of the way in which}} the language-game involving the word [...] "pain" [...] is played.|$|E

For <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> was often assigned to make movies with rape scenes. I am not a person who could possibly perform rape. I want to see a lady's happy face while having sex... Movies are fantasies. Sometimes they might be ugly, but they're still fantasies. I was the dreamweaver." ...|$|E

The series also set out to determine if Doctor Doom's path from troubled child to dictator was fated or if Doom's own faults led to his corruption — in essence, a nature versus nurture question; whether Doom could ever become a hero. Brubaker's version of Doom was heavily influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version; responding to a question if he would ever show Doom's face, Brubaker stated [...] "ollowing Kirby's <b>example,</b> <b>I</b> think it's better not to show it." ...|$|E
