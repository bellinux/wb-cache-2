A time-to-event model describing the concentration-effect relationship of preventive DHA-PQ administration was used to explore the potential clinical efficacy of once weekly adult <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens.</b> Loading <b>dose</b> strategies were evaluated and the advantage of weekly <b>dosing</b> <b>regimen</b> was tested against different degrees of adherence. Assuming perfect adherence, three tablets weekly <b>dosing</b> <b>regimen</b> scenarios maintained malaria incidence of 0. 2 - 0. 3 % per year, compared to 2. 1 - 2. 6 % for all monthly <b>dosing</b> <b>regimen</b> scenarios and 52 % for placebo.

These results suggest that weekly dosing of DHA-PQ for malaria chemoprevention would improve treatment outcomes compared to monthly administration by lowering the incidence of malaria infections, reducing safety concerns about high PQ peak plasma concentrations and being more forgiving.

Animal treatment is usually done with itraconazole or ketoconazole; most European countries use off label terbinafine in cats and dogs.

The treatment of onychomycosis involves the administration of itraconazole with systemic griseofulvin in combination with topical enilconazole, sometimes a ciclopiroxolamine solution and systemic terbinafine is used. The mistreatment of fungal pathogens is due to the thought of bacterial infection and the administration of corticosteroids. This causes a change in appearance of the lesion and can lead to a harder diagnosis. Mycological examination should form the basis of diagnosis before the administration of antibiotics or corticosteroids.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{vancomycin}} {{is frequently}} {{used to treat}} neonatal late-onset sepsis, {{there is no consensus}} on the optimal <b>dosing</b> <b>regimen.</b> Because many neonates needed dosing adaptation due to suboptimal trough values, the vancomycin <b>dosing</b> <b>regimen</b> in our neonatal department was changed during 2012. Objective: We aimed to document the need for validation of neonatal vancomycin dosing by exploring serum trough levels achieved using 2 published <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens</b> (previous regimen: based on postmenstrual age and serum creatinine and new regimen: based on postmenstrual age and postnatal age) and to identify covariates associated with suboptimal vancomycin trough levels (< 10 mg/L). Methods: Routine therapeutic drug monitoring serum trough levels quantified after initiation of intravenous vancomycin therapy and clinical covariates were retrospectively collected. Median vancomycin trough levels of both <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens</b> were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The influence of continuous and dichotomous covariates on achieving a suboptimal trough level was explored using the Van Elteren test (stratified Mann-Whitney U test) and Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified χ 2 test), respectively. Covariates significant in monovariate analysis were subsequently included in a logistic regression analysis. Results: In total, 294 observations (median current weight 1870 g [range = 420 – 4863 g] and median postmenstrual age 35. 07 weeks [range = 25. 14 – 56. 00 weeks]) were included. Using the previous and new <b>dosing</b> <b>regimens,</b> 66. 3 % and 76. 2 % of trough levels, respectively, were below 10 mg/L.

[...] 64Cu was believed to kill these cells because of its unique decay properties. In this experiment, animal models having colorectal tumors with and without induced hypoxia were administered Cu-ATSM. Cu-ATSM is preferentially taken up by hypoxic cells over normoxic cells. The results demonstrated that this compound increased survival of the tumor bearing hamsters compared with controls. In the control groups, death due to tumor burden occurred within 20 days weeks while animals with a dose greater than 6 mCi of the radioisotope tumor growth was inhibited and survival increased to 135 days in 50% of animals. The results also suggested that multiple doses and a single dose of 10 mCi were equally effective while the multiple <b>dose</b> <b>regimen</b> is safer for non-target tissue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} eggs {{excreted}} by a pig can give {{an indication of}} the worm burden because, in continuously exposed pigs, the quantity of eggs that are shed seems to be correlated with the number of adult worms in the intestine. For this, different coprological techniques can be applied [...] which make use of the buoyancy of parasite eggs to separate them from the faecal debris. For the detection of A. suum eggs, the quantitative McMaster test is generally used. The results of this examination are reported as eggs per gram of faeces or EPG.Although coprological examinations are easy to perform and require relatively cheap materials, the performance of the sampling and the tests are time consuming and not cost-effective nor optimal for the screening of large number of samples. In addition, the correct interpretation of the results of coprological examinations can prove to be a rather difficult exercise.Ascaris populations are strongly aggregated within the pig population with few pigs carrying the majority of the worms while most of the pigs carry few or even no adult worms at all. Because of this, a large number of pigs need to be investigated since there is a significant possibility to have false positive and false negative egg counts.False positives are the result of coprophagia and/or geophagia and their prevalence and magnitude depends on different management and housing factors. The number and range of false-positive A.suum egg counts in pigs can be considerable, but in general, EPG levels lower than 200 should be considered false-positives. However, for diagnosis on farm level, these false positive samples are not as important as the false negatives. False negative results are possible when only immature worms are present or when only worms of a single sex are present. Boes and colleagues [...] have shown that as much as 23% of the investigated pigs that harboured worms in their intestine did not excrete any eggs. Consequentially, prevalence studies that reveal many low A. suum egg counts in pigs should be interpreted with care. Furthermore, the number of adult worms, and therefore the EPG is not representative of the amount of migrating larvae the pig has been exposed to. Regardless of the <b>dose</b> <b>regimen,</b> the numbers of worms that end up in the small intestine is generally inconsistent and independent of the intake of infective stages. Moreover, there seems to exist an inverse relationship between the number of adults found in the intestine and the amount of eggs given during a single experimental infection dose.|$|E
