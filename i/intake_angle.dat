In general, diversion flow can be categorized as natural and artificial flow. Natural flow diversion usually occurs as braiding or cut-off in bend rivers, while artificial flow is man-made to divert flow by lateral intake channels for water supply. This paper presents the results of a laboratory research into effect <b>intake</b> <b>angle</b> on discharge ratio in lateral intakes in 180 degree bend. Investigation on lateral intake and determination of <b>intake</b> <b>angle</b> is among the most important issues in lateral intake on discharge ratio with model <b>intake</b> <b>angle</b> were measured in a laboratory flume under clear-water.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recurrent {{fractures}} of {{the previously}} treated fractured mandible are rare. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 13 cases of repeated mandibular fractures were evaluated according to age, sex, cause, fracture localizations and patterns, treatment modalities, and complications. RESULTS: All of the patients were men, {{with a mean age}} of 27. 5 years and 32 years for the first and the subsequent fractures, respectively. The mean time interval between fractures was 4. 3 years. In 10 cases, the cause for the second fracture was an assault, with 90 percent related to alcohol <b>intake.</b> <b>Angle,</b> body, and parasymphysis region of the mandible were the most common sites to be involved in the first occasion. In 10 cases, an internal rigid fixation procedure was performed for the treatment. In the recurrent injuries, none of the fractures occurred at exactly the same anatomical site. Fractures were either in the neighboring side or the contralateral side {{of the previously}} healed area of mandible. On the second occasion, angle fractures were common and body and subcondylar fracture rates increased. At second presentation, the complication rate increased from 23. 1 percent to 53. 8 percent and most commonly involving malocclusion. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that assault is the major etiologic factor for recurrent mandible fractures and that these fractures occur in different locations from the original injury. They necessitate a cautious approach for the prevention of unfavorable outcomes. Further retrospective clinical and experimental studies are necessary to elucidate the fracture patterns and bone-healing quality of these recurrent mandible fractures...|$|E

Conventional Diesel fuel was injected in up to six subsequent injections during the compression stroke by a piezo injector. For most load cases, soot and NOx emissions were reduced to near zero levels, but HC and CO emissions were significantly higher, when compared to conventional Diesel operation. The improved accuracy of the piezo injector enabled short injections and consequently short spray penetration lengths, which {{made it possible to}} use a nozzle with a wide included angle, without excessive cylinder liner wetting. Maintaining the wide included angle meant that operation of the same engine in Diesel operation was not compromised by the injector geometry.

The promotion of a stable and coherent tumble structure is largely believed in literature to enhance in-cylinder turbulence accelerating combustion process. In small PFI engine layout and weight constraints limit the adoption of more advanced concepts. In previous technical papers the authors demonstrated the influence of head shape and squish area on tumble vortex formation, development, breakdown and on final value of turbulence close to spark plug for small PFI engines.

Dynamic behavior comprises the particle trajectory and its impact velocity and location. While the erosion characteristics are resembled by the impact frequency, erosion rate, erosion parameter and the penetration rate. The study {{was carried out in}} two flight regimes, namely, takeoff, where the sand particles are prevailing, and cruise, where the fly ashes are dominated. In both cases, the effect of the particle size on its trajectory, impact location, and the erosion characteristics was studied. To simulate the problem in a more realistic manner, a Rosin Rambler particle diameter distribution was assumed at takeoff and cruise conditions. At takeoff, this distribution varies from 50 to 300 µm with a mean diameter of 150 µm sand particles.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore a {{methodology}} that allows to represent turbomachinery rotating parts by replacing the blades with a body force field. The objective is to capture interactions between a fan and an air intake at reduced cost, as compared to full annulus unsteady computations. Design/methodology/approach – The blade effects on the flow are taken into account by adding source terms to the Navier-Stokes equations. These source terms give the proper amount of flow turning, entropy, and blockage to the flow. Two different approaches are compared: the source terms can be computed using an analytic model, or they can directly be extracted from RANS computations with the blade’s geometry. Findings – The methodology is first applied to an isolated rotor test case, which allows to show that blockage effects have a strong impact on the performance of the rotor. It is also found that the analytic body force model underestimates the mass flow in the blade row for choked conditions. Finally, the body force approach is used to capture the coupling between a fan and an air <b>intake</b> at high <b>angle</b> of attacks. A comparison with full annulus unsteady computations shows that the model adequately captures the potential effects of the fan on the air intake. Originality/value – To the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time that the analytic model used in this paper is combined with the blockage source terms. Furthermore, the capability of the model to deal with flows in choked conditions was never assessed...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{constantly}} restricting emission regulations and develop better strategiesfor engine control systems, thorough knowledge of engine behavior is crucial. One {{of the characteristics}} to evaluate engine performance and its capabilityfor power generation is in-cylinder pressure. Indeed, most of the diagnosis andcontrol signals {{can be obtained by}} recording the cylinder pressure trace and predictingthe thermodynamic variables [3]. This study investigates the correlation between the in-cylinder pressure andtotal trapped gas mass [10] with the main focus on estimating the in-cylinder gasmass {{as a part of a}} lab measuring procedure using the in-cylinder pressure sensors,or as a real-time method for implementation in an engine control unit thatare not equipped with the cylinder pressure sensors. The motivation is that precisedetermination of air mass is essential for the fuel control system to convey themost-efficient combustion with lower emissions delivered to the after-treatmentsystem [10].

40|$|Modern VVA systems {{offer new}} {{potentialities}} {{in improving the}} fuel consumption for spark-ignition engines at low and medium load, meanwhile they grant a higher volumetric efficiency and performance at high load. Recently introduced systems enhance this concept through the possibility of concurrently modifying the intake valve opening, closing and lift leading {{to the development of}} almost “throttle-less” engines. However, at very low loads, the control of the air-flow motion and the turbulence intensity inside the cylinder may require to select a proper combination of the butterfly throttling and the intake valve control, to get the highest BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) reduction. Moreover, a low throttling, while improving the fuel consumption, may also produce an increased gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth. In highly “downsized” engines, the intake valve control is also linked to the turbocharger operating point, which may be changed by acting on the waste-gate valve. Depending on the valve lift and the actual exhaust pressure, different internal-EGR levels can be achieved, requiring a variation in the spark advance as well. Of course, the introduction of new degrees of freedom to the engine control poses new problems in terms of engine calibration and tuning. To best exploit the potential offered by these systems, new methodologies and development tools must be utilized as well. In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of four control parameters (<b>intake</b> valve closure <b>angle,</b> butterfly valve opening, waste-gate opening and spark advance) of a twin-cylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against the experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power™ commercial code environment, but employs an in-house routine that is implemented to simulate the combustion process. This routine takes into account the effects on the heat release induced by the variations of the in-cylinder flow field, turbulence and internal-EGR. These, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the engine control. An external module is implemented to evaluate the intake valve lift profile {{as a function of the}} closure angle and the engine speed. The 1 D prediction of the gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth is further validated through the comparison with the results obtained by the unsteady 3 D CFD analysis of the flow field within the air-box device. The 1 D computed pressure profile downstream the device is utilized as boundary condition for the 3 D model. The validated 1 D model of the turbocharged engine is then coupled to a multipurpose commercial optimizer (ModeFRONTIER™). The optimization procedure identifies the best combinations of the previously selected control parameters with the goal of minimizing both the fuel consumption and the gas-dynamic noise, for defined low-load lowspeed operating points. The procedure is validated against the experimental data obtained by a calibration of the engine at the test-bed. The values of the control parameters selected by the optimizer well agree with the experimentally identified ones. Alternative settings are also proposed with the aim to substantially reducing the radiated noise with limited or no penalty for the BSFC. The optimization results are also verified by a 3 D CFD analysis. Therefore, the procedure allows for the pre-calibration of a VVA turbocharged SI ICE on completely theoretical basis and proves to be very helpful in reducing the experimental costs and the engine time-to-market...|$|R
40|$|A {{supersonic}} combustion ramjet, or scramjet, is an {{air breathing}} engine {{that is designed}} to operate at hypersonic speeds. At these high speeds, scramjet engines use the forward motion of the vehicle to force air ingestion without the need for moving parts. The flow through a scramjet engine remains supersonic throughout causing the residence time of the fuel and air mixture in the combustion chamber to be very limited. This results in the need for long combustion chambers making it difficult for the thrust produced by the engine to overcome the drag on the vehicle. In order to potentially decrease the length of the combustion chamber, a method has been developed where the fuel is injected on the intake of a scramjet allowing it to mix with air in an environment that does not promote ignition. On entering the combustion chamber the mixture is ignited and the combustion process should proceed more efficiently than would be the case if no pre mixing had been allowed. A possible hazard of this method is that if the fuel ignites on the intake it could result in an increased wall pressure on the intake with a corresponding reduction in net thrust. In this study, hydrogen fuel is injected through a porthole in the intake wall of the model. This injection method has been widely used for injection into a combustion chamber. Injection is most commonly angled perpendicular to the flow through the engine in order to promote maximum jet penetration. The flow structure around the normal jet also contains high circulation regions that are conducive to ignition due to the high residence times in these zones. This is not a desirable feature for intake injection where combustion is ideally suppressed until the flow reaches the combustion chamber. Consequently, the fuel jets in this study are angled 45 degrees downstream to the cross flow which results in reduced recirculation zone size. The angled jet has the additional advantage that some of the momentum of the fuel injection is in the direction of motion of the vehicle and can therefore aide in propulsion. It is also thought that penetration depth is not greatly compromised [54]. Previous testing of <b>angled</b> <b>intake</b> injection on a two dimensional model scramjet in the T 4 shock tunnel at the University of Queensland has observed no signs of premature combustion [34]. Impulse testing facilities, such at the T 4 shock tunnel, provide a useful and cost effective method for hypersonic testing. One major difference between impulse testing and continuous flight is the surface heating experienced by the vehicle or model. The surface temperature is considerably higher in extended flight due to skin friction drag. The implications of high surface temperatures are significant in the case of intake injection because the higher intake wall temperatures increase the likelihood of premature combustion. For this study Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the temperature distribution above the surface of the intake for wall temperatures of up to 800 K. It was found that the effect of elevated wall temperature was localised within a few millimetres distance from the wall. This highlighted the importance of understanding the fuel injection trajectory. If the fuel jet penetrates well into the freestream and resides outside the hot boundary layer, it would be unlikely that it would combust on the intake. For this reason the models developed for this study were specifically designed to accommodate features necessary to utilise optical observation techniques. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of a heated wall on intake fuel injection. The project is consequently divided into two distinct tasks. The first of which is the development of a heated model that is capable of withstanding the harsh conditions experienced by the shock tunnel test flow. This task was accomplished by initially incorporating a heating element in the wall of an existing two dimensional scramjet. This allowed a wall temperature range of 300 K to 500 K to be investigated and comprised the first experiments completed with a heated model in the T 4 shock tunnel. A second model was then created and various techniques were investigated for heating the surface of an intake ramp. Electrical resistance heating eventuated as the simplest and most robust heating method for the second model. Experiments were performed and temperatures of up to 750 K were found to show no signs of combustion on the intake. The second task in {{this study was to investigate}} angled fuel injection on the intake using optical techniques. The majority of optical investigations of fuel injection trajectories have observed the maximum height of the jet. This study investigated techniques capable of providing more extensive, three dimensional information about the jet trajectory including observation of both upper and lower jet boundaries. For this reason two optical techniques were utilised for this study. The first was Holographic Interferometry where the density change across the flow was recorded and used to estimate the location of the majority of the fuel and the amount of mixing that is taking place. Secondly, a Planar Laser Induced Florescence apparatus was developed and used to observe nitric oxide (NO) or hydroxyl (OH) molecules. The NO images allow for the structure of the fuel injection to be observed. OH was also targeted because this is a species produced in the hydrogen air reaction scheme and can therefore be used to indicate if combustion is taking place. Flow visualisation using NO PLIF was used to view angled fuel injection allowing both upper and lower fuel boundaries to be seen for jet momentum flux ratios ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4. Curve fitting of experimental results allowed correlations estimating the jet penetration of the upper and lower boundaries to be determined. Sideways interaction of adjacent jets was seen to substantially influence the jet trajectory causing the boundaries to diverge from the determined correlations. Finally, OH levels were observed using the PLIF technique. Observations of a butane burner clearly showed that OH could be detected using the apparatus. Images of the flow, however, showed no signs of fluorescence. In conclusion, wall pressure measurements combined with optical visualisation results showed no detectable sign of premature combustion using intake injection onto a hot wall for conditions with total enthalpies ranging from (3. 42 +/- 0. 24) MJ/kg to (6. 61 +/- 0. 46) MJ/kg...|$|R
