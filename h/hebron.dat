5|$|<b>Hebron</b> {{glass was}} {{traditionally}} produced using sand {{from the village}} of Bani Na'im, east of <b>Hebron,</b> and sodium carbonate taken from the Dead Sea. Instead of sand, recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make <b>Hebron</b> glass today.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} of Great Capon Church built the present one-and-a-half-story Lutheran church building in 1849, {{when it was}} briefly renamed <b>Hebron</b> on the Cacapon after the Scriptural <b>Hebron</b> (the city associated with Judah, Abraham, and Isaac). The church was later known simply as <b>Hebron</b> Church.|$|E
5|$|The glass {{industry}} in <b>Hebron</b> was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to <b>Hebron</b> in particular. Glass artifacts from <b>Hebron</b> dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of <b>Hebron</b> glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced in <b>Hebron</b> are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hebron</b> Church (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Great Capon Church, <b>Hebron</b> Lutheran Church, and <b>Hebron</b> Evangelical Lutheran Church) is a mid-19th-century Lutheran church in Intermont, Hampshire County, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. <b>Hebron</b> Church {{was founded in}} 1786 by German settlers in the Cacapon River Valley, making it the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley. The congregation worshiped in a log church, which initially served both Lutheran and Reformed denominations. Its congregation was originally German-speaking; the church's documents and religious services were in German until 1821, when records and sermons transitioned to English.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the newly}} {{appointed}} Ottoman pasha ("governor") of the sanjak ("district") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to subdue the rebellion in the <b>Hebron</b> region. Kamil Pasha marched towards <b>Hebron</b> with his army in July 1855, and after crushing the opposition, {{he ordered the}} local shaykhs to summon to his camp. Several of the shaykhs, including {{the leader of the}} 'Amr clan and Muslih al-'Azza, did not obey the summons. Kamil Pasha then requested that the British consul in Jerusalem, James Finn, serve as an envoy and arrange a meeting with Muslih. Finn sent his vice-consul to assure Muslih of his safety in <b>Hebron</b> and convinced him to meet with Kamil Pasha. Muslih was well received in <b>Hebron</b> and returned to Bayt Jibrin escorted by twenty of the governor's men. Soon after, the Kamil Pasha paid a visit to Bayt Jibrin to settle affairs and collect the town's overdue taxes. Kamil Pasha took an oath of loyalty from all the local shaykhs in the <b>Hebron</b> region, including those under the rule of Muslih al-'Azza.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, the {{production}} declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, {{the products of}} <b>Hebron</b> continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling Jewish traders from the city. At the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna, <b>Hebron</b> was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained {{an important source of}} income for <b>Hebron</b> with four factories making 60,000 francs per annum.|$|E
5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being the authentic site. However, some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in <b>Hebron</b> as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the <b>Hebron</b> traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E
5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in <b>Hebron.</b> Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in <b>Hebron</b> during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in <b>Hebron</b> would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hebron</b> {{glass is}} an {{attraction}} for {{both domestic and}} foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on Palestinian freedom of movement {{in the aftermath of}} the Second Intifada, industry production has suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation, under these circumstances, the survival of the <b>Hebron</b> glass industry is in question.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 1915, {{the post}} office {{changed its name to}} Intermont (after the Intermountain Construction Company), {{operating}} until its closure on January 29, 1972. The unincorporated community around <b>Hebron</b> Church continues to be known as Intermont, after the former post office. By 1921, the Winchester and Western Railroad had been constructed to the east of <b>Hebron</b> Church by the Intermountain Construction Company to connect Wardensville with Winchester and develop the area's timber, mining, and fruit industries.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 1879, a {{post office}} was {{established}} near <b>Hebron</b> Church to serve the adjacent community (then known as Mutton Run). In December 1884, the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue, burning a hole through the sanctuary's ceiling which was soon repaired. On August 11–15, 1886, <b>Hebron</b> Church celebrated its centennial. During the celebration, Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region. The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States.|$|E
5|$|Schwester Selma was {{the only}} operating-room nurse on duty during the 1929 <b>Hebron</b> massacre. A rescue team managed to {{evacuate}} the wounded from <b>Hebron</b> and rush them to the Shaare Zedek and Hadassah hospitals in Jerusalem. Specialists from throughout Jerusalem came to Shaare Zedek to operate on the wounded, and Schwester Selma assisted them for 23 hours without a break.|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} the congregation's 175th anniversary in 1961, <b>Hebron</b> Church constructed a brick community and religious education building {{designed to be}} architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church. As of October 2015, the church continues {{to be used by}} the West Virginia-Western Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. <b>Hebron</b> Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 16, 2014, for its architectural distinction as a local example of vernacular Greek Revival church architecture in the Potomac Highlands.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} no known records of {{military}} planning, in early May the notables of Nablus, Jerusalem and <b>Hebron</b> coordinated an assault against Jerusalem. On 8 May armed peasants from Nablus, Jerusalem, <b>Hebron</b> and Gaza besieged the city and about 10,000 fighters attempted to storm the walls. They were initially repulsed by the Egyptian garrison. An earthquake occurred in the city on 13 May and fighting ceased for several days.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2015, the church's {{congregation}} {{is part of}} the Potomac Conference in the West Virginia-Western Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Ministered by David A. Twedt, <b>Hebron</b> Church has 22 baptized members, 19 confirmed {{members and}} an average attendance of six.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{economic}} and political policies alienated four broad and influential factions in Palestine, namely the effendiyat (notables) of Jerusalem, {{the bulk of the}} major clans in Jabal Nablus, the clans of the Jerusalem hinterland, and the Bedouin tribes in the areas of <b>Hebron</b> and Bethlehem.|$|E
5|$|In Islamic tradition, Bayt Jibrin is {{the burial}} {{place of the}} sahaba (companion) of the prophet Muhammad, Tamim al-Dari, who was famously known for his piety and briefly served as the Governor of Jerusalem in the late 7th century. Al-Dari {{and his family were}} granted {{trusteeship}} over the <b>Hebron</b> Hills, including Bayt Jibrin, and were assigned as the supervisors of the Cave of the Patriarchs (Ibrahimi Mosque) in <b>Hebron.</b> His sanctuary is the most venerated site in Bayt Jibrin, located just northwest of it. Until the present day, al-Dari's sanctuary has been a place of local Muslim pilgrimage. Other Islamic holy sites in the village include Maqam (shrine) for a local shaykh named Mahmud and a tomb for a shaykha (female religious figure) named Ameina.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1938, {{during the}} Arab National revolt of 1936-1939 J. L. Starkey, a {{well-known}} archaeologist, {{was killed by}} a group of armed Arabs on the track leading from Bayt Jibrin to <b>Hebron.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{spread to}} Jerusalem, <b>Hebron</b> and other mountainous areas {{in what is}} today known as the West Bank. Although Nablus was {{the core of the}} rebels' strength, the first actual clash between the authorities and the rebels occurred in the vicinity of <b>Hebron</b> after a group of Egyptian soldiers were sent by the Egyptian governor of <b>Hebron</b> to enforce the draft orders. Local peasants from the nearby village of Sa'ir and Bedouin fighters from the Bethlehem-based Ta'amirah tribe joined forces and killed some 25 soldiers during the fighting, defeating Ibrahim Pasha's forces in the area. Prior to this clash, peasants and local Bedouin took up arms against the Egyptian army in al-Salt, the Transjordanian center of the Nablus-based Tuqan family. Following these confrontations, the Egyptian Army's Nineteenth Regiment under Mustafa Bey came under rebel assault in the Jezreel Valley en route to the Galilee. About three-quarters of the regiment's roughly 1,200 soldiers were killed or captured, and Mustafa Bey was wounded. With 300 of his soldiers, the latter escaped to Haifa and traveled across its bay to Acre, whose walls were surrounded by rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|As part of Muhammad Ali's {{modernization}} policies, Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian {{governor of}} the Levant, issued conscription orders for a fifth of all Muslim males of fighting age. Encouraged by rural sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad, the urban notables of Nablus, <b>Hebron</b> and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area did not carry out Ibrahim Pasha's orders to conscript, disarm and tax the local peasantry. The religious notables of Safad followed suit. Qasim and other local leaders rallied their kinsmen and revolted against the authorities in May 1834, taking control of several towns. While {{the core of the}} fighting was in the central mountain regions of Palestine (Samaria and Judea), the revolt also spread to the Galilee, Gaza and parts of Transjordan. Jerusalem was briefly captured by the rebels and plundered. Faced with the superior firepower and organization of Ibrahim Pasha's troops, the rebels were defeated in Jabal Nablus, Jerusalem and the coastal plain before their final defeat in <b>Hebron,</b> which was leveled. Afterward, Ibrahim Pasha's troops pursued and captured Qasim in al-Karak, which was also leveled.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{has three}} bus {{stations}} owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, <b>Hebron,</b> Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses {{are not allowed}} to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.|$|E
5|$|Early {{religious}} services {{were held in}} the log church on land deeded to Reformed trustee Jacob Huber and Lutheran trustee John Nicholas Schweitzer, {{both of whom were}} church elders in 1786. The deed conveying the land to the trustees specified that it was to be used for a German church and burial yard. The united congregation became <b>Hebron</b> Church, the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{what would}} become US 213 was {{completed}} as a state highway between <b>Hebron</b> and Riverton via Mardela Springs, Easton and Longwoods, Centerville and Church Hill, and in the Chestertown area, while the present road between Elkton and Singerly was also built as a state highway. The portion of roads between Riverton and Sharptown, Brookview and Hurlock, Church Hill and southeast of Chestertown, northeast of Chestertown and northeast of Kennedyville, and Chesapeake City and Elkton were under contract to be built as state roads. At this time, a state highway was proposed along the segments between Ocean City and Berlin, Salisbury and <b>Hebron,</b> Sharptown and Brookview, Hurlock and Easton, Longwoods and Centreville, northeast of Kennedyville and Chesapeake City, and Elkton and Fair Hill. By 1915, {{the entire length of}} road between Ocean City and Elkton was completed as a state highway. The state highway between Singerly and south of Fair Hill was finished by 1923. The state highway was finished to Fair Hill by 1927.|$|E
5|$|In Jerusalem meanwhile, Rashad Bey and his {{garrison}} (numbering 1,500 men) were {{assaulted by}} rebel forces. Rashad Bey and 800 Egyptian soldiers were killed, while hundreds more were captured by rebels {{and taken to}} <b>Hebron.</b> Ibrahim Pasha had since returned to Mount Zion and the rebels attempted to lay siege against him and his troops.|$|E
5|$|Omar Mukhtar Street is {{the main}} road {{in the city of}} Gaza running north-south, {{branching}} off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and <b>Hebron</b> in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November {{attacks by}} the Anzac Mounted Division towards Tel el Khuweilfe {{and the road}} to <b>Hebron</b> and Jerusalem {{concerned}} the Ottoman defenders, who feared that a major cavalry attack could breakthrough the Ottoman line and capture the Seventh Army headquarters at <b>Hebron.</b> However, the EEF planned to break the Ottoman line in the center, at Hareira and Sheria. As the fighting at Khuweilfe continued, a minor attack on Gaza was made overnight on 1/2 November, while the main attacks on the centre at the Battle of Hareira and Sheria began on 6 November. Gaza {{was found to have}} been evacuated by its Ottoman defenders early on 7 November and Hareira was also captured that morning. After strong resistance against the 60th (London) Division's attacks against the Ottoman defenders at Sheria (supported by a light-horse charge on 7 November), the position was captured by infantry just before dusk on 7 November.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 2008, Williams and a {{consortium}} of oil companies led by Chevron Canada signed a deal to develop the <b>Hebron</b> oil field – the second largest oil field {{off the coast of}} the province with an estimated 700million barrels of oil reserves, worth some $20billion in royalties and up to 3,500 jobs from the project. Construction is scheduled to start in 2012, with oil extraction by 2017.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 2007, Williams {{signed a}} Memorandum of {{understanding}} for the <b>Hebron</b> offshore oilfield with several major oil companies in which government royalties were exchanged for a 4.9 percent equity {{stake in the}} project. On September 17, 2007, Williams called a provincial election. Williams' popularity was riding at 75%, and polls during the campaign showed the Conservatives reaching up to 86 percent of voter support.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{congregation}} {{built the}} present Greek Revival-style -story church building in 1849, {{when it was}} renamed <b>Hebron</b> on the Cacapon. The original log church was moved across the road and subsequently used as a sexton's house, Sunday school classroom, and public schoolhouse (attended by future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump).|$|E
5|$|The first {{mission of}} 1946 was Operation <b>Hebron</b> on 8January. This time the {{objective}} was the cordon and {{search of the}} town of Rishon LeZion by the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the police, during which fifty-five suspects were taken into custody. For the rest of the month, the brigade was involved in several smaller operations. In Operation Pigeon on 30January, they searched the Shapira district of Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of glassblowing {{continues in the}} 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City, north of <b>Hebron</b> and south of the neighboring town of Halhul which generally produce functional household souvenirs. Two of the factories are owned by the Natsheh family. These are displayed in large halls close to each of the factories.|$|E
5|$|As {{members of}} the Qais tribo-political faction, in {{opposition}} to the Yaman faction, the Barghouti aligned themselves with Qaisi-affiliated Bedouin tribes and other prominent families, including the Khalidi clan of Jerusalem, the 'Amr, 'Azza and 'Amla clans of the <b>Hebron</b> area and the Samhan clan of the Bani Harith nahiya to the north. In 1855–1856 tensions between Sheikh Salih and the leading families of Nablus broke out into fierce clashes. Sheikh Salih was eventually able to compel the Ottoman authorities to take the local rulers of Nablus to task. The restive sheikhs of the Jerusalem and <b>Hebron</b> regions were called to Damascus to conclude a lasting peace, but all were condemned to exile in Trabzon, northern Anatolia, with the exception of Sheikh Salih who apparently impressed the governor and was allowed to return to Deir Ghassaneh. The Barghouti clan would later support the Dar Hammad tribe against the Dar Hamid, both of which were engaged in a feud in nearby Silwad. In one day of fighting, 20 men were killed, prompting Sureya Pasha, the governor of Jerusalem, to personally intervene with a detachment of Ottoman troops which forced both factions to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Decline {{in market}} demand {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the trade and the stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives. Much of the town's agricultural products are sold in <b>Hebron.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{received}} his Master's degree {{in political science}} in 1980, and later his PhD in political studies, from Princeton. His doctoral thesis was on Zionism. Before gaining academic employment, Finkelstein was a part-time social worker with teenage dropouts in New York. He then taught successively at Rutgers University, New York University, Brooklyn College, and Hunter College and at DePaul University in Chicago. During the First Intifada, he spent every summer from 1988 in the West Bank, a guest of Palestinian families in <b>Hebron</b> and Beit Sahour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hebron</b> Church is on {{the plain}} of a {{predominantly}} rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County, in the Cacapon River Valley. Baker Mountain, a forested, narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises west of the church, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise east of the valley. The Cacapon River, just southeast of the church, is hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage. George Washington National Forest, encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River, is east of the church.|$|E
5|$|However, the Crusaders {{remained}} {{in control of}} Bethgibelin until 1244, when the Ayyubids reconquered it under Sultan as-Salih Ayyub. By 1283, the Mamluks had taken control and it was listed as a domain of Sultan Qalawun. The city prospered under the Egypt-based Mamluk Sultanate {{and served as a}} postal station. During Mamluk rule, Bayt Jibrin administratively belonged to <b>Hebron</b> and was {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Shafi'i (a school of law in Sunni Islam) qadi (head judge) of that city.|$|E
