40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to find out and map the {{occurrence}} of <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> in Novohradske Mountains and {{in parts of the}} surrounding foothills. There is a natural occurrence of Wych elm (Ulmus glabra) on the respective territory which was confirmed by my research. I also managed to find six Field <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> (Ulmus minor) that are not to be found on this territory naturally. A natural occurrence and purposeful growing of Wych <b>elm</b> <b>tree</b> (Ulmus glabra) is also proved in historical records dating as far back as 17 th century when the respective territory was part of the Buquoy manor. During my field research I was able to find 40 localities with altogether 783 registered <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> with the height of over 3 m. Researching the records of Forests of the Czech Republic, State Enterprise I also managed to find 10 more locations where I could register only 12 grown <b>elm</b> <b>trees,</b> since the remaining approximately 580 <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> up to 5 m of height have been planted in the last decade and their numbers will be changing in the following decades as a result of 4 silvicultural measures. It mostly concerns <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> that can be found in plastic protection or surrounded by forest fences against animal gnawing. It is interesting that there are several over aged specimen mostly in old alleys on the respective territory and all other <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> do not exceed the estimated age of 50 years...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topic of Dutch elm disease in {{infected}} <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> planting in Kostelany na Moravě, presents research at the area of seed orchard. There were observed the areas with two kinds of <b>elm</b> <b>trees,</b> where {{one of them was}} affected by Duth elm disease. The protection measures to prevent the spreading of the disease were proposed by the research. The orchard was attended during two vegetative periods in the year 2010 and 2011.

40|$|<b>Elm</b> <b>trees</b> (Ulmus spp.) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} landscape plants, widely used as ornamental trees to embellish parks and streets of different countries including Iran. <b>Elm</b> <b>trees</b> cultivation is seriously limited by biotic factors such as bacterial pathogens. Recently, bacterial wetwood has been identified as a common disease on <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> in Northwest Iran. In present study, in order to identify bacterial pathogens associated with <b>elm</b> <b>trees,</b> wetwood infected samples were collected from <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> showing wetwood symptom across Tabriz city and immediately transferred to the lab. After isolation and purification of isolates, hypersensitive reaction (HR), pathogenicity, biochemical and molecular tests were used to characterize the isolates. In total of 92 isolates obtained, 32 and 10 isolates were able to induce HR and wetwood symptoms on tobacco leaves and young branches of elm, respectively. Based on biochemical and molecular tests, the identity of the isolates studied were determined as Brevundimonas bullata, Paracoccus alcaliphilus, P. marcusii and Luteimonas aestuarii. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows that these four bacterial species here reported are responsible for the causal agent-complex of wetwood disease on <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> for the first time in the world...|$|R

40|$|Since 1992 <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> {{have been}} treated with a {{biological}} control product Dutch Trig ® {{to protect them from}} infection by Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease (DED). The active ingredient of the biocontrol product consists of the fungus Verticillium albo-atrum strain WCS 850. A conidiospore suspension of this fungus is injected into the vascular system of <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> at a height of 1. 3 m. This biocontrol product prevents healthy <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> from fungal infection transmitted by elm bark beetles. Dutch Trig ®, however, does not protect already infected trees or trees connected with diseased trees via root grafts. Since 2010, only 0. 1 % of the injected elms became infected with DED through beetle transmission and an additional 0. 4 % of the treated elms were infected through root contact in the Netherlands. Regression analysis considering all injected <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> in the Netherlands since 1992 indicated that DED infection through beetle transmission had significantly decreased during the 24 years application of Dutch Trig ®. In 2015, approximately 28, 300 trees in five countries (Netherlands, USA, Germany, Canada and Sweden) were treated with Dutch Trig ® to protect valuable susceptible <b>elm</b> <b>trees,</b> mainly in urban environments. </p...|$|R
