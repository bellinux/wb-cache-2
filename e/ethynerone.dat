50|$|In {{combination}} with mestranol, similarly to <b>ethynerone</b> and anagestone acetate (and certain other progestogens, including progesterone {{and several other}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives), chloroethynylnorgestrel was found to produce striking mammary tumors in beagle dogs after administration at very high dosages (10- to 25-fold human clinical dosages) for prolonged periods of time. This resulted in the discontinuation of its development, along with that of <b>ethynerone</b> and anagestone acetate, {{as well as the}} removal of several progestins, including chlormadinone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, from various markets as contraceptives (although medroxyprogesterone acetate has since been reintroduced). Subsequent research revealed that the risk is species-dependent and unique to canines and that there is no similar risk for humans.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, {{during its}} {{clinical}} development, <b>ethynerone</b> {{was found to}} produce mammary gland tumors in dogs treated with it at very high doses for prolonged periods of time. Subsequent investigation found that 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatves included anagestone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate produced similar mammary gland tumors, and that their ability to do so correlated directly with their progestogenic actions. In contrast, the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, and etynodiol diacetate, which are much less potent as progestogens, did not produce such effects at the dosages tested. Clinical development of <b>ethynerone</b> was discontinued, {{and many of the}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were withdrawn for the indication of hormonal contraception. Research later on revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethynerone</b> (INN, USAN), {{also known}} as 17α-(2-chloroethynyl)estra-4,9-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone group that was first reported in 1961 but was never marketed. Under the developmental code name MK-665, it was studied in combination with mestranol as an oral contraceptive. Development of the drug was discontinued due to concerns surrounding toxicity findings in dogs. It is a chloroethynylated derivative of norethisterone.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, {{along with}} a variety of other progestogens {{including}} progesterone, chlormadinone acetate, megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>ethynerone,</b> and chloroethynyl norgestrel, anagestone acetate was found to induce the development of mammary gland tumors in Beagle dogs after extensive treatment (2-7 years) with very high doses (10-25 times the recommended human dose), though notably not with 1-2 times the human dosage. In contrast, the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, and etynodiol diacetate were not found to produce such nodules. Because of these findings, anagestone acetate was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by the manufacturer in 1969. The findings also led to the virtual disappearance of most 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives as hormonal contraceptives from the market (though medroxyprogesterone acetate has continued to be used). According to Hughes et al., [...] "It is still doubtful how much relevance these findings have for humans as the dog mammary gland seems to be the only one which can be directly maintained by progestogens." [...] Subsequent research revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, CMA was {{introduced}} {{as a component}} of oral contraceptives. However, around 1970, such formulations were withdrawn from many markets due to the finding that CMA induced mammary gland tumors in Beagle dogs. (CMA has continued to be widely used as a contraceptive in some countries, such as Germany and China, however.) The doses administered that caused the nodules were 10 or 25 times the recommended human dosage {{for an extended period of}} time (2-4 years), while no tumors were found in dogs treated with 1-2 times the human dosage. In addition to CMA, mammary tumors were found in dogs with various other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and anagestone acetate, and they were also discontinued for the indication of hormonal contraception (although medroxyprogesterone acetate has since been reintroduced). Tumors were also observed with progesterone, as well as with <b>ethynerone</b> and chloroethynylnorgestrel, but notably not with the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, or etynodiol diacetate, which remained on the market. In any case, according to Hughes et al., [...] "It is still doubtful how much relevance these findings have for humans as the dog mammary gland seems to be the only one which can be directly maintained by progestogens." [...] Subsequent research revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 213 treated and 16 control monkeys {{comprising}} 12 experimental groups was evaluated for {{determination of the}} long-term (10 years) effects of various dosages {{of a variety of}} synthetic oral contraceptive steroids on the mammary glands of rhesus monkeys. The steroid hormones included mestranol, <b>ethynerone,</b> a combination of mestranol and <b>ethynerone,</b> chlorethynyl norgestrel plus mestranol, and anagestone acetate plus mestranol. Various degrees of physiologic lobular hyperplasia and lactational changes were observed in association with all of these steroid hormones; these changes appeared dose-dependent. Mestranol caused a proliferative atypia ranging from a minimal to a moderate degree in 8 of 34 (23 %) animals, but it was not dose-related. Eleven of 15 monkeys (73 %) administered <b>ethynerone</b> developed proliferative atypia, ranging in degree from minimal to severe, including one invasive carcinoma and 2 lesions resembling intraductal carcinoma in the human. The mestranol and <b>ethynerone</b> combination produced a proliferative atypia in 22 of 52 animals (42 %), including five identical to intraductal carcinoma in the human and one identical to lobular neoplasia. Of the 40 monkeys administered anagestone acetate and mestranol, 20 (50 %) developed proliferative atypias; the atypias ranged from mild to severe and included five resembling intraductal carcinoma in human breast. The chloroethynyl norgestrel and mestranol combination induced proliferative atypia in 25 of 52 monkeys (49 %); six of these atypias were severe and indistinguishable from intraductal carcinoma of the human breast; and one, if in the human breast, would reflect a solid variant of an invasive carcinoma. Only 2 of the 16 control monkeys (12 %) developed proliferative atypias, and these were of minimal to mild degree. The occurrence of severe degrees of atypia identical to intraductal carcinoma in the human breast and invasive carcinoma associated with hormone administration suggests a carcinogenic effect...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-Of 172 beagle dogs {{administered}} investigational {{oral contraceptive}} steroids for 2. 4 - 5. 2 years, 9 developed malig-nant mammary tumors. At necropsy their ages varied from 41 to 70 months, {{with a mean}} age of 4. 9 years. The malignant tumors were observed in 1 dog that received <b>ethynerone</b> plus mestranol at 1. 05 mg/kg/day and in 4 dogs that received chlorethynyl norgestrel plus mestranol at 1. 05 mg/kg/day. Also, 4 dogs that received anagestone acetate plus mestranol at either 0. 44 or 1. 10 mg/kg/day developed malignant mammary tumors. Malignant tumors were not seen in 33 dogs administered mestranol at 0. 02 and 0. 05 mg/kg/day for 7 years or in 18 dogs given <b>ethynerone</b> without mestranol at 1. 00 mg/kg/day for 5 years. No malignant tumors were observed in 18 control dogs maintained for 7 years without treatment. Three dogs had single malignant mammary nodules, 3 dogs had 2 malignant nodules, 2 dogs had 4 -...|$|E
