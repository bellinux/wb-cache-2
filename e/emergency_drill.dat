5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong <b>emergency</b> <b>drill</b> in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E

Many families built bomb shelters in their yards, and children had learned to “duck and cover” under their desks as an <b>emergency</b> <b>drill</b> to a nuclear blast (U-S-History.com). This state of cold war was fought through Vietnam with America supporting the anti-communist South Vietnam and the Soviet Union supporting the pro-communist North Vietnam (What was the Cold War, 2000). The U.S.’s economy showed a short prosperous growth, which faltered when Lyndon Johnson failed to raise taxes to cover war expenses (Carr and Conte). The war dragged on until 1975 and the economy stagnated. During this time period though, the U.S. had established the Department of Transportation in 1966 and the Federal Highway Administration in 1967 (About Inc.).

The Safe America Foundation also conducted a national drill during a meeting in January 2009 in Chicago, IL. The meeting was hosted by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) V Regional Administrator Edward Buikema. The organization also focused on creating the campaign around the FEMA’s 10 regional hubs. Safe America’s online Pledge to Drill form was also introduced in 2009.

40|$|ABSTRACT Rupture of {{the uterus}} is a serious obstetric {{emergency}} endangering the life of both mother and fetus. In a study at the general hospital in Dohuk, Iraq, from January 2003 to December 2004, the incidence of ruptured uterus was 0. 2 % (42 out of 20 574 deliveries). The majority of these women (81 %) were unbooked and had had no antenatal care. The range of parity was 1 – 13, median 7. The main causes were obstructed labour and previous caesarean scar (36 % of cases each). The maternal mortality rate among these cases was 5 % and the perinatal mortality rate was 62 %.
