5|$|At {{the start}} of that century, some {{boarding}} schools like Eton College and Winchester College thrived educating {{the sons of the}} aristocracy, but most endowed grammar schools were in decline, their classical curricula seen as <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industrial age.|$|E
5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> business of selecting fiction.|$|E

The prosecutors found Kids Can Say No! on YouTube and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E

25|$|Tchernov {{and others}} {{dismissed}} the snakes Haasiophis and Pachyrhachis, {{which had been}} previously put forward as evidence that snakes were close relatives of mosasaurs, as red herrings that were <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> understanding <b>the</b> origin of snakes or any potential evolutionary ties linking them to mosasaurs.|$|R
25|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Innate Knowledge thesis, the Innate Concept thesis {{suggests}} that some concepts are simply part of our rational nature. These concepts are a priori in nature and sense experience is <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> determining <b>the</b> nature of these concepts (though, sense experience can help bring <b>the</b> concepts <b>to</b> our conscious mind).|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the installment, an unborn child is apparently abducted from its mother's womb by a demon after the prospective parents discover that their child has birth defects. After Agent Spender dismisses the assignment as <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> X-Files, Mulder and Scully steal the case and investigate the creature. While looking into the report, the duo discover that Wayne Weinsider (Campbell) is a child-abducting demon.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{was created}} {{the border between}} Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern {{boundary}} of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language {{would continue to be}} spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as Cambria irredenta. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> purposes of its framers.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into {{separate}} parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments {{are not required to}} be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
50|$|A {{benefit of}} the technique, largely now <b>irrelevant</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rise of digital video, is a {{reduction}} in the cost of the production. When the cost of film was a significant fraction of the budget, filmmakers used this technique to maximize film usage.|$|R

5|$|The naval Battle of Jasmund (also {{known as}} the Battle of Rügen) took place between {{elements}} of the Danish and Prussian navies on 17 March 1864 during the Second Schleswig War. The action took place east of the Jasmund peninsula on the Prussian island of Rügen, during a Prussian attempt to weaken the Danish blockade in the Baltic Sea. The Prussian squadron, commanded by Eduard von Jachmann, sortied with two steam corvettes, a paddle steamer, and six gunboats to attack the Danish squadron blockading the eastern Prussian coast. The Danish force was commanded by Edvard van Dockum, and it consisted of one steam frigate, one ship of the line, and two steam corvettes. In an action lasting two hours, the superior Danish squadron forced the Prussians to withdraw, both sides suffering damage and light casualties. The Danish victory was compounded {{by the arrival of}} further warships after the battle, which cemented the blockade. The outcome of the battle, and the naval war in the Baltic as a whole, was <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the war, however, as the Prussian and Austrian armies decisively defeated the Danes on land, forcing them to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} hoplites is {{accepted}} as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon. Some historians {{have accepted the}} number of light troops and used them as a population census of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis, manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters. Thus 69,500 light troops {{could easily have been}} sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate. For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate. He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army. Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outcome of battle.|$|E

30|$|Solution (12) is the {{singular}} soliton solution. Singular solitons are {{another kind of}} solitary waves that appear with a singularity, usually infinite discontinuity (Wazwaz 2012). Singular solitons can be connected to solitary waves when the center position of the solitary wave is imaginary (Drazin and Johnson 1989). Therefore it is not <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> issue of singular solitons. This solution has spike and therefore it can probably provide an explanation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of Rogue waves.|$|R
30|$|It {{is clear}} from Figure[*] 9 that dot-base 62 x has a {{theoretical}} length reduction of approximately 30 % (orig. column) and approximately 24 % in real use (avg. column). In practice, only the average values are significant; the minimum and maximum lengths are largely <b>irrelevant</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> low probability of these extremes in real network environments.|$|R

Cognitive inhibition in particular can be observed in many instances throughout specific areas of cognitive science.|$|E
25|$|External {{validity}} {{pertains to}} the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or <b>irrelevant)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.|$|E

The cell was equipped with a DLR home-made segmented board <b>to</b> monitor <b>the</b> current density distribution.|$|R

This way of posing the question is both morally inappropriate and <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> determination of real climate mitigation policy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> religious status of Scientology, finding that <b>the</b> question was <b>irrelevant</b> <b>to</b> deciding <b>the</b> case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 {{that the question}} whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|R
