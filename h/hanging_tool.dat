50|$|Henry O. Studley (1838-1925) was {{an organ}} and piano maker, carpenter, and Mason {{who worked for}} the Smith Organ Co., and later for the Poole Piano Company of Quincy, Massachusetts. Born in 1838 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Studley is best known for {{creating}} the so-called Studley Tool Chest, a wall <b>hanging</b> <b>tool</b> chest which cunningly holds 245 tools in a space that takes up about 40 by 20 inches (102 × 51 cm) of wall space when closed. Studley joined the Massachusetts Infantry {{at the start of the}} Civil War and was captured in Galveston, Texas in 1863. After the war he returned to Quincy and joined the Rural Masonic Lodge. He died in 1925 and was remembered in his obituary in the Quincy Patriot-Ledger for his remarkable tool chest, among his other achievements.|$|E

50|$|While Jordan {{waits to}} be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to {{temporarily}} animate Kanjar's corpse, allowing him to learn the location of Qward where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns Boodikka (Tricia Helfer) and Kilowog (Michael Madsen) that Sinestro is not what he seems. When they catch Sinestro enacting his plot, Boodikka reveals her true allegiance and incapacitates Kilowog, allowing Sinestro to escape. Jordan tricks her into destroying Kanjar's unstable energy staff, the explosion launching her into the <b>tools</b> <b>hanging</b> from the ceiling and killing her.|$|R
40|$|The University of Copenhagen (UCPH) logger {{measures}} borehole inclination, azimuth, temperature, {{diameter and}} pressure. Readings are made continuously by the logger, {{and the results}} are transmitted every 3 s to the surface. The tool remembers the maxima and minima of the diameters measured in each 3 -s period. Thus, all extremes in diameter are recorded. The calliper is designed to give a resolution of 0. 1 mm. A trade-off of this high resolution is that the tool cannot penetrate in a hole inclined more than 15 °, and that the hole wall must be reasonably smooth in order to avoid <b>hanging</b> the <b>tool</b> on its callipers. The logger uses a single conductor coaxial steel cable, 3. 1 mm in diameter. The winch has a standard 3 -phase AC motor, which is powered by a variable frequency drive. The weight of the winch, including 3 km of cable, is 400 kg, and the total power consumption is less than 2 kW. This makes it possible to deploy the logger with light aircraft (Twin Otter or helicopter) support...|$|R
40|$|Cranes {{have often}} a freely <b>hanging</b> load or <b>tool</b> that starts easily swaying. Anti-sway control {{requires}} that the angles and angular velocities of the swinging object are measured. Some cranes can also rotate the tool with a hydraulic motor, {{and in many cases}} this rotator angle should also be known. Instrumenting all three axes, two swaying and one rotating axis, with traditional rotary encoders can be challenging. We propose an extended Kalman filter based system using two inertial measurement units. This system can measure the swaying in both directions and estimate the rotator angle. Computer vision system is used as reference. The initial results show that the error is approximately 5 degrees in the rotator angle and 2 degrees in the sway angles. The observer runs at 100 Hz on an embedded microcontroller. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A {{man wearing}} a long lightly colored jacket stands with a knife {{in his right hand}} and a slab of meat in his left hand while he faces the left {{at the edge of a}} table. To the left, a second man stands with both hands on a piece of meat on the table in front of him. Both of these men have stains on their clothing and sharpening <b>tools</b> <b>hanging</b> from their waist. A third man stands wearing a clean lightly colored jacket while he holds his left hand straight out and points to the right. To the right, long rows of whole beef hang from tracks on the ceiling that starts in the right foreground and extends to the background. Parts of beef hand behind the men on the left...|$|R
5000|$|Amber's father Darwin is {{released}} from jail. He notices his {{home is a}} mess, and that there's rotten food in the fridge. Darwin asks the sheriff whether he has heard from Amber, saying that he heard around town that Amber was hanging around Tom. The sheriff is biased toward Darwin, dismissing him and telling Darwin that Amber probably left town for a while, as she had before. Summer tries {{to survive in the}} basement by antagonizing Tom. She is defiant toward Tom and his mother. When Summer and Amber are alone, Summer tells the weakened Amber to grab the <b>tools</b> <b>hanging</b> on the wall. Amber, at first, is delrious, not understanding what Summer means. Amber asks for [...] "Daddy," [...] and Summer uses that to make Amber get up and limp toward the tools. Amber, weakened, falls on the ground, hits her head on a brick, and dies.|$|R
5000|$|A cloak, worn {{over the}} tunic, {{fastened}} {{on either the}} breast or a shoulder {{with the assistance of}} a brooch. Once in place, the brooch was left attached to the garment so that the cloak was slipped over the head. The cloak, knee-length and rectangular in shape, was fastened so that it appeared to be pleated or folded. Hoods and collars began to appear in the 9th century, and around the same time, the cloak began to be curbed by the same belt that was worn over the tunic. Such belts were narrower than earlier in the Saxon period, with fewer <b>tools</b> <b>hanging</b> from them. The wrap-over coat also made an appearance during this era. This knee-length coat wrapped over the front of the body. Its sleeves were, as Owen-Crocker says, [...] "deep, with decorated cuffs which were mostly straight". For the lower classes, this coat tended to be plainer than that of the nobility.|$|R
