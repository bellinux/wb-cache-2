500|$|At {{the time}} of the opening of the {{lighthouse}} in 1841, a fixed light was emitted by an oil lamp with one wick. The intensity of the light was increased by a combination of a dioptric <b>fixed</b> <b>lens</b> and catoptric mirrors. On 25 April 1843, lighting was upgraded to improve visibility from Sandy Bay, and in 1854, the lighthouse had a reported visibility of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The second {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1895 {{and for a while}} served as the rear light in the range. It had a , timber framed corrugated galvanized iron clad tower, with a lantern and a balcony. The original optical apparatus was a 4th order <b>fixed</b> <b>lens</b> with kerosene wick burner. In 1930 the light was converted to acetylene lighting, with sun valve and flasher. By 1977 the original lens had been removed and a solar powered Tideland ML-300 electric beacon installed. [...] A pilot station was established on the foreshore nearby in 1919, and closed in 1963.|$|E

2500|$|The first proto-eyes evolved among animals [...] {{about the}} time of the Cambrian explosion. The last common {{ancestor}} of animals possessed the biochemical toolkit necessary for vision, and more advanced eyes have evolved in 96% of animal species in six of the ~35 main phyla. In most vertebrates and some molluscs, the eye works by allowing light to enter and project onto a light-sensitive panel of cells, known as the retina, {{at the rear of the}} eye. The cone cells (for colour) and the rod cells (for low-light contrasts) in the retina detect and convert light into neural signals for vision. The visual signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. Such eyes are typically roughly spherical, filled with a transparent gel-like substance called the vitreous humour, with a focusing lens and often an iris; the relaxing or tightening of the muscles around the iris change the size of the pupil, thereby regulating the amount of light that enters the eye, and reducing aberrations when there is enough light. The eyes of most cephalopods, fish, amphibians and snakes have <b>fixed</b> <b>lens</b> shapes, and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens—similar to how a camera focuses.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other {{interchangeable}} lens designs, DSLRs {{must contend with}} potential contamination of the sensor by dust particles when the lens is changed (though recent dust reduction systems alleviate this). Digital cameras with <b>fixed</b> <b>lenses</b> are not usually subject to dust from outside the camera settling on the sensor.|$|R
50|$|Some cameras with <b>fixed</b> <b>lenses</b> {{have been}} made using a simple lens, usually a {{meniscus}} lens with the convex face facing outward. In such examples the lens aperture is made small {{and in some cases}} (such as the Kodak Brownie 127 camera), the film plane is curved to reduce the impact of aberrations.|$|R

50|$|The Contaflex {{series is}} a family of 35mm leaf-shuttered SLR cameras, {{produced}} by Zeiss Ikon in the 1950s and 1960s. The name was first used in 1935 on a 35mm Twin-lens reflex camera, the Contaflex TLR also by Zeiss Ikon, the -flex part in the name referring to integral mirror for the viewfinder. The first models, the Contaflex I and II have <b>fixed</b> <b>lenses,</b> while the later models have interchangeable lenses, and eventually the Contaflexes became a camera system {{with a wide variety}} of accessories.|$|R
25|$|Unlike DSLRs, most {{digital cameras}} lack {{the option to}} change the lens. Instead, most compact digital cameras are {{manufactured}} with a zoom lens that covers {{the most commonly used}} fields of view. Having <b>fixed</b> <b>lenses,</b> they are limited to the focal lengths they are manufactured with, except for what is available from attachments. Manufacturers have attempted (with increasing success) to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of focal length on models known as superzooms, some of which offer far longer focal lengths than readily available DSLR lenses.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} type of teleconverter called a teleside converter can be mounted {{on the front of}} the camera's lens rather than between the primary lens and the camera body. These are popular with users of video cameras and bridge cameras with <b>fixed</b> <b>lenses,</b> as they represent the only way to add more reach to such a camera. They are usually afocal lenses that do not reduce the brightness of the image, but are more likely to add aberrations to the image, independent of the quality of the main lens.|$|R
