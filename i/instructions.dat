40|$|Abstract. The {{quality and}} effect of network <b>instruction</b> is largely {{affected}} by the effectiveness of network <b>instruction</b> interaction. Firstly, we explain the definition and elements of network <b>instruction</b> interaction, {{as well as the}} concept of interaction of network <b>instruction</b> platform. Then, we focus on the overall analysis of network <b>instruction</b> interaction from the horizontal and longitudinal aspects. In the horizontal analysis, we discuss the network <b>instruction</b> interaction mode in detail. In the longitudinal analysis, we integrate all the <b>instruction</b> modes to introduce the <b>instruction</b> interaction hierarchical model. As the network <b>instruction</b> platform is a key element in the implementation of network <b>instruction,</b> its interactivity greatly affecting the effectiveness of network <b>instruction</b> as well, we finally design network <b>instruction</b> interaction mode including interactive classification and overall architecture of network <b>instruction</b> platform, in order to provide information technology support to create flexible network <b>instruction</b> interaction environment...|$|R

5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple <b>instructions</b> in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple <b>instructions.</b> With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which <b>instructions</b> can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the <b>instructions</b> and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which <b>instructions</b> to execute in parallel.|$|E
