40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{alterations}} frequently {{occur in}} many cancer patients and play important mechanistic {{roles in the}} pathogenesis of cancer. Furthermore, they can modify the expression level of genes due to altered copy number in the corresponding region of the chromosome. An accumulating body of evidence supports the possibility that strong genome-wide correlation exists between DNA content and gene expression. Therefore, more comprehensive analysis is needed to quantify the relationship between <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> and gene expression. A well-designed bioinformatics tool is essential to perform this kind of integrative analysis. A few programs have already been introduced for integrative analysis. However, there are many limitations in their performance of comprehensive integrated analysis using published software because of limitations in implemented algorithms and visualization modules. Results To address this issue, we have implemented the Java-based program CHESS to allow integrative analysis of two experimental data sets: <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> and genome-wide expression profile. CHESS is composed of a <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> analysis module and an integrative analysis module. The <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> analysis module detects <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> by applying a threshold based method or SW-ARRAY algorithm and investigates whether the detected alteration is phenotype specific or not. On the other hand, the integrative analysis module measures the genomic alteration's influence on gene expression. It {{is divided into two}} separate parts. The first part calculates overall correlation between comparative genomic hybridization ratio and gene expression level by applying following three statistical methods: simple linear regression, Spearman rank correlation and Pearson's correlation. In the second part, CHESS detects the genes that are differentially expressed according to the <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> pattern with three alternative statistical approaches: Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test and Chi square test. By successive operations of two modules, users can clarify how gene expression levels are affected by the phenotype specific genomic alterations. As CHESS was developed in both Java application and web environments, it can be run on a web browser or a local machine. It also supports all experimental platforms if a properly formatted text file is provided to include the chromosomal position of probes and their gene identifiers. Conclusions CHESS is a user-friendly tool for investigating disease specific genomic alterations and quantitative relationships between those genomic alterations and genome-wide gene expression profiling. </p...|$|E

40|$|It {{is an open}} {{question}} whether in multiple myeloma (MM) bone marrow stromal cells contain <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations,</b> which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. We conducted an array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis to compare the extent of unbalanced <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> in mesenchymal stem cells from 21 myeloma patients (MM-MSCs) and 12 normal donors (ND-MSCs) after in vitro culture expansion. Whereas ND-MSCs were devoid of genomic imbalances, several non-recurrent chromosomal gains and losses (> 1 Mb size) were detected in MM-MSCs. Using real-time reverse transcription PCR, we found correlative deregulated expression for five genes encoded in regions for which genomic imbalances were detected using array-CGH. In addition, only MM-MSCs showed a specific pattern of 'hot-spot' regions with discrete (< 1 Mb) <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations,</b> some of which were confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Within MM-MSC samples, unsupervised cluster analysis did not correlate with particular clinicobiological features of MM patients. We also explored whether cytogenetic abnormalities present in myelomatous plasma cells (PCs) were shared by matching MSCs from the same patients using FISH. All MM-MSCs were cytogenetically normal for the tested <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations.</b> Therefore we cannot support a common progenitor for myeloma PCs and MSCs. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

After 8 weeks, biomarkers of hepatic functions and oxidative stress, caspase- 3 activity, and tumor suppressor protein 53 (p 53) were determined spectrophotometrically. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) was employed to determine <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> among the groups. Coexistence of aflatoxicosis and PEM significantly decreased glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, while it increased peroxidase and catalase.

40|$|Abstract Background Recurrent non-random <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> are the {{hallmarks}} of cancer and the characterization of these imbalances is critical {{to our understanding of}} tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Results We performed array-comparative genomic hybridization (A-CGH) on cDNA microarrays containing 42, 000 elements in neuroblastoma (NB). We found that only two chromosomes (2 p and 12 q) had gene amplifications and all were in the MYCN amplified samples. There were 6 independent non-contiguous amplicons (10. 4 – 69. 4 Mb) on chromosome 2, and the largest contiguous region was 1. 7 Mb bounded by NAG and an EST (clone: 757451); the smallest region was 27 Kb including an EST (clone: 241343), NCYM, and MYCN. Using a probabilistic approach to identify single copy number changes, we systemically investigated the <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> occurring in Stage 1 and Stage 4 NBs with and without MYCN amplification (stage 1 -, 4 -, and 4 +). We have not found <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> universally present in all (100 %) three subgroups of NBs. However we identified both common and unique patterns of genomic imbalance in NB including gain of 7 q 32, 17 q 21, 17 q 23 - 24 and loss of 3 p 21 were common to all three categories. Finally we confirm that the most frequent specific changes in Stage 4 + tumors were the loss of 1 p 36 with gain of 2 p 24 - 25 and they had fewer <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> compared to either stage 1 or 4 -, indicating that for this subgroup of poor risk NB requires a smaller number of genomic changes are required to develop the malignant phenotype. Conclusions cDNA A-CGH analysis is an efficient method for the detection and characterization of amplicons. Furthermore we were able to detect single copy number changes using our probabilistic approach and identified <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> specific to stage and MYCN amplification. </p...|$|R
40|$|B-cell chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (B-CLL) results in an accumulation of mature CD 5 +/CD 23 + B cells due to an uncharacterized defect in apoptotic cell death. B-CLL is not characterized by a unique recurrent <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> but rather by genomic instability giving rise frequently to several chromosomal aberrations. Besides we reported that ∼ 15 % of B-CLL patients present malignant B-cells resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis, contrary to ∼ 85 % of patients and normal human lymphocytes. Telomere length shortening is observed in radioresistant B-CLL cells. Using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and multicolour FISH, we tested whether specific chromosomal aberrations might be associated with the radioresistance of a subset of B-CLL cells and whether they are correlated with telomere shortening. In a cohort of 30 B-CLL patients, all of the radioresistant B-CLL cell samples exhibited homozygous or heterozygous deletion of 13 q 14. 3 in contrast to 52 % of the radiosensitive samples. In addition to the 13 q 14. 3 deletion, ten out of the 11 radioresistant B-cell samples had another clonal <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> such as trisomy 12, deletion 17 p 13. 1, mutation of the p 53 gene or translocations in contrast to only three out of 19 radiosensitive samples. Telomere fusions and non-reciprocal translocations, hallmarks of telomere dysfunction, are not increased in radioresistant B-CLL cells. These findings suggest (i) that the 13 q 14. 3 deletion accompanied by another chromosomal aberration is associated with radioresistance of B-CLL cells and (ii) that telomere shortening is not causative of increased clonal chromosomal aberrations in radioresistant B-CLL cells...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Intracystic {{papillary}} breast tumors {{consist of}} benign papilloma, {{carcinoma in situ}} and carcinoma with invasion. Using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, this study aimed to determine the profile of genomic alterations in these lesions and to identify novel diagnostic criteria. Methods: Ten samples of intracystic papillary tumor, which included five papillomas (Pap), three papillary carcinomas in situ (PurePC) and two papillary carcinomas with invasion (PCinv), were studied. DNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissues that were microdissected from the same formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks. Using probe intensity and genotype data from high-density oligonucleotide SNP microarrays (AffymetrixR GeneChip Genome-wide Human 5. 0), paired copy number and LOH analysis was performed using Partek Genomic Suite Software. Results: Quality control (QC) call rate, which is an index measuring {{the quality of a}} SNP microarray experiment, ranged from 70. 75 % to 91. 93 %, mean 80. 72 %. The mean total <b>genomic</b> <b>alteration</b> rate (sum of amplifications, deletions and copy-neutral loss of heterogeneity) with respect to the whole genome was 2. 87 %, 15. 4 % and 35. 3 % in Pap, PC and IDC, respectively, and was significantly different between samples (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared test, p = 0. 043). The most commonly altered regions (. 4 / 5) in papillary carcinoma were copy-neutral loss of heterogeneity at 3 p 21. 31 and 3 p 14. 2 and amplification at 20 q 13. 13. Genes altered only in invasive carcinoma included genes concerned with transcription.

40|$|Cancer is {{a disease}} of the genome. Most tumors harbor a {{constellation}} of structural <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> that may dictate their clinical behavior and treatment response. Whereas elucidating the nature and importance of these <b>genomic</b> <b>alterations</b> has been the goal of cancer biologists for several decades, ongoing global genome characterization efforts are revolutionizing both tumor biology and the optimal paradigm for cancer treatment at an unprecedented scope. The pace of advance has been empowered, in large part, through disruptive technological innovations that render complete cancer genome characterization feasible on a large scale. This article highlights cardinal biologic and clinical insights gleaned from systematic cancer genome characterization. We also discuss how the convergence of cancer genome biology, technology, and targeted therapeutics articulates a cohesive framework for the advent of personalized cancer medicine...|$|R
