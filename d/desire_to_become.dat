5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|Johnson did not {{initially}} aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major {{and on his}} <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a television commentator.

The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that {{she did have a}} fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing in}} Minor League Baseball for the Yankees organization, Virdon {{was traded to}} the Cardinals, and he made his MLB debut in 1955. That year, Virdon won the National League Rookie of the Year Award. He slumped at the {{beginning}} of the 1956 season, and {{was traded to the}} Pirates, where he spent the remainder of his playing career. A premier defensive outfielder during his playing days as a center fielder for the Cardinals and Pirates, Virdon led a strong defensive team to the 1960 World Series championship.

5|$|By {{the time}} of his 1922 {{re-election}} bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.|$|E

5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered by the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the need of a more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state. Consciousness grows {{in relation to the}} impressions each form is capable of gathering.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1932, the Finucane {{brothers}} {{were taken to}} an air show at Baldonnel and had a 10-minute flight. Brendan expressed his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a pilot, an ambition which strengthened during holiday visits to air shows at Swaythling and Eastleigh airfields. In August 1933, {{the family moved to}} New Grange Road, Cabra and Brendan started school at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School, a distinguished Roman Catholic school in North Richmond Street.

5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took its toll on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E
5|$|A youth named Guybrush Threepwood {{arrives on}} the fictional Mêlée Island™, with the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a pirate. He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who set him three trials {{that must be}} {{completed}} to become a pirate: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, finding a buried treasure, and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion. These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck, who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey IslandTM, an act {{that was meant to}} win the love of the governor Elaine Marley. Guybrush meets several characters of interest, including a local voodoo priestess, Stan the Used Boat Salesman, Carla the Sword Master, a prisoner named Otis, and Meathook, whose hands have been replaced by hooks.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} as CGS, Dannatt {{effectively}} {{retired from the}} Army, but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009. Shortly after leaving office, Dannatt was approached by David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition. Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the Shadow Cabinet once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen's Regulations, which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces. Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party, Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis. The timing of the decision, which became public in October 2009—within two months of Dannatt's effective retirement—attracted some controversy, with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces. He advised Cameron and his shadow cabinet until he resigned, shortly after the 2010 general election, stating that Cameron, by then prime minister, should turn to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a special adviser.|$|E

5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Working together, the Autobots {{and human}} {{soldiers}} manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. Sam confronts Gould as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Gould into the Pillar, electrocuting him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive {{and destroy the}} Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron {{that he will be}} replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus' right arm, and is about to execute him when Megatron intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for betraying his own principles. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.|$|E
5|$|For much of Chinese history, the {{position}} of Emperor was determined by primogeniture; {{the position}} would pass from father to first-born son upon the father's death. While Khitan succession was also kept within families, an {{emphasis was placed on}} selecting the most capable option, with all of a leader's brothers, nephews, and sons considered valid choices for succession. Khitan rulers were expected to hand over power to a paternal relative after serving a single three-year term. Abaoji signaled his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a permanent ruler at his accession in 907, securing his position by killing most of the other Khitan chieftains. Between 907 and 910 Abaoji's rule went unchallenged. It was only after 910, when Abaoji disregarded the Khitan tradition that another member of the family assume {{the position of}} Great Khan, that his rule came under direct challenge. In both 912 and 913 members of Abaoji's family, including most of his brothers, attempted armed insurrections. After the first insurrection was discovered and defeated, Abaoji pardoned the conspirators. After the second, only his brothers were pardoned, with the other conspirators suffering violent deaths. The brothers plotted additional rebellions in 917 and 918, both of which were easily crushed.|$|E
