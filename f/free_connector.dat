40|$|Developing lead <b>free</b> <b>connector</b> {{products}} involves {{at least}} two distinct steps: removing the lead from the product and ensuring the product has sufficient thermal stability. Lead is most commonly found in terminal finishes and {{has been removed from}} most thermoplastic materials used in connectors. Ensuring sufficient thermal stability requires knowledge of the thermal excursions involved in soldering and how these excursions translate into product performance metrics. For reflow soldering, we know the maximum soldering temperatures will increase by 20 to 30 C. The magnitude of this change is not large, however, the temperature value, 260 C, exceeds the melt point of many engineering thermoplastics. Since the cost of these plastics typically scales with melt temperature, an increase in thermal requirements can mean a significant cost increase. In this paper we strive to understand the fundamental response of the plastics to the transient thermal excursions involved in wave soldering. FEM simulations demonstrate the thermal gradients that exist during these processes. These results can be used to understand the heat transfer and then to engineer the products to ensure reliability. Wave solder process simulation shows that the pin to plastic interface resides at a temperature very near to that of the solder. Connector terminals, made from copper based alloys, often have very high thermal diffusivities, increasing heat flow from the solder pot into the plastic. FEM results are compared to experimental results from lab and production manufactured testing of solderable interconnects. A test method for evaluating plastic performance in wave solder applications is proposed...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} H2S {{sets were}} essentially prototype units that were hand-built to equip the Pathfinder Force with all possible speed. Among the many {{problems with the}} rushed service entry was that the developers were forced to use existing plug-and-socket designs to connect the various units of the complete set together. There were no bulkhead mounting male connectors available at this time, and consequently many of the male <b>free</b> <b>connectors</b> {{at the ends of}} cable runs carried exposed lethal voltages. While installations of the prototypes progressed, work was underway on a true production version, the Mk. II, which would go on to be the most numerous version built. This was largely identical to the Mk. I's with the exception of various packaging and electronics details intended to make them easier to build.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacterial virus phi 29 genomic DNA is {{packaged}} into a procapsid shell {{with the}} aid of a motor containing a 12 -subunit connector channel and a hexameric pRNA (packaging RNA) ring. The wide end, or the C-terminus, of the cone-shaped connector is embedded within the procapsid shell, whereas the narrow end, or N-terminus, extends outside of the procapsid, providing a binding location for pRNA. Recently, we have reported the mechanism of in vivo assembly of an ellipsoid nanoparticle with seven connectors through an interaction among a peptide tag. Here we report the formation of a similar nanoparticle in vitro via the addition of DNA or RNA oligos to <b>connector</b> proteins. <b>Free</b> <b>connectors</b> guided by one or two copies of oligonucleotides were assembled into a rosette structure containing 60 subunits of reengineered proteins. The number of oligonucleotides within the particle is length-dependent but sequence-independent. Reversible shifting between the 12 - and 60 -subunit nanoparticles (between individual connectors and rosette structures, respectively) was demonstrated by the alternative addition of oligonucleotides and the treatment of ribonuclease, suggesting a potential application as a switch or regulator in nanobiotechnology. This advancement allows for a simple method to produce multivalent nanoparticles that contain five 12 -unit nanoparticles with defined structure and stoichiometry. That is, it will be possible to assemble nanoparticles in vitro with the combination of 60 assortments of ligands, tags, therapeutic drugs, and diagnostic moieties for multivalent delivery or enhancement of signal detection in nanotechnological and nanomedicinal applications...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{its many}} effects, the law {{established}} an independent public authority, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, {{also known as}} the Massachusetts Health Connector. The Connector acts as an insurance broker to offer free, highly subsidized and full-price private insurance plans to residents, including through its web site. [...] As such {{it is one of the}} models of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges. The 2006 Massachusetts law successfully covered approximately two-thirds of the state's then-uninsured residents, half via federal-government-paid-for Medicaid expansion (administered by MassHealth) and half via the <b>Connector's</b> <b>free</b> and subsidized network-tiered health care insurance for those not eligible for expanded Medicaid. Relatively few Massachusetts residents used the Connector to buy full-priced insurance.|$|R
50|$|An {{extension}} of the line from Victoria Square / Tarndanyangga down King William Street then along North Terrace opened in October 2007. A further extension to Port Road, Thebarton {{and then to a}} terminus at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre on Port Road (Hindmarsh) opened in December 2009. The extended line now has stops adjacent to key city points, including Rundle Mall, the Adelaide railway station and the City West campus of the University of South Australia. A plan to create a city loop by extending the line through either Morphett or Gray Streets, Currie Street, and Grote Street to rejoin the line in Victoria Square / Tarndanyangga has also been proposed. If this goes ahead, this could replace the City Loop and <b>Connector</b> <b>free</b> buses, which are currently in operation.|$|R
