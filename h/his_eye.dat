5|$|Informant Michael Marks awakens in a {{room with}} a spike-filled mask locked to his neck. A {{videotape}} informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> to obtain the key, which has been surgically implanted and sealed behind it. He sets off the timer and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had to keep}} <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on his {{teammate}} and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable. LeMond would keep the yellow jersey {{to the end of}} the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership. LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.|$|E

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E

5|$|Back in South Park, Chef rallies {{the townspeople}} (in {{a parody of}} Braveheart) to fight the genetically {{engineered}} turkeys; humorously, one of the turkeys also rallies the other turkeys to fight the townspeople. A massive battle ensues in which Kenny is killed (<b>his</b> <b>eye</b> is poked and gouged out), but eventually the South Park residents kill all the turkeys and claim victory. The FBI returns Cartman to South Park and takes Marvin home, but not before he brings {{the bodies of the}} dead turkeys back to Ethiopia for everyone to eat. Marvin is then hailed as a hero by his people while they pass Struthers being bound and gagged over a fire.|$|E
5|$|By now, Chapman {{had retired}} as a player in {{first-class}} football, having played his last match against Watford in January 1909, but filled the gap he left, as well as showing <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> for spotting talent, by signing players such as future England international Fanny Walden. As Southern League champions, Northampton contested and lost the 1909 FA Charity Shield, 2–0 to Newcastle United, and although they did not win the Southern League title again during Chapman's time as manager, they {{finished in the top}} four in each of the following three seasons. Additionally, they proved their mettle in the FA Cup against First Division sides, knocking out The Wednesday and taking Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United to replays, losing 1–0 both times.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E

5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Pei {{boarded a}} boat and sailed to San Francisco, then {{traveled}} by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by {{the high level of}} drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Chatwin {{moved to}} London {{to begin work}} as a porter in the Works of Art {{department}} at Sotheby's. Chatwin was ill-suited for this job, which included dusting objects that had been kept in storage. Sotheby's moved him to a junior cataloger position working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. This position enabled him to develop <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> for art, and he quickly became known {{for his ability to}} discern forgeries. His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.|$|E

5|$|Laurie was {{supposed}} to wear a monocle as Lt. George, the character's second incarnation, but eventually decided against it after it kept falling out of <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> Laurie reprised the role of Prince George in the Christmas special Blackadder's Christmas Carol, and portrayed a new character, Lord Pigmot, set in the distant future. He also appeared in the millennium special , playing the Roman Consul Georgius and the modern day Major George Bufton-Tufton, The Viscount Bufton-Tufton. Although no new series or specials were made, the creators of the series have commented on various proposals over the years; one possibility was a film in which the main characters return as a 1960s' rock band, with George playing the guitar and keyboard. Curtis later said Laurie's international success with House would make a new instalment difficult.|$|E
5|$|McGee's first post-TUF {{fight was}} against UFC veteran, Ryan Jensen at UFC 121. Early {{in the first}} round, McGee {{was hit with a}} stiff shot that dropped him and later {{suffered}} a minor cut below <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> In the second round, Jensen began to visibly tire and after being hit, began to bleed from the nose. McGee won the second round after a takedown just before the bell. In the third round, McGee successfully executed a takedown and a full mount, where he secured an arm triangle choke to force the tapout at 1:21 of the final round.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{prepares for}} an acting {{job in a}} {{laboratory}} safety video that was arranged by his talent agent, Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). The directors continuously have {{to talk him out}} of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, since he has an aversion towards anything being shot into <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Carlos Kirchner {{was born}} on 25 February 1950, in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, a federal {{territory}} at the time. His father, Néstor Carlos Kirchner Sr., met the Chilean María Juana Ostoić by telegraphy. They had three children: Néstor, Alicia, and María Cristina. Néstor {{was part of the}} third generation of Kirchners living in the city. As a result of pertussis, he developed strabismus at an early age; however, he refused medical treatment because he considered <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> part of his self-image. When Kirchner was in high school he briefly considered becoming a teacher, but poor diction hampered him; he was also unsuccessful at basketball.|$|E
5|$|O'Gara {{received}} his first Lions call-up {{for the tour}} to Australia in 2001. He played in four tour games, against Western Australia, NSW Waratahs, NSW Country Districts and ACT Brumbies, scoring 26 points overall.

In the game against NSW Waratahs, O'Gara was involved in an off the ball incident with Duncan McRae, which resulted in O'Gara needing eight stitches around <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and McRae being sent off and later banned for seven weeks. After the game, then Lions coach Graham Henry called the match ‘a bad day for rugby’.|$|E
