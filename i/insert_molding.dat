If the insert and the TPV are compatible materials, a melt bond occurs at the interface between the two materials.

The interfacial adhesive property between the inserted part and an injected polymer was investigated. The glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) with various adhesive lengths of 0, 5, 10 and 15 mm was prepared as the inserted part. Polypropylene was injected to the mold. The effects of the inserted parts surface roughness, pre-heated the inserted parts and the barrel temperature on the adhesive property of GF/PP-PP injection molded were studied. It was found that interfacial adhesive property of GF/PP-PP <b>insert</b> injection <b>molded</b> increased according with increasing of surface roughness, pre-heated the insert part and increasing the barrel temperature. In addition, the effect of vent barrel on the adhesive property was evaluated.

50|$|Injection {{molding machine}} molds can be {{fastened}} {{in either a}} horizontal or vertical position. The majority of machines are horizontally oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applications such as <b>insert</b> <b>molding,</b> allowing the machine {{to take advantage of}} gravity. Some vertical machines also don't require the mold to be fastened. There are many ways to fasten the tools to the platens, the most common being manual clamps (both halves are bolted to the platens); however hydraulic clamps (chocks are used to hold the tool in place) and magnetic clamps are also used.

40|$|Abstract. Polymer microstructures {{are used}} {{more and more}} in many fields. Hot {{embossing}} is one of molding processing to achieve micro polymer components. In this paper, bulk metallic glass was selected as mold material to fabricate <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> of micro hot embossing. Traditional UV-lithography and ICP-etching were used to achieve micro features on silicon wafer. And then, micro features were transferred from silicon wafer to bulk metallic glass <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> above its glass transition temperature. Finally, applied bulk metallic glass <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> to replicate polymer microstructure with hot embossing.

30|$|Hot {{embossing}} {{consists of}} heating a polymer substrate above its glass transition temperature, pressing a <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> into the polymer substrate {{to transfer the}} features, cooling the substrate and <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> while maintaining the embossing pressure, and separating the <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> from the polymer substrate (Matthew and David 2011; Song et al. 2008 a). Compared with microinjection molding, hot embossing offers advantages such as low operation cost, process simplicity, and easy mold exchange as well as replicating structures with a lower internal residual stress (Guo et al. 2007 a, b; Song et al. 2008 b; Worgull et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|Quality {{inspection}} of ultra precise <b>mold</b> <b>inserts</b> is conducted outside the manufacturing machine by using phase-shifting interferometers (PSI). Reworking or a local correction of form deviations is difficult, because the <b>mold</b> <b>inserts</b> {{have to be}} repositioned in the machine tool. A promising way to overcome this problem is the machine-integration of the measurement system. But due to the sensitivity of PSI methods a direct integration into the machine tool is possible only to a limited extend. A FFT-based measurement technique was developed with reduced sensitivity. It was applied in a injection molding machine for form testing of a clamped <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> with 80 degrees C process temperature...|$|R

50|$|Plugged tooth coils are {{frequently}} {{used in a}} star-shaped stator design where a final ring or yoke is mounted after the assembly of the coils. Inside slotted stator laminations can also be fitted with plugged tooth coils. But in that case, fill factor losses can be registered due to the plug-in direction from the inside to the outside. Conical windings are only possible and beneficial, if the plug-in direction is from the outside to the inside. As {{for the type of}} insulation, it is possible - as with the classical single teeth - to work with paper insulations or insulating end plates. If <b>insert</b> <b>molding</b> is applied with a star-shaped package, it is not referred to as plugged tooth coils anymore because of the necessary direct winding with a needle winding system, flyer winding technique or linear winding technique.Plugged tooth coils eventually require at least two contact points per coil, just as the single teeth. Toothed chains of a phase connected in series are rarely produced since, compared with the already difficult assembly of phase-wise wound T-segments, they will be followed by further assembly movements (pushing onto the stator pack) and the changing length ratios of the connecting wires between the coil sections of a phase. Therefore, two cut-and-clamp contacts per coil {{are frequently}} used for plugged tooth coils which finally reach into a control card or a lead frame via pin-like forms of the contacts.|$|E

40|$|Creating highly {{articulated}} miniature structures requires {{assembling a}} large number of small parts. This is a very challenging task and increases cost of mechanical assemblies. <b>Insert</b> <b>molding</b> presents the possibility of creating a highly articulated structure in a single molding step. This can be accomplished by placing multiple metallic bearings in the mold and injecting plastic on top of them.

40|$|Increasing {{requirements}} for energy and resource efficiency promote {{the usage of}} lightweight materials. Moreover, hybrid parts made of different materials can provide {{a wider range of}} properties than parts from a single material. One of today’s challenges in production technology is the development of efficient manufacturing methods. Within the scope of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries”, the so called In-Mould-Metal-Spraying (IMMS) is being developed for manufacturing of metal/plastics hybrid parts. It is based upon the transfer of thermally sprayed coatings from the <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> to the plastic coating carrier during injection molding. A key factor of the IMMS process is the adjustment of the coating bond strength to the <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> for a residue-free transfer. The surface topography and therefore the surface pretreatment of the <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> are important for the IMMS process. In the preliminary study, a surface topography fabricated by glass bead blasting has enabled the transfer of wire arc sprayed Zn-coatings. How-ever, further investigations indicated limitations regarding the <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> material and local coating residuals on the <b>mold</b> <b>insert</b> surface after coating transfer. For the close investigation of this effect, laser structuring is chosen as surface pretreatment method because of its capability of fabricating freely selectable, defined surface topographies. Surface structures in micron range overlaid by LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures) in submicron range can be prepared using ultrashort pulse lasers. Different surface structures produced by regularly drilling on the surface and variation of the drilling diameter, depth and distance, which lead to the variation of the coating bond strength, are investigated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to address a {{manufacturing}} problem related to the technology of Film <b>Insert</b> <b>Molding</b> (FIM) {{for the production of}} vehicle interior parts. The problem occurs in the first stages of the process during the production of the film, prior to injection molding. The film was distorted in some cases. When the distortion of the film was high, the film was not sticking to the mold properly, showing a tendency to pop out. This led to pinching of the film in the mold which caused two main failures: flashing of the resin and ripping of the film. A particular emphasis was put toward the process stages of forming and UV curing, that were identified through a root causes analysis, to induce major distortion of the shape of the film. With the use of a laser scanner and analysis software: Geomagic control X, it was possible to compare the shape of manufactured parts to the original CAD model containing the nominal shape of the film. The analysis was based on two full-factorial plans, one for forming of the film and one for UV curing it. Using analysis of the variance (ANOVA) of the deviations, it was possible to detect the influence of the factors on particular points of the surface of the film. It was found that parameters related to forming: dwell time and temperature, had a significant influence on the deviation of the film, the first accounting for about 50 % of the change in deviation. Once the forming parameters were set to achieve the lowest deviation, parameters related to UV curing: UV oven conveyor speed and ink size, did not have an high influence on the distortion of the film...|$|E
