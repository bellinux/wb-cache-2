5|$|The {{conditions}} on Sunday, 29 November were extremely unsettled. There were {{a series of}} thunderstorm cells that formed {{early in the morning}} — despite it being more common for thunderstorms to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> in the south-east Queensland region.

He was also told to send one of his units—the South Staffordshires (which was not complete and was awaiting its full complement {{of men in the}} second lift)—to Arnhem to help with the advance to the bridge. The South Staffords departed in the morning and linked up with the 1st Parachute Battalion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
2500|$|BBC One has {{traditionally}} been the home of children's television: Blue Peter had been broadcast on the channel prior to the Children's BBC strand, and sections such as the pre-school Watch with Mother being transmitted on the channel for several decades. This became more pronounced with the launch of Children's BBC, later renamed [...] "CBBC". This new strand was broadcast primarily on BBC One <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons,</b> as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings also such as Going Live! and Live & Kicking, each lasting two to three hours. <b>The</b> launch <b>in</b> 2002 of dedicated digital channels for this content —the CBBC Channel and CBeebies—did not affect this provision. Combined with BBC Two, the channel broadcast 2,195 hours of children's programmes in 2010, mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoons</b> on weekdays. Saturday morning children's programming moved to BBC Two in 2006 following a three-month trial.|$|R

5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early morning}} and return <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E
5|$|The {{festival of}} Purim celebrates the {{deliverance}} of the Jewish {{people from the}} plot of Haman to annihilate them in the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire, {{as described in the}} Book of Esther. It is a day of rejoicing and merriment, on which children, and many adults, wear costumes.

5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E

After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here they dropped their remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the lorries blocked the road and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E

5|$|Méliès's film studio, {{which he}} had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass walls and a glass ceiling to let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June {{the royal}} {{government}} and the remaining rebels, who were unsatisfied with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls.

5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E

What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
