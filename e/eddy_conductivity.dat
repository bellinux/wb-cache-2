It {{has been found that}} the primary reason why nickel-base superalloys, which are often used in the most critical gas-turbine engine components, lend themselves easily for eddy current residual stress assessment lies in their favorable electro-elastic behavior, namely that the parallel stress coefficient of the <b>eddy</b> current <b>conductivity</b> has a large negative value while the normal coefficient is smaller but also negative. As a result, the average stress coefficient is also large and negative, therefore the essentially isotropic compressive plane state of stress produced by most surface treatments causes a significant increase in conductivity parallel to the surface.

40|$|Abstract: Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} to illustrate that there exists a unique window of opportunity for eddy current NDE of residual stress in surface-treated nickel-base superalloys. In light of its frequency-dependent penetration depth, the measurement of <b>eddy</b> current <b>conductivity</b> has been suggested as a possible means to allow the nondestructive evaluation of subsurface residual stresses in surface-treated components. This technique {{is based on the}} so-called electro-elastic effect, i. e., the stress-dependence of the electrical conductivity. In contrast with most other materials, surface-treated nickel-base superalloys exhibit an apparent increase in electrical conductivity at increasing inspection frequencies. This observation by itself indicates that in these materials the measured conductivity change is dominated by residual stress effects, since both surface roughness and increased dislocation density are known to decrease rather than increase the conductivity and the presence of crystallographic texture does not affect the electrical conductivity of these materials, which crystallize in cubic symmetry. Experimental results indicate that the frequency-dependent apparent <b>eddy</b> current <b>conductivity</b> of shot-peened nickel-base superalloys can be used to estimate both the absolute level of the sub-surface stress and the penetration depth of the compressive layer. The eddy current results correlate well with residual stress profiles obtained by destructive X-ray diffraction measurements both before and after partial thermal relaxation.

40|$|A S-year {{series of}} summer {{temperature}} profiles {{was used to}} calculate the coefficient of <b>eddy</b> <b>conductivity</b> in a small (20. 1 ha) mountain lake. The relatively high value obtained (6. 22 ~ 10 ~ ’ g cm-l set-I) prompted us to evaluate the role of direct solar heating in the hypolimnion using data on total daily solar radiation, the spectral curve of sunlight, and the light transmission properties of the lake water. It was found that an estimated 65 - 85 s of the heating in the upper hypolimnion could be accounted for by direct solar heating. It is postulated that in Castle Lake direct solar heating rather than turbulent mixing is responsible for the shape of the hypolimnetic thermal profile. LNTRODUCTION Limnologists have often noted that the vertical temperature profiles of lakes show a regular series of changes during the summer heating period. As time progresses, the epilimnion becomes thicker, the gradient in the metalimnion becomes steeper, and tem-peratures increase at all depths. This is evi-dent in profiles from Castle Lake, California, taken on three dates in the early summer of 1963 (Fig. 1).

Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the conductivity variation resulting from volumetric inhomogeneities in as-forged engine alloys do not display significant frequency dependence.

The surface atmospheric conditions which drive the circulation, both mechanically and thermally, are prescribed and depend on latitude only. The numerical integration is done in two phases.

40|$|Shot-peened nickel-base {{superalloys}} exhibit 1 – 2 % {{increase in}} apparent eddy current conduc-tivity (AECC), {{which can be}} exploited for nondestructive residual stress assessment. Experi-mental evidence indicates that the excess AECC {{is due in part}} to elastic strains, i. e., residual stress, and in part to plastic strains, i. e., cold work. The very fact that the conductivity in-creases rather than decreases was originally thought to indicate that there was no significant cold work contribution to the observed AECC increase. This assumption was also supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results on fully relaxed specimens showing that the cold work in-duced widening of the diffraction beam only partially vanishes when both the residual stress and the AECC completely disappear due to thermal relaxation. However, we show in this paper that assuming that the conductivity change is entirely due to residual stress via the piezoresistivity of the material could result in an unacceptable overestimation of the magni-tude of the compressive residual stress. Therefore, we investigated the different mechanisms through which cold work could influence the AECC in surface-treated nickel-base super-alloys. It was found that neither the magnetic susceptibility nor the piezoresistivity of the material is affected significantly by cold work up to 50 % plastic strain level, but the electri-cal conductivity does substantially increase due to microstructural changes. Based on these observations, we suggest that in future research the complex variations caused by cold work should be modeled by at least two main types of cold work parameters rather than by a single one in order to properly account for the otherwise contradictory effects of plastic deformation on <b>eddy</b> current <b>conductivity</b> and XRD measurements...|$|R

The use of a 3 -D CFD model revealed heat transfer effects due to flow streamlines and <b>eddy</b> <b>conductivity,</b> and provided insight into the two-dimensional nature of the wall heat flux.

However, it was found that the predicted heat flux was largely independent of the grid resolution, as long as the near-wall region was well resolved. Finally, a single-element injector model was constructed to explore the sensitivity of the peak heat flux and combustion chamber length to the circumferential and radial spacing of injector elements in the outer row of a multi-element injector. Many cases, including the baseline case, had a recirculation region that was oriented such that the outer shear layer was directed at the combustion chamber wall, resulting in a large peak heat flux near the injector face.

40|$|The local {{convective}} {{thermal transfer}} from a spherical surface {{in an air}} stream was experimentally investigated by measuring the temperature distribution in the air stream surrounding the sphere. The investigation {{was carried out in}} an air stream of known turbulence level at bulk velocities of 8 and 16 feet per second using two different half-inch spheres. The local thermal flux over the spherical surface was calculated from the detailed measurements of temperature distribution in the air close to the surface. These results are compared with available experimental results obtained at higher velocities with larger spheres. In the forward region of the sphere from the stagnation point up to an angle of about 80 [degrees], the experimental radial temperature distributions are correlated empirically in terms of the displacement thickness of the thermal boundary layer. Over this region the experimental and correlated results are compared in terms of the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers with the results of theoretical analyses based on the laminar boundary layer theory. There is satisfactory agreement with the theoretical results obtained by the method of Drake and the application of the solutions of Eckert. The integrated values of thermal transfer are in agreement with the gross values obtained from simultaneous over-all measurements. There is also fair agreement between the integrated results and available published information on the gross thermal transfer from a sphere. A detailed knowledge of the distribution of temperature, thermal flux, and the pressure gradients associated with the turbulent flow of fluids is of importance in creating a background of experimental facts from which it is possible to predict the transfer characteristics for a particular physical situation. Special methods and equipment employed in the measurement and control of temperature and thermal flux in an investigation of thermal transfer in turbulent gas streams are described. Measurements of the thermal flux and the pressure gradient are presented {{as a function of the}} imposed temperature distribution and macroscopic flow rate. They extend from gross velocities of 10 to 90 feet per second and to average temperature gradients as high as 1000 [degrees] F. per foot. The results represent a contribution to the knowledge of the shear and the thermal flux associated with the nonisothermal flow of air between parallel plates. As expected, the thermal transfer coefficients for nonuniform transfer are larger than those obtained in this work under conditions of uniform transfer. The region near the boundary of a turbulently flowing fluid accounts for the greater part of the resistance to thermal transfer to or from the stream. An understanding of the influence of conditions of flow upon the temperature distribution near the boundary of turbulently flowing streams is required in order to permit the recent advances in fluid mechanics to be applied to the prediction of thermal transfer in steady flow. The detailed temperature distribution near the boundary of a turbulent air stream flowing between parallel plates was measured at gross velocities from 10 to 90 feet per second and for average temperature gradients as high as 1000 [degrees] F. per foot. The corresponding value of thermal flux was determined directly, and from these primary measurements the temperature gradient and <b>eddy</b> <b>conductivity</b> were established as a function of flow conditions.

Recently we obtained an asymptotic {{solution to the}} katabatic flow assuming {{the validity of the}} WKB method, which solves the fourth-order governing equation coupling the momentum and heat transfer. The WKB approximation requires that eddy diffusivity may vary only gradually compared to the calculated quantities, i. e., potential temperature and wind speed. This means that the scale height for eddy diffusivity must be higher than that for the calculated potential temperature and wind speed. The ratio between the maximum versus the mean eddy diffusivity should be less than that for the scale heights of the diffusivity versus the calculated quantities temperature and wind). Here we justify (a posteriori) the WKB method independently based on two arguments: (i) a scaling argument and (ii) a philosophy behind a higher-order closure turbulence modeling. Both the eddy diffusivity maximum and the level of the relevant maximum turbulent kinetic energy are above the strongest part of the nearsurface inversion and the low-level jet which is required for the WKB validity.

An attempt was made to assess the validity of the coefficients as follows. In the clinolimnion, the average values of the coefficients were similar when computed either on the basis of temperature change with depth and time or on the basis of the heat transport equation. A satisfactory correlation was obtained bctwccn the coefficients and a function of shearing stress (velocity gradient) and resistance to mixing (stability). The cocfficicnts decreased with increasing depth in the epilimnion, became minimal and constant in the metalimnion and increased in the hypolim-nion. Oxygen consmnption exceeded oxygen production below 5. 5 m and was maximal just below the cuphotic zone (9 - 12 m). Oxygen consumption was minimal in the metalimnion and incrcascd in the hypolimnion. An oxygen concentration maximum was correlated with the mctalimnetic oxygen consumption minimum. Euphotic zone oxygen production equiva-lent to dysphotic zone oxygen consumption amounted to 1. 01 g Oz/m 2 /day. Euphotic zone respiration would have been 1. 21 g Oz/m 2 /day if it proceeded at the same rate as in the 9 - to 12 -m stratum. On the basis of the ratios, oxygen consumption/chlorophyll and oxygen consumption/seston cuphotic zone respiration amounted to 1. 44 g Oz/m 2 /day and 2. 01 g Oa/m 2 /day respectively. Gross production values then would range between 2. 22 g Oz/m 2 / day and 3. 02 g 0,/m 2 /day. The latter value was extremely close to black and clear bottle estimates of 3. 00 g 02 /m 2 /day...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of the temperature and velocity distribution in the two-dimensional wake of a heated cylinder are presented. Measurements of the temperature distribution {{on the surface of}} the cylinder for various rates of heat dissipation are also included, and these data are correlated in the form of dimensionless parameters. The cylinder was 12. 15 inches long and 0. 190 inch in outside diameter and was placed midway between the upper and lower parallel walls of a horizontal conduit of rectangular cross section through which air flowed normal to the cylinder. The walls, which were spaced 0. 75 inch apart, were independently maintained at desired temperatures. In one series of {{measurements of}} the temperature and velocity distribution in the wake the rate of heat dissipation from the cylinder was maintained at a constant value of 5. 42 watts per inch length of the cylinder for Reynolds numbers of 4, 270, 7, 630, 15, 200, and 26, 900 based on the free cross-section area of the conduit. In another series of measurements at a Reynolds number of 15, 200 the rate of heat dissipation from the cylinder was maintained at 1. 70 watts per inch and 3. 20 watts per inch. In each of the above cases the temperature of the walls of the conduit was maintained at 100 [degrees]F, identical to the bulk temperature of the entering air. In addition measurements at a Reynolds number of 15, 200 were made with the entering air at a temperature of 100 [degrees]F, the upper wall at 130 [degrees]F, the lower wall at 70 [degrees]F, and a rate heat dissipation of about 5. 43 watts per inch. Point values of temperature and velocity were obtained as a function of position in the wake of the cylinder. From these data values of <b>eddy</b> <b>conductivity</b> and eddy viscosity were calculated. Analysis of the data on the basis of Prandtl's momentum transfer theory and Taylor's vorticity transfer theory is included. The results are given in tabular form, and a number of graphical presentations of the data are included...|$|E

CO; 2 A numerical model of a 6 -level, baroclinic ocean with a fiat bottom and a regular coast line extending from 51. 25 S to 48. 75 N is integrated over 125 years of simulated time using a finite-difference analog of the primitive equations. The surface atmospheric conditions which drive the circulation, both mechanically and thermally, are prescribed and depend on latitude only. The numerical integration is done in two phases. In the first phase (100 years), the temperature is predicted from the complete thermal energy equation, while the equations of horizontal motion are linear and the vertical mean current is constant in time. In the second phase (25 years), the complete primitive equations are used, and the coefficients of eddy viscosity and <b>eddy</b> <b>conductivity</b> are reduced. Integration of the first phase produces western boundary currents in both hemispheres, a surface countercurrent at 7 N, an eastward undercurrent at the equator, and a narrow band of cold surface water along the equator which is maintained by a narrow belt of strong vertical velocities {{of the order of}} 200 cm day- 1 {{at the bottom of the}} first layer. However, the calculated undercurrent and western boundary current speeds are only 253 as strong as those observed, and in the equatorial region the calculated thermocline is too deep. The most interesting differences in the results of the two phases occur in equatorial regions where the eastward transport by the model undercurrent nearly doubled in the second phase. By comparing the undercurrent transport predicted by Gill's theory, with that obtained in the first and second phases, respectively, it is shown that density stratification increases the eastward transport by a factor of 4 while increased baroclinity and nonlinear effects increase the transport an additional 753 over the stratified case. A calculation of the different modes of poleward heat transport in the second phase shows that the mean meridional circulation transports most of the heat, and that the eddies in both the vertical shear current and the vertical mean current transport heat equatorward. An analysis of the energy balance in the second phase of the model shows that, in the mean, kinetic energy is transformed into potential energy and that this is related to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer in the vicinity of the western boundary. There is also a positive, though small, transformation from the kinetic energy of the vertical shear flow to the kinetic energy of the vertical mean flow, which is related to the relatively large lateral eddy viscosity required by the coarse grid...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} of {{the tissue}} can be measured via eddy current sensor {{and it can be}} used to distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy tissue. The conductivity of healthy and cancerous tissues is different due to the strong correlation between necrosis in tumor and the associated membrane breakdown [10]. Three types of similar electronic set ups with different components based on eddy current technique  were investigated to measure electrical properties of tissue in vitro as well as test and evaluate the electronic set ups. This papre describes new application of eddy current sensor, one of basics of non destructive testing, NDT, in biomedical engineering. For medical purposes, conductivity of tissue or tissue equivalent samples is evaluated and compared with other specimens via sensor based on eddy current techniques. To reach the aim, the electronic set ups are evaluated via measurements on targets with predetermined <b>conductivities.</b> <b>Eddy</b> current was induced in targets by magnetic field of the coil and that eddy current generated a secondary magnetic field which opposed the primary magnetic field and affect the inductance and consequently the impedance of the coil. The measured output (RMS-value or its amplitude) from bridge circuit is correlated to the change in coil's inductance and impedance and those are proportional to change in conductivity of the targets. Prominent sensor characteristics such as quality factor, inductance and operating frequency considered to be high enough and desired sensor dimensions are assessed...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 79 - 88). Due to the switching of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gradient fields, electric fields are induced in imaged subjects which {{give rise to}} `subject eddy currents'. The feasibility of low-frequency conductivity imaging based on measuring the magnetic field (subject eddy field) due to subject eddy currents is investigated within the frame of two main goals. First goal is to understand whether conductivity reconstruction is possible provided that subject eddy fields are accurately measured. Regarding this goal, the inverse problem of obtaining conductivity distribution from subject eddy fields is formulated as a convection-reaction equation and a conductivity reconstruction algorithm is developed. In the simulations, successful conductivity reconstructions are obtained pointing the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The second goal is to understand the fidelity by which subject eddy fields must be measured for accurately reconstructing conductivity. For measuring subject eddy fields, a pulse sequence is developed by which the contribution of subject eddy fields to MR phase images is determined. It is found that this contribution cannot be measured with an uncertainty suffciently low for accurate conductivity reconstruction. Furthermore, some artifacts other than random noise are observed in the measured phases which are modeled by considering the e ects of magnetic fields due to MRI system imperfections during readout. For feasible subject <b>eddy</b> current based <b>conductivity</b> imaging, it is required that the span of the phase accumulated by subject eddy fields is increased, and the mentioned artifacts are eliminated from the phase measurements. For the first requirement, the state-of-the-art gradient systems are evaluated and also a multi-spin-echo pulse sequence is developed. This pulse sequence is analyzed by using the extended phase graph framework. For the second requirement, {{the possibility of using}} geometric distortion correction methods are evaluated. It is found that, if the multi-spin-echo pulse sequence is used in small-sized preclinical MRI scanners which have extremely high gradient fields, the span of accumulated phase can be suffciently increased for the feasibility. On the other hand, it is found that the geometric distortions cannot be corrected to the degree that the level of artifacts becomes suffciently low for the feasibility. by Ömer Faruk Oran. Ph.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Data {{from the}} Surveyor 1968 Spring cruise {{were used to}} study the {{vertical}} distribution of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, apparent oxygen utilization, pH, alkalinity, specific alkalinity and percent saturation of calcite in two sections, one along 162 °W from 35 °N to 45 °N and the other along 180 °W from 35 °N to 50 °N. Data from this cruise and additional data from the Surveyor 1968 Fall cruise, YALOC 66 cruise (summer) (Barstowetal,, 1968) and Boreas cruise (winter, 1966) (SIO reports, 1966) were used to study the distribution of salinity, temperature, apparent oxygen utilization, preformed phosphate and depth on the sigma-t surfaces of 26. 8 and 27. 3 in an area between 35 °N and 52 °N and 162 °W and 155 °E. In both sections the vertical distribution of the physico-chemical parameters is such that in general {{there is a tendency}} for the isograms to slope upward from south to north following the same trend of the sigma-t surfaces. This indicates that mixing and advection along the sigma-t surfaces play an important role on the distribution of these parameters. AOU data from YALOC 66 cruise (summer) compared to that from Surveyor 1968 Spring cruise suggest that aeration by mixing, <b>eddy</b> diffusivity and <b>conductivity</b> takes place to more than 500 meters depth at about 50 °N. It also suggests that the changes of organic primary production at the euphotic zone during different seasons of the year may affect to a great extent the AOU distribution on the 26. 8 sigma-t surface and to a very small extent on the 27. 3 sigma-t surface. The direction of flow suggested by the AOU distribution on the 26. 8 and 27. 3 sigma-t surfaces was compared to that indicated by the acceleration potential contours on the S[subscript t] = 125 cl/ton and S[subscript t] = 80 cl/ton surfaces drawn by Reid (1965). The disagreements were explained in terms of mixing and possible gradients of primary production at the sea surface. On the 26. 8 sigma-t surface a southward flow connecting the westward flow south of the Aleutian chain and the eastward flow farther south, between 175 °E and 180 °W is suggested by the AOU distribution but not by the acceleration potential contours. If the circulation pattern at this density surface is similar to that at the sea surface, this linkage is very likely to be real...|$|R
