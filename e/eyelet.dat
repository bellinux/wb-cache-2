25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: grasping the <b>eyelet</b> of the fly, and rotating the <b>eyelet</b> toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the <b>eyelet</b> directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. Large trout can be grasped gently and forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|E

25|$|The set of nine {{campaign}} stars {{was designed}} by the Royal Mint engravers. The stars all have a ring suspender that passes through an <b>eyelet</b> formed above the uppermost point of the star.

25|$|The Kimberley Star was six-pointed, {{with a ball}} on {{each point}} and struck in silver, {{to fit into a}} 46 millimetres {{diameter}} circle. Two Kimberley Stars were struck in gold. The star is attached to the suspender by a ring, which passes through an <b>eyelet</b> formed in the uppermost point-ball of the star. The suspension is in two parts, a decorated bar with an <b>eyelet</b> on the reverse for the suspender ring to pass through and a plain bar {{at the top of the}} ribbon with a brooch-pin on the reverse.|$|E
25|$|Another kind of {{compound}} eye, {{found in}} males of Order Strepsiptera, employs {{a series of}} simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina. Several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye, {{which is similar to}} the 'schizochroal' compound eyes of some trilobites. Because each <b>eyelet</b> is a simple eye, it produces an inverted image; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image. Because the aperture of an <b>eyelet</b> is larger than the facets of a compound eye, this arrangement allows vision under low light levels.|$|E
25|$|During Ottoman rule, Acre {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role in the region via smaller autonomous sheikhdoms. Towards the end of the 18th century Acre revived under the rule of Zahir al-Umar, the Arab ruler of the Galilee, who made the city capital of his autonomous sheikhdom. Zahir rebuilt Acre's fortifications, using materials from the city's medieval ruins. He died outside its walls during an offensive against him by the Ottoman state in 1775. His successor, Jazzar Pasha, further fortified its walls when he virtually moved the capital of the Saida <b>Eyelet</b> ("Province of Sidon") to Acre where he resided. Jazzar's improvements were accomplished through heavy imposts secured for himself all the benefits derived from his improvements. About 1780, Jazzar peremptorily banished the French trading colony, in spite of protests from the French government, and refused to receive a consul. Both Zahir and Jazzar undertook ambitious architectural projects in the city, building several caravanserais, mosques, public baths and other structures. Some of the notable works included the Al-Jazzar Mosque, which was built out of stones from the ancient ruins of Caesarea and Atlit and the Khan al-Umdan, both built on Jazzar's orders.|$|E

The ribbon itself {{must be at least}} 35g (1oz), 4–6cm (1.6–2.4") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides.

Combining certain increases, which can create small <b>eyelet</b> {{holes in the}} resulting fabric, with assorted decreases [...] is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling lace.

60|$|The two squadrons were intermingled, and it {{required}} some {{little time for}} Sir Gervaise to get {{a clear idea of}} the state of his own ships. Generally, it might be said that the vessels were scattering, the French sheering towards their own coast, while the English were principally coming by the wind on the larboard tack, or heading in towards England. The Cæsar and le Pluton were still foul of each other, though a rear-admiral's flag was flying at the mizzen of the first, while that which had so lately fluttered at the royal-mast-head of the other, had disappeared. The Achilles, Lord Morganic, was still among the French, more to leeward than any other English ship, without a single spar standing. Her ensigns were flying, notwithstanding, and the Thunderer and Dublin, both in tolerable order, were edging away rapidly to cover their crippled consort; though the nearest French vessels seemed more bent on getting out of the mêlée, and into their own line again, than on securing any advantage already obtained. Le Téméraire was in the same predicament as the Achilles as to spars, though much more injured in her hull, besides having thrice as many casualties. Her flag was down; the ship having fairly struck to the Warspite, whose boats were already alongside of her. Le Foudroyant, with quite one-third of her crew killed and wounded, was running off to leeward, with signals flying for her consorts to rally round her; but, within less than ten minutes after she became visible, her main and mizzen-masts both went. The Blenheim had lost all her top-masts, like the Plantagenet, and neither the Elizabeth nor the York had a mizzen-mast standing, although engaged but a very short time. Several lower yards were shot away, or so much injured as to compel the ships to shorten sail; this accident having occurred in both fleets. As for the damage done to the standing and running rigging, and to the sails, it is only necessary to say that shrouds, back and head-stays, braces, bowlines and lifts, were dangling in all directions, while the canvass that was open exhibited all sorts of rents, from that which had been torn like cloth in the shopman's hands, to the little <b>eyelet</b> holes of the canister and grape. It appeared, by the subsequent reports of the two parties, that, in this short but severe conflict, the slain and wounded of the English amounted to seven hundred and sixty-three, including officers; and that of the French, to one thousand four hundred and twelve. The disparity in this respect would probably have been greater against the latter, {{had it not been for}} the manner in which M. des Prez succeeded in doubling on his enemies.|$|E
