500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But {{all you have to}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> at me to know / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E

Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying [...] "we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, {{and we must}} engage them as friends". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying [...] "If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing... And so what I would <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> at the programs that LBJ gave us with the Great Society and they'd be gone." ...|$|E

[...] According to Gérard Prunier, a staffer to the Assistant Secretary said that [...] "the only {{thing we have to}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> the other way", with respect to Rwanda's continued intervention. New York Times correspondent Howard W. French said that according to his sources, Rice herself made the remark. The Congo Wars spearheaded by Rwanda led to over five million deaths. In 2012, when serving as UN ambassador, Rice opposed efforts to publicly censure Rwandan President Paul Kagame for again supporting a Congolese rebel group, this time in the 2012 Congo conflict, despite the sacking of the regional capital of Goma. The Rwandan government was a client when Rice worked at Intellibridge in 2001–02.|$|E

2500|$|In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, {{and this}} time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he {{switched}} serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One’s dagger and uses it to control Gold to [...] take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> on. Fortunately, Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to [...] "do what is necessary" [...] to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of [...] "weakness," [...] but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that “necessity” will make her love him once again.|$|E
