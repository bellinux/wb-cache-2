25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|The album's final parody is [...] "eBay", {{based on}} [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by Backstreet Boys. In this song, the narrator {{describes}} {{a variety of}} obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was going to shoot a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{members of}} the school's faculty were {{involved}} in controversy surrounding the U.S. Republican Party presidential primaries. On October 9, Dean Hill and Associate Dean W. Steve Albrecht sent an e-mail to 50 BYU Management Society members and 100 {{members of the}} school's National Advisory Council asking them to support Mitt Romney's bid for the U.S. presidency. Hill and Albrecht signed the message with their official BYU titles, sent the e-mail from a BYU e-mail address, and began the message [...] "Dear Marriott School Friend." [...] Both the LDS Church and BYU, as tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations, are prohibited by federal law from endorsing a particular candidate or political party. Albrecht said {{that he should not}} have sent it in his capacity as a BYU dean: [...] "It wasn't something BYU did, it wasn't something <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done, and it was bad judgment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Lord Arranmore answered. [...] "That little affair is {{not worth}} mentioning. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> done the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blame him!" [...] and Jimmy's {{voice was}} strained. [...] "If I {{had had his}} load to carry and felt it as he did, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> gone under long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{need not}} suppose," [...] Sabatini replied. [...] "It {{is not worth}} while. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> done what the impulse of the moment demanded. So far, however, I have found most people reasonable." ...|$|R
500|$|... "My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I {{probably}} {{should not have}} done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campbell is {{involved}} with a side band, The Dirty Knobs. [...] "It's rougher-edged ," [...] Campbell says of the group. [...] "It's slightly over-driven, less polished, lots of Sixties influence: The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, The Animals. It's something <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done a long time ago, but I didn't 'cause I was {{wrapped up in the}} Heartbreakers." [...] Some Dirty Knobs material has been recorded.|$|E
2500|$|While {{not known}} for being an {{outstanding}} putter, Nicklaus was often {{able to make the}} important putts when he needed them. Nicklaus's putting was highly regarded by his rivals. He was also known as a conservative player at times, going for broke only when it was necessary. This was especially apparent on the green, where he would often choose to be less aggressive and make sure of an easy two-putt. Nicklaus spoke about this in his autobiography. [...] "I was a fine two-putter, but sometimes too defensive—too concerned about three-putting—to go for putts that <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> gone for." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mike Rutherford {{later called}} the album [...] "dodgy", elaborating that [...] "I {{look back at}} it and you know... we made the record, I didn't {{think too much about}} it, but later - <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> done it. The {{chemistry}} with Carrack and Young was great, then we lost Paul Young and I kind of battled on - with some nice songs. I shouldn't have done it. And the sound on that - I don't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} bit of blame attaches to you," [...] she said. [...] "Had I been in your place, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> done the same and behaved much more outrageously. For you were outrageous, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] the Princess answered. [...] "I {{suppose you}} have sense {{enough to see}} that we cannot stay on here for you to make your {{interesting}} confessions. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> some of these tradespeople trying to put me in prison." ...|$|R
2500|$|Friedman sparked {{criticism}} for writing that congressional ovations for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were [...] "bought {{and paid for}} by the Israel lobby." [...] A letter from the American Jewish Committee objected that [...] "Public opinion polls consistently show a high level of American ... support for and identification with Israel. This indicates that the people’s elected representatives are fully reflecting the will of the voters." [...] Friedman responded to criticism by writing: [...] "In retrospect <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> used a more precise term like ‘engineered’ by the Israel lobby – a term that does not suggest grand conspiracy theories that I don’t subscribe to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smudged Cat Games started {{development}} on The Adventures of Shuggy shortly after Microsoft released the XNA framework, {{a set of}} tools that would allow individuals to program their own games for the Xbox 360. It was entered as a competitor in Microsoft's Dream.Build.Play competition, a program awards winning games with a publishing contract on Xbox Live Arcade and development funding to complete the game. The game made the top 20 contestants, but ultimately was not awarded a publishing contract. Later that year the developer {{signed a contract with}} Sierra Online. When Sierra Online's parent company, Vivendi Games, was acquired by Activision Blizzard Sierra was shut down, terminating the contract with Smudged Cat Games. Shuggy was later picked up by Valcon Games. It passed Microsoft's Xbox Live certification process on May 1, 2011 and was released on June 15, 2011. Programmer David Johnston stated that in retrospect he wishes he had not spent four years in development. [...] "On reflection, once I entered into Dream Build Play, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> released it as soon as I could," [...] Johnston stated. [...] "It could have done with a bit of polish - but not three and half years’ worth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{put you on}} my knee, {{and told}} you fairy tales, or cut dolls for you out of this bark, instead of sitting respectfully silent and making a basket for your stores." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They stared a good deal. It {{seems to}} be the custom in Europe; but I told Captain Jenness <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> to go about by myself in Venice, as my aunt's an invalid, and I had better get used to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would be}} nearer the truth, {{if you said}} that Pierre {{and the two men}} had brought me back," [...] Philip laughed; [...] "for {{if it had not been}} for them, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> lost my head the day after the queen left Nerac." ...|$|R
60|$|I resumed my seat on {{the side}} of the bed. My sensations were a little confused. Under {{ordinary}} circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> been angry. It was impossible, however, to persevere in such a sentiment towards the abject creature who cowered by my side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, father; up to {{the time}} when this trouble first began I don't think that I thought very seriously about it. Lord Halliburn was very nice, I liked him as much as any man I have met. I suppose I was gratified by his attentions; every one spoke well of him; I own that I was rather proud of {{carrying}} him off, and it really seemed to me that I was likely to be very happy with him. Since then I have looked at it in a different way. I knew, of course, that husbands and wives are supposed to share each other's troubles, but it had never really seemed to me that there was a likelihood of troubles coming into my life. Well, troubles have come, and with them I have come to look at things differently. To begin with, I have learnt more of Lord Halliburn's character than <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done in all my life if such troubles had not come.|$|E
60|$|When afterwards, in {{the course}} of our gregarious walk, I found myself for half an hour, not perhaps without another manoeuvre, at the great man's side, the result of his affability was a still livelier desire that he shouldn't remain in ignorance of the {{peculiar}} justice I had done him. It wasn't that he seemed to thirst for justice; on the contrary I hadn't yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a grudge--a note for which my young experience had already given me an ear. Of late he had had more recognition, and it was pleasant, as we used to say in The Middle, to see how it drew him out. He wasn't of course popular, but I judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of that. He had none the less become in a manner the fashion; the critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with him. We had found out at last how clever he was, and he had had {{to make the best of}} the loss of his mystery. I was strongly tempted, as I walked beside him, to let him know how much of that unveiling was my act; and there was a moment when <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done so had not one of the ladies of our party, snatching a place at his other elbow, just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish. It was very discouraging: I almost felt the liberty had been taken with myself.|$|E
5000|$|However, Campese {{later told}} Canberra sports {{journalist}} Geoff Hawke, in the Canberra Times, that he regretted publishing his comments about FitzSimons. Campese is reported saying that, “Fitzy {{is a good}} friend but he’s very upset about what I said about his fighting in a French Test last year. At the time, I thought it was okay, but in hindsight <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> toned it down.” ...|$|E
6000|$|We hurried down, Kate humming, [...] "Somewhere {{the sun is}} shining," [...] solely, I believe, {{because she}} knew it aggravated me. At any other time <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> thrown a pillow at her, but just now I was too eager to see if Jim Nash had brought any mail.|$|R
60|$|Ere long, I {{had reason}} to congratulate myself on the course of {{wholesome}} discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> been unequal to maintain, even externally.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, never," [...] {{answered}} Mabberly, {{who sat on}} {{the seat}} beside him; [...] "and {{if it had not}} been for our misfortune, or the carelessness of that unknown steamer, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> never <b>have</b> known of the existence of your beautiful island. At least, I would have remained in ignorance of its grandeur and beauty." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{coming up}} just short, Truex said he [...] "did all I thought I could do. I had the lead. <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> run him {{up a little}} more, just lost in the last second. … Really proud of everybody. Really proud of the {{teamwork}} with the JGR guys. We're team players, and we're {{in it for the}} long haul with them. Congrats to Denny. He beat me by a couple of feet.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Campbell still {{tours and}} works on albums with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and is {{involved}} with a side band, The Dirty Knobs. [...] "It's rougher-edged Petty's material," [...] Campbell says of the group. [...] "It's slightly over-driven, less polished, lots of Sixties influence: The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, The Animals. It's something <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done a long time ago, but I didn't 'cause I was {{wrapped up in the}} Heartbreakers." [...] Some Dirty Knobs material has been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|After {{going from}} the lead to 14th on the final lap, Kenseth said that he [...] "wouldn't trade that {{position}} for anybody in the whole field. I didn't really think the outside was going to muster up enough run {{to get it to}} be honest with you. Somehow, (Hamlin) just got a massive run. Hindsight <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> stayed in front of Martin and tried to race him back to the line. It looked like he was going so fast I could get {{in front of him and}} get a little boost and I just couldn't." ...|$|E
50|$|I owe Mr. Symons a great debt: but {{for having}} read his book I should not, {{in the year}} 1908, have heard of Laforgue or Rimbaud; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not <b>have</b> begun to read Verlaine; but for reading Verlaine, I <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> heard of Corbière. So the Symons book {{is one of those}} which have {{affected}} the course of my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "she {{often thought}} so;" [...] and added, [...] "it is my garden, monsieur, {{which makes me}} retain this house, {{otherwise}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> removed to larger and more commodious premises long since; but you see I could not take my garden with me, and I should scarcely find one so large and pleasant anywhere else in town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said Lady Fitzgerald. [...] "I {{certainly}} do not think harshly of her. In her position <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> acted as she has done." [...] The difference, however, between them was this, {{that it was all}} but impossible that Lady Fitzgerald should not sympathize with her children, while it was almost impossible that the Countess of Desmond should do so.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the loss}} of Taylor, Schembechler {{questioned}} his decision to let the injured Taylor play: [...] "I suppose if I {{had to do it}} all over again, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> started Elvis and let the chips fall where they may. To be honest with you, Taylor didn't throw a pass all week. He's got a bad arm right now. But he's a great competitor. He wanted to go. He felt he'd be able to throw the ball all right." [...] Schembechler added, [...] "Michael Taylor is a fifth-year quarterback. He's the leader of our team. Hell's afire, we send him out there with a bad arm. If Michael's healthy, you'll see a difference." ...|$|E
60|$|Even {{the criticisms}} from which I most dissent {{have been of}} great service to me, by showing in what places the {{exposition}} most needed to be improved, or the argument strengthened. And I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been well pleased if the book had undergone a much greater amount of attack; as in that case <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> been enabled to improve it still more than I believe I have now done.|$|R
2500|$|Under Turner's direction, the CIA {{emphasized}} {{technical intelligence}} (TECHINT) and signal intelligence (SIGINT) more than human intelligence (HUMINT). In 1979, Turner eliminated over 800 operational positions {{in what was}} called the Halloween Massacre. In a memoir/analysis published in 2005, Turner expressed regret for the dismissals stating, [...] "In retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> effected the reductions of 820 positions at all, and certainly not the last 17. The reductions applied to Vietnam-era personnel according to later-era employee and then novelist Jason Matthews. ”Turner gave notable testimony to Congress revealing much of the extent of the MKULTRA program, which the CIA ran from the early 1950s to late 1960s. Reform and simplification of the intelligence community's multilayered secrecy system was one of Turner's significant initiatives, but produced no results by the time he left office.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Oakley {{directed}} his first feature film The Devil You Know starring Dean Winters, Rosamund Pike, Lena Olin and then aspiring actress Jennifer Lawrence. However, {{the film was}} never released until its video on demand release on July 9, 2013. On film concept and idea, Oakley said, [...] "I went to American Film Institute to the directing program and found it very restrictive. Although in hindsight, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> found it that way. I met my whole team there—the director of photography, the writer, the producer, the set designers—and {{we wanted to make}} a feature quickly out of the program. The writer had an idea that seemed interesting. So, we started putting it together." [...] Oakley describes Mildred Pierce as his inspiration behind the film.|$|R
