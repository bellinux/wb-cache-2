40|$|The {{influence}} of cathodic protection on {{the rate of}} microfooling on mild steel was investigated in natural seawater. Cathodic protection was applied at current densities of 0. 12 and 0. 22 mA/cm 2 using sacrificial zinc anodes. The rate of attachment of bacteria and diatoms was observed to increase dramatically {{as a function of}} applied current, particularly during {{the first few days of}} exposure. It was also found that sulphate-reducing bacteria come into the scene as early as the fourth day white freely corroding specimens encourage SRB activity only by the twelfth day of exposure. The growth rate of calcareous <b>depos</b> tsw as also investigated to make it comparable with that of microorganisms...|$|E
