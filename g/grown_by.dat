5|$|Banksia sceptrum, {{commonly}} known as the sceptre banksia, is a plant that grows in Western Australia near the central west coast from Geraldton north through Kalbarri to Hamelin Pool. It extends inland almost to Mullewa. First collected and <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> early settler James Drummond in Western Australia, it was described by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1855.|$|E
5|$|In {{synthetic}} diamond <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis {{or chemical}} vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to {{the direction of}} the growth. Such alignment has been also been observed in gallium arsenide and thus is not unique to diamond.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{conductivity}} {{is commonly}} observed in nominally undoped diamond <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> chemical vapor deposition. This conductivity {{is associated with}} hydrogen-related species adsorbed at the surface, {{and it can be}} removed by annealing or other surface treatments.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, three {{cuttings}} of Carménère were {{imported from}} Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart {{in the late}} 1990s. After two years in quarantine, only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro-propagated (segments of individual buds grown on nutrient gel) and field <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> Narromine Vine Nursery. The first vines from the nursery were planted in 2002 by Amietta Vineyard and Winery in the Moorabool Valley (Geelong, Victoria) who use Carménère in their Angels' Share blend.|$|E

5|$|In the North Island, Māori {{cultivated}} selected {{forms of}} C.australis for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> gardeners as the cultivar Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, trust {{companies}} were booming; {{in the decade}} before 1907, their assets had <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> 244%. During the same period, national bank assets grew by 97%, while state banks in New York increased by 82%. The leaders of the high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York's financial and social circles. One {{of the most respected}} was Charles T. Barney, whose late father-in-law William Collins Whitney was a famous financier. Barney's Knickerbocker Trust Company was the third-largest trust in New York.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can be <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, {{because of}} high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Mid-Year Estimate for the {{population}} of Manchester was 510,700. This was an increase of 7,900, or 1.6%, since the 2011 MYE. Since 2001, {{the population}} has <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> 87,900, or 20.8%. Manchester was the third fastest-growing of the areas in the 2011 census. The city experienced the greatest percentage population growth outside London, with an increase of 19% to over 500,000. Manchester's population is projected to reach 532,200 by 2021, an increase of 5.8% from 2011. This represents a slower rate of growth than the previous decade.|$|E

Based on the 2011 UK Census, Birmingham's population is projected to reach 1,160,100 by 2021, an increase of 8.0%. This compares with an estimated rate of 9.1% for the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{right whale}} spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, stocks are estimated to have <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E
5|$|These SWNT forests (buckypaper) were <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> the super-growth CVD {{method to}} about 10 μm height. Two factors could {{contribute}} to strong light absorption by these structures: (i) a distribution of CNT chiralities resulted in various bandgaps for individual CNTs. Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption. (ii) Light might be trapped in those forests due to multiple reflections.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{commenced}} in Toraja in the 1970s, {{and accelerated}} in the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1984 and 1997, {{a significant number}} of Torajans obtained their incomes from tourism, working in and owning hotels, as tour guides, drivers, or selling souvenirs. With the rise of political and economic instability in Indonesia in the late 1990s—including religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi—tourism in Tana Toraja has declined dramatically. Toraja continues to be a well known origin for Indonesian coffee, <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> both smallholders and plantation estates, although migration, remittances and off-farm income is considered far more important to most households, even those in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} are <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt or {{some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely <b>grown</b> <b>by</b> the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
