40|$|The {{innovative}} {{trends of}} Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) have posed never experienced opportunities in productive environments, like data centers. While NFV decouples software {{implementation of the}} network functions (e. g., DPI and NAT) from their physical counterparts, SDN {{is in charge of}} dynamically changing those functions to create network paths. One new opportunity of such Software-based networks is to make the network service-provisioning models more flexible, by enabling users to build their own service graphs: users can select the Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to use and can specify how packets have to be processed and forwarded in their networks. In particular, this PhD thesis spans mostly topics related to the verification and configuration of service graphs. For what concerns the challenges of network verification, our aim is to explore strategies that overcome the limitations of traditional techniques, which generally exploit complex modelling approaches and takes considerable verification times. Thus we envision for verification techniques that are based on non-complex modelling approaches in order to be much more efficient than existing proposals. Under these conditions, such novel approaches may work at run-time and, in particular, may be performed before deploying the service graphs, in order to avoid unexpected network behaviours and detect errors as early as possible. Another requirement is that verification should take a reasonable amount of time from a VNF Orchestrator point of view, with <b>fair</b> <b>processing</b> resources (e. g. CPU, memory and so on). This is because we are in the context of flexible services, where the reconfiguration of network functions can be frequently triggered, both in case of user request and in case of management events. The first contribution of this thesis lays on the service graphs specification by means of forwarding policies (i. e, a high-level specification of how packet flows are forwarded). While the majority of the SDN verification tools operate on OpenFlow configurations, we have defined a formal model to detect a set of anomalies in forwarding policies (i. e., erroneous specifications that may cause misleading network conditions and states). The key factors that distinguish our work from existing approaches are both an early detection of policies anomalies (i. e., before translating such policies into OpenFlow entries), in order to speed up the fixing phase, without even starting service deployment, and a scalable approach that achieves verification times in the order of milliseconds for medium- large- sized networks. Another advancement in network verification has been the possibility to verify networks including stateful VNFs, which are functions that may dynamically change the forwarding path of a traffic flow according to their local algorithms and states (e. g., IDSs). Our second contribution is thus a verification approach that models the network and the involved (possibly stateful) VNFs as a set of FOL formulas. Those formulas are passed to the off-the-shelf SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solver Z 3 in order to verify some reachability-based properties. In particular, the proposed solution has been implemented in a tool released under the AGPLv 3 license, named VeriGraph, which takes the functional configurations of all deployed VNFs (e. g., filtering rules on firewalls) into account to check the network. The adopted approach achieves verification times in the order of milliseconds, which is compliant with the timing limitations needed by a VNF Orchestrator. Finally, for what concerns the configuration of VNFs, service graph deployment should include a strategy to deploy VNF configurations in order to fix bugs in case of verification failures. Here, we have to face several challenges like the different ways a network function may require for being configured (REST API, CLI, etc [...] .) and the configuration semantic that depends on the function itself (e. g., router parameters are clearly different from firewall ones). We conclude this thesis by proposing a model-based configuration approach, which means defining a representation of the main configuration parameters of a VNF. This VNF model is then automatically processed by further software modules in the VNF architecture to translate the configuration parameters into a particular format required by a VNF and to deliver the produced configuration into the VNF following one of the configuration strategies (e. g., REST, configuration file, etc.) already supported by the function. The achieved results of this last work, w. r. t. {{the current state of the}} art, are the exploitation of a model-driven approach that achieves a higher flexibility and the insertion of non-VNF-specific software modules to avoid changes in the VNF implementation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{government}} {{initiatives have}} actively promoted information sharing for staff working in social {{care in the}} delivery of services. Research has shown however that social workers are sometimes reticent to share or may share information inappropriately despite the availability of guidelines from both government and local authorities. There are no computer-based tools in general use to support practitioners in resolving the issues they are confronted with in deciding when to share, what to share and with whom to share information. To address this deficiency, we are undertaking research intended to clarify the requirements for a privacy mediation tool, PRAIS, which can be used by agencies to ensure that information sharing conforms to legal requirements, <b>fair</b> information <b>processing</b> principles and the conditions set out in local data sharing agreements. In this paper the rationale and design of our prototype for PRAIS are explained. ...|$|R

The sampled data consist of two components, translation and orientation; the former is represented by a vector in R 3 and the latter by a rotation matrix in the rotation group, SO(3). Since the sequence of data contain sampling noises, the captured motion is not smooth and wiggles along the moving path. There are well-known fairing algorithms in Euclidean space based on difference geometry. Extending these for the motion data, we present a new fairing algorithm. The new algorithm iteratively minimizes the energy function reflecting the forces and torques, exerted on a moving object, to perform motion fairing.

Examining the effect on specific chemical and biochemical quality parameters directly after treatment and during storage at 4 °C revealed only significant differences in residual enzyme activities. For pectin methylesterase inactivation, none of the treatments was able to cause a complete inactivation, although heat and HP pasteurization were the most effective in limiting the residual activity. Peroxidase was completely inactivated by heat pasteurization and was much less susceptible to HP and PEF. All other quality parameters investigated, including the sugar profile, the organic acid profile, bitter compounds, vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid), the carotenoid profile, furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, experienced no significantly different impact from the three pasteurization techniques...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the first study}} comparing different high pressure (HP) and thermal treatments at intensities ranging from mild pasteurization to sterilization conditions. To allow a <b>fair</b> comparison, the <b>processing</b> conditions were selected based {{on the principles of}} equivalence. Moreover, pilot- and industrial-scale equipment were opted for, supporting conditions close to industrial application. The overall impact on carrot quality was characterized by analyzing a wide range of quality attributes, including specific (micro) nutrients (carotenoids and sugars), process-induced contaminants (furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural), enzyme activities (pectin methylesterase and peroxidase) and other relevant quality aspects (texture, dry matter content and color). This study demonstrated that the potential benefit of HP over thermal processing of carrots is largely dependent on the processing intensity applied. Thermal sterilization affected carrot quality the most, while mild and severe thermal pasteurization, mild and severe HP pasteurization and HP sterilization resulted in a comparable overall quality. Industrial relevance: The extensive nature of this investigation and the corresponding results can be considered of key importance for further implementation of HP technology in the food industry, since a correct and complete assessment of process-induced changes is of major importance in the context of legislative aspects of novel processing technologies...|$|R
40|$|Draft {{regulatory}} guidance {{suggests that}} if the processing of a child's personal data begins {{with the consent of}} a parent, then {{there is a need to}} find and defend an enduring consent through the child's growing capacity and on to their maturity. We consider the implications for health research of the UK Information Commissioner's Office's (ICO) suggestion that the relevant test for maturity is the Gillick test, originally developed in the context of medical treatment. Noting the significance of the welfare principle to this test, we examine the implications for the responsibilities of a parent to act as proxy for their child. We argue, contrary to draft ICO guidance, that a data controller might legitimately continue to rely upon parental consent as a legal basis for processing after a child is old enough to provide her own consent. Nevertheless, we conclude that data controllers should develop strategies to seek fresh consent from children as soon as practicable after the data controller has reason to believe they are mature enough to consent independently. Techniques for effective communication, recommended to address challenges associated with Big Data analytics, might have a role here in addressing the dynamic relationship between data subject and processing. Ultimately, we suggest that <b>fair</b> and lawful <b>processing</b> of a child's data will be dependent upon data controllers taking seriously the truism that consent is ongoing, rather than a one-time event: the core associated responsibility is to continue to communicate with a data subject regarding the processing of personal data...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{achieving}} fairness in {{the allocation of}} the bandwidth resource on a link shared by multiple flows of traffic has been extensively researched over the last decade. However, with the increasing pervasiveness of optical networking and the occasional trend toward using over-provisioning as the solution to bandwidth congestion, a router's processor also becomes a critical resource to which, ideally speaking, all competing flows should have fair access. For example, if the network is not <b>fair</b> in allocating <b>processing</b> resources, denial of service attacks based on an excessive use of the router processor (such as by using unnecessary optional headers) become possible. In this report, we investigate the issue of achieving fairness in the joint allocation of the processing and bandwidth resources. We first present a simple but powerful general principle for defining fairness in such systems based {{on any of the}} classic notions of fairness such as maxmin fairness, proportional fairness and utility max-min fairness defined for a single resource. We apply our principle to a system with a shared processor and a shared link with max-min fairness as the desired goal. We then propose a practical and provably fair packet-by-packet algorithm for the joint allocation of processing and bandwidth resources. We demonstrate the fairness achieved by our algorithm through simulation results using both synthetic and real gateway traffic traces. The principles and the algorithm detailed in this report may also be applied in the allocation of other kinds of resources such as power, a critical resource in mobile systems...|$|R
40|$|This Policy Brief {{argues that}} the newly adopted EU {{temporary}} relocation (quota) system constitutes a welcome yet timid step forward in addressing a number of central controversies of the current refugee debate in Europe. Two main challenges affect the effective operability of the new EU relocation model. First, EU member states’ asylum systems show profound (on-the-ground) weaknesses in reception conditions and judicial/administrative capacities. These prevent a <b>fair</b> and humane <b>processing</b> of asylum applications. EU states are not implementing the common standards enshrined in the EU reception conditions Directive 2013 / 33. Second, the new relocation system constitutes a {{move away from the}} much-criticised Dublin system, but it is still anchored to its premises. The Dublin system is driven by an unfair and unsustainable rule according to which the first EU state of entry is responsible for assessing asylum applications. It does not properly consider the personal, private and family circumstances or the preferences of asylum-seekers. Policy Recommendations In order to respond to these challenges, the Policy Brief offers the following policy recommendations: The EU should strengthen and better enforce member states’ reception capacities, abolish the current Dublin system rule of allocation of responsibility and expand the new relocation distribution criteria to include in the assessment (as far as possible) asylum-seekers’ preferences and personal/family links to EU member states. EU member countries should give priority to boosting their current and forward-looking administrative and judicial capacities to deal and welcome asylum applications. The EU should establish a permanent common European border and asylum service focused on ensuring the highest standards through stable operational support, institutional solidarity across all EU external borders and the practical implementation of new distribution relocation criteria...|$|R
40|$|This report details Indonesia’s poor {{treatment}} of migrant and asylum-seeking children. Indonesia detains hundreds of migrant and asylum-seeking children each year without {{giving them a}} way to challenge their detention. They are kept in sordid conditions, without access to lawyers, and sometimes beaten. Others are left to fend for themselves, without any assistance with food or shelter. Indonesian law permits up to 10 years of immigration detention. They arrive in Indonesia after fleeing persecution, violence, and poverty in Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma, and elsewhere. Unaccompanied migrant children – who travel without parents or other adults to protect them – fall into a legal void. With no government agency responsible for their guardianship, no one responds to their needs. Some children languish in detention, while others are left on the streets, without the legal or material assistance {{to which they are}} entitled by law. Without a viable future, many migrant children – either alone or with their families – risk their lives on dangerous boat journeys to Australia. They typically board rickety boats organized by smugglers without adequate fuel; hundreds are thought to die on this crossing each year. For this report, Human Rights Watch interviewed 102 migrants between the ages of 5 and 66. 42 of our interviewees were children when they entered Indonesia. Human Rights Watch researchers met a number of government officials concerned with migration, and interviewed staff members of nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations. Both adults and children described guards kicking, punching, and slapping them or other detainees. Some reported that guards tied up or gagged detainees, beat them with sticks, burned them with cigarettes, and administered electric shocks. In one case, parents said immigration guards forced their children, including their 4 -year-old and 6 -year-old, to watch guards beat other migrants. Several unaccompanied boys told Human Rights Watch that Indonesian immigration guards beat them in detention. Detention conditions fall far short of international standards: Centers are often overcrowded, unsanitary, and occasionally flooded. Children have next to no access to education and inadequate recreation time. Some children said they do not see sunlight for weeks at a time. More than 1, 000 unaccompanied children arrived in Indonesia in 2012. Many were detained with unrelated adults, at even greater risk of the violence and abuse that characterizes Indonesian immigration detention facilities. Almost 2, 000 asylum-seeking and refugee children were in Indonesia as of March 2013, a number that has gone up each of the last five years. Indonesia has no asylum law and delegates its responsibility to determine who must be protected as a refugee {{to the office of the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Yet even when UNHCR recognizes people as refugees, Indonesia often refuses to release them from detention, and does not recognize them as having any legal right to be in the country. Even if released, refugees and asylum seekers, including children, face constant threat of re-arrest and further detention. Asylum seekers and refugees who are released cannot legally work or move freely around the country. Children have few prospects for gaining an education. Many wait months or years for UNHCR to process their cases. Only a small number are ultimately resettled to a third country. The Indonesian government should stop detaining migrant children, clean up its detention facilities, and institute <b>fair,</b> thorough <b>processing</b> for asylum seekers...|$|R
40|$|Modular product {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} the existence of standardized interfaces between the physical building blocks. A module is a collection of technical solutions that perform a function, with interfaces selected for company-specific strategic reasons. Approaches to modularity are the structured methods by which modular product architectures are derived. The approaches include Modular Function Deployment (MFD), Design Structure Matrix (DSM), Function Structure Heuristics and many other, including hybrids. The thesis includes a survey of relevant theory and a discussion of four challenges in product architecture research, detailed in the appended papers. One common experience from project work is structured methods such as DSM or MFD often do not yield fully conclusive results. This is usually because the algorithms used to generate modules do not have enough relevant data. Thus, we ask whether it is possible to introduce new data to make the output more conclusive. A case study is used to answer this question. The analysis indicates that with additional properties to capture product geometry, and flow of matter, energy, or information, the output is more conclusive. If product development projects even have an architecture definition phase, very little time is spent actually selecting the most suitable tool. Several academic models are available, but they use incompatible criteria, and do not capture experience-based or subjective criteria we may wish to include. The research question is whether we can define selection criteria objectively using academic models and experience-based criteria. The author gathers criteria from three academic models, adds experience criteria, performs a pairwise comparison of all available criteria and applies a hierarchical cluster analysis, with subsequent interpretation. The resulting evaluation model is tested on five approaches to modularity. Several conclusions are discussed. One is that of the five approaches studied, MFD and DSM have the most complementary sets of strengths and weaknesses, and that hybrids between these two fundamental approaches would be particularly interesting. The majority of all product development tries to improve existing products. A common criticism against all structured approaches to modularity is they work best for existing products. Is this perhaps a misconception? We ask whether MFD and DSM can be used on novel product types at an early phase of product development. MFD and DSM are applied to the hybrid drive train of a Forwarder. The output of the selected approaches is compared and reconciled, indicating that conclusions about a suitable modular architecture can be derived, even when many technical solutions are unknown. Among several conclusions, one is the electronic inverter must support several operating modes that depend on high-level properties of the drive train itself (such as whether regeneration is used). A modular structure for the electronic inverter is proposed. Module generation in MFD is usually done with Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), where the results are presented {{in the form of a}} Dendrogram. Statistical software can generate a Dendrogram in a matter of seconds. For DSM, the situation is different. Most available algorithms require a <b>fair</b> amount of <b>processing</b> time. One popular algorithm, the Idicula-Gutierrez-Thebeau Algorithm (IGTA), requires a total time of a few hours for a problem of medium complexity (about 60 components). The research question is whether IGTA can be improved to execute faster, while maintaining or improving quality of output. Two algorithmic changes together reduce execution time required by a factor of seven to eight in the trials, and improve quality of output by about 15 percent. QC 2012060...|$|R
