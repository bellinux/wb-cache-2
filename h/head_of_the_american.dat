After a {{period during which}} Katharine Viner served as the US editor-in-chief before taking charge of Guardian News and Media as a whole, Viner's former deputy, Lee Glendinning, was appointed to succeed her as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> operation {{at the beginning of}} June 2015.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, 1775, Dunmore {{ordered the}} {{gunpowder}} {{removed from the}} Williamsburg Magazine to a British ship. Patrick Henry led a group of Virginia militia from Hanover in response to Dunmore's order. Carter Braxton negotiated a resolution to the Gunpowder Incident by transferring royal funds as payment for the powder. The incident exacerbated Dunmore's declining popularity. He fled the Governor's Palace to a British ship at Yorktown. On November 7, Dunmore issued a proclamation declaring Virginia {{was in a state}} of rebellion. By this time, George Washington had been appointed <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> forces by the Continental Congress and Virginia was under the political leadership of a Committee of Safety formed by the Third Virginia Convention in the governor's absence.|$|E
25|$|While not overtly political, {{the film}} {{documents}} {{that the federal}} government of the United States under the Presidency of George W. Bush joined the auto-industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards in a meaningful way since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.|$|E

25|$|<b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> contingent, he is Machiavellian in {{his use of}} power. However, his cynicism {{is later}} {{shown to be a}} form of self-defense; Chalmers is at least partly driven by a hidden idealistic side. Early in the voyage to Mars, he becomes sexually {{involved}} with Maya Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent of the mission. During {{the second half of the}} voyage, Toitovna becomes involved with Boone. Already bitter that Boone became the first to walk on Mars instead of him as they were both candidates for the mission and that he was allowed to join the colonization trip despite his manipulations, Chalmers further despises Boone because of Toitovna's affection. His dislike culminates in his involvement in a plot to assassinate Boone, which ultimately succeeds and allows him to take over handling major affairs on Mars, which ultimately became his undoing as his ruthless governance and aggressive diplomatic work backfire on him during the revolution of 2061. In the final chapters of Red Mars, Chalmers flees with Toitovna and other members of the First Hundred to join the hidden colonists at the polar ice cap but dies along the way when he is caught outside their vehicle during an aquifer flood in Valles Marineris.|$|E
25|$|Though Clay {{left the}} country on February 25, {{negotiations}} with the British did not begin until August. Clay {{was part of a}} team of five commissioners, which also included Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin, Senator James Bayard, ambassador Jonathan Russell, and ambassador John Quincy Adams, the nominal <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> team. Clay and Adams maintained an uneasy relationship marked by frequent clashes, and Gallatin emerged as the unofficial leader of the American commission. When the British finally presented their initial peace offer, Clay was outraged by its terms, especially the British proposal for an Indian barrier state. After a series of American military successes in 1814, and coupled with growing British reluctance to fight in the United States, the British delegation made several concessions. However, Clay continued to fight them on the issue of Mississippi River navigation rights, judging that the British wanted peace more than they were letting on; Clay was proven right when the British offered an even better deal. The Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814, ending the war. Clay briefly traveled to Paris and then London, where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain. Clay finally returned to the United States in September 1815. Despite his absence, Clay's constituents elected him in 1814 to another term. Clay declined Madison's offer of an appointment as minister to Russia, and Clay won another term as Speaker of the House.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps North Vietnam's {{ultimate}} resource was its population. During 1965, 97,000 North Vietnamese civilians {{volunteered to}} work full-time in repairing the damage inflicted by U.S. bombs. Another 370,000–500,000 civilians worked part-time. When the nation's {{lines of communication}} came under attack, railroad supply trains and truck convoys were split into smaller elements which traveled only at night. The logistical effort was supported by citizens on sampans, driving carts, pushing wheelbarrows, or man-portering supplies on their backs to keep the war effort going. They were motivated by slogans like [...] "Each kilogram of goods...is a bullet shot into the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> pirates." ...|$|E

Cooke owned nearly the whole First Fork, [...] long, {{with the main}} [...] "Lodge" [...] from the mouth, and a smaller [...] "Upper Cabin" [...] upstream of that. Herbert Hoover found solitude at the Ogontz Lodge as a guest of Jay Cooke III three times: in June, 1918 (just before leaving for Europe as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Food Administration), mid-May, 1928 (just before his selection as the Republican presidential candidate), and finally in late May, 1930 (as President of the United States).

500|$|During this time, Lees Ferry and the {{surrounding}} area attracted people because of a series of gold strikes in southern Utah, beginning with Cass Hite, a prospector who discovered gold in Glen Canyon in 1883. Gold seekers came to the area as early as 1889, when two Mormon prospectors by the names of Holladay and Huntington began to explore the surrounds of Lees Ferry. The most extravagant investment was a full-scale mining operation led by Charles H. Spencer, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Placer Company, who came to Lees Ferry in 1910 planning to extract gold from the Chinle Formation. Spencer brought in tons of equipment including a [...] steamboat, the Charles H. Spencer, reputedly the largest vessel ever to float the Colorado River upstream of the Grand Canyon. The operation was a dismal failure, and Spencer left, broke, in 1912. The steamboat sank in 1921 and now lies in pieces along the Colorado from Glen Canyon to below Lees Ferry.|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Family Association (AFA), {{alleged that}} [...] "The Littlest Tramp" [...] {{depicted}} cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. The AFA, during its incarnation as the National Federation for Decency, had previously targeted CBS as an [...] "accessory to murder" [...] after a mother killed her daughter following an airing of [...] Concerning Bakshi's involvement with Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, the AFA claimed that CBS [...] "intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then {{allowed him to}} insert {{a scene in which}} the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine." [...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm {{not going to get into}} who sniffs what. This is lunacy!" [...] On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were [...] "a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine". Despite receiving an award from Action for Children's Television, favorable reviews, and a ranking in Time magazine's [...] "Best of '87" [...] feature, Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures was canceled by CBS following the controversy.|$|E

500|$|On January 31, 1968, two Memphis {{sanitation}} {{workers were}} crushed {{to death in}} a malfunctioning garbage compactor, prompting the start of the Memphis Sanitation Strike on [...] The mostly black sanitation workers were Memphis's lowest paid civil servants, and received no overtime or holiday pay. Memphis's mayor was now Henry Loeb, a former member of Temple Israel, who converted to Christianity soon after starting his term in 1968, after marrying an Episcopalian woman. He refused to negotiate with the workers, and the strike soon came to national attention as a civil rights issue. After being contacted by black ministers, Wax arranged a meeting on [...] between Loeb, local union leaders, and Jerry Wurf, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The talks, which continued until [...] on the 19th, and resumed later that day, resolved nothing. Temple Israel member Dreifus used her past support for Loeb in his 1967 mayoralty campaign as a means of trying to force him to resolve the strike, and act as a representative of both white and black Memphians. The strike continued through March. In an attempt to defuse tension, Wax called a meeting of Memphis's two clergy groups, the mostly white Memphis Ministers Association and the black Interdenominational Alliance for [...] The meeting, if anything, had the opposite effect; the black ministers wanted to march immediately on the mayor's office, while most of the white clergy, including Wax, refused to join the march, which they argued would just inflame the white public.|$|E
500|$|When Chotiner {{appeared}} before the subcommittee on May 2, he testified {{that he had been}} retained by the firm when it was seeking to expand to California, that he had conferred with Justice Department attorneys regarding the criminal charges, and that no special favors had been asked or given. Under questioning by subcommittee counsel Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of committee member and future president John F. Kennedy, Chotiner also disclosed that he had been retained by New Jersey mobster Marco Regnelli in an attempt to stave off a deportation order. He testified that he never discussed his clients with Nixon, and had not used the Vice President's offices for business purposes. In a press release, Chotiner fired back at Kennedy, suggesting that he had been subpoenaed for political reasons. Denying any influence peddling, Chotiner asked whether the subcommittee counsel could [...] "explain whether any influence was used in connection with his own appointment as attorney for a subcommittee of a committee of which his brother... is a member." [...] Patrick Murphy Malin, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil Liberties Union concurred that requiring Chotiner to testify had [...] "overtones of political harassment." [...] Time magazine summed up the hearings, [...] "At week's end two points were clear: 1) Murray Chotiner had been sought out by, and had gone to work for, unsavory clients who obviously regarded him as a man of influence; and 2) on the basis of evidence so far adduced, he had been remarkably unsuccessful in wielding any." ...|$|E
500|$|While other [...] "new magazines—and {{many of the}} old—are {{dying of}} {{literary}} cirrhosis. The cause? Poisoning due to decayed fiction", Gold stated, Galaxy was profitable within five issues; an [...] "incredible" [...] achievement, in his words. The outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages—Gold wrote in a 1951 editorial that [...] "buying paper these days is like being mugged on a dark street"—that forced the magazine {{to find a new}} printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. That summer, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt Galaxys distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director and the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. [...] The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States {{to find out what the}} problem was, and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. [...] They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell Galaxy to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. [...] In Gold's words, [...] "he, Guinn, knew what he was buying, whereas World Editions hadn't known what they were selling".|$|E
