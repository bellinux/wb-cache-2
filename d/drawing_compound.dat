40|$|Visual {{navigation}} of hierarchically structured graphs is {{a technique}} for interactively exploring large graphs that possess an additional hierarchical structure. This structure is expressed in form of a recursive clustering of the nodes: in call graphs of telephone networks, for instance, the nodes are identified with phone numbers; they are clustered recursively through the implicit structure of the numbers, e. g., nodes with the same area code belong to a cluster. In {{order to reduce the}} complexity {{and the size of the}} graph, only those subgraphs that are currently needed are shown in detail, while the others are collapsed, i. e., represented by meta nodes. In such a graph view the subgraphs in the areas of interest are expanded furthest, whereas those on the periphery are abstracted. As the areas of interest change over time, clusters in a view need to be expanded or contracted. First and foremost, there is need for an efficient data structure for this graph view maintenance problem. Depending on the admissible modifications of the graph and its hierarchical clustering, three variants have been discussed in the literature: in the static case, everything is fixed; in the dynamic graph variant, only edges of the graph can be inserted and deleted; finally, in the dynamic graph and tree variant the graph additionally is subject to node insertions and deletions and the clustering may change through splitting and merging of clusters. We introduce a new variant, dynamic leaves, which is based on the dynamic graph variant, but additionally allows insertion and deletion of graph nodes, i. e., leaves of the hierarchy. So far efficient data structures were known only for the static and the dynamic graph variant, i. e., neither the nodes of the graph nor the clustering could be modified. As this is unsatisfactory in an interactive editor for hierarchically structured graphs, we first generalize the approach of Buchsbaum et. al (Proc. 8 th ESA, vol. 1879 of LNCS, pp. 120 – 131, 2000), in which graph view maintenance is formulated as a special case of range searching over tree cross products, to the new dynamic leaves variant. This generalization builds on a novel technique of superimposing a search tree over an ordered list maintenance structure. With an additional factor of roughly O(log n/log log n), this is the first data structure for the problem of graph view maintenance where the node set is dynamic. Visualizing the expanding and contracting appropriately is the second challenge. We propose a local update scheme for the algorithm of Sugiyama and Misue (IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics 21 (1991) 876 – 892) for <b>drawing</b> <b>compound</b> digraphs. The layered drawings that it produces have many applications ranging from biochemical pathways to UML diagrams. Modifying the intermediate results of every step of the original algorithm locally, the update scheme is more efficient than re-applying the entire algorithm after expansion or contraction. As our experimental results on randomly generated graphs show, the average time for updating the drawing is around 50 % of the time for redrawing for dense graphs and below 20 % for sparse graphs. Also, the performance gain is not at the expense of quality as regards the area of the drawing, which increases only insignificantly, and the number of crossings, which is reduced. At the same time, the locality of the updates preserves the user ’s mental map of the graph: nodes that are are not affected stay on the same level in the same relative order and expanded edges take the same course as the corresponding contracted edge; furthermore, expansion and contraction are visually inverse. Finally, our new data structure and the update scheme are combined into an interactive editor and viewer for compound (di-) graphs. A flexible and extensible software architecture is introduced that lays the ground for future research. It employs the well-known Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm to separate the abstract data from its presentation. As a consequence, the purely combinatorial parts, i. e., the compound (di-) graph and its views, are reusable without the editor front-end. A proof-of-concept implementation based on the proposed architecture shows its feasibility and suitability...|$|E

We compare the innovation performance of incumbent firms with entrants, controlling for {{differences in the}} scale and scope of research, both at the firm level and at the project level. To do so, we develop a simple analytical framework of drug development, which we use to estimate a structural model, using data on 3, 000 drug R&D projects in preclinical and clinical trials in the US during the 1980 s-early 1990 s. Key to our approach is a careful attention to the issue of selection – firms choose which compounds to advance into clinical trials. This choice depends upon the likelihood of success, but also upon economies of scale and scope, and strategic considerations about product cannibalization. It also depends upon how the costs of development and the rewards of success are shared within organizations and between alliance partners. After controlling for selection, we find that: a) incumbent pharmaceutical firms <b>draw</b> their <b>compounds</b> from better statistical distributions; b) over time, learning or environmental selection make entrants firms more similar to the established firms both in terms of selection behavior and research productivity; c) compounds licensed by pharmaceutical firms are at least as likely to succeed as internal developed projects, inconsistent with the “lemons” hypothesis; d) firm scale improves innovation performance but not scale at the project level. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{attention}} has been <b>drawn</b> to <b>compounds</b> that activate the human ether-a-go-go channel potassium channel (hERG), {{which is responsible for}} the repolarizing rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) in the mammalian myocardium. The compound NS 3623 [N-(4 -bromo- 2 -(1 H-tetrazol- 5 -yl) -phenyl) -N-(3 -trifluoromethylphenyl) urea] increases the macroscopic current conducted by the hERG channels by increasing the time constant for channel inactivation, which we have reported earlier. In vitro studies suggest that pharmacological activation is an attractive approach for the treatment of some arrhythmias. We present here data that support that NS 3623 affects native IKr and report the effects that activating this potassium current have in the intact guinea pig heart. In Langendorff-perfused hearts, the compound showed a concentration-dependent shortening of action potential duration, which was also de-tected as concentration-dependent shorter QT intervals. There was no sign of action potential triangulation or reverse use dependence. NS 3623 decreased QT variability and distinctly decreased the occurrence of extrasystoles in the acutely bra-dypaced hearts. Taken together, the present data strongly sup-port the concept of using hERG activators as a treatment for certain kinds of arrhythmias and suggest further investigation of this new approach. The rapid and slow delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKr and IKs) are required for normal repolarization during the cardiac action potential.

This thesis therefore examines consent as regulatory instrument in context of stem cell related interventions and endeavours to introduce a sufficient consent model for such interventions. To this end, a clinical overview and explanation of stem cells is provided in order to establish an understanding of the field of science in need of regulatory control. This is followed by a background and introduction to consent, a discussion of specific aspects of consent and the National Health Act of 2003 and the Regulations made in terms of the Act to provide insight into consent as understood in South Africa. Consent in international instruments and international law is then examined. The law of the United Kingdom is also analysed by providing an examination of the legal systems in the United Kingdom which is then followed by a discussion of the Human Tissue Act of 2004 and the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act of 2006. Finally, dynamic informed consent is explained and introduced as the recommended consent format for the proper and valid regulation of stem cell therapy-research interventions. At the close of this thesis, the conclusions <b>drawn</b> throughout are <b>compounded</b> and pertinent recommendations are made regarding consent procedures and specifications.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to study a {{proposed}} air pollution control (APC) system designed to treat flue gases produced during the combustion of waste derived syngas. In order to achieve this objective, a literature study was done to gain insight into the pollution formation during gasification and combustion of syngas, and {{a model of the}} APC system was built using the Aspen Plus software. This model was used in four different case studies aimed at optimizing the water and chemical requirements throughout the system. Several different types of wastes were considered; municipal solid waste (MSW) representing that which is normally generated in developed countries, MSW representing that which is normally generated in developing countries, a waste composition representing that of the plastic fraction of MSW, and a waste composition representing that of the biomass fraction of MSW.   Based on the results of the literature study, a few conclusions could be <b>drawn.</b> Sulfur <b>compounds</b> could be expected {{to be found in the}} form of H 2 S in the syngas and SO 2 in the flue gases. Chlorine compounds could be expected to be found in the form of HCl and the nitrogen compounds in the form of NH 3, HCN and N 2 after gasification and NO after combustion. The amount of research done in the area of MSW gasification, and combustion of MSW based syngas, is, however, small, and more research is needed.   Based on the results of the case studies, the amount of NaOH varied greatly depending on flue gas composition and negligibly depending on recirculation setup. The total amount of water required varied notably between the different cases studied and no case stood out clearly as the optimal case for all four waste compositions. The case studies seemed to indicate a trend towards an increased total water requirement with an increase in the amount recirculation. The four best cases where cases 2, 3, 4 and 10, out of which case three has been recommended as a good initial estimate from which to depart when finding the optimal setup for a specific system under study. In case 3, 40 wt% of the fresh water from the first splitter was sent to the direct contact scrubber, 50 wt% of the remaining fresh water was sent to the absorption tower, 40 wt% of the liquid leaving the absorption tower was recycled back to the direct contact scrubber, and 40 wt% of the remaining water leaving the absorption tower was recycled back to the absorption tower...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the problem of state {{estimation}} based on interval-valued stochastic descriptions of noise. To perform the estimation, we derive a probabilistic description of unobserved states conditioned on the observations, called a statistical inference rule. Moreover, we link the derivation of the rules to the notion of estimation risk. In the context of confident estimation, risk is defined as a variational expression dependent of the statistical inference rule. More specifically, we <b>draw</b> upon a <b>compound</b> risk description, comprising two additive terms. The a-level represents the first ingredient of risk and is found to be a function of the lower expectation of the statistical inference rule, while the second term represents the upper expectation of the rule’s fuzziness taken with respect to the observations. Both terms are connected through a variational parameter. Finally, the compound risk reduces into a function of the statistical inference rule and the variational parameter. Given this description of the compound risk and a fixed a-level, we treat the derivation of the statistical inference rule as a constrained minimisation problem, where the variational parameter depends on the fixed a-level. In other words, we attempt to obtain fuzzy inference rules, since {{at the same time we}} keep the estimation at an acceptable confidence level. We build our methodology upon spin models, a specific class of modelling structures with roots in statistical mechanics. State estimation in these models is possible only locally by considering a finite range of interactions among spins. It is exactly this locality that adds a stochastically described noise to the observations, given a log-linear function of observed and unobserved states. The statistical inference rule is then presented as a semi-linear combination of such local functions. Furthermore, we place the calculation of expectations, needed in order to form the compound risk, into a variational framework, thus calculating interval-valued rather than exact expectations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{approaches}} {{the question of}} how nominal compounds as linguistic means contribute to the construction of cultural meaning within the framework of knowledge transfer in the medieval monastic school. The starting point for the study is the semiotic definition of culture, which sees culture as shared models for perceiving, relating and interpreting among members of a social group. Language is seen as the place where cultural meaning is constructed and manifests itself in significant patterns, i. e., patterns of language usage that have meaning {{due to the fact that}} they are patterns. The central objective of this study is to reveal such patterns in nominal <b>compounds</b> <b>drawn</b> from Old High German (or rather bilingual hybrid) adaptations of Latin school texts translated, or adapted by Notker III (Labeo). Focus is placed on newly formed compounds, as well as compounds that differ distinctively from their Latin models. Methodologically this study combines the morphosemantic analysis of nominal compounds with a hermeneutic approach interpreting compounds in their textual and cultural context. Three significant patterns were established: (1) explication of implied meaning, (2) summary of complex expressions, and (3) explanatory translation. The first pattern can be observed in cases where the power of compounds to give additional information was utilised, e. g., in order to ensure a certain interpretation of a metaphorical expression. The second pattern demonstrates the capacity of compounds to refer to more complex concepts, expressing underlying syntactic constructions in a more memorisable manner. Finally, recourse was taken to explanatory translation in order to make the concept easier to understand. The three patterns are not necessarily the only patterns used by Notker III (Labeo); rather they are to be seen as an exemplification of the potential of nominal compounds for meaning construction...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la VI Reunión de Expertos en Tecnologías de Fluidos Comprimidos celebrada en Madrid del 28 al 29 de junio de 2012. Nowadays, {{the concept}} of {{chemical}} preservatives in food is very controversial. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are commonly used in the food industry due their effectiveness and low price. Nevertheless, the toxicity of these <b>compounds</b> <b>drew</b> attention to their side effects on {{the human body and}} possible carcinogenic properties. Modern consumer options have been redirected to natural alternatives, healthier and more diversified in terms of chemical composition and functional properties. Therefore, in the last years an increased interest to obtain natural bioactive compounds {{that can be used in}} the food industry has been observed. Besides, these components may be also useful for the development of functional foods that can provide additional physiological benefits, other than energy and nutrition. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) is applied for extraction of natural compounds from two raw materials from Romania: ramson (Allium ursinum), plums (Prunus domestica) and a raw material from Spain: lemon balm (Melissa officinalis). The antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined by using DPPH (1, 1 - diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) in-vitro assays. The content of total phenolics in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents. The results support the possibility that these raw materials, which are commonly used in the Romanian and Spanish diet, can contribute to protective effects on human health. However, in vivo experiments and the absorption and metabolism of plants' bioactives are still necessary to further shed light on their efficacy in disease risk reduction. This work has benefited from financial support through the 2010 POSDRU/ 89 / 1. 5 /S/ 52432 project, Organizing the national interest postdoctoral school of applied biotechnologies with impact on Romanian bioeconomy, project co-financed by the European Social Fund through the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007 – 2013.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} system of {{compounding}} attested in the earliest written Latvian texts of the 16 th and 17 th centuries. The philological analysis presented in this work is the first systematic attempt to extensively treat compounds in Old Latvian. The purpose of this thesis is to thoroughly describe {{the system of}} compounding of the earliest period of written Latvian. One of the main aims of the analysis provided in this work is {{to determine whether the}} Old Latvian compounds were distinguished in terms of their meaning and form. This is why another important aim {{of this study is to}} discern the most characteristic formal properties of each category of compounds in Old Latvian. This study also addresses the morphological variation of the components of compounds and seeks to explain why one finds different tendencies of compounding in the texts of this period.     Firstly, it is shown in this thesis that compounds in Old Latvian were clearly distinguished in terms of their meaning. The main semantic types of Old Latvian compounds, which were analyzed in this study, are the determinative compounds, the possessive compounds, the verbal governing compounds, and the copulative compounds. Secondly, it is argued that the aforementioned types of compounds were clearly differentiated in terms of the formal properties of their components. A large number of possessive compounds and verbal governing compounds had the compositional suffix -is (m.) /-e (f.). By contrast, only a handful of determinative compounds had this suffix. In view of the distribution of the suffix found in the Old Latvian compounds, it is suggested that the suffix was originally restricted to adjectival compounds. Furthermore, the different types of compounds in Old Latvian were also distinguished in terms of the first component. In the majority of cases, both the possessive compounds and the verbal governing compounds were coined without linking elements, while the determinative compounds had linking elements to a larger extent. Thirdly, it is proposed in this thesis that a part of linking elements used in the determinative compounds in Old Latvian originated from the original stem vowels of the first components. Thus, it is argued that stem compounds were still attested in the Old Latvian texts, although this Baltic model of coining compounds is no longer visible in Modern Latvian. Lastly, it is suggested that the tendencies of compounding found in the texts under discussion represent dialectal differences. Another contribution of this study is that the Old Latvian compounds are not treated in isolation, but analyzed in <b>drawing</b> parallels with <b>compounds</b> in the other Baltic languages, Lithuanian in particular. Hence, by analyzing common features and similarities between the compounding systems, the Old Latvian compounds are positioned within the context of the Baltic system of compounding. ...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death due to {{infectious}} disease. The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a facultative intracellular parasite with a slow regeneration rate. Though there is a decline in the overall TB incidence since 2005, the emergence of resistant strains that are impervious to existing treatment regimens make the discovery and development of new drug leads crucial. To this end, exploiting key differences between the biology of the host and the pathogen can generate novel lead molecules with minimal side effects. This thesis details the study of two proteins that are essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis (M. tb) but are not present in the host, making them potential drug targets. The first protein, IspD (2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol- 4 -phosphate (MEP) cytidyl transferase), is a part of the non-mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of isoprenoids and catalyzes the condensation of MEP and cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form 4 -diphosphocytidyl- 2 -C-methylerythritol (CDP-ME) and pyrophosphate (PPi). A medium-throughput enzyme assay was developed to identify inhibitors for this protein. It was screened against 3550 <b>compounds</b> <b>drawn</b> from five different M. tb whole-cell active small molecule libraries generating a total of five hits. These molecules were then assessed for their potency against IspD as measured by their IC 50, their activity against M. tb whole cells and their cytotoxicity. Of the five hits, two compounds inhibited M. tb whole cell growth at a concentration below 50 ?M while exhibiting no general cytotoxicity to human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). They each had an IC 50 of 26. 1 ?M and 37. 8 ?M and preliminary SAR studies were performed on the latter. These molecules could prove to be a viable starting point for the rational design of IspD inhibitors. The second protein, Wag 31 is a cell division associated protein that regulates mycobacterial cell size and septum formation. Wag 31 exhibited a propensity for gel formation both alone and in association with other cellular proteins. A purification strategy was developed to circumvent this tendency and generate soluble protein. It was found that mutations within the wag 31 protein coding sequence conferred resistance to a whole-cell active small molecule (MIC 99 = 6. 25 ?g/ml) in both M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. Moreover, all of the discovered mutations were clustered within the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of the protein. It was established that this compound binds to Wag 31 and seems to shift the equilibrium of the protein solution towards gel formation. The mutated protein does not form gel and seems to bind to the compound at a significantly reduced rate. To further confirm that Wag 31 was indeed the target of this small molecule, whole cell viability assays were performed to establish whether the over-expression of Wag 31 in M. smegmatis would shift the EC 50 and MIC 99 values. Wag 31 over-expression reduced both the EC 50 and MIC 99 values providing further proof that Wag 31 is the target for this compound. The compound appears to act by shifting the equilibrium of the protein towards a gelatinous state which proves inhibitory for cell growth...|$|R
