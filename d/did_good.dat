On 16 June 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service {{was held at the}} Flinders Street Baptist Church. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried.

It became his biggest grossing picture to date, taking nearly $4million in the US alone {{in its first year}} and ranking in the top 10 box office films of its year. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won Ford his fourth Oscar for Best Director, as well a second Best Cinematography Oscar for Winton Hoch. It was followed by What Price Glory? (1952), a World War I drama, the first of two films Ford made with James Cagney (Mister Roberts was the other) which also <b>did</b> <b>good</b> business at the box office ($2million).|$|E
500|$|In October 1868, La Périchole {{marked a}} {{transition}} in Offenbach's style, with less exuberant satire and more human romantic interest. Lamb calls it Offenbach's [...] "most charming" [...] score. There was some critical grumbling at the change, but the piece, with Schneider in the lead, <b>did</b> <b>good</b> business. It was quickly produced in Europe and both North and South America. Of the pieces that followed {{it at the}} end of the decade, Les brigands (1869) was another work that leaned more to romantic comic opera than to opéra bouffe. It was well received, but has not subsequently been revived as often as Offenbach's best-known operettas.|$|E

He wrote it as his swan song as a stage actor: [...] "I would like to act once more before I fold my bedraggled wings." [...] The trilogy gained glowing reviews and <b>did</b> <b>good</b> box office business in the UK. In {{one of the three}} plays, A Song at Twilight, Coward abandoned his customary reticence on the subject and played an explicitly homosexual character. The daring piece earned Coward new critical praise. He intended to star in the trilogy on Broadway but was too ill to travel. Only two of the Suite in Three Keys plays were performed in New York, with the title changed to Noël Coward in Two Keys, starring Hume Cronyn.|$|E
500|$|After the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry removed Jenkins' cavalry {{from the}} Ohio River area, it escorted Lightburn's {{retreating}} army and supplies to Ohio.

The 2nd Virginia did not cross the river, and camped on the Virginia side at Point Pleasant.

Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved.

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired.

[...] To stay profitable the ship took whatever jobs were available, carrying a variety of cargo over long distances. [...] On 6 June 1908, the ship began one of many such voyages, departing from Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia with coal for delivery to Valparaíso in Chile. [...] However, disaster struck on 3 July, when a strong gust of wind caused the ship to heel and the cargo to shift, resulting in her sailing with an unsafe angle of list. [...] The crewmen were forced to cut down parts of the rig to keep the ship upright. [...] The situation worsened as the winds picked up and more of the rig broke down, making maneuvering difficult. [...] Though the ship sustained heavy damages, the crew trimmed some of the cargo and continued the journey. [...] On 17 July the ship was offered assistance by the crew of the British steamship Frankby, but refused.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Utah Territory was heavily {{populated}} by Mormons and dominated religiously and politically by the Mormon Church, which held great sway over Mormons voters. Because {{the vast majority}} of the population was Mormon, people outside of the LDS church had very little political representation. The segregation between Mormons and non-Mormons (at the time called [...] "Gentiles") became very apparent. As a non-Mormon woman there were few ways to meet other women, whereas, the women of the Mormon Church had the Relief Society to build friendships and expend energy. Froiseth struggled with the lack of social engagement. During a visit to family and friends back in New York City in 1875, Froiseth attended the Sorosis Women's club with her sister Julia. The experience Froiseth had at the club motivated her to form a literary club back in Salt Lake City which was organized in 1875 and called the Blue Tea. It was Utah's first women's club. The Blue Tea's first president was Froiseth (1876) who set a cap of 25 members. The Blue Tea discussed many topics for the purpose of stimulating [...] "mental culture" [...] within its members. A few women would be assigned to read a book or article and come back the next week to expound on the ideas they read. Then the club would debate over those ideas.

Froiseth's club gave non-Mormon women the chance to socialize but also empowered them to push for change within their society.

2500|$|The A. Bruni Foundry in Rome and the Fonderia Lagana in Naples {{cast the}} sculptures using the lost-wax casting process. The {{foundries}} {{intended to use}} fire-gilding to finish the statues. Fire-gilding is {{a process in which}} gold leaf and mercury are applied to the bronze. Fire is applied to the area, which causes the gold to adhere to the bronze and the mercury to evaporate. But several problems were encountered during both the casting and gilding phases. The foundries wanted to use joints that while less expensive to cast would not wear well, and the sculptors were forced to intervene to achieve the required quality. Samples of fire-gilded bronze were shipped to the United States, where it was discovered the color was too bright. This required both sculptors to intervene again to achieve the correct color. Minzolli then visited the foundries to check on the castings. He discovered that the Bruni foundry did excellent casting, but its gilding was poor. The casting at the Fonderia Lagana foundry was also of high quality, but not quite as good as that in Rome. Its gilding was better than the Roman foundry's, however. Fraser looked into moving part of the casting work to a foundry in Milan and the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry in Florence. [...] The Milan foundry's work was at least as good as that done at the Neapolitan foundry. The Florentine foundry, however, <b>did</b> <b>good</b> casting work but exceptionally poor gilding. In the end, the gilding work on Valor was done in Milan and Sacrifice in Florence. The Rome foundry did both casting and gilding on Aspiration and Literature, while Naples did casting and gilding for Music and Harvest. More than [...] of 24-karat gold (worth $ in [...] ) was used in the gilding process.|$|E
