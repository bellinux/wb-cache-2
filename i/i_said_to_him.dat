25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project.

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

[...] "I s'pose it's not 'aving a father, {{but he seems to}} me to think more of you than any-body else in the wide, wide world. I get quite jealous sometimes. Only the other day <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>'im,</b> joking like, 'Well, you'd better go and live with 'im if you're so fond of 'im,' I said." ...|$|R

2500|$|Four years later, when part of Crowe's {{appearance}} at the 2002 BAFTA awards was cut out {{to fit into the}} BBC's tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe used strong language during an argument with producer Malcolm Gerrie. The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor Richard Harris, and it was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> may have been a little bit more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, I would have liked it to have been." ...|$|E

He said, 'Yes, I know, but no one else but you could help me.' He said, 'Two sticks, a dash and cake with a stick down. What is it?' I said, 'Did you wake me up just to tell me this?' As it turns out, two sticks is the number 11. A dash is a dash. And cake with a stick down is the number nine. And that was September 11." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; certainly, if {{you think}} so. What could <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> Certainly it was better. His {{presence}} would have half killed me. But what will he do, Henry?" ...|$|R

2500|$|God, {{that was}} horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself. I {{thought he looked}} a bit weird after the show—I didn't know that he'd taken a whole bloody bottle of weird-looking {{psychiatric}} pills. It was a bad time.

6000|$|... "You {{must tell}} me everything--this minute--Jack," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{clinging}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> like a child. [...] "I can't bear this suspense. Begin telling me at once. You'll do me {{more harm than}} good if you keep me waiting any longer." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'Commander of the Believers, {{was there}} some matter that troubled you this night?'

2500|$|And he said, [...] "Mum, I'm in... big trouble... You {{know this}} Nouvelle Solidarité?"... He said, [...] "I can't do this... I want out." [...] And {{at that point}} the phone was cut.

[...] I {{realised}} he was in such danger that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "I love you." [...] And then he said, [...] "I want to see you now."...

2500|$|The Beatles, in {{recording}} [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] {{from the}} album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, used tapes of calliope music {{to create the}} atmosphere of a circus. Beatles producer George Martin recalled, [...] "When we first worked on Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! John had said {{that he wanted to}} 'smell the sawdust on the floor,' wanted to taste the atmosphere of the circus. [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'What we need is a calliope.' 'A what?' 'Steam whistles, played by a keyboard.'" [...] Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing Sousa marches. [...] " [...] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had Geoff Emerick throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was telling}} him," [...] {{answered}} Perrine, simply, [...] "that {{it was time}} to change the bandages on his arm; and <b>I</b> also <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> what <b>I</b> have often <b>said</b> before, that he must never play at that terrible game of the Soule again." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> good-by <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and toddled along rather {{pleased with}} myself. It {{seemed to me}} that I had handled his affairs in a pretty masterly manner for a chap who's {{supposed}} {{to be one of the}} biggest chumps in New York.|$|R

2500|$|Yorke {{has worked}} {{extensively}} with electronic instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines, and sequencers, and techniques including programming, sampling and looping. Nonetheless, in 2015 he said: [...] "Really I just enjoy writing words {{sitting at a}} piano. I tend to lose interest in the drum machine." [...] Unlike Greenwood, Yorke does not read sheet music, feeling [...] "you can't express the rhythms properly like that. It's a very ineffective way of doing it, so I've never really bothered picking it up." [...] Explaining why he turned down a request to play piano on the track [...] "Mr. Bellamy" [...] on Paul McCartney's album Memory Almost Full (2007), Yorke said: [...] "The piano playing involved two hands doing things separately. I don’t have that skill available. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'I strum piano, that's it.'" ...|$|E

He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'Sherman!

2500|$|In the US Grierson had met {{pioneering}} documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Grierson respected Flaherty immensely for {{his contributions}} to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events. [...] Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's focus on exotic and faraway cultures. ("In the profounder kind of way", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, [...] "we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other"). In Grierson's view, the focus of film {{should be on the}} everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: [...] "Beware {{the ends of the earth}} and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums; are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty." [...] "'You keep your savages in the far place Bob; we are going after the savages of Birmingham,' I think <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> pretty early on. And we did.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look at me, and he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E
