5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E
5|$|Mariners <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, {{based on their}} direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The {{other half of the}} tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

25|$|After the crisis, the U.S. and the Soviet Union {{created the}} Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct {{communications}} link between Moscow and Washington. The {{purpose was to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that {{the leaders of the}} two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis. The worldwide U.S. Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. U-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honors in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously.|$|E
25|$|On October 11, 1898, Augustus Moore Herring {{took one}} of his gliders, fitted with a motor, to Silver Beach in St. Joseph. Herring’s machine lifted ever so {{slightly}} {{off the ground and}} actually flew for seven seconds. Eleven days later, the inventor made another flight of ten seconds. While Herring had a powered heavier-than-air craft, he did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to control it. It was left to the Wright brothers to perfect controlled flight five years later, and give themselves and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a place in history that might have ended up belonging to Herring and St. Joseph.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} the {{civilian}} authority to maintain control, it needed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to direct the military without unduly infringing on the prerogatives of the military world and thus provoking a backlash. Civilian leadership would decide the objective of any military action but then {{leave it to the}} military world to decide upon the best way of achieving the objective. The problem facing civilian authority, then, is in deciding on the ideal amount of control. Too much control over the military could result in a force too weak to defend the nation, resulting in failure on the battlefield. Too little control would create the possibility of a coup, i.e., failure of the government.|$|E

25|$|Echidnas {{are very}} timid animals. When they feel {{endangered}} {{they attempt to}} bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball, both methods using their spines to shield them. Strong front arms allow echidnas to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them from the hole. Although they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to protect themselves, the echidnas still face many dangers. Some predators include wild cats, foxes, domestic dogs and goannas. Snakes pose as a large threat to the echidna species because they slither into their burrows and prey on the young spineless puggles. Some precautions {{that can be taken}} include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing less pollution, planting vegetation for echidnas to use as shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas or just leaving them undisturbed. Merely grabbing them may cause stress, and picking them up improperly may even result in injury.|$|E
25|$|The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 {{provided}} the right opportunity and {{circumstances in which}} to establish Canada's first order: the Order of Canada. The system was officially established in 1972 and has since expanded, mostly through the 1990s, and generally attracted little criticism; indeed, the orders, decorations, and medals of Canada inspired other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, to adopt similar approaches in their respective jurisdictions, as did each of Canada's provinces. However, some experts in the field, such as Christopher McCreery, have pointed out {{what they see as}} deficiencies in the construct: At the 2006 conference on Commonwealth Honours, the concern was raised that Canada does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to recognize the nation's very best; the three grades of the Order of Canada being insufficient to do so. It was suggested that either two more levels be added to the Order of Canada, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders, or create a new single class but limited-membership order, similar to the Order of New Zealand. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels of each of the other orders, contrary to international practice. McCreery echoed these comments in 2010 and added that the Canadian honours system was lacking a polar medal, such as those issued in other northern nations, as well as a public service order, akin to the Imperial Service Order, and honours to specifically recognise protective services other than the police forces.|$|E
500|$|Many {{authors were}} {{interested}} in separating the esthetic, the ethical and the religious but it may have been, as far as Kierkegaard was concerned, of more importance for the single individual to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to decide when one was becoming dominant over the other two. Henrik Stangerup, (1937-1998) a Danish writer, wrote three books {{as a way to}} illustrate Kierkegaard's three stages of existence, 1981, The Road to Lagoa Santa, which was about Kierkegaard's brother-in-law Peter Wilhelm Lund (the ethicist), 1985 The Seducer: It Is Hard to Die in Dieppe, Peder Ludvig Moller was the esthetic in that novel, and in 1991 [...] Brother Jacob which describes Søren Kierkegaard as a Franciscan monk.|$|E

500|$|Rosaline {{is used as}} a {{name for}} only one other Shakespearean character—the one of the main female figures in Love's Labours Lost (1598), {{although}} Rosalind {{is the name of the}} main female character in As You Like It. [...] Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. [...] These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of living.|$|E
500|$|Most notably, Harlan dissented from Supreme Court rulings restricting {{interrogation}} techniques used {{by law enforcement}} officers. For example, he dissented from the Court's holding in Escobedo v. Illinois, that the police could not refuse to honor a suspect's request to consult with his lawyer during an interrogation. Harlan called the rule [...] "ill-conceived" [...] and suggested that it [...] "unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement." [...] He disagreed with Miranda v. Arizona, which required law enforcement officials to warn a suspect of his rights before questioning him (see Miranda warning). He closed his dissenting opinion with a quotation from his predecessor, Justice Robert H. Jackson: [...] "This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of collapsing when one story too many is added." ...|$|E

500|$|Gens' {{relations}} with the various Jewish resistance groups were strained. He allowed some resistance members to escape the ghetto, but opposed the plans for resistance because he felt they would threaten the entire ghetto's existence. Gens promised to provide aid to the resistance groups and may have promised to join them in a revolt if the time was right. He did provide money, taken from the various Judenrat funds, to the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO), a resistance group in the ghetto. Because {{of the need for}} secrecy, the FPO did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to directly solicit money from the ghetto inhabitants. Gens provided funds to another resistance group, the [...] "Struggle Group" [...] established by Boris 'Borka' Fridman. It later merged with the [...] "Yechiel Group", established by Yechiel Sheinbaum, to form the [...] "Yechiel's Struggle Group". He provided a pistol to the Struggle Group, its first. The FPO tried to prevent the formation of other resistance groups in the ghetto, mainly because they feared that it would increase the chances of German discovery as well as competition for scarce resources. Gens' support for the Struggle Group appears to have led to friction between himself and the FPO.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally mixed to positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 19 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". [...] Some writers noted and praised the heavy use of electronic, bass and funk beats, while others suggest The Neptunes {{were unable to}} blend R and rock. Anthony Henriques of PopMatters lauded the production, saying that [...] "their signature drums and spaced-out samples sound as good as ever here", going on to say [...] "he overall balance between live and electronic instrumentation is also the best they have managed {{on any of the}} N.E.R.D. albums". He compared the album to M.I.A.'s Kala as [...] "one of the best genre-blurring club records". However, Andy Kellman of Allmusic felt the songs [...] "still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of seeming as easy and carefree as the moments when N.E.R.D. are simply bashing away…blowing off steam, and talking ridiculous nonsense". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian pointed out that the songs were [...] "largely about sex", calling it [...] "wearisome". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media called the album a [...] "baffling, obnoxious mess". Adrian Ruhi of Okayplayer gave the album a score of 88 out of 100 and called some of the songs [...] "a dynamic mess", but noted it was [...] "a good thing".|$|E
