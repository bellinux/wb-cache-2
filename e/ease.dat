40|$|This paper {{uses the}} credit-friction model {{developed}} by Curdia and Woodford, {{in a series}} of papers, as the basis for attempting to mimic the behavior of credit spreads in moderate as well as crisis times. We are able to generate movements in representative credit spreads that are, at times, both sharp and volatile. We then study the impact of quantitative <b>easing</b> and credit <b>easing.</b> Credit <b>easing</b> is found to reduce spreads, unlike quantitative <b>easing,</b> which has opposite effects. The relative advantage of credit <b>easing</b> becomes even clearer when we allow borrowers to default on their loans. Since increases in default offset the beneficial effects of credit <b>easing</b> on spreads, the policy implication is that, in times of financial stress, the central bank should be aggressive when applying credit <b>easing</b> policies.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{severity}} of the 2007 financial crisis led {{to the implementation of}} quantitative <b>easing</b> in many countries, including the US. Even though there have been various studies on the impact of quantitative <b>easing,</b> research on quantitative <b>easing</b> and bank profitability is still limited. This paper tries to explore this novel aspect of quantitative <b>easing</b> via a model of profitability of banking industry. Using aggregate quarterly data from 1992 Q 4 to 2013 Q 4, this paper provides evidence that asset purchase and bank profitability are negatively correlated. This implies that quantitative <b>easing,</b> by purchasing a massive amount of assets, would drive down the profitability of the US banking sector. The result is shown to survive many robustness checks. However, due to some potential problems arising from the method used in this paper, further research should be carried out to confirm the exact effect of quantitative <b>easing</b> on bank profitability...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{describes}} the Quantitative <b>easing</b> as an unconvetional {{tool of the}} monetary policy. In {{the first chapter of}} this thesis there is theoretical analysis of the zero lower bound and also of specific phenomenon that might occur in this situation (the liquidity trap). The second chapter deals with the quantitative <b>easing</b> as a monetary policy with focus on the United States. It summarizes its development during three so called rounds, during which the quantitative <b>easing</b> has been used. This chapter also contains analysis of the entrance and exit strategy of the quantitative <b>easing.</b> In the third chapter, there is an econometric model estimated by ordinary least squares method with robust errors. This model is being used to verify the hypothesis whether the quantitative <b>easing</b> lowered long-term interest rates. The hypothesis has been rejected as the quantitative <b>easing</b> does not have statistically significant effect on any selected long-term bonds...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{macroeconomic}} model with {{open market operations}} that allows examining the effects of quantitative and credit <b>easing.</b> The central bank controls the policy rate, i. e. the price of money in open market operations, {{as well as the}} amount and the type of assets that are accepted as collateral for money. When the policy rate is sufficiently low, this set-up gives rise to an (il-) liquidity premium on non-eligible assets. Then, a quantitative <b>easing</b> policy, which increases the size of the central bank's balance sheet, can increase real activity and prices, while a credit <b>easing</b> policy, which changes the composition of the balance sheet, can lower interest rate spreads, stimulate real activity, and reduce prices. The effectiveness of quantitative and credit <b>easing</b> is however limited to the extent that eligible assets are scarce. Nevertheless, they can help escaping from the zero lower bound.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the impact of {{quantitative}} <b>easing</b> on public sector bond yields of selected countries in the world. It mentions channels of standard monetary policy tools and channels of quantitative <b>easing,</b> which can be included among unconventional monetary policy tools. This thesis analyses the impacts of quantitative <b>easing,</b> which was done by the Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. Firstly, all these institutions fought against the financial crisis with standard monetary policy tools. However, those tools were not very effective, therefore the institutions moved to non-standard tools. After the analysis based on event-study method was carried out, it was found out that mainly the first announcements about the policy of quantitative <b>easing</b> were always the most effective in decreasing government bond yield. The subsequent expansion of the policy of quantitative <b>easing</b> did not have such impact. The main benefit of this thesis is in the examination of the impact of later statements regarding quantitative <b>easing</b> on government bond yield, which were not effective in decreasing government bond yield...|$|R
40|$|The Bank of Japan’s {{quantitative}} <b>easing</b> {{policy was}} introduced in March 2001 and terminated in March 2006. Initially, it was not certain whether the unprecedented policy would succeed, and in a sense, its introduction was experimental. Was the quantitative <b>easing</b> policy effective as a new monetary policy measure? Although many observers have negative views {{about the effects of}} the policy, we have attempted to examine its effects using a macro-economic model. In a nutshell, the quantitative <b>easing</b> policy was one in which the operating target of money market operations was shifted from interest rates to a quantitative indicator. The quantitative indicator was the outstanding balance of current accounts held by banks at the Bank of Japan. When this policy was introduced, the central bank also strengthened its commitment by clearly stating that it would continue quantitative <b>easing</b> policy until “the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) (excluding fresh food) registered zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis. ” Quantitative <b>Easing</b> Examined through a Macro-model The following is an examination of the effects of monetary <b>easing</b> on the rea...|$|R

40|$|The master thesis {{analyses}} potential {{impacts of}} {{introduction of the}} quantitative <b>easing</b> by the Czech National Bank as a new monetary instrument in the Czech Republic, which would {{be used as a}} means of fight against the economic cycle. Instruments which a central bank can use in the area of monetary policy become limited in the era of major interest rates inclining to zero. Power of conventional means becomes insufficient. As a result, more and more central banks consider introduction of a relatively new instrument [...] quantitative <b>easing</b> which is applied e. g. by the FED or the ECB at present. The main goal of the thesis is to assess advantages and disadvantages of introduction of quantitative <b>easing</b> by the Czech National Bank and its ability to influence the economic cycle when basic principles of quantitative <b>easing</b> are applied on a real small opened economy. The output should present analysis and assessment of costs and benefits arising from introduction of quantitative <b>easing.</b> Actual data from the economies, where the quantitative <b>easing</b> has been applied, are analyzed in the thesis. The results of the analysis are used as a basis for creation of a simple universal model of functioning of quantitative <b>easing</b> which is after customizing according to specifics of the Czech economy, applied to the Czech Republic.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} currently analysing the effects of Quantitative <b>easing</b> especially {{in the wake of the}} 2008 financial crisis as large asset purchase programmes were implemented in the USA and the UK. Traditionally, the studies analysing the effects of QE have tended to focus on its impact on the financial markets as a whole or on interest rates. However, the manner in which quantitative <b>easing</b> works puts banks at the centre of how they operate. Therefore it is important to understand how quantitative <b>easing</b> works through the bank lending channel of monetary policy. Past papers such as Bowman et al. (2011) and Joyce and Spaltro (2012) have analysed the effects of quantitative <b>easing</b> on bank lending however they have tended to focus more on the direct channel of Quantitative <b>easing</b> through the bank lending channel. This study aims to build upon their work by including other channels under which asset purchase programmes could affect bank lending. We use OLS, Fixed effects and GMM estimators to analyse data. To this end, we seek to find how quantitative <b>easing</b> affect banks through an increase in money supply, changes in the bank’s net interest margins and Z-score. We find slight evidence for the indirect path of Quantitative <b>easing</b> especially through the net interest margin. We can’t conclusively ascertain whether the direct channel worked however...|$|R
