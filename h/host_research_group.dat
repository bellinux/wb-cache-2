50|$|Many public {{databases}} {{are already}} extensively linked so that complementary information in another database is easily accessible; for example, Genbank and the PDB are closely intertwined. However, specialized tools organized and <b>hosted</b> by specific <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> {{can be difficult}} to integrate into this linkage effort because they are narrowly focused, are frequently modified, or use custom versions of common file formats. Advantages of sequence profiling tools include the ability to use multiple of these specialized tools in a single query and present the output with a common interface, the ability to direct the output of one set of tools or database searches into the input of another, and the capacity to disseminate hosting and compilation obligations to a network of <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> and institutions rather than a single centralized repository.|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the modes of}} appropriation of the discourse on sustainable development in Latin America {{over the past four}} decades. Most studies on sustainability use qualitative methods of discourse analysis. Others use quantitative methods, such as the citation-based approach applied to the academic landscape of sustainability science at the global level, or to specific subfields. In this study, we use a hybrid approach that crosses quantitative methods (network analysis based on bibliometrics) and qualitative methods (discourse analysis and literature review) at different spatial and temporal scales. Our research provides a mapping of academic activities in the discursive field of sustainable development in Latin America and shows the dynamics of regional authors within these debates as well as institutions <b>hosting</b> projects, <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> and programs. The paper shows the active and critical participation of Latin American scholars in the debate about sustainability. It maps the consolidation of a Latin American network over time, highlighting the central actors and mediators who have their own discourse and interactions. We also analyze the links between different countries, revealing preferences in cross-national citations. Regarding the content of discussions, we show that reformist, even radical, approaches to sustainability find greater resonance among Latin American scholars.

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} application of antibodies has inspired {{the development of}} several novel methods to isolate and target antibodies using smart biomaterials that mimic the binding of Fc-receptors to antibodies. The Fc-binding domain of antibodies is the primary binding site for e. g., effector proteins and secondary antibodies, whereas antigens bind to the Fab region. Protein A, G, and L, surface proteins expressed by pathogenic bacteria, are well known to bind immunoglobulin and have been widely exploited in antibody purification strategies. Several difficulties are encountered when bacterial proteins are used in antibody research and application. One of the major obstacles hampering the use of bacterial proteins is sample contamination with trace amounts of these proteins, which can invoke an immune response in the <b>host.</b> Many <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> actively develop synthetic ligands {{that are able to}} selectively and strongly bind to antibodies. Among the reported ligands, peptides that bind to the Fc-domain of antibodies are attractive tools in antibody research. Besides their use as high affinity ligands in antibody purification chromatography, Fc-binding peptides are applied e. g., to localize antibodies on nanomaterials and to increase the half-life of proteins in serum. In this review, recent developments of Fc-binding peptides are presented and their binding characteristics and diverse applications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Retrospective {{conversion}} as {{a conversion}} {{of data from}} an old to a newer format is usually realized as a transfer of card catalogue into a computer form in a fast and simple way. The National and University Library in Ljubljana, Slovenia, started its first retroconversion project in 1997 with the oldest, partly handwritten catalogue, covering the period 1774 - 1947. The description of the catalogue is given, taking into account both cards’characteristics (size, handwritten/penwritten, scripts used etc.) and different cataloguing rules applied at that period (Austrian Library Instruction, Prussian Instruction etc.). The whole process was divided into separate phases according to technologies and human resources available, and specific procedures were designed (transcription, manual and automatic structuring, control etc.). The results are ca. 70, 000 records in MARC format, which were included into existing library catalogue.
