40|$|Detection {{and removal}} of rain streaks <b>from</b> <b>videos</b> has {{recently}} {{become a great}} and challenging topic of research. This paper discusses a new technique {{for the removal of}} rain <b>from</b> <b>videos</b> using the temporal-spatial statistical properties. For this the temporal statistical properties of the pixels affected by rain are made use of, and then an efficient and easy algorithm is implemented which takes care of the effective removal of rain <b>from</b> <b>videos.</b> This technique works very well for videos with still and moving backgrounds involving moving objects with a fixed camera position. For the videos which involve the motion of the camera, the technique works well for a small rate of change of background in the camera frames. Our algorithm does not use variable and conditional parameters like the shape, size, velocity, and spatio-temporal physical model of raindrops, and camera’s parameters like the aperture, focal length, and exposure time. The test results quantitatively and qualitatively illustrate that the performance of our algorithm is quite efficient in comparison to the previously existing algorithms which are state of the art techniques used for the purpose of removing rain <b>from</b> <b>videos...</b>|$|R

5|$|Aqua's {{character}} has received mixed response <b>from</b> <b>video</b> game publications, with initial comments {{focused on her}} brief appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of Aqua and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II; only later was their importance explored at the end of Birth by Sleep. Prior to Aqua's appearance in Birth by Sleeps trailers, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that fans speculated the character would be male. Having played a demo from Birth by Sleep as Aqua in the E3 2010, Ryan Clements from IGN enjoyed her character due to her gameplay mechanics.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} work on text extraction <b>from</b> <b>videos</b> is conducted in these few years, {{but not many}} focus on the Chinese language. Due to different characteristics between Chinese and English, new methods areurgently needed for Chinese character extraction. We are applying optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to video frames, and trying to extract character texts <b>from</b> <b>videos.</b> By doing this, we can automatically convert videocontents to text, and then exploit the Chinese subtitles for indexing and searching in a digital video library. This paper covers ways we filter the heavy noise and segment out each Chinese character in videosegments.

40|$|Abstract. Face {{analysis}} <b>from</b> <b>videos</b> can {{be approached}} using two different strate-gies, {{depending on whether}} the temporal information is used or not. The most straightforward strategy applies still image based techniques to some selected (or all) frames and then fuses the results over the sequence. In contrast, an emerging strategy consists of encoding both facial structure and dynamics through spa-tiotemporal representations. To gain insight into the usefulness of facial dynam-ics, this paper considers two baseline systems and compares static versus spa-tiotemporal approaches to face analysis <b>from</b> <b>videos.</b> The first approach is based only on static images and uses spatial Local Binary Pattern features as inputs to SVM classifiers, while the second baseline system combines facial appearance and motion through a spatiotemporal representation using Volume LBP features as inputs to SVM classifiers. Preliminary experiments on classifying face pat-terns into different categories based on gender, identity, age, and ethnicity point out very interesting findings on the role of facial dynamics in face analysis <b>from</b> <b>videos...</b>|$|R
5|$|Conceived from a name {{idea for}} a Swedish character, Lars was given a moveset fitting with other strong {{characters}} in the series, to make him easy to use by newcomers to the franchise. Lars had a mixed reception <b>from</b> <b>video</b> game reviewers. While some critics praised his fighting style, even suggesting him to new players of the franchise, his design was met with a negative response; most reviewers found it ridiculous, often referring to his spiky hair. Nevertheless, he has been popular among fans of the franchise, often ranking {{as one of its}} most popular characters.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in June 1998, {{directly}} {{after the release of}} its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Banjo-Tooie features levels that are significantly larger than those of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim <b>from</b> <b>video</b> game critics. The game is also included in the Rare Replay video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Voids {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage <b>from</b> <b>video,</b> and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E
