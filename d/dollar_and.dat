Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E

5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} <b>dollar,</b> <b>and</b> the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half <b>dollar</b> <b>and</b> to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1880, {{in their}} annual reports, the Mint Director and Treasury Secretary appealed to Congress to {{discontinue}} the three-cent piece. The last three-cent pieces were struck in 1889, and the denomination was discontinued, {{along with the}} gold <b>dollar</b> <b>and</b> the three-dollar piece, by the Act of September 26, 1890. Many of the coins from 1888 and 1889 were still held at the Treasury Department and were melted after passage of the act, the fate of millions more as they flowed back from banks. The resultant metal contributed to large mintages of the Liberty Head nickel between 1890 and 1893.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. Leech, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half <b>dollar,</b> <b>and</b> after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E

Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian <b>dollar,</b> <b>and</b> government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half <b>dollar,</b> <b>and</b> one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
