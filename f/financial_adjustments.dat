Firstly, the thesis investigates whether reporting standards and company-specific factors are associated with <b>financial</b> statement <b>adjustments.</b> Secondly, the thesis examines whether <b>financial</b> statement <b>adjustments</b> are associated with actual credit ratings. 	 The data used in the analyses is provided {{by one of the}} largest credit rating agencies, referred to as Credit Rating Agency X. The main data consists of the time period 2004 - 2007, including 196 companies reporting under US GAAP, IFRS and local GAAPs. Moreover, the IFRS companies included in the main data are analyzed more thoroughly in terms of the adjustment type, using the second set of data from year 2007. The data only includes companies active in the telecommunications industry. The first part of the empirical analyses aims at explaining <b>financial</b> statement <b>adjustments</b> using a linear regression method. The second part, on the other hand, includes credit rating models estimated also with a linear regression method. The adjustment variables are added one at a time in the rating models in order to investigate the association between <b>financial</b> statement <b>adjustments</b> and ratings. In an additional test, the explanatory powers resulting from reported and adjusted data are compared. First, the evidence suggests that capital intensity, operative risk and leverage are important in explaining <b>financial</b> statement <b>adjustments.</b> Additionally, public companies face fewer adjustments relative to private companies. The ultimate underlying reason for <b>financial</b> statement <b>adjustments</b> seems to be company-specific decisions concerning financing and capital structure as well as contractual matters. Second, the evidence demonstrates that, without any adjustments, credit ratings are higher for companies reporting under IFRS relative to companies reporting under US GAAP. However, adjustments increase ratings for US companies. On the other hand, local GAAP adjustments decrease rating relative to US GAAP.

5000|$|The Financial Economic Journal article: [...] "Law, finance, and {{economic}} growth in China" [...] by Allen and Qian (2005), critically and creatively evaluates through comparisons and inferences on China’ alternative institutional arrangement, governing systems, law, and formal financial system,. It also assesses the relationship between China’s economic growth and other countries’ financial development systems. such as the Stock Market. Contemporary studies cited on China's legal and fiscal systems establishments indicate signs of underdevelopment despite the rapid economic growth compared to other countries. (Liang & Teng, 2006). For instance, the Chinese private sector grow is less inclusive equated to other Listed and State sector thereby demanding transformation to eliminate deficiencies. Comparatively, the Chinese State and listed sectors indicate successful development based on alternative mechanisms employed to build institutional relationships and reputation for other economies. Consequently, exposure of the key factors connecting the Chinese formal systems, financial, law, {{and economic}} growth lead {{to an understanding of}} how the nonstandard mechanisms impacts on promoting optimal growth and development for China and other countries (Allen, Qian & Qian, 2005). Broadly, the article employs scholarly evidence to explore China’s legal, financial and growth sectors visualizing the Status of Chinese economic based on GPD and growth to contrast the issue against the emerging economies rather than the developed ones. Allen, Qian, and Qian, explore the Chinese firms’ financial sources based on aggregated evidence as well as cross-cross country evidence on annual growth rates, Purchase Power Parity, and population density. They also access evidence on both Listed and Private Sector to demonstrate different types of the corporate governance, stocks, ownership structures, financing, valuation, and dividends. Survey and anecdotal evidence, for example, were used by the author to provide background information on the successful regions evaluated as a justification of the findings and results obtained.Agreeing with the Article Argument: Analyses on the authors’ argument in the article indicate delivery of facts, figures, and substantiation from an informed and expert position, which make it worth agreeing with the authors’ arguments. The article covers the visualization of China’ as an alternative institutional arrangement, with different governing systems, law, and formal financial system. These areas form China’s economic growth and relate well with its development targets and agenda. They are also factual through the use of figures and numbers and can be measured scientifically, socially and politically given the current chine’s position as an emerging economy and as an influence in the world economy.The second reason for agreeing with the article {{is a result of the}} examinations provided in the three major economic sectors that include the state and government controlled companies and enterprises, the publicly traded and exchange sector called listed and the private sector, which is under private ownership. In reviewing the imbalance of the three sectors, and the support for private sector, the article is keen on using measures that include banking systems’ domination and the ongoing privatization process. It samples more than 1000 firms, listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) with an indication of concentrated equity on State for firms converted from the State Sector and founder families for the private firms (Allen, Qian & Qian, 2005).As demonstrated from the research by Liang and Teng (2006), the status of the Chinese economy, which is also the position of the article, make it among the most impactful in the world. The country's growth domestic Product (GDP) in 2002 stood at U.S $1,237 ahead of Canada and Spain but now is at $11,391.620 only behind the United States (China GDP, 1960-2016). The feat is remarkable given that China’s rapid growth only started in 1979. Other comparisons in the article indicate the same effect of fast Chinese growth. On the legal system, China classifies as an English-origin, which is true given the protection offered to investments and the upholding of creditor and shareholder rights. These attributes, also proclaimed by Liang and Teng, (2006) contribute to strengthening the financial system allowing venture in various finance and capital markets and line with the country's equity versus the population. The mitigation measures outlined in the article such as the formation of the state-owned asset management companies assigned to cash recovery on the bad loans and improving loan structures. Based on an outright reliability of the authors’ point of view the’ findings and results, I find them accurate and reliable to generalize or use for future studies. One way for this is the referencing from credible sources such as financial, law and politic journals, empirical perspectives, case studies and renowned authors among others further justifying the article’s standpoint. For instance, the authors employ both survey and anecdotal evidence to obtain the background information about the most successful regions or sectors in China.Evaluating the authors’ argument persuasiveness based on the consistency of point made for the authors' key inferences and assumptions. The general assumption made by the authors while exploring the topic of research is that the economic status, legal systems and financial system of a country affect the overall economic growth and development. The brief description of the authors’ variables and sources, strong inferences and conclusion serves as the best tool and build up in building the authors’ arguments. For this reason, I concur with the authors’ arguments on the topic of study about China’s financial, legal {{and economic growth}}.Reflection on the Economic and Financial in China: Statistically, an economic and financial study of China’s financial, law, institutions and economic growth in shows that China serves as a counter example in analyzing weak financial and legal systems despite fastest growing economies Liang & Teng, 2006). The economic and financial phenomenon as learned in previous literature tends to support market-based systems where openness and the role of the state play an important part in the country’s financial system development. From a deregulation and financial liberalization point of view, relational, financial systems are regarded as a better approach for long-term Chinese economic development compared to a market-based system (Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003). In this regard, the Chinese economic growths evolve as the financial systems progress with the financial globalization changes and the alterations of the Chinese power relationships (Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003).,Also, the economic politics affects financial systems directly. The economic and financial systems constitute financial institutions and market arrangements that channel the country’s savings for corporate governance and productive uses. Though, as asserted by (Lee, 2015), the positive correlation between economic and financial development result to better monitoring and allocation of financial resources where financial systems are either categorized as bank-based or market-based. Therefore, similar financial market development and banks influence on the economic outcome. Chinese lower economic performance compared to the developed economies is as a result of inadequate financial and legal systems based on its inefficiency market-based system (Lee, 2015). This is an indication of a high moral hazard that exposes the government policies to economic fragility and financial crisis.While no financial system is complete, each of the Chinese market and bank-based financial systems has its benefits and disadvantagesMarket-based financial systems are considered stronger and better compared to bank market systems as they can generate adequate data about different firms' performance as well as reflecting on all the fundamentals requirements in a real financial sector (Lee, 2015). The components of the stock market are use essential in the effective financial motoring process atas they can visualize market stock prices and potential bad economic performances (Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003). Therefore, maximizing the stock market values by firms has a positive implication of improving the economic growth and performance. However, financial market success gives a better reason for corporate groups to allocate resources to their affiliate firms. This reason, China uses bank loans and self-fundraising commercial channels as financial channels to finance Chinese, companies consequently determining the stock market bottom line through price speculations that lead to high transaction costs (Lee, 2015). Evaluation of the Chinese bank-based systems benefits and their particular limitations demonstrate that the existing financial debts help in solving cash flow misreporting as it exerts economic disciplinary effect.Alternative governance and financial mechanism serve as a turning point in supporting the growth and development of the Chinese private sector through reputation and relationship that enable firms to overcome asymmetric data problems that inhibit contract enforcement and coalitions. Cultural and religious factors also play a significant role in investors’ protection, institutional development and legal origin in venturing capital industry growth and development. (Bruton & Ahlstrom, 2003). To add to these factors, the Chinese economic situation has high social trusts that serve as an alternative mechanism for the development of substantial financial incentives to increase economic participation. Product and input market competitions work successfully in the country by creating a relatively strong comparative advantage for organization thriving and survival. Moreover, the existence of low entry barriers promotes high levels of market competitions allowing companies to grow and develop economically. The financial, legal, and economic environment control and ownership separation protect shareholders in countries with dominant ownership structures. such as China. At the same time, input suppliers cooperation by forming market compliances and coalitions ensures the optimal outcome of financing and legal systems. (Bruton n& Ahlstrom, 2003). However, profit sharing among the firms enables firms’ growth, reputations, and contractual agreement. As a transitional economy, China and its firms have to adjust both their financial and legal systems to strengthen their economic growth and development. The result will be a diversified commercial work for the transitional economy that is likely to work regardless of the socialistic Adopt drastic economic reforms such the Chinese economy may not work due to the Confucius's influence that essential changes in society should be gradual and fully implemented only after they prove correct, thus reinforcing the existing financial and legal systemsThrough analyzing different governance systems and their economic support, much can be learned from the Chinese Communist Party based on its autocratic nature, but with the ability to support and promote financial and legal systems for economic growth especially for Private Sector. The government plays a significant role in financial, legal and economic growth reform process especially for transitional and socialist economies. (Liang & Teng, 2006). As socialist governments experience limited support for economic grow progression, much can be observed from democratic economies and richer countries in supporting financial and legal systems. (Liang & Teng, 2006). For instance, the government officials play a vital role in implementing alternative governing mechanisms and institutional arrangements for the development of financial and legal systems and should be consulted for efficient implementation of an alternative mechanism for economic development. They also help incorporate the three pillars of financial and legal system constructions entailing information systems, legal environment, and market support system. The Chinese legal environment allows normal market operations as information systems address asymmetric constructs based on information credibility and authoritativeness (Bruton &Ahlstrom, 2003). Finally, market support systems allow investors in alternative mechanisms to improve their experiences and expertise.Suggestions for Future Reforms Economic Financial Phenomenon in China: The future financial and economic reforms should be directed towards the liberalization of financial and economic matters as globalization takes effect in many countries. Future studies need to encourage China’s successful Private Sector transformation to better alternative methods in the state deficiency and listed sectors As suggested by Lee (2015), it is imperative that future explorations on financial opening, liberalization and globalization conducted to visualize proficient <b>financial</b> <b>adjustments</b> that include changes in financial systems, handling a crisis, and alterations in the legal functions. It is equally important to implement better legislative policies that strengthen the pillars of financial and juridical systems construction such as education, information systems, money control, the legal environment, and support market systems. As a populous nation, there is a need to have reforms in areas including social welfare, housing, insurance, employment policies and the state-owned enterprises, which affect the financial system. These will be achieved through initiating favorable determinant areas that include taxation, foreign investment policy, exit policy, power to make decisions, and decentralization thereby ensuring credibility and disclosure of vital information connect economic growth, finance, and legal systems. It is expected that the reforms will be pragmatic due to the obvious basis of experimentation of rather than the use of ideology in China, but adopting a more rapid and privatized system that leases operation of the state-owned assets (Lee, 2015). Consequently, the move will promote efficiency for the enterprises and allow or encourage the development of other non-state and foreign sectors that highly account for China’s economic growth.|$|E

40|$|Concerning the {{characterisation}} or {{classification of}} municipalities {{a wide range}} of different approaches exists. Usually some historical, functional, and/or political indicators are used for such a classification. These indicators are usually structured simple, referring to inhabitant size, political importance, configuration of available infrastructure like hospitals and schools, places of work, or the like. However, an application field, where a quite specific, meaningful, and comprehensible classification for each municipality is of fundamental interest, is the local <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> between communities on the same hierarchical administrative level. Which municipality delivers gladly more money than it is forced to do by law, or which community renounces voluntarily external support? Therefore, well elaborated indicators are needed to define the amount of money which has to be transferred, generally spoken, from rich communities to the poorer ones. However, it is obvious that a pure redistribution of revenues between financially strong and financially weak communities, which would lead in principle to a more or less equal financial configuration of the communities, is not sufficient for a fair system of <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Such a redistribution system would not consider the different financial loads of the budgets of different types of communes. These varying financial loads for varying types of commues can be characterised by the following two concepts: 'costs of width' and 'costs of density'. The 'costs of width' are explained mainly by geographical reasons for peripheral and/or mountainous communities with low population density, which implies specific financial load for the particular community. By contrast, 'costs of density' are explained by disproportional high socio-demographic burdens and high costs of infrastructure in central and urban communities. Meaningful indicators for such a financially oriented classification of municipalities need detailed investigations, to be silent completely of that these indicators also need political acceptance, in the end. This paper presents a study carried out for the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, which made part of the cantonal revision of the system of inter-communal <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The aim was to provide means for a cantonal regulation on how the <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> between the communities should be regulated. Therefore, socio-demographic and geographic indicators have been evaluated in order to find rules to reflect the financial load of the municipal budgets. The heuristically driven statistical modelling has been carried out using multiple regression. Besides the presentation of the technical approach, this paper discusses the analysed indicators in the perspective of regional policy and territorial justice. ...|$|R

Nesse sentido, foram avaliados dois indicadores de pressão económica – necessidades materiais insatisfeitas e cortes e ajustamentos financeiros – e o funcionamento familiar numa amostra de 263 sujeitos constituída por 76 pais, 95 mães e 92 filhos jovens adultos entre os 18 e os 29 anos. De um modo geral, os resultados apontam para a existência de repercussões da pressão económica no funcionamento familiar. Especificamente: (1) no grupo dos pais as necessidades materiais insatisfeitas contribuíram significativamente para um pior funcionamento familiar e os cortes e ajustamentos financeiros para um melhor funcionamento familiar; e (2) no grupo dos filhos jovens adultos as necessidades materiais insatisfeitas contribuíram significativamente para um pior funcionamento familiar. Este estudo contribui para aprofundar o conhecimento acerca do impacto de uma crise económica na vida das famílias e, em particular, no seu funcionamento familiar. Em termos de futuro, revela-se essencial continuar a explorar a experiência das famílias em contextos de crise económica, em especial nas distintas fases do ciclo vital. Research {{has shown}} that living under economic pressure can negatively influence several family processes. In order to contribute towards the understanding of an eventual relationship between economic pressure and family functioning, this research has as its main goal the study of these variables in families with young adult children. In this sense, the influence of two indicators of economic pressure - unmet material needs and cuts and <b>financial</b> <b>adjustments</b> - on the family functioning was assessed {{in a sample of}} 263 subjects consisting of 76 fathers, 95 mothers and 92 young adults between the ages of 18 and 29. In general the results point to the existence of an impact on the perception of fathers, mothers and young adult children about economic pressure on family functioning. Specifically: (1) the group of parents unmet material needs have significantly contributed to a worse perception of family functioning and cuts and <b>financial</b> <b>adjustments</b> contributed for a better perception of the operation; and (2) in the group of young adult children it were unmet material needs that significantly contributed to the perception of a poor family functioning. This study thus contributes to deepen the knowledge about the impact of a economic crisis in family life and in particular in their family functioning. In terms of the future, it will be essential to continue to explore the experience of families in economic crisis contexts, especially in the different phases of the life cycle...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a study of}} rational expectations and financial ratio smoothing. Dynamic adjustment models {{have been used in}} traditional accounting and financial analysis to capture the temporal pattern of financial ratios. Empirical studies of <b>financial</b> ratio <b>adjustment</b> based on these models typically use the current or past industry average ratio as the desired target. The determination of the correct desired target ratio is important for analyzing <b>financial</b> ratio <b>adjustment.</b> The issue of expectation formation is relevant for the type of <b>financial</b> ratio <b>adjustment</b> model considered here involving an adjustment lag. When there is no adjustment lag, expectations are generally irrelevant because a firm can always respond to any change in the market conditions. The paper proposes a rational expectations-partial adjustment model to explain the behavior of some important financial ratios. The model incorporates a process of expectation formation, which is considerably more general than any of the previous specifications in the financial ratio movements rather well...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES—The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine (1) trends concerning financial assistance from the national government to local governments, (2) trends regarding death rates and life expectancies among prefectures, and (3) the effect of the national <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> policy in equalising both the revenues of local governments and variations in the health levels among prefectures in terms of death rates and life expectancies.  DESIGN—The study analysed prefectural income, the amount of national taxes collected, financial assistance from the national government to local governments, and age adjusted death rates and life expectancies of all of the prefectures in Japan during the period from 1965  through 1995.  MAIN RESULTS—(1) Under the <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> policy, <b>financial</b> assistance from the national government to the local governments, which consists of the sum of the local allocation tax and treasury disbursements, increased from 1831  billion yen in 1965  to 31   116 billion yen in 1995.  (2) During the same period, the age adjusted death rate per 100   000 people decreased from 1168. 9  (1965) to 545. 3  (1995). The range of variation in the age adjusted death rate among prefectures diminished as the coefficient of variation of the death rate declined from 0. 060  in 1965  to 0. 043  in 1995.  (3) There was a significant statistical correlation between higher prefectural incomes and lower mortality rates during from 1965  until 1975  (p <  0. 05), whereas this correlation was indistinct in the 1980 s and has not been observed since 1990.  (4) The relative health level of Tokyo has declined in terms of its ranking among all the prefectures with regard to life expectancy, from being the best in 1965  to below average in 1995.  CONCLUSIONS—The national <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> policy to balance the revenues of local governments has increased the health levels of rural prefectures. It is probable that the policy reduced the disparity in death rates and life expectancies among prefectures throughout the country. However, the policy has precluded the nation's capital city from applying its economic resources as local government expenditures to deal with the megacity issues affecting health.    Keywords: fiscal adjustment policy; mortality disparit...|$|R
40|$|The civil {{consequences}} {{of corruption in}} international commercial contracts are poorly mapped under English private law, despite the economic importance of English law in governing international contracts. England seeks to balance protecting the main economic transaction (eg the main infrastructure project, the main provision of goods) benefitting the principal (eg a foreign public authority) with harsh treatment of the corrupting transaction itself, ie the transaction between the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker. The starting point in English law for addressing corruption {{is the relationship between}} the principal and its agent. Even though the Bribery Act 2010 moved away from this principal/agent relationship to address corruption from a criminal law perspective, the UK Supreme Court relied on this principal/agent relationship in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC, where it held that the agent held the product of corruption in trust for his principal. The question remains whether such <b>financial</b> <b>adjustments</b> developed by the judges are a sufficient punishment or deterrence against corruption. They may offer a clear and simple answer signalling clearly that English judges disapprove of corruption as a serious evil. However, as a matter of public policy, a range of other techniques may need to be developed to discourage corruption in a more systematic way among all the parties involved, the bribe-giver included...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and utilizes a new general equilibrium simulation model of capital income taxation. Its chief advantage over existing {{models of the}} effects of taxation is that it recognizes that agents may adjust their financial behavior in response to changes in the way that capital income is taxed. By integrating a structural treatment of portfolio choice and financial markets into a standard multi-sector model of taxation, the model can trace the general equilibrium impact of these <b>financial</b> <b>adjustments</b> and calculate the tax-induced changes in the allocation of factors and output as well as the distributional effects of any tax change. The model is used to simulate the impact of completely indexing the tax system for inflation. The results indicate there would be significant financial adjustment in response to indexing. A large shift in the distribution of private risk bearing accompanies a slight reallocation of the capital stock away from owner-occupied housing toward its other uses and a substantial change in the ownership of the housing stock by income class. All in all, indexing the tax system of an economy like the U. S. in 1977 seems to lead to an efficiency gain, slightly hurts the lowest income classes, and substantially improves the welfare of the highest income groups. The simulation results should, however, be considered tentative due to uncertainty about the values of several parameters and the relatively simple formulations of the determinants of portfolio choice and the U. S. financial structure. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the use of {{financial}} information and valuation methods among private equity funds in Europe and India. The authors analyze differences in the choice of valuation methods and how the use of financial information differs among funds in the UK, Pan Europe and India. Design/methodology/approach – A survey approach was utilized in collecting proprietary data from European and Indian private equity funds. The data were classified according to fund type, country grouping, size, risk profile, labor cost and industry structure and analyzed using MANOVA and ANOVA. Findings – The results show that the use of valuation models is relatively homogeneous across countries and that the use of financial information appears to be driven to a large extent by fund type and fund focus. The use of audited financial statements appears to increase as firms mature. Significant differences were found in standard <b>financial</b> <b>adjustments</b> between the two fund types and between the country groupings. Results based on labor cost are weakly significant whereas industry structure does not appear to have an impact on how fund managers evaluate investments. Research limitations/implications – The results indicate that fund managers adapt their decision-making behavior according to investment type and risk. The authors argue that understanding asymmetrical and structural issues may potentially improve investment decision-making processes. The main conclusion for researchers is that buy-out and venture capital funds should not be combined as one asset class. Since a survey approach was used, the study is subject to the belief that fund managers do not internalize decisions well, which could reduce the effectiveness of the research design. Originality/value – There are few studies in the areas covered by this paper due to the proprietary nature of the private equity industry. The results are important because they help in understanding how fund managers use decision aids such as financial statements and valuation techniques. A better understanding of current practices will help fund managers and fund sponsors in devising improved decision aids and processes, which ultimately may lead to fewer non-performing investments. This is especially important in private equity since investment decisions are often irreversible and binary. Equity capital, Europe, Financial reporting, Financial risk, India, Venture capital...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} stylized intertemporal forward-looking model able that {{accommodates}} key regional economic features, {{an area where}} the literature is not well developed. The main difference, from the standard applications, is the role of saving and its implication for the balance of payments. Though maintaining dynamic forward-looking behaviour for agents, the rate of private saving is exogenously determined and so no neoclassical <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> is needed. Also, we focus on the similarities and the differences between myopic and forward-looking models, highlighting the divergences among the main adjustment equations and the resulting simulation outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the exchange rate}} predictability stemming from the equilibrium model of international <b>financial</b> <b>adjustment</b> developed by Gourinchas and Rey (2007). Using predictive variables that measure cyclical external imbalances for country pairs, we assess the ability of this model to forecast out-of-sample four major US dollar exchange rates using various economic criteria of model evaluation. The analysis shows that the model provides economic value to a risk-averse investor, delivering substantial utility gains when switching from a portfolio strategy based on the random walk benchmark to one that conditions on cyclical external imbalances. foreign exchange; fundamentals; global imbalances; predictability...|$|R
