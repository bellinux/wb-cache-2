50|$|The {{train was}} {{streamlined}} after wind tunnel experiments, {{a sort of}} research which was pioneered by the developers of the high-speed interurban railcar Bullet {{a couple of years}} before. The Fliegender Hamburger design was very similar to the Bullet's. Its lightweight, articulated construction and Jakobs bogies were also known on the US interurban scene. However, the Fliegender Hamburger had diesel-electric propulsion. Each of the two coaches had a 12-cylinder Maybach diesel engine with a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> directly coupled to it, which drove a Tatzlager traction motor.

It came equipped with or without dynamic brakes. This locomotive shared the same common frame with the SD39, SD38, SD40 and SD45. The SD38AC is basically the transition engine between the SD38 and the SD38-2. 15 examples of this model were built; 6 for B&LE, 8 for DMIR and one for BC Hydro.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} a {{prototype}} diesel locomotive which could work through London's tube tunnels was first considered in 1936, and work began on its construction at Acton Works in 1939. It was designed to use its diesel engine when in the open air, but to draw current from {{the third and fourth}} rail when underground. Two Brush built 1915 Stock (also known as 'Ealing Stock') driving motors, numbered 3937 and 3941, which had been withdrawn from the Central London line, were converted into the electro-diesel locomotive. The work involved scrapping the passenger saloons and joining the two driving ends together to form a double ended locomotive. The central bay held a six-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine, manufactured by Petters, which was coupled to a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with these conditions, when a conductor or conductors move through {{a magnetic field}} to cut the lines of force, electrons are enabled to enter the conduction band thereby inducing an electric pressure {{for the production of}} alternating current in an external circuit. This may be referred to as an elementary alternator, consisting of a single wire loop called an armature with each end being attached to slip-rings and arranged so as to revolve midway between the magnetic poles. Two copper-graphite brushes connect with the external circuit on the slip-rings in order to collect the alternating current, generated in the conductor when the alternator is in operation. Another machine used for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of electromagnetic induction is called a dynamo or <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
50|$|When it was built, the New Yorker Hotel had {{coal-fired}} steam boilers and generators {{sufficient to}} produce more than 2,200 kilowatts of <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> electric power.

50|$|Pearl Street Station was {{the first}} {{commercial}} central power plant in the world. It was located at 255-257 Pearl Street in Manhattan on a site measuring 50 by 100 ft, just south of Fulton Street and fired by coal. It began with one <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator,</b> and it started generating electricity on September 4, 1882, serving an initial load of 400 lamps at 82 customers. By 1884, Pearl Street Station was serving 508 customers with 10,164 lamps. The station was built by the Edison Illuminating Company, which was headed by Thomas Edison. The station was originally powered by custom-made Porter-Allen high-speed steam engines designed to provide 175 horsepower at 700 rpm, but these proved to be unreliable with their sensitive governors. They were removed and replaced with new engines from Armington & Sims {{that proved to be}} much more suitable for Edison's dynamos.|$|E
50|$|While {{numerous}} studies illustrate technological {{systems that have}} been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes, who gives a historical account {{of the development of}} Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.|$|E
50|$|The Gepard is also {{equipped}} with a Daimler-Benz (type: OM 314) 4-cylinder diesel auxiliary engine for the energy supply system. This engine is on the front left of the vehicle, located where the Leopard 1 has an ammunition magazine. The engine, which has a 3.8 liter capacity, is designed as a multi-fuel engine and produces 66 kW (90 PS). It consumes, depending on the operational status of the tank, between 10 and 20 liters per hour (l/h). The auxiliary engine is coupled with five generators to operate at different speeds: Two Metadyn machines in tandem with a flywheel (which is used to store energy during the acceleration and deceleration of the turret) for {{the power of the}} elevation and traverse drives, two 380-Hz three-phase generators with a capacity of 20 kVA for the ventilation, fire control and radar systems, and a 300-A 28-volt <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> for the electrical system.

The coal-fire steam heating plant was built with its tall chimney. Later, coal was replaced by oil, then by wood. A larger water tower was built and a steam pump was used to pump water from the lake through a 6" [...] copper pipe. The potable water still came from the well at the previous water tower. Concrete tunnels were used to deliver water and steam to all the buildings. Between the nun's villa and the sanatorium, the tunnel was {{large enough to be}} used by employees during the hard winters when the temperature often drops below forty degrees. A steam turbine drove a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b> In 1950, it was replaced by two alternative current generators with two diesel engines each (used alternatively) that also supplied the village until the prolongation of Hydro Québec's power lines in 1967-1968.|$|E

50|$|Before AC {{electric}} {{generators and}} the newly invented transformers were invented only DC electrical generators {{could be used to}} generate electrical power and they were restricted by their low voltage requirements to economically transmitting power for only a few miles. Too much power was lost in transmission at low voltage for long distance power transmission to be practical. This meant the original power stations were restricted (at that time) to local steam generating plants built right in each local neighborhood. Pearl Street Station was the first central power plant in the United States. It was located at 255-257 Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan on a site measuring 50 by 100 feet (15 by 30 m), just south of Fulton Street. It began with one <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> powered by a coal burning steam engine, and it started generating electricity on September 4, 1882, serving an initial load of 400 incandescent lamps used by 85 customers located within about 2 mi of the station. Using transformers to convert the generated power to a much higher voltage for transmission allowed the power plants and users to be separated by hundreds of miles if needed. The high voltage could then use transformers to obtain lower voltages for final use.Single point failures were minimized in the plant design. The AC generators and their associated water turbines were so large that they could not be shipped by rail and were shipped 19000 mi around Cape Horn by ship. Only two of the four alternating current generators were operating on July 13, 1895 when the powerhouse provided the first electricity to Sacramento via 22 mi of transmission lines, {{making it one of the}} first places in the United States to transmit long-distance hydroelectric power. The Folsom power plant predates Niagara Falls Adams power House generating AC electrical transmission for local use and shipment to Buffalo, New York in 1897. The International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891 in Frankfurt am Main Germany demonstrated an earlier instance of long distance AC transmission of hydroelectric power. Westinghouse Electric Company and General Electric were in a race to develop better equipment and bring it to the United States.|$|E
50|$|All E-units {{used the}} same EMD {{passenger}} truck design by engineer Martin Blomberg. This was an A1A-A1A truck, with the outer axles powered and the center axle unpowered. Like the well-known two-axle Blomberg B trucks, these trucks had outside spring hangers between the wheels for better cushioning of side-to-side motion. Also like the Blomberg B, there were no drop equalizers between the axles. Two <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> powered four traction motors, two on each truck, in an A1A-A1A arrangement. This truck design was used on all E units and on CB&Q 9908 and MP 7100 power cars. The success of the design is shown by the few changes to it over the years.|$|R
50|$|Developments {{in power}} systems {{continued}} beyond the nineteenth century.
