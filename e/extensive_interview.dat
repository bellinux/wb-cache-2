5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was {{fully aware of the}} talents he possessed as a player; {{there is some evidence that}} he sought to influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an <b>extensive</b> <b>interview</b> for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{replied to}} this blog post citing his own <b>extensive</b> <b>interview</b> with Shoup that {{directly}} contradicts Shoup's later version of events. Wright also cites interviews he conducted with other Marines {{in the unit}} that differ from Shoup's account, noting that Shoup's direct superior, Major Eckloff, claimed to have single-handedly killed at least 17 insurgents with a shotgun fired from his truck. Wright states that he reduced that number to 1-2 after other sources contradicted Eckloff. Wright states that his book had {{to take into consideration}} interviews {{from a wide variety of}} Marines in the battalion, including officers, and could not advance the perspective of just one person.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August, Pravda {{published}} an <b>extensive</b> <b>interview</b> with Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, {{chairman of a}} 26-member commission {{set up by the}} Congress of People's Deputies to investigate the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocols. During the interview, Yakovlev admitted that the secret protocols were genuine. He condemned the protocols, but maintained that they had no impact on the incorporation of the Baltic states. Thus Moscow reversed its long-standing position that the secret protocols did not exist or were forgeries, but did not concede that events of 1940 constituted an occupation. It was clearly not enough to satisfy the Baltics and on 22 August, a commission of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR announced that the occupation in 1940 was {{a direct result of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and therefore illegal. It was the first time that an official Soviet body challenged the legitimacy of the Soviet rule.|$|E

500|$|Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one {{and only}} live concert during this period. The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall {{as part of a}} Music and Fashion Festival. The trio {{performed}} four songs, [...] "Terrapin", [...] "Gigolo Aunt", [...] "Effervescing Elephant" [...] and [...] "Octopus". Poor mixing left the vocals barely audible until part-way through the last number. At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off the stage. The performance has been bootlegged. Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio, recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971. [...] All three came from the Barrett album. After this session, he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an <b>extensive</b> <b>interview</b> with Mick Rock and Rolling Stone in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about touring with Jimi Hendrix and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with.|$|E
