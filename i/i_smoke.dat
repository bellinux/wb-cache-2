500|$|Disney's {{public persona}} was very {{different}} from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as [...] "almost painfully shy... diffident" [...] and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney [...] "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" [...] and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the fa√ßade, and told a friend that [...] "I'm not Walt Disney. I {{do a lot of things}} Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. <b>I</b> <b>smoke.</b> Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." [...] Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called the private Disney: [...] "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." [...] Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said [...] "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, <b>I</b> <b>smoke</b> way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it." [...] He expressed.|$|E
2500|$|Boehner {{appeared}} on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on January 23, 2014. When asked by Leno {{if he would}} ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, [...] "I like to play golf.

2500|$|In the 1930s, Heston {{went into}} the real estate {{business}} in Detroit. [...] He also established a cemetery in Flat Rock, Michigan. [...] Heston ran a half-mile every morning until he was age 75, and remained vigorous and active into his eighties. [...] A short time before his death at age 85, Heston told a reporter, [...] "I don't run the half mile any more and I've quit going to dances, but <b>I</b> <b>smoke</b> seven cigars a day and I'm {{having a lot of}} fun loafing and living." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went into}} my own room and {{prepared}} to pack after noting down {{the facts of the}} case. As <b>I</b> <b>smoked</b> <b>I</b> heard the game begin again,--with a miss in balk this time, for the whir was a short one.|$|R

6000|$|... 'What, {{not in your}} own, eh?' Mr. Omer returned, laughing. 'All the better, sir. Bad habit for a young man. Take a seat. <b>I</b> <b>smoke,</b> myself, for the asthma.' ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{all have}} the right to write about our lives, and she does, too. If the book is insightful, if it helps people, I may be applauding it.I'm sure most of the things she says are true. <b>I</b> <b>smoked</b> grass, <b>I</b> ran around, I found excuses to stay on the road. It got so bad that <b>I</b> <b>smoked</b> grass to numb myself. It took me a year to where my brain worked again. I no longer think of grass as harmless. We were in the death throes of a marriage. She should ask herself how did she not see these things.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, {{except that}} <b>I</b> <b>smoke</b> {{more than usual}} when I am lonely. And then, too, it's such a long-standing habit. I learned when I was only a youngster." ...|$|E
