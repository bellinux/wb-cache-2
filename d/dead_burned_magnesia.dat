40|$|In {{magnesia}} plant, annular {{vertical shaft}} kilns - high temperature processing units, {{are used for}} the production of <b>dead</b> <b>burned</b> <b>Magnesia.</b> Vertical Shaft kilns such as those operating at the reference magnesia plant are known to be efficient. However, the knowledge of thermal processes and physical behaviours inside the operating kiln has not yet been studied in detailed. This is mainly due to the high working temperature inside the kiln which makes temperature and pressure measurements very difficult and expensive or almost impossible. The inability to obtain such information has limited the optimisation of the kiln's process variables. With increasing knowledge and computing power, computational modelling is becoming a readily used resource for improving processes that occurs in a vertical shaft kiln. This study represents the review of the thermodynamic processes of <b>dead</b> <b>burned</b> <b>magnesia</b> production with an integrated view to improving energy efficiency of magnesia production and to achieve environmental sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{phosphate}} cements (MPCs) are {{materials that}} belong to chemically bonded ceramic materials. They have {{a wide range of}} potential applications, due to their superior performance. In this paper, the reaction products and cementing mechanism of magnesium phosphate bonded cement based on the <b>dead</b> <b>burned</b> <b>magnesia</b> and the mono-potassium phosphate (M PP) are investigated. Fine powder and grains of <b>dead</b> <b>burned</b> <b>magnesia</b> were used to prepare pure cement paste and bonding cluster samples, respectively. The cement reaction products and their micro-morphology in the both different samples are examined. The microstructure of specimens is analyzed by SEM, TEM, XDR, and optical microscopy. Struvite of potassium (MgKPO 4. 6 H(2) O) is observed in the reaction products. According to the analysis, it is found that struvite exists in both crystalline and amorphous form. There is also residual magnesia in the hardened cement paste. By means of microscopy observation, {{it can be seen that}} reaction products form around the unreacted magnesia and can develop into a continuum structure, which further produces the hardened paste. Struvite can grow up to form the more perfect crystal in a long term curing age, if large enough space is available during the hydration process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.

40|$|A novel {{phosphate}} bonded {{magnesia cement}} was developed recently, which sets quickly and develops high {{strength in the}} early ages.

Interestingly, {{the strength of the}} cement increase with the content of fly ash, from 10 % - 40 % by weight. The hardened cement paste has a dense microstructure, low open porosity and water sorptivity due to the low water to binder ratio.

40|$|The {{galvanic}} processes {{used for}} coating metallic or plastic surfaces generate wastes {{that should be}} properly treated before their disposal in a landfill. Stabilization /Solidification (S/S) converts them to solids and reduces the release of heavy metals. In this study, three real wastes (an exhausted electroless nickel plating bath, an exhausted chromium electroplating bath and a zinc plating sludge) were stabilized using different reagents: Portland cement type I, Portland cement mixed with soluble silicates and magnesium phosphate cements prepared with MgO extrapure or hard <b>burned</b> <b>magnesia</b> of about 70 % purity and phosphates like Na 3 PO 4, Na 2 HPO 4 or KH 2 PO 4. In order to analyze the retention of the heavy metals by the matrix the samples were subjected to the leaching test number 2 of the Spanish Order 13 / 10 / 89 (similar to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure of the U. S. EPA). Heavy metal concentration of the leachate was determined using ICP-MS. It was found that magnesium phosphate cements obtained by mixing hard <b>burned</b> <b>magnesia</b> with the different phosphates are appropriate for the Stabilization/Solidification (S/S) of the wastes containing nickel and zinc.

40|$|High-quality {{magnesium}} hydroxide powders {{can be produced}} by hydrating slow-reacting magnesia in dilute magnesium acetate solutions.

40|$|Magnesium {{potassium}} phosphate cement (MKPC) {{is a kind}} of cementitious binder in which the chemical bond is formed via a heterogeneous acid-base reaction between <b>dead</b> <b>burned</b> <b>magnesia</b> powder and {{potassium phosphate}} solution at room temperature. Small amount of boron compounds can be incorporated in the cement as a setting retarder. The final reaction product of MgO-KH 2 PO 4 -H 2 O ternary system is identified as magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate, MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O. However, the mechanisms and procedures through which this crystalline product is formed and the conditions under which the crystallization process would be influenced are not yet clear. Understanding of the reaction mechanism of the system is helpful for developing new methodologies to control the rapid reaction process and furthermore, to adjust the phase assemblage of the binder, and to enhance the macroscopic properties. This study is mainly focused on the examination of the reaction mechanism of MKPC. In addition, the formulation optimization, microstructure characterization and field application in rapid repair are also systematically studied. The chemical reactions between magnesia and potassium dihydrogen phosphate are essentially an acid-base reaction with strong heat release, the pH and temperature variation throughout the reaction process could provide useful information to disclose the different stages in the reaction. However, {{it would be very difficult}} to conduct such tests on the cement paste due to the limited water content and fast setting. In the current research, the reaction mechanism of MKPC is investigated on the diluted MKPC system through monitoring the pH and temperature development, identification of the solid phase formed, and measurement of the ionic concentration of the solution. The reaction process can be explained as follows: when magnesia and potassium phosphate powder are mixed with water, phosphate is readily dissolved, which is instantly followed by the dissociation of magnesia. With the increase of magnesium ions in the solution, MgHPO 4 · 7 H 2 O is the first product precipitated, and its crystallization is accompanied with the increase of both pH and temperature. Beyond pH of 7, MgHPO 4 · 7 H 2 O is transformed to Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O, leading to a slight decrease of pH. The following dramatic increase of pH may be due to the formation of Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O. Finally, Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O gradually transforms to MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O and leads to the second decrease of pH. Both increasing molar ratio of magnesium to phosphate (M/P) and decreasing the weight ratio of liquid to solid can speed up the reaction rate while addition of small amount of boron compounds can prolong the process even though the products are not changed. The retarding mechanism of boron compounds is related to their buffering effect on the pH of the solution, i. e. decreasing pH development rate, leads to delaying the formation of reaction products. The performance of MKPC based cementitious materials can be significantly influenced by M/P molar ratio, addition of setting retarder, water content, fly ash replacement of magnesia and aggregate usage. Therefore, the formulation of MKPC based materials is optimized in terms of workability, compressive strength, and cost consideration. With optimized formulation, MKPC mortars show high early compressive and flexural strength, superior bond strength to ordinary Portland cement mortar/concrete substrate, and low drying shrinkage. Undoubtedly, the mechanical properties of this cement is closely related to its inner composition and microstructure. The microstructure examination shows that the phase assemblage and the morphology characteristics of MKPC paste vary with the different formulae. In the formulation with lower M/P ratio of 2, KH 2 PO 4 residues can be found in a flat, smooth, and bulky mass form. The reaction product MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O, can be observed as acicular crystal habit with large aspect ratio of 30. With the increase of M/P ratio, MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O is crystallized in a larger size and the morphology is changed from acicular to bladed and then prismatic shape. The magnesia residues can be well identified in all of the formulations...|$|E
