50|$|Since the {{relevant}} information, in photoemission spectroscopy, {{is contained in}} the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> of the photoelectrons, a specific device is needed to energy-filter the electrons emitted (or scattered) by the sample.Electrostatic monochromators {{are the most common}} choice. The older design, a CMA, represents a trade-off between the need for high count rates and high angular/energy resolution. The so-called cylindrical mirror analyser (CMA) is mostly used for checking the elemental composition of the surface.It consists of two co-axial cylinders placed in front of the sample, the inner one being held at a positive potential, while the outer cylinder is held at a negative potential.Only the electrons with the right energy can pass through this set-up and are detected at the end. The count rates are high but the resolution (both in energy and angle) is poor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> in the {{direction}} of ion flight can be corrected by using a reflectron. The reflectron uses a constant electrostatic field to reflect the ion beam toward the detector. The more energetic ions penetrate deeper into the reflectron, and take a slightly longer path to the detector. Less energetic ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio penetrate a shorter distance into the reflectron and, correspondingly, take a shorter path to the detector. The flat surface of the ion detector (typically a microchannel plate, MCP) is placed at the point where ions with different energies reflected by the reflectron hit a surface of the detector at the same time counted with respect to the onset of the extraction pulse in the ion source. A point of simultaneous arrival of ions of the same mass and charge but with different energies is often referred as time-of-flight focus.An additional advantage to the re-TOF arrangement is that twice the flight path is achieved in a given length of instrument.|$|E

50|$|The Ar-ICP {{produces}} an ion-beam {{with a large}} inherent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>distribution,</b> which makes {{the design of the}} mass-spectrometer somewhat more complex than it is the case for conventional TIMS instruments. First, different from Quadrupole ICP-MS systems, magnetic sector instruments have to operate with a higher acceleration potential (several 1000V) in order to minimize the energy distribution of the ion beam. Modern instruments operate at 6-10kV. The radius of deflection of an ion within a magnetic field depends on the kinetic energy and the mass/charge ratio of the ion (strictly, the magnet is a momentum analyzer not just a mass analyzer). Because of the large energy distribution, ions with similar mass/charge ratio can have very different kinetic energies and will thus experience different deflection for the same magnetic field. In practical terms one would see that ions with the same mass/charge ratio focus at different points in space. However, in a mass-spectrometer one wants ions with the same mass/charge ratio to focus at the same point, e.g. where the detector is located. In order to overcome these limitations, commercial MC-ICP-MS are double-focusing instruments. In a double-focusing mass-spectrometer ions are focused due to kinetic energy by the ESA (electro-static-analyzer) and kinetic energy + mass/charge (momentum) in the magnetic field. Magnet and ESA are carefully chosen to match the energy focusing properties of one another and are arranged so that the direction of energy focusing is in opposite directions. To simplify, two components have an energy focus term, when arranged properly, the energy term cancels out and ions with the same mass/charge ratio focus at the same point in space. It is important to note, double-focusing does not reduce the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> and different kinetic energies are not filtered or homogenized. Double-focusing works for single as well as multi-collector instruments. In single collector instruments ESA and magnet can be arranged in either forward geometry (first ESA then magnet) or reversed geometry (magnet first then ESA), as only point-to-point focusing is required. In multi-collector instruments, only forward geometry (ESA then magnet) is possible due to the array of detectors and the requirements of a focal plane rather than a focal point.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{kinetic energy}} of the atoms {{in the region of}} dense {{collisions}} is recalculated into temperature (using the basic equation E = 3/2·N·kBT), one finds that the kinetic energy in units of temperature is initially of the order of 10,000 K. Because of this, the region can be considered to be very hot, and is therefore called a heat spike or thermal spike (the two terms are usually considered to be equivalent). The heat spike cools down to the ambient temperature in 1-100 ps, so the [...] "temperature" [...] here does not correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium temperature. However, {{it has been shown that}} after about 3 lattice vibrations, the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> of the atoms in a heat spike has the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, making the use of the concept of temperature somewhat justified. Moreover, experiments have shown that a heat spike can induce a phase transition which is known to require a very high temperature, showing that the concept of a (non-equilibrium) temperature is indeed useful in describing collision cascades.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} beta decay {{provided}} the first physical {{evidence for the}} existence of the neutrino. In both alpha and gamma decay, the resulting particle has a narrow energy distribution, since the particle carries the energy from the difference between the initial and final nuclear states. However, the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>distribution,</b> or spectrum, of beta particles measured by Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in 1911 and by Jean Danysz in 1913 showed multiple lines on a diffuse background. These measurements offered the first hint that beta particles have a continuous spectrum. In 1914, James Chadwick used a magnetic spectrometer with one of Hans Geiger's new counters to make more accurate measurements which showed that the spectrum was continuous. The distribution of beta particle energies was in apparent contradiction to the law of conservation of energy. If beta decay were simply electron emission as assumed at the time, then the energy of the emitted electron should have a particular, well-defined value. For beta decay, however, the observed broad distribution of energies suggested that energy is lost in the beta decay process. This spectrum was puzzling for many years.|$|E
