50|$|Among {{the notable}} reforms {{introduced}} was husförhör and Parish register. Henceforth, the parish vicar of every parish {{of the nation}} was obliged to conduct a husförhör (<b>Household</b> <b>Interview),</b> an annual survey of the religious knowledge of every household in the parish to ensure all parishioners' knowledge {{of the bible and}} Luther's Small Catechism. A consequence of this was the need for every parishioner, regardless of age and sex, to know how to read, as it would be necessary to read the bible and the catechism to pass the annual survey.Since the predecessor law from 1571, children's schools for reading, writing and counting had already been an obligation in the cities, but this law resulted in the need for every village and rural community to organise basic schooling for their children, normally by paying a läromäster (schoolmaster) or läromoster (schoolmarm) to hold lessons in the local vicarage, and from this point forward, illiteracy was close to eradicated in Sweden.|$|E

40|$|Background: Undergoing {{a routine}} medical {{examination}} {{may be associated}} with the prevalence rate of chronic diseases from a population-based <b>household</b> <b>interview</b> survey. However, this important issue has not been examined so far. Methods: Data came from the first health service <b>household</b> <b>interview</b> of Hunan province, China, in 2013. A Rao–Scott chi-square test was performed to examine the difference in prevalence rates between subgroups. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) was calculated using the PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure of SAS 9. 1 statistical software. Results: In total, 24, 282 residents of 8400 households were surveyed. A higher proportion of elderly adults had undergone a medical examination within the prior 12 months compared with young adults (≥ 65 years, 60 %; 45 – 64 years, 46 %; 18 – 44 years, 37 %). After controlling for location, sex, and household income per capita, undergoing a medical examination was significantly associated with high prevalence rates of hypertension (adjusted OR: 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 3. 5) and of diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR: 3. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 7 – 6. 5) for young adults aged 18 – 44 years. The associations were not statistically significant for age groups 45 – 64 years and 65 years or older. Conclusion: The prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be seriously underestimated for young adults not undergoing a routine medical examination in a health <b>household</b> <b>interview</b> survey...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether existing data sources from <b>household</b> <b>interview</b> based surveys conducted in a large number of countries may be used towards estimating the distribution and levels of severity of non-fatal health at the population level. Operationally, this objective addresses two main questions: 1. Is there information content on the severity and distribution of non-fatal health status in data collected through <b>household</b> <b>interview</b> surveys? 2. May this information be compared in a valid and reliable manner across countries? The paper first reviews current approaches to measure health status within interview based surveys and the limitations of these approaches concerning the cross-population comparability of data collected, not only the comparability of questions. Issues demanding further attention concerning the cross-population comparability include inconsistent reporting and differences in end-points and cut-points on reference scales. These limitations prevent the meaningful comparison of survey data within and across populations. The paper then describes and tests a methodology to extract information on non-fatal health status. This approach is specific to self-reported data from different surveys conducted in different populations, as a first attempt to improve comparability of data given that no external means to calibrate responses are available.
