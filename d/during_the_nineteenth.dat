5|$|Bewick's fame, already {{nationwide}} across Britain for his Birds, grew <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. In 1830, William Yarrell named Bewick's swan in his honour and Bewick's son Robert engraved {{the bird}} for later editions of British Birds. Bewick's wren also took his name.|$|E
5|$|Narrative {{tales and}} stories {{are most often}} found on papyri, but partial and {{sometimes}} complete texts are found on ostraca. For example, Sinuhe is found on five papyri composed during the Twelfth and Thirteenth dynasties. This text was later copied numerous times on ostraca <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nineteenth</b> and Twentieth dynasties, with one ostraca containing the complete text on both sides.|$|E

Also buried within the chamber were flint tools and small quantities of pottery.|$|E
5|$|Baseball was {{introduced}} to Puerto Rico by immigrants <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. The first sanctioned baseball game in the island was played on January 9, 1898 in Santurce, Puerto Rico, where two teams composed of Puerto Rican, American and Cuban players participated. After this game, baseball became a widespread sport and professional and amateur leagues were organized. During this time period, the Puerto Rico national teams experienced success on international competition and Afro-Puerto Rican players began {{to participate in the}} Negro Leagues.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> {{century the}} metric system of weights and {{measures}} proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the first country {{not part of the}} French Empire to officially adopt a metric system. Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the metric system. There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965, the Commonwealth followed suit.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, The Fairchild Family was {{renowned for}} its {{realistic}} portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the twentieth century the books have most often been viewed as quintessential examples of the didactic style of children's writing popular before Alice.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, boosted by Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs. Early in the century, the area was visited by Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, and the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares {{its position in the}} latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{circumstances}} {{such as a}} good {{breeding season}} followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range. Bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000. Red crossbills Loxia curvirostra too are irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil {{nationalism}} is {{the conviction of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), {{that they have the}} right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy as a tool to spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Hotel in {{the area}} of Woodhill was {{designed}} and built to serve Brunel's railway line which finished a few steps away from the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a public authority <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal mining area <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> {{and early twentieth centuries}} when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, although there are no working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Irish {{people began}} to arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge. The 1851 UK Census {{recorded}} that Irish people constituted 35.8% of the local population. Although while {{a significant proportion of}} these immigrants were Protestant, the majority were Catholic. By 1901 UK Census, the percentage of Irish-born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland. In the 2001 UK Census, Irish ethnicity was recorded at just over 1%, although just over half the population claimed their religious denomination as Roman Catholicism. In 1985, 56% of the population of Coatbridge were Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century, castles became tourist attractions. Blair Castle was a popular {{location}} on account of its landscaped gardens, and Stirling Castle because of its romantic historic connections. Tours became increasingly popular <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, usually starting at Edinburgh and then spending up to two weeks further north, {{taking advantage of the}} expanding rail and steamer network. Blair Castle remained popular, but additional castles joined the circuit, with Cawdor Castle becoming popular once the railway line reached north to Fort William. Scottish castle guidebooks became well known for providing long historical accounts of their sites, often drawing on the plots of Romantic novels for the details. Sir Walter Scott's novels set in Scotland popularised several northern castles, including Tantallon, which was featured in the poem Marmion (1808).|$|E
5|$|Living {{in what is}} now Europe, {{during the}} Jurassic Period (~201 to ~145 million years ago), Megalosaurus may have hunted stegosaurs and sauropods. Repeated {{descriptions}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> and early twentieth century of Megalosaurus hunting Iguanodon (another of the earliest dinosaurs named) through the forests that then covered the continent are now known to be inaccurate, because Iguanodon skeletons are found in much younger Early Cretaceous formations. The only specimens belonging to Megalosaurus bucklandii are from the Lower/Middle Bathonian of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. No material from outside of the Bathonian formations of England can be referred to Megalosaurus. It lived alongside the theropods Cruxicheiros, Iliosuchus and Streptospondylus, and the sauropods Cardiodon, Cetiosaurus, and possibly Cetiosauriscus. The pterosaur Rhamphocephalus, and indeterminate sauropod and ornithopod remains have also been found alongside fossils of Megalosaurus.|$|E
