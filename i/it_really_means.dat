25|$|Chibiusa {{started out}} {{socially}} awkward, she quickly became popular with her classmates. In the manga, she once {{became president of}} her class. Her initial shyness {{could be attributed to}} {{the fact that she was}} teased in the 30th-century for not having any Soldier powers. As the manga progresses, she gradually matures, becoming more comfortable with herself and more confident with her Soldier abilities. Because her dream in the manga is to become a beautiful lady, her actions often are based around this. She tries to be a perfectionist and starts off trying to do everything alone and for herself. This view evolves as she realizes what maturity really is and what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means</b> to be an adult. In the original anime, she is more judgmental and does not mature as much as her manga counterpart. But she does in Sailor Moon Crystal and gets along better with Usagi.|$|E

[...] On March 11, two days before pre-sale began, an extra 40 dates were added to meet high demand, bringing the number of shows to 50— five of these dates were reserved in their entirety for the public sale. Jackson's 50 dates would make the concerts the longest residency at the arena. In May 2009, the show was originally set to have begun on July 8, 2009, and finished on March 6, 2010.|$|E

As many as 7,000 fans and 350 reporters awaited the singer's arrival, many donning Jackson-related clothing. The singer commented at the conference, [...] "I {{just wanted to say that}} these will be my final show performances in London. When I say this is it, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means</b> this is it", adding that it was his [...] "final curtain call", although he may have just been referring to performing in London. Organizers touted the residency as, [...] "dramatic shows [...] promise an explosive return with a band of the highest calibre, a state-of-the-art stage show and incredible surprise support acts". Hours before the press conference, promotional posters for the residency were displayed around London. Further promotion took up an entire commercial break period on ITV London during Dancing on Ice, the first time this has ever happened for a musical artist. The advert, which cost £1 million to air, was viewed by 11 million people.|$|E
2500|$|The film's title has {{a double}} meaning. In Vaud, the French-speaking part of Switzerland where Godard was raised and {{currently}} lives, the word [...] "adieu" [...] can mean both goodbye and hello [...] "according {{to the time}} of day, the tone of voice." [...] Godard has acknowledged that this interpretation would only be understood in Vaud and said [...] "nowadays, it seems that talking has nothing to do, that speech no longer exists." [...] He believes that words are losing all meaning and that [...] "we are missing the point... when I say 'Farewell' to language, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means</b> 'Farewell', meaning to say goodbye to my own way of speaking." [...] However Godard believes that images, like films that mix words and visuals, are still capable of meaningful communication, citing Islamic and Christian prohibitions of certain images while allowing words as an example. Godard said that in the sequence with Mary Shelley and himself painting with watercolors he wanted to visually show the physical acts of the language of writing and the language of visual art. Bordwell believes that a theme of the film is [...] "the idea that language alienates us from some primordial connection to things." ...|$|E

[...] In his opinion, the film was a [...] "stirring testament to what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means</b> when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together." [...] Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an [...] "intriguing" [...] documentary that [...] "becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't." [...] The reviewer said the film is [...] "refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled" [...] and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough questions about that period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an [...] "essential companion piece" [...] to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that [...] "the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will [...] "come out with a new appreciation of {{what it takes to be}} U2". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "One", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a [...] "complete record" [...] of Achtung Babys conception, but that it [...] "offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set a context in which they can appreciate what it is that U2 accomplished". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of [...] "One" [...] as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, [...] "This may not be everything I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rav Hana (or {{some say}} Hanin) bar Bizna {{said in the}} name of Rabbi Simeon the Pious that because Joseph sanctified God's Name in private when he {{resisted}} Potiphar's wife's advances, one letter from God's Name was added to Joseph's name. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words, [...] "And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work," [...] in [...] to teach that both Joseph and Potiphar's wife had the intention to act immorally. Rav and Samuel differed in their interpretation of the words [...] "he went into the house to do his work." [...] One said that <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means</b> that Joseph went to do his household work, but the other said that Joseph went to satisfy his desires. Interpreting the words, [...] "And there was none of the men of the house there within," [...] in [...] the Gemara asked whether it was possible that no man was present in a huge house like Potiphar's. A Baraita was taught in the School of Rabbi Ishmael that the day was Potiphar's household's feast-day, and they had all gone to their idolatrous temple, but Potiphar's wife had pretended to be ill, because she thought that she would not again have an opportunity like that day to associate with Joseph. The Gemara taught that just at the moment reported in [...] when [...] "she caught him by his garment, saying: ‘Lie with me,' Jacob's image came and appeared to Joseph through the window. Jacob told Joseph that Joseph and his brothers were destined to have their names inscribed upon the stones of the ephod, and Jacob asked whether it was Joseph's wish to have his name expunged from the ephod and be called an associate of harlots, as [...] says, [...] "He that keeps company with harlots wastes his substance."

She has friends and a loving family, and she goes to public school. However, on various occasions, she gets [...] "psychic visions" [...] about what may or may not happen later. She is only able to [...] "see" [...] a small segment of some future event, and she frequently errs on what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means,</b> in which case her attempts to change these events only end up making it happen or making it worse. Her main catchphrases are [...] "Oh Fudge!", [...] "Oh snap!", [...] "Ya nasty!", [...] "How y'all doin'?", and [...] "Oh, no he didn't!" [...] She abruptly says, [...] "I'm okay!" [...] if she falls down in one of her disguises. And, if big guys throw her, she tells them to do it [...] "gently!" [...] In addition, when she disapproves of something, she exclaims [...] "Gotta go!" [...] When she makes an appearance on Cory in the House, her father exclaims, [...] "You didn't get kicked out of design school because they don't give out refunds!", which shows she is attending design school. Raven is also a master of disguise, which fits in with her trouble-making antics and passion for becoming a fashion designer, like her idol, Donna Cabonna, whom she worked for as an intern. Raven Baxter is extremely allergic to mushrooms, and her favorite drink is orange juice. According to Chelsea, her favorite gemstone is diamond, her favorite vegetable is corn, and her favorite animal is stuffed. Often referred to as Rae, Raven does not enjoy nature or camping. She has appeared in every episode of the series, along with her younger brother Cory. In the second spin-off, Raven's Home, Raven eventually married her first love Devon but they got divorced. In between that time, they had two children Nia and Booker - latter of whom, shares Raven's ability to see into the future.|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Stuart Tave {{noted that}} a major theme of Austen's novel is propriety, as she both mocks those who cling {{outwardly}} to propriety, often in a self-righteous manner without understanding what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>means</b> and praises those who really live up to it. Those who really understand propriety in Austen's novel take into account both the feelings of others and draw the appropriate conclusions. Tave argued that the play Lover's Vows is {{a test of the}} character's commitment to propriety. The priggish Mrs. Norris sees herself as the guardian of propriety and is trusted by Sir Thomas before he leaves for Antigua to uphold propriety, a task she fails at completely by letting Lover's Vows be put on. Edmund objects to the play, as he knows it violates propriety in some way, but he fails to make the point, as bases his objections in specific matters rather the universal one of propriety. Only Fanny understands this point as she knows that playing the characters will also impact on the amateur actors, but she is not strong enough to persuade the others of her viewpoint. As the rehearsals continued, Fanny could clearly see the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the part of the two lovers, which fills her with misery and jealousy. Tave wrote about Price and the play: [...] "Excluded from the gaiety and busy employment of others, alone, sad, insignificant, seeing Mrs. Grant promoted to consequence and honor because Mrs. Grant accepted the character she herself refused, Fanny is in some danger of envying her. What distinguishes Fanny here, and throughout, is that she is capable of thought and recovery, and in this instance, reflection brings better feelings, showing her that even if she could have received the greatest respect she would never have been easy. It would have been easier to join a scheme, which considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether". Finally, Tave suggests that when Sir Thomas shuts down Lover's Vows, this demonstrates the hypocrisy and myopic character of Sir Thomas as he is content to destroy the set and props without considering just what had led his children into putting on Lover's Vows in the first place as he is only concerned with the external aspects of people, not what really drives them.|$|E

He grew abstracted and solitary,--holding dark seances with himself,--which was odd, as everybody knew he never cared a rap for the Millikens girl.

But his reason was undoubtedly affected, for he had been heard to mutter incoherently at the Club, and, strangest of all, to answer questions THAT WERE NEVER ASKED! This was so awkward in that Branch of the Civil Department of which he was a high official--where the rule was exactly the reverse--that he was presently invalided on full pay! Then he disappeared.
