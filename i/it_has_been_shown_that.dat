5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{environmental}} parameters like {{changes in}} temperature and prior residence {{may affect the}} cichlid's territorial aggression. The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which {{may be explained by}} the fact that convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by {{the extent of their}} post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> in [13] and [14] that, {{under the}} above {{assumptions}} {{and an additional}} linear growth condition on f and g, equation (7) has a unique mild solution for any square-integrable initial condition, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> in [15] that the solution depends continuously on the initial conditions and coefficients.|$|R

50|$|LY-255582 is a phenylpiperidine non-selective opioid antagonist. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> {{to reduce}} ethanol {{consumption}} in experiments {{carried out on}} rats. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to reduce food and water consumption in rats.|$|R
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification {{are better able}} to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E

5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> aphthous stomatitis {{is more common}} in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E
5|$|Using the Very Large Telescope {{to study}} the motions of about 300 {{planetary}} nebulae, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> M87 has absorbed a medium-sized galaxy over the last billion years. The distinctive spectral properties of the planetary nebulae allowed astronomers to discover a chevron-like structure in M87's halo which was produced by the incomplete phase-space mixing of a disrupted galaxy.|$|E

5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (Pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of several plant species.|$|E
5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, {{all three}} elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E
5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{out of all}} dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is {{most likely}} to be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> {{the couple}} created by gravity {{and the ground}} {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way}} to right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
