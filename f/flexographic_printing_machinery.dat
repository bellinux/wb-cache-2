30|$|This {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> for the patterning of AuNPs onto electrode surfaces for biosensing applications. The main issue with previous work carried out on AuNPs is {{that much of the}} fabrication technique is not transferable to mass production. Glucose sensing {{is just one of many}} potential applications of this technology. The use of <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> can significantly reduce the production cost of the devices as it allows the fabrication of vast numbers of devices at relatively low cost. This is due to the fast printing process with great accuracy allowing direct patterning of nanomaterials onto a substrate. This can be compared to methods employed by others whereby the attachment of AuNPs to the surface of the electrode takes a 6 -h immersion in an AuNP solution [10], while <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> would take seconds to print potentially hundreds of samples. <b>Flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> offers very high throughput as compared with other printing techniques, such as screen and inkjet printing. The technique is able to perform roll-to-roll printing at a speed of up to 300  m min− 1. Inkjet printing is significantly slower and also suffers from problems such as blockage of the fine printing head and ‘coffee-ring’ effect [23]. It is clear that the printing of AuNPs via <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> allows a high throughput of devices, and the sensitivities achieved on our printed AuNP glucose sensors are comparable to those seen through other fabrication methods.|$|R

40|$|The <b>flexographic</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> {{process has}} been used for package printing applications since the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Recent improvements in the flexographic technology have enabled flexographic printers to compete in new market areas that have historically been served by roto-gravure or offset lithographic printing. Occurring simultaneously with the <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> improvements has been the infusion of personal computer-based graphic design capabilities. Designers can optimize quality only when they understand {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the printing process that will be used to mass produce their design. Desktop design capabilities and the need for <b>flexographic</b> <b>print</b> quality to match or exceed lithographic and roto-gravure print quality are both factors that accentuate the need to understand the process in an effort to create a design that will be of high quality when printed flexographically. Designing package graphics for the flexographic process is unique for a number of reasons, (the 2 ̆ 2 master image carrier 2 ̆ 2 (printing plate) is significantly different from roto-gravure and offset lithography, the inks used in flexography are significantly different form those used in gravure) and a wider assortment of substrates may be <b>printed</b> by the <b>flexographic</b> process than by the offset lithographic process. Each substrate has its own printing characteristics. This thesis will inform those who may be interested in designing for <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing</b> of the unique considerations that should be addressed when designing a package graphic for <b>flexographic</b> <b>printing.</b> Considerations specifically addressed are; variable repeat length capabilities, reverse-side printing, trapping, typography halftones and dot-gain screen ruling and substrate, step-and-repeat and flexographic plate elongation...|$|R

Highly uniform coverage of AuNPs was selectively patterned on the substrate surface, which was subsequently used {{in the development of}} a glucose sensor. These AuNPs provide a biocompatible site for the attachment of enzymes and offer high sensitivity in the detection of glucose due to their large surface to volume ratio. The average size of the printed AuNPs is less than 60  nm. Glucose sensing tests were performed using printed carbon-AuNP electrodes functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx). The results showed a high sensitivity of 5.52  μA mM− 1  cm− 2 with a detection limit of 26  μM.
