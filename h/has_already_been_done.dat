5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Mutagenesis experiment: The {{direct method}} to {{investigate}} the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in viruses, bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila. For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In Escherichia coli, one study used transposon mutagenesis to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects {{too small to be}} detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{consequences}} of Owen's actions resonate {{in the next}} episode, the first series finale [...] "End of Days". By opening the Rift, he has allowed more [...] "flotsam and jetsam" [...] to come through, including a Roman soldier, a group of mediaeval plague sufferers, and even a large UFO. As Jack puts it, opening the Rift has caused the cracks in time to widen on a global scale. The time travelling Bilis Manger shows Gwen {{a vision of the}} death of her boyfriend Rhys, convincing her to open the Rift even wider to reverse the damage that <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> When this happens, the entity known as Abaddon rises from [...] "beneath the Rift". Jack sacrifices himself to destroy Abaddon, and the Rift immediately closes. The team (including Jack, who has come back from the dead again thanks to his past experiences) still retains the memory of what happened, but some of the actual events have been reverted (such as Rhys returning to life), and Owen spearheads a minor clean-up mission. A year later in [...] "Exit Wounds", Jack's brother Gray has Captain John Hart widen the rift again to unleash chaos across Cardiff, unleashing monsters such as Hoix, Weevils and cowled ghouls from distant times and places. As a Time Agent, Captain John can use his wrist-strap vortex manipulator to travel to Cardiff through the Rift.|$|E

40|$|Key Words : {{professional}} development, pedagogical competency, personal competency, social competency, professional competency.

The research was conducted by using descriptive qualitative design. The instruments {{used in this study}} were questionnaires, interview guide, obseravtional notes, and portfolio. The primary data were analyzed descriptively. Accordingly, {{the results of the study}} showed that: 1) Self-directed Development, Case-based Professional Development, and Cooperative-Collegeal Development were the types/models of the professional development that had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by English teachers on their professional development, 2) Each of the professional developments was derived from some kinds of activities/efforts which <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by English teachers; 3) Time limitation, the lack of literatures, the lack and inequal opportunity to participate in scientific forum, the use of technology for self-development were several problems encountered by English teachers in pursuing their pedagogical, social and professional competency. Finally, from the result of the analysis it can be concluded that: 1) The efforts that <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by English teachers on their professional development in terms of pedagogical competency are: using various teaching media, using various teaching techniques and models, reading books, articles and journals about english and education, participating in scientific forums, using learning and teaching facilities, conducting assessment/evaluataion, conducting discussion with peers, conducting lesson study, 2) The efforts that <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by English teachers on their professional development in terms of personal competency are: Accepting and giving constructive critics and suggestions from peers, being discipline, and following religious activities in school, 3) The efforts that <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by English teachers on their professional development in terms of social competency are: participating in scientific forums, participating in professional community and organization, conducting discussion with peers. 4) The efforts that <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by English teachers on their professional development in terms of professional competency are: reading books, articles and journals about english, conducting research, using information and technology for self-development, 5) The problems encountered by English teachers in pursuing those four main competencys are: Problem in the context of Pedagogical competency: 1) Time limitation and lack understanding of how to conduct research especially in classroom action-based research, 2) The lack of literatures, and 3) Time limitation in conducting team teaching. Problem in the context of Social competency: The lack and inequal opportunity to participate in scientific forum.
