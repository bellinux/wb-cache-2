The attack {{resulted}} in 137 fatalities and 593 casualties, {{many of which were}} civilians. The attack made the German navy very unpopular with the British public, as an attack against British civilians <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Likewise, the British Royal Navy was criticised for failing to prevent the raid.|$|E

5|$|By 1991, most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from Armenia {{were forced}} to move to their {{respective}} countries, as remaining <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> became nearly impossible.

Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E

In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> able to care for their often large families while still earning an income.|$|E

Aircraft at the Marine Corps Camp Lejeune were relocated inland and helicopters were moved to hangars; some helicopters remained available for emergency rescue operations. An estimated 6,200residents evacuated to Red Cross shelters in the state.|$|E

Daily skirmishes continued there. After the ZNG pulled out of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, a substantial number of civilians left the area as well, leaving only about 120 Croat civilians in the two towns and the surrounding villages. About half of these stayed behind in Hrvatska Dubica, where looting and torching of houses owned by Croats or Serbs who had previously fled the town continued until mid-October. Most of the civilians who stayed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> were elderly or women.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} Emily {{prompted}} hurricane warnings {{for much of}} the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware. A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000people during the busy Labor Day weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10million (1993USD). About 1,600residents on these islands rode out the storm <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> and emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives, causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal. Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily's path, there were also evacuations from the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Fire Island in New York.|$|E

Officials recommended evacuation of the Florida Keys, leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12shelters. Three shelters were opened in Key West, but only 500 individuals utilized them during the storm. Most residents chose to endure the storm <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> In Fort Lauderdale, schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave.|$|E

Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E

5|$|During {{the week}} when Emily {{approached}} shore, the North Carolina government {{was scheduled to}} have a two-day emergency management exercise involving a hurricane strike; the storm caused the exercise to be postponed. On August29, a voluntary evacuation was issued for the Outer Banks, and within 36hours of the storm's approach, a mandatory evacuation was issued for Ocracoke and Hatteras Island. A total of 160,000people (mostly tourists) evacuated from the Outer Banks, representing about 90% of the population there. The evacuation was completed within 12hours, expedited by highway patrol and making U.S. Route 158 and the Wright Memorial Bridge only one direction, away from the coast. About 1,000residents on Hatteras Island and another 600 on Ocracoke rode out the storm <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The United States Coast Guard evacuated personnel to the mainland, leaving behind a skeleton crew to maintain their facilities. The National Park Service closed the campground on Ocracoke {{two days before the}} storm. Several towns in southeastern North Carolina were also evacuated, and schools closed across the region.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, {{making it impossible for}} larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E
