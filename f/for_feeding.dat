5|$|During World War II, {{rationing}} {{was imposed}} almost immediately. Restrictions were immediately more stringent {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen waste to be used <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> animals, primarily swine but also poultry.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} <b>for</b> <b>feeding,</b> which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed plankton and small fish from the water.|$|E
5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome {{looks more like a}} mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify changes in rice {{planting}} and regional features of rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> production in Hokkaido. The study approach employed two analyses. First, by using statistical data, the changes in crop acreage of paddy rice were determined. Second, surveys of rice farmers showed details of the planting practices <b>for</b> rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> production. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) There are increasing regional disparities in the “production control policy” and rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> production. (2) Expansion of production of rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> is affected by local agriculture promotion policies. It is concluded that production of rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> contributes to maintenance of the rice acreage...|$|R

5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels {{at high speed}} both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the soil to either side with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were <b>for</b> <b>feeding,</b> but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E

5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding.

They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment <b>for</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern spotted owl {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. Roosevelt elk, American black bear, coyote, cougar, black-tailed deer, North American river otter, American mink, and North American beaver are among the mammals found in the watershed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed <b>for</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the average}} {{depth of the}} ocean is about 4300metres, the photic zone {{represents}} {{only a tiny fraction}} of the ocean’s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone <b>for</b> <b>feeding.</b> Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.|$|E

5|$|The African species' {{breeding}} habitat {{consists of}} forested rivers with islands with sandy shores for breeding. The nesting {{grounds of the}} white-eyed river martin are unknown, but if the breeding habitat resembles that of its relative, {{it is likely to}} be the forested valleys of large rivers, which can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The African river martin uses coastal savannah as its winter habitat. Based on its only known wintering site, the non-breeding habitat of the white-eyed is assumed to be in the vicinity of open fresh water <b>for</b> <b>feeding,</b> with reed-beds for the night-time roost.|$|E

40|$|Livestock feed {{demand is}} a {{collection}} of derived feed demands by various livestock categories. A structural understanding of demand <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> grains and total concentrates requires knowledge of separate <b>feed</b> demand relationships <b>for</b> each major livestock cate-gory. While a number of aggregate livestock feed demand relationships have been estimated, {{little is known about the}} structure of feed demand by livestock type. In this study unique livestock <b>feed</b> demand relationships <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> grains and total concentrates are estimated for each of seven major livestock categories. The estimated relationships show substantial differences in elasticities of concentrate and feed grain feed demand with respect to feed prices and with respect to livestock price across livestock groups. Using feed demand parameters by livestock category enables analysts to evaluate policy effects of changes in feed demand quantities and feed costs within the livestock economy, as well as to provide more reliable estimates of the total change in feed demand.
