25|$|G.D. Hale Carpenter {{joined the}} London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, {{and took the}} Doctor of Medicine {{examination}} in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly (<b>Glossina</b> palpalis) and sleeping sickness.|$|E
25|$|All current classifications {{place all}} the tsetse species {{in a single}} genus named <b>Glossina.</b> Most classifications place this genus as the sole {{member of the family}} Glossinidae. The Glossinidae are {{generally}} placed within the superfamily Hippoboscoidea, which contains other hematophagous families.|$|E
25|$|There is one genus in this Family: <b>Glossina,</b> {{known as}} tsetse-flies or simply tsetse. Flies {{of this family}} are similar to Stomoxys flies within the Muscidae, but have a life cycle and {{veterinary}} and medical importance justifying a separate Family designation. Tsetse-flies are found only in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
25|$|The causative {{agent and}} vector were {{identified}} in 1903 by David Bruce, and the differentiation between the subspecies of the protozoa made in 1910. Bruce had earlier shown that T. brucei {{was the cause of}} a similar disease in horses and cattle that was transmitted by the tse-tse fly (<b>Glossina</b> morsitans).|$|E
25|$|Bites from tsetse flies are painful {{but these}} flies are not {{generally}} associated with direct causes of lost production in cattle. <b>Glossina</b> morsitans and G.pallidipes tsetse-flies are transmitters of various species of Trypanosoma protozoa causing animal trypanosomiasis (= nagana) in cattle, {{and other forms}} of trypanosomiasis in sheep, goats, pigs, camels and horses. Tsetse-flies are also notorious as transmitters of the Trypanosoma species causing African trypanosomiasis (= sleeping sickness) in humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{tsetse fly}} (genus <b>Glossina)</b> is a large, brown, biting fly {{that serves as}} both a host and vector for the {{trypanosome}} parasites. While taking blood from a mammalian host, an infected tsetse fly injects metacyclic trypomastigotes into skin tissue. From the bite, parasites first enter the lymphatic system and then pass into the bloodstream. Inside the mammalian host, they transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, and are carried to other sites throughout the body, reach other body fluids (e.g., lymph, spinal fluid), and continue to replicate by binary fission.|$|E
25|$|Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the {{pea aphid}} (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and its endosymbiont Buchnera sp. APS, the tsetse fly <b>Glossina</b> morsitans morsitans and its endosymbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis and the endosymbiotic protists in lower termites. As with endo{{symbiosis}} in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in {{that neither the}} bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists {{have been unable to}} cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.|$|E
25|$|In the Niayes {{region of}} Senegal, a coastal area close to Dakar, {{livestock}} keeping was difficult {{due to the}} presence of a population of <b>Glossina</b> palpalis gambiensis. Feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of Senegal. After completion of the feasibility studies (2006–2010), an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an SIT component was started in 2011, and by 2015, the Niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free.|$|E
25|$|Alkanes {{are found}} in animal products, {{although}} they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C19H40). They are important as pheromones, chemical messenger materials, on which insects depend for communication. In some species, e.g. the support beetle Xylotrechus colonus, pentacosane (C25H52), 3-methylpentaicosane (C26H54) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C26H54) are transferred by body contact. With others like the tsetse fly <b>Glossina</b> morsitans morsitans, the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C18H38), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C39H80), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C39H80) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C40H82), and acts by smell over longer distances. Waggle-dancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.|$|E
25|$|These usually {{consist of}} netting made of {{synthetic}} fibers or fine metal mesh that is fitted to the ventilation slats / windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides {{such as the}} synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or <b>Glossina</b> species land on it. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Some of the brachyceran flies are {{important}} transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission. These flies have complex cutting mouthparts {{that make a}} superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such {{as a group of}} species of <b>Glossina</b> genus {{are important}} biological transmitters, not mechanical.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and <b>Glossina</b> species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
2500|$|G.D. Hale Carpenter {{joined the}} London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, {{and took the}} DM in 1913 with a {{dissertation}} on the tsetse fly (<b>Glossina</b> palpalis) and sleeping sickness. He published: ...|$|E
2500|$|Tsetse ( [...] , [...] or [...] ), {{sometimes}} spelled tzetze {{and also}} known as tik-tik flies, [...] are large biting flies that inhabit much of tropical Africa. [...] Tsetse flies include all the species in the genus <b>Glossina,</b> which are placed in their own family, Glossinidae. The tsetse are obligate parasites that live by feeding on the blood of vertebrate animals. Tsetse have been extensively studied because of their role in transmitting disease. They have a prominent economic impact in sub-Saharan Africa as the biological vectors of trypanosomes, which cause human sleeping sickness and animal trypanosomiasis. Tsetse are multivoltine and long-lived, typically producing about four broods per year, and up to 31 broods over their lifespans.|$|E
2500|$|A {{project that}} was {{implemented}} from 1994 to 1997 on the Island of Unguja, Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania), demonstrated that, after {{suppression of the}} tsetse population with insecticides, SIT completely removed the <b>Glossina</b> austeni Newstead population from the Island (...) [...] [...] The eradication of the tsetse fly from Unguja Island in 1997 {{was followed by the}} disappearance of the AAT which enabled farmers to integrate livestock keeping with cropping in areas where this had been impossible before. The increased livestock and crop productivity and the possibility of using animals for transport and traction significantly contributed to an increase in the quality of people’s lives (...) [...] A recent entomological survey (2015) jointly carried out by independent experts and the Department of Veterinary Services of Zanzibar has confirmed the tsetse-free status of the island, 18 years after eradication was declared.|$|E

60|$|I {{had already}} shot the Ancobra River when {{paddling}} up, {{and was not}} over lucky when coming down. The big kingfisher did not put in an appearance, and the sun-birds equally failed me: the smallest item of my collection measures two and a quarter inches, and is robed in blue, crimson, and sulphur. I {{was fortunate enough to}} bring home four specimens of a rare spur-plover (Lobivanellus albiceps): they are now in Mr. Sharp's department of the British Museum. I killed a few little snakes and one large green tree-snake; two crocodiles, both lost in the river, and an iguana, which found its way into the spirit-cask. A tzetze-fly (<b>Glossina</b> morsitans) was captured in Effuenta House, curiously deserting its usual habit of jungle-life in preference to a home on clear ground: its dagger-like proboscis, in the grooved sheath with a ganglion of muscles at the base, assimilated it to the dreaded and ferocious cattle-scourge which extends from Zanzibar to the Tanganyika Lake and from Kilwa (Quiloa) to the Transvaal. My kind friend and hospitable host Dr. (now Sir) John Kirk, who did the geography and natural history for the lamentable Zambeze expedition, met it close to the Victoria Falls. Burton also sent home a specimen from the Gold Coast east of Accra.|$|E
60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts of clear grassy land, and the woods, clear of undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a tropical jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (<b>Glossina</b> morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare, sufficing only for home use. The southern parts, about Cape Lopez and beyond it, resemble the Oil River country in the Biafran Bight: the land is a mass of mangrove swamps, and the climate is unfit for white men.|$|E
