5|$|Kristen Feilberg (1839–1919) {{stands as}} another Danish {{photographer}} known mainly for <b>his</b> <b>images</b> captured {{far beyond the}} borders of Denmark. From the 1860s until the 1890s, Feilberg participated in expeditions to Sumatra, Singapore, and Penang. In 1867, he exhibited photos at an exhibition in Paris and in 1870 he joined an expedition to the Batak lands of East Sumatra, where he successfully recorded scores of ethnographic images.|$|E

Photographer Mik Critchlow (who would later become involved with Amber Films' sister company Side Gallery) also documented the seacoalers at Lynemouth, between 1981 and 1983. He also used the power station as an industrial backdrop to some of <b>his</b> <b>images.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace {{and the home of}} Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of <b>his</b> <b>images,</b> particularly the portraits, were hand-tinted.|$|E
5|$|Some of <b>his</b> <b>images</b> {{were among}} the photos that were {{distributed}} to news media with {{the announcement of the}} first atomic bomb and the secret project that created it. In the weeks before the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, prints of 18 of his photographs were made in secrecy in preparation for the announcement. The photographs were declassified and distributed as part of the press kit. He also processed film taken by the damage assessment teams in his laboratory in Oak Ridge. It took three days to print them. Armed guards outside the darkroom.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>image</b> {{has seemed}} such a {{liability}} that one professional publicist {{even suggested that}} Osmond purposefully get arrested for drug possession in order to change <b>his</b> <b>image.</b> Osmond, however, {{felt that he had}} too much to lose. Criminal allegations would affect his family life. He was considering how <b>his</b> new public <b>image</b> could be explained to his children, nieces and nephews. He rejected the idea.|$|R

5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared <b>his</b> <b>images</b> of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|In June 1869, Meessen and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to Batavia, and the following year they returned to Utrecht. There, in late 1870, Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen {{to open a new}} studio, named A.A. Vermeulen & Company. They signed a contract for five years, but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873. Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen– best known for portraits– had been interested in the possibility of expanding his range with landscapes, whereas Meessen required a place to print and market <b>his</b> <b>images</b> of the Indies. Indeed, in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better-executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to King William III. This album of 153images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold, and featured the names of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Nias in the corners. In the center were silver coconut and banana trees surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Butcher had a {{partnership}} that marketed and sold <b>his</b> <b>images</b> {{to the wall}} décor departments of Sears, Montgomery Ward, and J. C. Penney. He eventually accrued around 200 employees and offices in Akron, Ohio and Southern California. In order to increase sales, Butcher started photographing with color film so <b>his</b> <b>images</b> could match the avocado green shag carpets and gold couches. The bulk of his photography during this time took place west of the Rocky Mountains and in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

25|$|White {{sometimes}} printed {{the same}} image using different processes, {{and as a result}} there are significant variations in how some of his prints appear. His platinum prints have a deep magenta-brown tone, for example, whereas his gum prints have a distinct reddish hue. Photogravures of <b>his</b> <b>images</b> in Camera Work, which he considered to be true prints, were more neutral, tending toward warm black-and-white tones.|$|E
25|$|In his Daybooks he {{provided}} an unusually detailed {{record of his}} evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that <b>his</b> <b>images</b> reflect his own interpretations of the subject matter, by 1932 his writings revealed {{that he had come}} to accept the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development as an artist and his impact of future generations of photographers.|$|E

Newfoundland-born artist Gerald Squires returned in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Soldier Tony Vaccaro is also {{recognized}} as one of the pre-eminent photographers of World War II. <b>His</b> <b>images</b> taken with the modest Argus C3 captured horrific moments in war, similar to Capa's Spanish soldier being shot. Capa himself was on Omaha Beach on D-Day and captured pivotal images of the conflict on that occasion. Vaccaro is also known for having developed his own images in soldier's helmets, and using chemicals found in the ruins of a camera store in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Magnum found <b>his</b> <b>images</b> {{difficult}} {{to sell to}} American magazines, as they concentrated on {{the suffering of the}} Vietnamese people and reflected his view of the war as an episode in the continuing decolonisation of former European possessions. However, he was eventually able to get a scoop that the American outlets liked: photographs of Jackie Kennedy holidaying with a male friend in Cambodia. The proceeds from these photos enabled him to continue his coverage of Vietnam and to publish Vietnam Inc. in 1971.|$|E
