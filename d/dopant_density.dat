50|$|In metals, the Fermi level {{lies in the}} {{conduction}} band (see Band Theory, above) giving rise to free conduction electrons. However, in semiconductors {{the position of the}} Fermi level is within the band gap, approximately halfway between the {{conduction band}} minimum and valence band maximum for intrinsic (undoped) semiconductors. This means that at 0 kelvin, there are no free conduction electrons, and the resistance is infinite. However, the resistance continues to decrease as the charge carrier density in the conduction band increases. In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors, dopant atoms increase the majority charge carrier concentration by donating electrons to the conduction band or producing holes in the valence band. For both types of donor or acceptor atoms, increasing <b>dopant</b> <b>density</b> reduces resistance. Hence, highly doped semiconductors behave metallically.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the recombination mechanisms in polycrystalline silicon on glass solar cells, which limit their open circuit voltages to the 500 mV range. The theoretical basis is mainly developed from the study of device characteristics (Suns-Voc, external quantum efficiency) over a range of temperatures (~ 150 - 330 K) and base dopant densities (1 e 15 - 1 e 18 cm^- 3), and partly from the more basic study of film properties such as photoconductivity and Hall effect parameters. The major conclusion is that the recombination current in polycrystalline silicon on glass solar cells can be modelled by the superposition of two processes, one which involves only shallow electronic levels and one which occurs via deep levels at charged extended defects. The former process is called shallow bands recombination and is most likely linked to dislocations. It leads to a distinct activation energy in the lifetime of 170 - 210 meV near room temperature, an inverse relationship between lifetime and <b>dopant</b> <b>density,</b> and consequently open circuit voltage which is insensitive to <b>dopant</b> <b>density</b> when the cell base diffusion length exceeds the base thickness. The latter process may originate either from charged dislocations or grain boundaries. It exhibits the effects of electrostatic fluctuations, whereby the potential barriers at the charged extended defects are characterized by a statistical distribution, in the Suns-Voc and local ideality factor characteristics. Shallow bands recombination dictate the device properties over virtually the entire practical 5 e 15 cm^- 3 to 1 e 17 cm^- 3 base doping range, while electrostatic fluctuations become influential at < 5 e 15 cm^- 3 base doping levels and is expected to degrade the open circuit voltage and fill factor at these low base dopant densities. The analysis gives justification to current practices in achieving high cell efficiencies (seeking a base <b>dopant</b> <b>density</b> in the mid 1 e 15 cm^- 3 range), offers some convenient additional suggestions (lowering the base <b>dopant</b> <b>density</b> further than the existing mid 1 e 15 cm^- 3 level might be detrimental), and helps identify the limiting factor to state-of-the-art poly-Si on glass solar cells (dislocation density).

40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} focuses on the {{interaction}} of high Rydberg states of hydrogen molecules and atoms with various doped Si semiconductor surfaces with the results compared with those obtained with an atomically flat gold surface. The {{major part of the}} thesis was carried out using para-H₂ molecular Rydberg states with principal quantum number n = 17 - 21 and core rotational quantum number N⁺ = 2. Subsequently, this study was continued using H atomic Rydberg states with principal quantum number n = 29 - 34. The high Rydberg states have been produced using two-step laser excitation. For close Rydberg surface separation (< 6 n² a. u.), the Rydberg states may be ionized due to an attractive surface potential experienced by the Rydberg electron, and the remaining ion core may be detected by applying an external electric field. An efficient ion detectability method is introduced to compare the many surface ionization profiles quantitatively. The p-type doped Si surfaces enhance the detected ion-signal more than the n-type doped Si surfaces due to the presence of widely distributed positive dopant charge fields in the p-type doped Si surfaces. As the <b>dopant</b> <b>density</b> increases, the area sampled by the resultant ions becomes effectively more neutral, and the decay rate of the potential from the surface dopant charge with distance from the surface becomes more rapid. Therefore, the minimum ionization distance is also reduced with increasing <b>dopant</b> <b>density.</b> It is found that the detected ion-signal decreases with increasing <b>dopant</b> <b>density</b> of both p- and n- type doped Si surfaces. The higher-n Rydberg states have shown higher ion detectability than that of lower-n Rydberg states and this variation also becomes smaller when increasing the <b>dopant</b> <b>density.</b> Experiments involving H 2 Rydberg molecules incident on various doped Si surfaces {{in the presence of a}} Stark field at the point of excitation are also presented here. The surface ionization profiles produced via both electron and ion detection schemes are measured by changing the Stark polarization. Positive surface dopant charges oppose production of backscattered electrons and negative surface dopant charges enhance the electron-signal. For the electron detection scheme, lightly doped n-type Si surfaces show higher detectability but in the case of p-type Si surfaces the more heavily doped Si surfaces give a higher detected signal. This different behaviour of the detected ion or electron signal implies a different production mechanism. Theoretical trajectory simulations were also carried out based on a new 2 D surface potential model. The results qualitatively agree with the experimental results and explain the changes of the surface ionization profiles between the various dopant types and dopant densities of the Si surfaces.

The effects of the <b>dopants</b> on <b>density,</b> optical absorption and conductivity of the polypyrroles were studied. The presence of the dopant in the conducting polymer matrix was verified by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Density function theory (DFT) simulation was used to understand {{the effect of the}} dopants on the solid structure, optical absorption and energy band structures. Anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonic acid-doped polypyrrole yielded the highest conductivity. The dye-doped polypyrrole showed an enhancement in its UV–vis optical absorption. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A {{semiconductor}} device has a multilayer doping to provide improved passivation by quantum exclusion. The multilayer doping includes a plurality M of doped layers, where M is an integer greater than 1. The <b>dopant</b> sheet <b>densities</b> in the M doped layers {{need not be}} the same, but in principle can be selected {{to be the same}} sheet densities or to be different sheet densities. M- 1 interleaved layers provided between the M doped layers are not deliberately doped (also referred to as "undoped layers"). Structures with M= 2, M= 3 and M= 4 have been demonstrated and exhibit improved passivation...|$|R
40|$|After {{termination}} with hydrogen, a silicon surface usually naturally {{retains a}} certain density of dangling bonds (DBs). On an undoped sample, DBs are {{occupied by a}} single electron, but on n-type samples, DBs can become doubly-occupied, yielding a net negative charge – this acceptor level is located around mid-gap for Si. Charge will accumulate on the surface until the induced potential shifts the surface DB acceptor level to equal the Fermi level, bending the bands up. The introduction of a STM tip perturbs the system and tends to either attract or repel the electrons occupying the surface, screening {{the potential of the}} tip. This has the effect of pinning the Fermi level near the DB acceptor level over a certain range of tip voltages, which depends on surface DB concentration and dopant levels. Semi-classical calculations using the finite element method are presented that solve this system in general, allowing spatially varying <b>dopant</b> <b>densities,</b> different tip sizes, DB acceptor levels and surface DB concentrations. We show how the presence of a tip affects the average DB charge density, and present experimental STM images confirming the expected effect [1]. These images additionally show how the charge of a DB locally affects imaging over < 1 nm length scales, shifting molecular levels in nearby molecular lines. The calculations presented are electrostatic and assume negligible current flowing through the STM tip – future extensions to the calculations will include steady-state conditions with non-zero current...|$|R
