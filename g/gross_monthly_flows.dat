40|$|Although net monthly {{changes in}} {{unemployment}} and employment are relatively small, {{the level of}} gross flows among the three conventional labor force states, Employment, Unemployment, and Not-in-the-Labor-Force, tends to be very large. This paper reviews Canadian evidence on <b>monthly</b> <b>gross</b> <b>flows</b> of labor for the period since 1976.

Due to the prominence of the business cycle during this period and the sheer size of <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> employment <b>flows,</b> this paper focuses on the weeks-per-year margin, holding constant weekly hours and the probability of not working at all during a calendar year. In the 21 stcentury U.K., for example, the single largest quarterly employment decline for the non-elderly population has so far been 0.3 million, as compared to at least 2.6 million non-elderly people who join or separate from an employer during the average quarter. 2 Adding just one week out of work before joining, or after separating, would therefore create a remarkable net reduction in the number employed at a point in time. Also, the large majority of unemployment spells last less than 12  months, and some of those lasting 12  months do not blanket an entire tax year. 3 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Transition probabilities {{between four}} labor market states (full-time employment, {{part-time}} employment, unemployment and inactive) for three age groups (the young, mature and old) are calculated using <b>monthly</b> <b>gross</b> <b>flow</b> data for Australia from October 1997 to May 2012. We determine {{the responses of}} the different groups to phases of the business cycle by estimating four unobserved common dynamic factors that drive the age group transitions. Job-finding and job-losing factors were significantly affected by the business cycle variable. Impulse responses to a business cycle shock show that both job-finding and job-losing matter, with the former more important. Part-time job flow responses are more important cyclically than full-time ones. In business cycle downturns, the young have a disproportionate difficulty finding and keeping all jobs, the mature unemployed have more difficulty finding full-time work, and the old have difficulty keeping full-time work. 11 page(s...|$|R

In order to support public and monetary planning, reliable forecasts of future salaries are indispensable. Objectives: The aim is to provide an outline of the behaviour of the average gross wages and the gross wage medians of the Czech business sphere up to the end of 2018 using an optimised random walk model and an optimised ARIMA Model with a constant. Methods: Consumer price indices were used in the confrontation of the behaviour of the Average <b>Gross</b> <b>Monthly</b> Wages and the Monthly Wage Medians with the behaviour of inflation in the Czech Republic. The Box-Jenkins methodology is used for the time series modelling. Results: The Czech Average <b>Gross</b> <b>Monthly</b> Wages and the Monthly Wage Medians in the business sector will continue to grow more rapidly than the Czech inflation growth, expressed by consumer price indices. Conclusions: It is possible to expect that the rising trend of the Average <b>Gross</b> <b>Monthly</b> Wages and the Gross Wage Medians will be more rapid than the growth of inflation...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to investigate}} the jobrelated expenditures of married clerical workers. Also examined were the economic contribution married clerical workers made to the total family income and their reasons for working. The sample was taken from the 1973 - 74 Staff Directory at Oregon State University. Only those employed in a clerical position who indicated they were married were included in the sample. Of the 425 who were mailed a questionnaire, 212 or 50 percent of them were received and were usable in the study. The number of hours the married clerical workers were employed per week ranged from 20 hours to 45 hours with 84 percent of the sample working 35 or more hours weekly. The mean monthly and yearly income for those in the sample were 471 and 5, 652 respectively. The mean percentage of gross family income contributed by the married clerical workers ranged from 10 percent to 94 percent with a mean of 47 percent. Of the 212 in the sample, 206 married clerical workers gave sufficient information to compute their job-related expenditures. Married clerical workers in the study reported 42. 1 percent of their <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> income was used for job-related expenditures. The mean expenditures were 198. 66 monthly and 2, 383. 92 yearly. Payroll deductions took 27. 2 percent of the married clerical workers' <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> income and other directly related expenses took 2. 2 percent. Expenses indirectly related to employment, such as clothing, personal care, child care, meals eaten away from home, and transportation, used 12. 7 percent of their <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> income. Expenses directly related to employment represented 70 percent of all job-related expenditures. The mean job-related expenditures of 124 of the 206 married clerical workers who reported no chiLdren in the household were 38 percent of their <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> and yearly income. Their mean <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> income was 478 and mean yearly income was 5, 736. Expenses directly related to employment took 29. 4 percent of their <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> and yearly income while indirectly related expenses used 8. 6 percent of their gross income. The mean percentage of job-related expenditures of the 42 married clerical workers who reported children in the household but no child care expense was 40. 7 percent with a mean monthly income of 459 and a mean yearly income of 5, 508. Payroll deductions represented 28. 3 percent of the job-related expenditures while other directly related expenses took two percent of their <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> and yearly income. Expenses indirectly related to employment used 10. 4 percent of their income. For the 40 married clerical workers who reported children in the household and child care expenses, their job-related expenses used 52 percent of their <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> and yearly income. Their mean monthly income was 498 and mean yearly income was 5, 976. Payroll deductions took 25. 9 percent of <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> income and other directly related expenses took 2. 9 percent. Expenses indirectly related to employment used 23. 2 percent of the married clerical workers' income. Reasons for working were also examined. Using a chi square test, there was a significantly greater amount (at the. 01 level) of full-time married clerical workers who indicated they worked to pay for current living expenses and to help pay debts than those working part time. There was also a significantly greater amount (at the. 05 level) of those who worked part time than those who worked full time indicating they worked because they liked working better than fulltime homemaking...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Streamflow {{disaggregation}} is used {{to preserve}} statistical attributes of time series across multiple sites and timescales. Several algorithms for spatial disaggregation and for disaggregation of annual to <b>monthly</b> <b>flows</b> are available. However, the disaggregation of monthly to daily or weekly to daily flows remains a challenge. A new algorithm is presented for simultaneously disaggregating <b>monthly</b> <b>flows</b> {{at a number of}} sites and daily flows at an index site to daily flows at a number of sites on a drainage network. The continuity of flow in time across months at each site as well as the intersite flow pattern are preserved. The disaggregated daily flows at the multiple sites are conditioned on the spatial (across site) pattern of <b>monthly</b> <b>flows</b> at the respective sites. The probability distribution of the vector of disaggregated flows conditional on the multisite <b>monthly</b> <b>flows</b> is approximated nonparametrically using the k nearest neighbors of the <b>monthly</b> spatial <b>flow</b> pattern. A constrained optimization problem is solved to adaptively estimate the disaggregated flows in space and time for each such neighborhood.
