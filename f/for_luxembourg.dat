5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg).</b> The Council would also have to hold sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Pierlot {{joined the}} Catholic Party (Parti catholique), the main centre-right party in Belgium {{and one of}} the three that {{dominated}} Belgian political life. The Catholic Party, which was considered the party of stability and the establishment, was extremely electorally successful during the interwar period and headed a series of coalition governments. On 23 December 1925, Pierlot entered parliament {{as a member of the}} Chamber of Deputies representing Neufchâteau-Virton but left just a week later to become a senator. He served as provincial senator <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> from 1926 to 1936 and as directly elected senator for the same province between 1936 and 1946. He received a reputation for his oratorical abilities and for personal sincerity during the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} {{of being a}} small population and with Belgian coins so abundantly circulating in Luxembourg meant it was seldom necessary <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> to issue coinage on a year by year basis, especially in later years during design changes when large numbers of coins were minted in Brussels to supply the small country for many years at a time. As a result, some dates appear in mint sets only while many other dates saw no standard issue coins minted at all. Many earlier dates changed frequently with larger denominations often being single year designs.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{recommended}} in May 2005 that its Member States cease all analogue television transmissions by January 1, 2012.

Latvia stopped broadcasting analogue television from June 1, 2010. Poland completed the transition on 23 July 2013 and Bulgaria completed the transition on 30 September 2013. Malta switched on 1 November 2011. ASO was mostly completed in Europe in 2013 though small hilly underpopulated isolated terrain areas awaited DTT rollout beyond that date.|$|E
25|$|Radio Luxembourg {{also served}} as a refuge for stars and shows {{previously}} heard on the BBC but with whom the BBC had fallen out for one reason or another. Thus, when in 1951 the BBC wanted Vera Lynn, one of its biggest singing stars, to perform more upbeat material than her traditional repertoire, she refused, and signed up to record 42 shows <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> instead – which, she said, also paid better. Likewise, the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, terminated by the BBC after six years, transferred to Radio Luxembourg for a period in 1950–51 before the BBC relented and revived the show.|$|E

25|$|The city's great {{significance}} for the frontier between the Second French Empire and the German Confederation led to the 1866 Luxembourg Crisis, almost resulting in a war between France and Prussia over possession of the German Confederation's main western fortress. The 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg's fortress to be torn down and <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> {{to be placed in}} perpetual neutrality, signalling the end of the city's use as a military site. Since then, the remains of the fortifications have become a major tourist attraction for the city. In 1994, the fortress remains and the city's old quarter were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|Early on 10 May 1940, the German diplomat Von Radowitz {{handed the}} general {{secretary}} of the Luxembourgish government a memorandum from the German government, stating that Germany had no intention of changing the territorial integrity or political independence of the Grand Duchy. The following day, a military administration <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> was set up. Luxembourgish interests were represented by a governmental commission under Albert Wehrer, which consisted of senior civil servants and had been legitimated by the Chamber of Deputies. There was a good relationship between this commission and the military authorities, as Colonel Schumacher showed a broad-minded attitude towards the country's problems and a willingness to solve these in consultation with the government commission.|$|E
25|$|Télé Monte Carlo (TMC) {{has also}} {{declared}} that Monaco {{would not be}} returning to the Eurovision Song Contest for the 2010 Edition, mainly {{due to a lack}} of finances to send a Monegasque entry. The RTL Group had announced that they were having serious discussions regarding a possible comeback <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> in the contest for the first time since 1993, but later confirmed that the country would not be present for the 2010 Contest either. San Marino also considered returning to the competition in 2010. However, after deliberations with Italian artists, including Italian sister duo Paola & Chiara, Sammarinnese broadcaster Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV) was informed to withhold returning after failing to receive funding from the Sammarinnese parliament or sponsors.|$|E

25|$|The {{reinforcement}} of the fortifications which {{had begun in}} 1320 under John the Blind continued {{until the end of}} the 14th century. In 1443 Philip the Good and his Burgundian troops took the city in a surprise attack by night. This started a period of foreign occupation <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> which had been elevated from a County to a Duchy in 1354. Integrated into the territory of the Netherlands, it would be drawn into the duel between Valois-Bourbons and Habsburgs over the next few centuries, and was ruled by the Burgundians, the French, and the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs. During this time the fortress was continually expanded and extended, and fitted to the military requirements of the day. The casemates, constructed by the Spanish and Austrians, are of particular note.|$|E
25|$|Radio Luxembourg {{was one of}} few {{channels}} {{through which}} {{people living in the}} Eastern Bloc could listen to rock and other contemporary popular music. Under good weather conditions, and especially at night, people as far as eastern Czechoslovakia and Estonia could listen to the station. Eastern Bloc governments did not use jammers to prevent people from listening to Radio Luxembourg, but did do so for Radio Free Europe and, since the stations used harmonic frequencies (1439kHz <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> and 719kHz for Free Europe), the jamming also affected Radio Luxembourg's signal. Even though western popular music was considered undesirable by socialist regimes, legal prosecution was rare, although not unheard of. The music appealed to young people as something forbidden, and listening to it became a social ritual. It also strongly influenced contemporary underground culture and music in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|However, when {{it seemed}} that Germany {{was on the verge}} of victory, the Chancellor began to revise his statements. [...] In his Septemberprogramm, Bethmann Hollweg called <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> to become a German federal state, and for that result to be forced upon the Luxembourgish people once Germany {{achieved}} victory over the Triple Entente. [...] Given this promise, it came as a great relief to most Luxembourgers that the British and French halted the German advance at the Battle of the Marne in mid-September. [...] The result for the combatant nations was trench warfare, but, <b>for</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> it was the indefinite continuation of German occupation.|$|E
