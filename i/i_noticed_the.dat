My companion, an unjaded {{musician}} from Prague, came away entranced... On opening night, <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> <b>the</b> loudest cheers came from the under-30s. After five performances, and despite a poisonous press, the good Doctor achieved an 83 per cent attendance and a decent chance of revival. So who was right, critics or audience? ...|$|E

McCloy wrote that three weeks before the explosion, he and Junior Toler found, while drilling a bolt hole, a gas pocket, which detectors confirmed the presence of methane. [...] "We immediately shut down the roof bolter, and the incident was reported up the line to our superiors. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> following day that the gas leak had been plugged with glue normally used to secure the bolts." ...|$|E

I saw him go into a steep dive... and then saw the triplane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments.As long as I [...] live I shall never forget my admiration for that German pilot, who single-handed fought seven of us for ten minutes and also put some bullets through all our machines. His flying was wonderful, his courage magnificent, and in my opinion he was the bravest German airman whom {{it has been my}} privilege to see fight.|$|E

2500|$|Although details, {{such as the}} superlaser's location, shifted between {{different}} concept models during production of Star Wars, {{the notion of the}} Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a [...] "Death Star" [...] to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film [...] In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that [...] "I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle." [...] As it [...] "would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression," [...] Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was created by John Stears. The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>the</b> schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E

60|$|Now, let him who {{is highly}} cultured {{take up a}} stone to throw at the poor, untaught Zulu, which <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>the</b> most dissolute and drunken wretch of a white man is often ready to do, {{generally}} because he covets his land, his labour, or whatever else may be his.|$|R
