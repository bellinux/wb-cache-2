5000|$|For example, the {{fracture}} {{surface of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>connector</b> showed the progressive growth of the crack from acid attack (Ch) to the final cusp (C) of polymer. In this case the failure was caused by hydrolysis of the polymer by contact with sulfuric acid leaking from a car battery. The degradation reaction is the reverse of the synthesis reaction of the polymer: ...|$|E
5000|$|Step-growth {{polymers}} like polyesters, polyamides and polycarbonates can be degraded by solvolysis and mainly hydrolysis to give lower {{molecular weight}} molecules. The hydrolysis {{takes place in}} the presence of water containing an acid or a base as catalyst.Polyamide is sensitive to degradation by acids and polyamide mouldings will crack when attacked by strong acids. For example, the fracture surface of a <b>fuel</b> <b>connector</b> showed the progressive growth of the crack from acid attack (Ch) to the final cusp (C) of polymer. The problem is known as stress corrosion cracking, and in this case was caused by hydrolysis of the polymer. It was the reverse reaction of the synthesis of the polymer: ...|$|E

50|$|The engine {{compartment}} space {{was designed to}} be watertight so that the Panther could ford water obstacles; however, this made the {{engine compartment}} underventilated and prone to overheating. The <b>fuel</b> <b>connectors</b> in the early models were not insulated, leading to the leakage of fuel fumes into the engine compartment, which caused engine fires in the early Panthers. Additional ventilation was added to draw off these gases, which only partly solved the problem of engine fires. Other measures taken to reduce this problem included improving the coolant circulation inside the motor and adding a reinforced membrane spring to the fuel pump. Despite the risks of fire, the fighting compartment was relatively safe due to a solid firewall that separated it from the engine compartment.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{connectors}} {{are widely}} utilized for signal communications in automotive electronic systems whose performance {{is related to}} the reliability of the entire system. Electrical connectors are frequently affected by the engine vibration, resulting in fretting damages on electrical connector. In this thesis, the main propose is to find a signal analysis method to predict the fretting damages on <b>fuel</b> pump <b>connector</b> induced by engine vibration. The data of the <b>fuel</b> pump <b>connector</b> is studied from a vibration test of the four-cylinder engine and the dominating frequencies are used in the fretting test to verify the analysis method. The fretting damage is identified through visual inspection by microscope. The model of the connector is built in COMSOL to explain the fretting on the contact surfaces. The results present the signal analysis method can be directly used to predict the risk of fretting damages during the engine vibration. Some significant frequencies are pointed out as guidelines for future tests and optimization...|$|R

5000|$|Polyphthalamide based resins are {{injection}} moulded into parts {{that are used}} {{in a wide variety of}} applications. Automotive uses include fuel and coolant lines, pump wear rings, motor bobbin parts, <b>fuel</b> line <b>connectors,</b> water heater manifolds fuel modules, fuel cut-off valves, thermostat housing, air coolers, coolant pumps, and LED headlights. In electronics, the high melting point of PPA allows SMD parts molded from PPA to be assembled using a lead-free soldering process. [...] PPAs are also used for USB Type-C connectors, LED mounts and cable/wire protection. Other applications for PPA based resins include gas pipes and supply lines for the oil industry (due to their ability to withstand high pressures), Medical applications such as tubing for catheters, in personal care, for toothbrush bristles as well as hairbrushes. PPAs are also used in sports equipment, valve bodies for showers, bushings and bearing pads in aircraft engines ...|$|R
