40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{groups of}} White Leghorn pullets, reared in floor pens, were {{observed}} {{for changes in}} behavioral traits when housed in cages. Data in Experiment 1 were obtained during Days 1 to 5 posthousing from 40 pullets kept in eight 40. 7 -cm wide x 45. 7 -cm <b>deep</b> <b>cages</b> with either four or six birds/cage and in Experiment 2 during Days 1 to 5 and Day 7 posthousing from 24 pullets housed four/cage in three 30. 5 -cmwide x 45. 7 -cm <b>deep</b> <b>cages</b> (<b>deep</b> <b>cages),</b> and three 45. 7 -cm wide x 30. 5 -cm <b>deep</b> <b>cages</b> (shallow cages). In Experiment 1, pullets housed four/cage spent significantly (P<. 05) fewer periods standing and crouching, but more periods preening, feeding, and performing comfort movements, than those housed six/cage. There was a significant group size x days posthousing interaction for standing and drinking. Standing was most frequent in the four-hen cages on Day 1 and then declined, whereas periods of standing increased in six-bird cages. Drinking behaviors were significantly different only on Day 1; six birds per cage had the lowest level. In Experiment 2, pullets in <b>deep</b> <b>cages</b> spent significantly more periods standing and moving and fewer periods crouching. Crouching frequencies declined from Day 1 to Day 7 posthousing for birds in both <b>deep</b> and shallow <b>cages.</b> Although there were significant cage shape x days posthousing interactions for all behavior observed, the interactions appeared {{to be associated with}} erratic day-to-day differences between hens in <b>deep</b> and shallow <b>cages.</b> (Key words: cage shape, density, settling in behavior...|$|R

Egg production increased (P <. 06) an average of 5 % for the levels of 250 and 500 ppm ascorbic acid. No differences were observed for feed consumption, egg weight, and shell thickness for the different levels of ascorbic acid or calcium in the diet. An increase (P <. 01) was observed for specific gravity, as the levels of ascorbic acid increased. Increasing the level of calcium from 3. 0 to 3. 5 % increased (P <. 01) specific gravity from 1. 073 to 1. 075. Shell weight increased (P <. 01) with the higher levels of ascorbic acid (250 and 500 ppm). No interactions were observed between the levels of ascorbic acid and calcium.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{describes}} the in silico prediction {{of the regulatory}} network of Leishmania infected human macrophages. The construction of the gene regulatory network requires the identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) in the regulatory regions (promoters, enhancers) of genes that are regulated upon Leishmania infection. The promoters of human, mouse, rat, dog and chimpanzee genes were first identified in the whole genomes using available experimental data on full length cDNA sequences or <b>deep</b> <b>CAGE</b> tag data (DBTSS, FANTOM 3, FANTOM 4), mRNA models (ENSEMBL), or using hand annotated data (EPD, TRANSFAC). A phylogenetic footprinting analysis and a MATCH analysis of the promoter sequences were then performed to predict TFBS. Then, an SQL database that integrates all results of promoter analysis {{as well as other}} genome annotation information obtained from ENSEMBL, TRANSFAC, TRED (Transcription Regulatory Element Database), ORegAnno and the ENCODE project, was established. Finally publicly available expression data from human Leishmania infected macrophages were analyzed using the genome-wide information on predicted TFBS with the computer system ExPlain™. The gene regulatory network was constructed and activated signal transduction pathways were revealed. The Irak 1 pathway was identified as a key pathway regulating gene expression changes in Leishmania infected macrophages...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three cage {{designs and}} three {{population}} densities were evaluated for production and economic performance traits of caged layers. A <b>deep</b> <b>cage</b> measuring 38. 1 cm {{across the front}} and 50. 8 cm in depth was compared with two shallow cages measuring 60. 9 cm across the front and 31. 8 cm and 35. 5 cm in depth (shallow A and shallow B, respectively). Population sizes were 4, 5, and 6 birds per cage. Birds in the shallow cages had higher hen-day egg production values, gained more weight, had larger egg weights and egg mass, produced more eggs grading large and extra large, used more feed, and had higher pullet and feed costs than birds in the deep cages. Hen-housed production and mortality differences for cage designed were not present. Birds in shallow cages also had poorer feed conversion figures and reduced net egg incomes. Differences between the shallow A and shallow B design cages {{were not significantly different}} (P>. 05) for the traits measured except for egg loss. Increasing density reduced most performance and economic factors. Exceptions were observed for mortality, egg weight, eggs grading large, and undergrades for which significant differences for population densities were not found. Significant (P<. 05) cage design by density interactions were present for hen-day production, feed usage, and pullet plus feed costs. (Key words: cage type, density, and performance...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{our work}} on the inference of gene regulatory interactions from deep sequencing data. In the first part we start with {{an introduction to the}} problem of inferring transcription regulatory interactions (Chapter 2). Then we describe detailed methods of promoterome construction in human and mouse genomes from <b>deep</b> <b>CAGE</b> data (Chapter 3), and show how promoters together with gene expression data can be used to infer transcription regulatory interactions (Chapter 4). Finally, we show an application of this methodology to a human macrophage lineage undergoing differentiation accompanied by a detailed experimental validation of the predicted network structure (Chapter 5). Work presented in Chapter 5 comes from the FANTOM 4 project. In the second part we focus on the regulatory functions of two small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). In Chapter 8 we describe an atypical function of snoRNAs - regulation of the mRNA alternative splicing process by a particular class of mouse snoRNAs (MBII- 52 variants). These are of great interest, as the locus encoding MBII- 52 is linked to Prader-Willi Syndrome. Methods include in silico RNA hybridization screens and experimental confirmation of the predictions. In Chapter 9, we report a discovery of the first virus-encoded snoRNA in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Again, we show that the function of this snoRNA (v-snoRNA 1) is atypical: it is processed into small, 24 nt long fragments that can function as microRNAs. ...|$|E

50|$|After {{the lobster}} seed is sold to farmers, they are {{normally}} placed into sea cages and grown to adult size for harvest at about 1 kg. This takes about 18- 24 months. Three methods of cage culture exist.

The second farming method is wooden fixed cages, made from 2.5m length by 10 cm width wood with salt resistance, placed about 2 m apart so to create a square shape and normally have an area of 20-40 m2 up to 100-200 m2 with varying cage size. They are usually on or off seabed in areas with little wave activity. Normally such cage methods are found in Van Phong Bay. The third cage farming method is the submerged cage method, made from iron mesh with meshing of 15-16 mm, with an overall size of the cage ranging from 1 - 16 m2 and with a height of 1 - 1.5 m.

40|$|Poultry {{production}} in intensive farms {{has been steadily}} increasing since the 1970 s. This has occurredthrough {{a number of factors}} including increased feed supply through greater use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer andincreased use of supplementary forage feeds. Potentially, the integration of low-protein forage (e. g. maize), toreduce dietary-N concentration, or management practices (e. g. <b>deep</b> layer, <b>cage</b> tier), to reduce excreta to waste,water and soil, can mitigate environmental N emissions and increase efficiency. However, effects of thesemitigation practices on resource use efficiency and environmental emissions, such as greenhouse gas emissionsand N leaching, {{are becoming more and more}} substantial, as the production on wider basis increased. This is oneof the reasons for including the large scale poultry farms on the list of the economical activities with significantimpact on environment, being subjected to more and stricter regulations. The direct and indirect environmentalimpacts of poultry farming are currently being investigated by using simulation modelling. The model simulationusing a life cycle assessment approach indicates that N fertilizer increases production and economic efficiencybut decreases environmental efficiency through predicted increases in N leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, using forage increases the use of land and production efficiency, with a decrease in N leaching andno increase in greenhouse gas emissions (per capita).

40|$|Abstract: A {{total number}} of two hundred day-old quails of mixed sexes were {{assessed}} for body weight, wing length, thigh length and breast girth from third week to the tenth week of age. Analyzed data showed that there was highly significant (P< 0. 01) house x sex interaction effects on live body weight. This means that body weight is house and sex dependent. Male and female birds reared inside the cage were superior in terms of body weight to those on deep litter. Generally, {{the rate of growth}} from third to seventh week was higher across both housing systems and sexes, but decreased after seventh week of age. In the same vein, There was highly significant (P< 0. 01) house x sex interaction effects on wing length, thigh length and breast girth of quail birds. It infers that these growth traits are house and sex dependent. Male and female birds reared inside the cage were superior in terms of body weight and other growth traits to those on <b>deep</b> litter. Since <b>cage</b> birds were restricted, they were able to utilize feeds given optimally leading to increase in muscle cells and body size.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to estimate and compare the costs and returns in <b>deep</b> litter and <b>cage</b> systems of poultry rearing and also to identify the constraints, which affect the poultry production in India. Results of this study reveal that the fixed investment per farm is found to be more on cage system of rearing for all the three size groups. In both systems, the feed cost decrease gradually when the stock size increases except in medium size group in deep litter system and accounts for more than 84 % of the total cost of production irrespective of stock size and system of rearing. The cost of production per bird reveal that the cost of permanent and family labor and electricity increase with increase in stock size in case of deep litter system whereas in cage system, it is found to decrease with increase in flock size. The cage system appears to be more efficient than the deep litter system in producing eggs and the feed efficiency increases with decrease in stock size in both the system of rearing. Further, the net returns per farm increase as the size of the farm increases in both the systems and the returns per farm is, however, higher in cage system than in deep litter system in all the three groups. The major constraints in egg production are identified and ranked by using Garrett’s Ranking Technique and are in the order of high cost of feed, high cost of medicine and vaccine, supply of poor quality feed and feed ingredients, non remunerative price for eggs, lack of disease control facilities and higher rate of electricity tariff...|$|R
50|$|On December 24, 1932, at 8:15 AM, {{the whistle}} from the mine blew. People {{from the town}} began to gather outside the mine because {{they knew that the}} whistle meant that {{something}} went wrong at the work site. There was a methane gas explosion in the mine shaft a few minutes before they got there. It was later discovered in a state investigation published February 1, 1933, by the Moweaqua News that the disaster was caused by the open flame of a miner’s carbide lamp which ignited the methane gas and prompted the explosion. Only about half of the miners were working that day as it was Christmas Eve and many chose to stay home with their families or were out of the town. 54 miners were trapped 625 feet below the ground in the shaft. However, two miners named Frank Floski and Ibra Adams did survive the accident because they were in a <b>cage</b> <b>deeper</b> in the mine. Specially trained rescue miners from Pana, Springfield arrived to help control the situation and retrieve bodies from the mine. When the other miners who had taken the day off arrived at the mine, they were not allowed in. The Illinois Central Railroad brought in cars to give the rescue miners a place to sleep and food to eat. The American Red Cross, the Moweaqua Hospital and people in the town also helped provide meals for the workers. Although the disaster was tragic and 54 lives were lost, it brought the community together and everyone helped each other through their grief.

40|$|Water troughs from <b>deep</b> litter and <b>caged</b> chicken water troughs (drinkers) {{fixed to}} each of the {{different}} 3 -tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7 -day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. Drinkers were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p> 0. 05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p 0. 05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring...|$|R
5000|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter simply said, [...] "Fury is a good, solid World War II movie, {{nothing more}} and nothing less. Rugged, macho, violent {{and with a}} story {{sufficiently}} unusual to grab and hold interest, it's a modern version {{of the sort of}} movie Hollywood turned out practically every week back in the 1940s and 1950s." [...] Peter Debruge wrote for the magazine Variety in which he praised Pitt, [...] "Brad Pitt plays a watered-down version of his 'Inglourious Basterds' character in this disappointingly bland look at a World War II tank crew." [...] The Wraps James Rocchi gave 4 out 5 ratings and expressed a warm approval of the film which is [...] "unflinching, unsentimental and never unconsidered, [...] "Furys rumbling, metal-clad exterior has real humanity, fragile and frightened, captured and <b>caged</b> <b>deep</b> within it." [...] Randy Myers of the San Jose Mercury News rated the film 3 out of 4 and talked about LaBeouf [...] "who's most impressive, inhabiting the soul of a scripture-quoting soldier who seeks guidance from the Word in hopes of remaining on a moral path. While much has been made about the reportedly extreme lengths he took to prep for the role, the fact remains it is one of his best performances." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a 4 out of 4 rating and wrote completely in the favor of the film: [...] "A great movie lets you know you're in safe hands from the beginning." [...] James Berardinelli also gave the film a positive review saying: [...] "This is a memorable motion picture, accurately depicting the horrors of war without reveling in the depravity of man (like Platoon). Equally, it shows instances of humanity without resorting to the rah-rah, sanitized perspective that infiltrated many war films of the 1950s and 1960s. It's as good a World War II film as I've seen in recent years, and contains perhaps the most draining battlefield sequences since Saving Private Ryan.|$|R
