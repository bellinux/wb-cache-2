5|$|In North America, all Tales of Graces fs DLC, {{excluding}} cameo costumes {{from other}} franchises, was localized and released between March 13, 2012 and April 10, 2012.

5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one <b>day,</b> <b>one</b> gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E

5|$|A North American {{localization}} was hinted on Namco Bandai Games' Facebook page by {{a puzzle}} on January 24, 2011.

On May 11, 2011, Namco officially announced the North American, EMEA and Asia-Pacific localization of Tales of Graces f. The text was translated by 8-4 while Cup of Tea Productions produced the dubbing. The North American localization {{was released on}} March 13, 2012. The EMEA and Asia-Pacific localization released on August 31, 2012 along with a <b>day</b> <b>one</b> special edition.

5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that <b>day</b> <b>one</b> {{or both of the}} fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called {{for the majority of the}} 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on <b>day</b> <b>one.</b> The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one anti-tank platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine gun and anti-tank platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the social}} {{programs}} involved during the event were {{the opening ceremonies}} at the Tipsport arena.

Concerts {{took place on the}} Liberec main square where medal award ceremonies occurred. In addition, there were special themed days, including Italian Day, Czech Day, Norwegian Day and Slovak <b>Day.</b> <b>One</b> recurring theme of this was free beer for people from these countries in some pubs at happy hour. The most famous fans at the championships were the Norwegians, who were very numerous compared with the other countries.|$|E

5|$|At 9:42a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{grounded}} all civilian aircraft {{within the}} continental U.S., and civilian aircraft already in flight {{were told to}} land immediately. All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers. Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the <b>day,</b> <b>one</b> of the most prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the U.S. State Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Another jet—Delta Air Lines Flight 1989—was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the <b>day.</b> <b>One</b> of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since How to Sleep, and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How to Sleep needed two days, the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one <b>day</b> (<b>one</b> of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E

5|$|Close to {{the village}} and gorge are Batts Combe quarry and Callow Rock quarry, two of the active Quarries of the Mendip Hills where {{limestone}} is still extracted.

The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per <b>day,</b> <b>one</b> third of which was supplied to an on-site lime kiln, which closed in 2009; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99percent carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite).|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from <b>day</b> <b>one</b> without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
