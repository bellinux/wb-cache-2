5000|$|The <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> {{occupies}} {{an intermediate}} trophic {{level in the}} food chain.|$|E
50|$|The main predators of the <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> are the Pacific cod, Alaska pollock, arrowtooth flounder, Greenland turbot and Pacific halibut.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flathead</b> <b>sole's</b> diet {{consists}} of zoobenthos invertebrates such as clams, worms and brittle stars, {{as well as}} fish and squid.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> is a right-eyed {{flounder}} with an oval-shaped body. Its {{upper surface}} is dark in colour, olive brown to reddish grey-brown, {{and may have}} dusky blotches; its underside is white with translucent areas. The dorsal and anal fins also have dusky blotches. The lateral line curves slightly around the pectoral fin. The upper jaw is narrow {{in the middle and}} has one row of teeth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flathead</b> <b>sole</b> is not {{currently}} overfished, and biomass {{is estimated to}} be above the level required to support the maximum sustainable yield. In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area, biomass was estimated at 535,356 tons in 2008, down from a peak of almost 800,000 tons in 1997; in the Gulf of Alaska, biomass was estimated at 280,000 tons in 2007, where biomass has fluctuated around an average of 220,000 tons since 1984.|$|E
50|$|The USA lands the {{majority}} of the world's catch of <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> and manages three fisheries - one in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, one in the Gulf of Alaska and one off the West Coast. Commercial fishing is conducted by trawler. Annual catches average around 17,000 tons in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area; in 2008 the Gulf of Alaska catch reached its highest ever level of 3,396 tons. The discard rate for each area is around 10%.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> Hippoglossoides elassodon, is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on soft, silty or muddy bottoms at depths of up to 1050 m. Its native habitat is the northern Pacific, from the seas of Japan and Okhotsk, across the Bering Sea and to the coast of North America, {{as far south as}} Point Reyes, USA. It grows to 52 cm in length, and can weigh up to 1.56 kg; females are typically larger than males. Lifespan is at least 27 years for females and at least 30 years for males.|$|E
40|$|Data from ichthyoplankton surveys {{conducted}} in 1972 and from 1977 to 1999 (no {{data were collected}} in 1980) by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (NOAA, NMFS) in the western Gulf of Alaska were {{used to examine the}} timing of spawning, geographic distribution and abundance, and the vertical distribution of eggs and larvae of <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> (Hippoglossoides elassodon). In the western Gulf of Alaska, <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> spawning began in early April and peaked from early to mid-May on the continental shelf. It progressed in a southwesterly direction along the Alaska Peninsula where three main areas of <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> spawning were indentified: near the Kenai Peninsula, in Shelikof Strait, and between the Shumagin Islands and Unimak Island. <b>Flathead</b> <b>sole</b> eggs are pelagic, and their depth distribution may be a function of their developmental stage. Data from MOCNESS tows indicated that eggs sink near time of hatching and the larvae rise to the surface to feed. The geographic distribution of larvae followed a pattern similar to the distribution of eggs, only it shifted about one month later. Larval abundance peaked from early to mid-June in the southern portion of Shelikof Strait. Biological and environmental factors may help to retain <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> larvae on the continental shelf near their juvenile nursery areas...|$|E
40|$|Whole-gear {{efficiency}} (the {{proportion of}} fish passing between the otter doors of a bottom trawl that are subsequently captured) was estimated from data collected during experiments {{to measure the}} herding efficiency of bridles and doors, the capture efficiency of the net, {{and the length of}} the bridles sufficiently close to the seafloor to elicit a herding response. The experiments were focused on four species of flatfish: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> (Hippoglossoides elassodon), rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus), and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). Whole-gear efficiency varied with fish length and reached maximum values between 40 % and 50 % for arrowtooth flounder, <b>flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> and rex sole. For Dover sole, however, whole-gear efficiency declined from a maximum of 33 % over the length range sampled. Such efficiency estimates can be used to determine catchability, which, in turn, can be used to improve the accuracy of stock assessment models when the time series of a survey is short...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} analyzes {{a proposed}} action that would allocate the ABC surplus (i. e., {{the difference between}} acceptable biological catch and total allowable catch) for <b>flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> rock sole, and yellowfin sole, among the Amendment 80 cooperatives and CDQ groups, using the same formulas {{that are used in}} the annual harvest specifications process. These entities would be able to exchange their <b>flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> rock sole, and/or yellowfin sole quota share for an equivalent amount of their allocation of the ABC surplus for these species. The approach is intended to increase the opportunity for maximizing the harvest of these species, while ensuring that the overall 2 million mt optimum yield, and ABCs for each individual species, are not exceeded. The analysis also includes options to restrict flexibility in the exchange of yellowfin sole, if the analysis shows that there is a potential negative impact of the approach on users of yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands trawl limited access sector. The proposed action would amend the Fishery Management Plan fo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 The Mendenhall Wetlands in Juneau, Alaska were sampled with {{a variety}} of gear types to {{determine}} if the wetlands were essential fish habitat for flatfish. At locations where fish were captured, water quality characteristics were recorded and stomach contents of starry flounder and yellowfin sole were examined. Starry flounder, yellowfin sole, rock sole and <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> were captured {{over the course of the}} sampling season, both adults and juveniles. Starry flounder were captured in all sampling locations. Starry flounder have the ability to survive in higher temperatures, lower salinities and lower oxygen content than the other species. Yellowfin sole, rock sole and <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> were only captured on the mudflat, not in any of the less saline or warmer locations. The flatfish had more food items in their stomachs at high tide than at low tide, with the majority of food items being benthic, such as clam siphons, whole clams, mussels and copepods. The Mendenhall Wetlands appear to provide essential habitat for starry flounder, providing both food and shelter to several life stages and marginal habitat for the other three species of flatfish observed...|$|E
40|$|A rigid grate was {{installed}} in a groundfish trawl to test its effectiveness in excluding Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis, from commercial flatfish catches in the Gulf of Alaska. The grate was located ahead of the trawl codend to direct halibut toward an escape opening while allowing target species to pass through toward the codend. In an experimental fishery, the escape rate of halibut was estimated at 94 %, while 72 % of the Dover sole, Microstomas pacificus, 67 % of the rex sole, Glyptocephalus zachirus, and 79 % of the <b>flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> Hippoglossoides elassodon, were retained...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Prior to 2001, the "other flatfish" species complex {{included}} Alaska plaice (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus). <b>Flathead</b> <b>sole</b> (Hippoglossoides elassodon) {{were part}} of the other flatfish complex until they were removed in 1995, and in recent years Alaska plaice was the dominant species of the complex and comprised 87 % of both the 2000 catch and the estimated 2001 trawl survey biomass. Because more biological information exists for Alaska plaice than for the remaining species of other flatfish, an age-structured population model was used to assess this stock. In contrast, survey biomass estimates are the principal data source used to assess the remaining other flatfish. In 2002, Alaska plaice were and removed from the other species complex and managed separately. Given the differences in biological information, assessment techniques, and management, it is appropriate to separate the assessment of Alaska plaice from the remaining other flatfish. This chapter considers the ass...|$|E
40|$|On the {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of the neutral lipids in nine species of flatfishes Kenji HAYAsm * and Minoru YAMADA* Nine species of flatfishes were examined for this study. The fatty aoid oomposition of the neutral-lipids in eaoh flesh, visoera, liv~r, and gonad of the examined fishes was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The {{results showed that the}} fatty acid composition in the liver of 'aburagarei', Japanese arrowtooth flounder, 'samegarei', roughsoale sole, and 'akagarei', <b>flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> consisted markedly of large amounts of monoenoio aoids, while relatively little of polyenoio aoids. A similar tendenoy was recognized in the oase of the flesh of 'aburagarei ' and 'samega. rei'. Besides, the ratio of monoenoio aoid to polyenoio acid contents in the fatty aoid oomposition of the liver of 'aburagarei', 'same-garei', 'akagarei', and 'ishigarei', stone flounder, gave the value of more than four.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 <b>Flathead</b> <b>sole,</b> Pacific halibut, rock sole, and {{yellowfin sole}} were found co-existing near Kodiak Island as juveniles (< 200 mm) during late summer. Dietary {{differences}} {{were attributed to}} fish species, size, and depth-sediment characteristics of their habitat. Two to three size classes were assigned within each species. Across all habitats, significant differences in dietary composition, stomach fullness, and diet diversity were found between size classes of different flatfish species. Within a single depth-sediment habitat, flatfishes of different species and size classes ate similar prey. Seven of nine species size classes had similar prey composition across multiple habitats. Significant differences in dietary composition across habitats were detected only for small Pacific halibut and small rock sole. The juvenile flatfishes near Kodiak were opportunistic feeders, and appeared to select habitat based on parameters other than the presence of specific prey taxa...|$|E

40|$|Service {{for use in}} {{studying}} the capture efficiency of a survey bottom trawl’s footrope in diverse habitats commonly sampled during surveys. This system utilizes a 50 -watt quartz halogen light since most survey stations are at depths greater than natural light can penetrate for low-light camera use. One potential shortcoming to {{this approach is that}} the light emitted might alter fish behaviour and thereby bias estimates of escapement. The light effect on escapement was examined by attaching the video system onto a trawl fitted with an auxiliary capture bag to retain those fish which would have otherwise escaped beneath. A paired towing experiment (unlit vs. lit) was conducted to test the hypothesis that there is no effect on capture proportion due to the addition of artificial light. ANOVA was used to test for the effect both fish length and water depth had on escapement. Since neither length nor depth were significant, a paired t test (α= 0. 05) was used to test the null hypothesis. For five of the six species examined, we found no effect of the light on fish escapement. Only <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> (Hippoglossoides elassodon) showed a statistically significant difference in capture proportion due to artificial light, the proportion decreasing by 0. 0698...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014. Influences of biophysical {{conditions}} on survival of zoeal and {{early stages of}} eastern Bering Sea Tanner crab, Chionoecetes bairdi, were investigated using simple linear regression modeling, and a combination of hydrodynamic modeling and spatial and geostatistical methods. Linear regression analyses indicated that estimated reproductive female crab abundance, age 3 - 7 Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) abundance and <b>flathead</b> <b>sole</b> (Hippoglossoides elassodon) total biomass were statistically related to estimates of recruitment to the 30 - 50 mm carapace width size interval of juvenile crab. Analysis of output from a Regional Ocean Modeling System simulation model indicated considerable capacity of the Bering Sea oceanography to retain zoeae at regional and local scales. Major transport patterns corresponded to long-term mean flows, with a northwesterly vector. Retention may be a significant recruitment process, particularly in Bristol Bay, which is effectively oceanographically isolated from other source regions of crab larvae. Periods during which conditions may have favored juvenile crab survival were observed at the model-estimated larval endpoints during the early 1980 s and mid to late 1990 s. While environmental conditions at model-estimated endpoints were highly variable, crab recruitment {{was positively correlated with}} endpoint locations either within the periphery of the cold pool, or outside of it, and SST > 2 ° C after allowing for autocorrelation in the juvenile recruitment series. However, limitations of the model, gaps in knowledge of Tanner crab life history and ecology, and the possibility of spurious correlations complicate interpretation of these results...|$|E
