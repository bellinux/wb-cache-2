25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>PEW</b> survey {{previously}} referenced, 50% {{of respondents}} believe that refugees are a burden due to job and social benefit competition. When Sweden received over 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015, it {{was accompanied by}} 50 attacks against asylum-seekers, which was {{more than four times}} the number of attacks that occurred in the previous four years. At the incident level, the 2011 Utøya Norway terror attack by Breivik demonstrates the impact of this threat perception on a country's risk from domestic terrorism, in particular ethno-nationalist extremism. Breivik portrayed himself as a protector of Norwegian ethnic identity and national security fighting against immigrant criminality, competition and welfare abuse and an Islamic takeover.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ball of fire}} {{reportedly}} {{divided into}} two segments, one exiting through a window by smashing it open, the other disappearing somewhere inside the church. The explanation at the time, because of the fire and sulfur smell, was that the ball of fire was [...] "the devil" [...] or the [...] "flames of hell". Later, some blamed the entire incident on two {{people who had been}} playing cards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pew</b> during the sermon, thereby incurring God's wrath.|$|E

I think he has said that of course I know what all the reputable scholars think on the subject and therefore when I talk about the risen body I must mean something other than the empty tomb. But I don't. I don't know how to persuade him, but I really don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|A November 2010 {{survey by}} the Pew Research Center found that 58% of the U.S. public favored {{allowing}} gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, while less than half as many (27%) were opposed. According to a November 2010 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, 72% of adult Americans favored permitting people who are openly gay or lesbian {{to serve in the}} military, while 23% opposed it. [...] "The main difference between the CNN poll and the Pew poll is in the number of respondents who told pollsters that they didn't have an opinion on this topic – 16 percent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pew</b> poll compared to only five percent in the CNN survey", said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. [...] "The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that {{there are some people who}} favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers. That happens occasionally on topics where moral issues and equal-treatment issues intersect." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is {{to determine the extent to}} which creation care is reaching and influencing <b>the</b> patrons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> of Evangelical Christian churches as well as to determine if Evangelicals will ever be prepared to take a strong and widespread stance on the environmental issues of our time. A mixed method research design was employed that consisted of three focus groups that served to directly inform the development of an online survey. Survey respondents consisted of 283 primarily Mississippi residents and students attending colleges and universities in Mississippi. Results illustrated that a majority of Evangelicals do consider themselves called by God to be good stewards of the earth. However, this has not equated to substantial proactive environmental action. The study concluded that creation care’s message has not substantially influenced patrons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> of Evangelical churches. However, the data further illustrated that a strong willingness to engage in creation care does exist among Evangelicals Christians.

50|$|According to David Barrett,, {{there are}} an {{additional}} 60 million Americans who are born again believers and do not attend any church.
