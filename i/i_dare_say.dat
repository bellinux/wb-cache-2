25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E

[...] Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse.|$|E
500|$|As {{the smoke}} cleared, the Prussian {{infantry}} reformed its lines, preparing {{to pursue the}} fleeing Austrians. Snow began to fall and Frederick halted the pursuit. A few soldiers, perhaps only one, started to sing the well-known chorale, Nun danket alle Gott (Now Thank We All Our God); eventually the entire army may have joined in the song, although this story is likely apocryphal. Frederick pushed toward Lissa. Refugees from the battle had filled the town, and he found {{the courtyard of the}} local castle crowded with startled Austrian officers. Reportedly, after he dismounted, he addressed them politely, [...] "Good evening, Gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> you did not expect me here. [...] Can one get a night's lodging along with you?" ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." [...] Speaking of his manga in general, he said, [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, {{as long as they have}} entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, manga {{critic and}} editor of Viz's editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far the}} most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on Dragon Balls global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy. The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E

"Yes, but {{she only}} looked at me in her tragical way, and said, so pitifully, 'My little friend, I hope you will never have {{to pass through the}} scenes I've passed through, but keep your peace {{unbroken}} all your life.'

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>dared</b> <b>say</b> no more; and, {{when the}} poor {{old man had}} been driven away by this foul proceeding, I went {{up the steps and}} peeped in; for I heard some one crying, and thought the cross bird, perhaps, had hurt some one else. A little old woman stood there, {{wringing}} her hands in great distress; while a small dog was barking at her with all his might.|$|R
2500|$|The {{national}} syndicalist journalist Émile Janvion {{published an}} undated pamphlet, probably in late 1917, titled Le féminisme défaitiste (Defeatist Feminism). He identified pro-peace feminist {{leaders such as}} Hélène Brion, Séverine, Marguerite Durand, Hubertine Auclert and Nelly Roussel, and wrote, [...] "the history of defeatism, when it is known, will demonstrate superabundantly that feminism will there merit, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say,</b> the place of honor." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtues humor, visual {{design and}} voice acting {{generally}} received praise, with some exceptions. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer felt that [...] "the poop gags [...] a little wearisome" [...] but added [...] "a sprinkling {{of the old}} Gilbert magic makes it a worthwhile ride." [...] In comparison to DeathSpank, IGN's Hatfield felt that Thongs of Virtue was [...] "addictive, just as pretty, and <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> it's even a little funnier." [...] Ryan Vincent from GameZone thought the game's new setting gave the game [...] "far more charm and personality than the first DeathSpank." ...|$|E
2500|$|He had {{a special}} penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his {{favourite}} amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: [...] "a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I'm just a snob." [...] He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: [...] "Elspeth, of course, is Scottish." [...] And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2014, Lithuanian {{ambassador}} to the United States, [...] {{said in an interview}} for the LRT TV programme Savaitė, that after the Russo-Georgian War everyone in Brussels [...] "laughed about Lithuania's position". He said that [...] "... at that time, the Western world forgot and forgave Russia for what it did in Georgia – occupied a large part of its territory, and is still keeping it." [...] In July 2014, Žygimantas Pavilionis said that when Russia occupied the Georgian territories, [...] "... Lithuanian diplomats were the only ones in Europe and, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say,</b> in Lithuania who constantly tried to defend a free Georgia to the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzen was disliked by Russian {{radicals}} as too moderate. Radicals such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov {{wanted more}} commitment towards violent revolution from Herzen and {{the withdrawal of}} any hope in the reformist Tsar. Radicals asked Herzen to use The Bell as a mouthpiece for violent radical revolution, but Herzen rejected these requests. He argued that the Russian Radicals were not united and strong enough to seek successful political change, stating, [...] "You want happiness, I suppose? <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> you do! Happiness has to be conquered. If you are strong, take it. If you are weak, hold your tongue". Herzen feared a new revolutionary government would merely replace the dictatorship with another dictatorship.|$|E
2500|$|Vita's first {{close friend}} was Rosamund Grosvenor (5 September 1888 – 30 June 1944), who {{was four years}} her senior. Rosamund was the {{daughter}} of Algernon Henry Grosvenor (1864–1907), and the granddaughter of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury. Vita met Rosamund at Miss Woolf's school in 1899, when Rosamund had been invited to cheer Vita up while her father was fighting in the Second Boer War. Rosamund and Vita later shared a governess for their morning lessons. As they grew up together, Vita fell in love with Rosamund, whom she called 'Roddie' or 'Rose' or 'the Rubens lady'. Rosamund, in turn, was besotted with Vita. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> I realized vaguely that I had no business to sleep with Rosamund, and I should certainly never have allowed anyone to find it out," [...] she admits in her journal, but she saw no real conflict: [...] "I really was innocent." ...|$|E

2500|$|The OVA {{received}} mixed reviews. Rating the OVA an A-, Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment recommended it, {{praising the}} animation quality, {{and considered the}} plot [...] "an extended prologue" [...] {{to the events of}} the manga. Anime News Network's Theron Martin rated it as a B, describing it as [...] "a sharp, great-looking series which mixes shojo elements with sometimes intensely graphic violence, but this was not a production meant to stand on its own." [...] Martin noted that Yuki's interpretation of Judeo-Christian elements had the potential to be offensive to Christian or Jewish viewers. Rating it one out of five stars, Dave Merrill of Anime Jump criticized Angel Sanctuary as a [...] "pretentious, confusing claptrap", and found the inclusion of incest objectionable. Aimée Schafer of THEM Anime Reviews rated it similarly, and criticized Sara and Setsuna's relationship as [...] "completely unnecessary and totally ruined what could otherwise have been a solid and, <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say,</b> good story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then <b>I</b> <b>dare</b> <b>say</b> it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
