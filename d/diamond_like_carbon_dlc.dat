In the study of the coating used several surface sensitive techniques and methods, i. e.

40|$|Thin films, used {{in various}} {{applications}} and devices, must strongly adhere to their substrates. Due to various processing and storage environments that devices can be exposed to, water may be {{introduced into the}} system. If residual stresses are present in a thin film, delamination propagation can be driven by water without the assistance of an externally applied mechanical force. It is extremely important to measure coating adhesion quantitatively, taking into account environmental effects.

40|$|Low {{friction}} surface coatings combine low wear rates with low friction coefficients. Both properties enable the protective layers to sustain wide ranges of loading and environmental conditions {{or even to}} substitute lubricants. At present, low friction coatings are commonly used on an empirical basis but not as a design element. The reason for the empirical approach is the missing of tools to describe {{the interaction between the}} coatings and the substrate and the difficulty to obtain information on the mechanical properties (e. g. strength, toughness, adhesion, residual stresses) of the coatings. A cyclic indentation test is proposed by (1) and (2) to substitute expensive coating tests in cyclic loaded machine elements, e. g. ball bearings. (3) studied the fracture modes of different hard coatings (e. g. TiCN, TiAlN, CrN) under different loading conditions (e. g. in lubricated ball bearings) and found them consistent with the failure modes in cyclic indentation tests under similar str ess conditions. This paper analyses the possibility to predict the lifetime of <b>Diamond</b> <b>like</b> <b>carbon</b> coatings (<b>DLC,</b> a-C:H) under mechanical cyclic loading by the use of the cyclic spherical indentation test.

40|$|Due {{to limited}} {{lifetime}} for biomedical implants, material engineers have strived {{to improve the}} surface properties of existing biomaterials. Widely used methods of surface modification include film deposition such as physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and <b>diamond</b> <b>like</b> <b>carbon</b> coating (<b>DLC).</b> Internal stresses {{make it difficult to}} bond such coatings to the substrates thus weakening the structure and limiting the life of implants. Laser glazing can achieve an amorphous layer on a component surface. Advantages of an amorphous layer include increased hardness, wear and corrosion resistance. These advantages arise from the elimination of crystalline anisotropy and inter-crystalline defects. These latter crystalline features provide the dislocation nucleation sites and shorter diffusion paths for enhanced oxidation and corrosion degradation. The current study introduced a surface modification method of laser glazing of biomedical AISI 316 L austenitic stainless steel to improve tribological properties. This stainless steel is commonly used in orthopaedics owing to its high corrosion resistance. However, due to its low hardness (250 HV), its tribological properties are poor. A pulsed CO 2 laser was used with peak power and pulse width being varied between 0. 4 to 1. 5 kW and 30 µs to 120 µs respectively. The laser beam spot size, sample speed, percentage overlap and pulse repetition frequency were kept at 90 µm, 570 rpm, 50 % and 5 kHz respectively. These parameters were optimised from literature parameters using design of experiments software. This paper presents and discusses the effects of these processing parameters on the morphology of the glazed zone. Microstructure and chemical composition were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyse the degree of crystallinity in the glazed zone. A stylus profilometer and micro-hardness tester were also used to investigate the effects of glazing on roughness and hardness of the modified stainless steel layer. A strong correlation between irradiance, depth of processing and roughness of processed material was found. Increased depth of altered microstructure and increased roughness were linked to higher levels of irradiance...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of cutting performance of knifes attempt {{to enhance the}} abrasion resistance of the edge, for example with coatings. Nowadays there are sporadic applications using hardened steel knifes for non-shape cutting, which use a coating of Titanium, Chromium or Titanium aluminium nitride. Thereby are friction minimizing and abrasion protection more important than cutting performance enhancement. The paper describes the results of studies with coated knives which use a super hard <b>Diamond</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Carbon</b> coating (<b>DLC).</b> The trials show that the amorphous carbon coating improves the cutting output of hardened knives. The {{research shows that the}} cutting performance of technical knives can be enhanced through coatings. The amorphous hydrogen-free carbon coating obviously improves the cutting output of hardened stainless steel knives. Coated machine-guided paper knives show a double cutting performance compared to uncoated knifes. Furthermore the tests have not been performed to the end so the difference in practice might be higher than the test results in laboratory. By the coated samples the aimed sharpness protecting effect occurs. The protection of one edge side leads to wear on the uncoated side thus minimize the widing of the edge breadth. Therefore the sharpness of th coated knife stays on longer. To achieve such good results it was very important to produce a very adhesive coating. For that reason the pre-treatment of the sample before coating has been adjusted for this special base material. The micro edged geometry and the coating properties have to be adapted for each application. An integrated view which takes all those parameters into consideration fails. Even though the results show that coatings can improve the cutting performance of hardened knives, {{further research is needed to}} understand the adhesion problems of the coatings at the small edge. The behaviour of the coated side is different to the free surfaces because of its unequal properties. The influence of the roughness and the sharping method is not scientifically defined. The effect to the coated side adhesion is not quite clear and subject of further research. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
