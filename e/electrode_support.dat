40|$|The {{invasive}} {{nature of}} electrodes placed into sound fields is examined. In particular, perturbations {{of the sound}} field due {{to the presence of}} the <b>electrode</b> <b>support</b> are explored. The effect of an electrode on the drive sound field (at ~ 23 kHz) is shown to be negligible under the conditions investigated in this paper. However, scattering of shock waves produced by cavity collapse is shown to exhibit a significant effect. To demonstrate this, multibubble sonoluminescence (MBSL) and electrochemical erosion measurements are employed. These measurements show an enhancement, due to the reflection by the solid/liquid boundary at the <b>electrode</b> <b>support,</b> of pressure pulses emitted when cavitation bubbles collapse. To first order, this effect can be accounted for by a correction factor. However, this factor requires accurate knowledge of the acoustic impedance of the interface and the electrolyte media. These are measured for two commonly employed substrates (soda glass and epoxy resin, specifically Epofix). A scattering model is developed which is able to predict the acoustic pressure as a function of position over a disk-like electrode substrate. The effects of shock wave reflection and materials employed in the electrode construction are used to clarify the interpretation of the results obtained from different sonoelectrochemical experiments.

40|$|Heteropolyacids (HPAs) are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} that have shown promising results as catalysts during the last decades. Since HPAs have displayed encouraging performance as electrocatalysts in acidic environment, in this project their redox activity in acid and alkaline aqueous electrolytes and their electrocatalytic performance as additives on a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode in alkaline aqueous electrolyte are tested. The results from the electrochemical characterisation of two different HPAs, the phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) and the phosphotungstic acid (PWA) dissolved in acidic and alkaline environment showed that both heteropolyacids demonstrate a redox activity but they also suffer from low stability issues. A series of gas diffusion electrodes were manufactured having PMA and PWA incorporated in their catalyst layer. The <b>electrode</b> <b>support</b> was carbon Toray paper and each heteropolyacid was mixed with Ni to create the catalyst layer of the electrode. From the electrochemical characterisation oF these electrodes in alkaline electrolyte, it was shown that the addition of HPAs enhances {{the activity of the}} nickel towards OER and ORR. During the constant current measurements on the manufactured gas diffusion electrodes it was noticed that the electrodes fail after a period of time which could be attributed to the corrosion of the carbon support. In order to find alternative, non-carbon materials to be used as the <b>electrode</b> <b>support,</b> electrochemical characterisation on Magneli phase bulk materials, Magneli spray coated electrodes and PVD coated electrodes was performed.
