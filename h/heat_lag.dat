40|$|Background: Eczema is an {{important}} condition as it affects 20 % {{of children in the}} UK and is associated with significant morbidity for children and their families. Although some progress in understanding factors associated with the occurrence of eczema has been made, very little is known about factors associated with disease worsening. Most textbooks and review articles quote long lists of exacerbating factors but with very little scientific data to support them. Before I could begin to study this topic, I first had to define a disease flare in eczema, systematically review the literature on flare factors in eczema and review available outcome measures for eczema. Objectives: The objectives of the main study described in this thesis were to assess the role of various environmental factors on the severity of eczema in a cohort of children with eczema. Hypotheses: 1. In hot weather, the combination of heat, sweating and grass pollen precipitates increased severity in children with eczema in the UK. 2. In cold weather, the combination of cold weather, indoor aeroallergen exposure and reduced relative humidity from central heating lead to increased severity in children with eczema in the UK. These first two hypotheses were informed by previous research which proposed "summer" and "winter" types of eczema. 3. Detergents (soap, shampoo) increase the propensity to disease flares triggered by other factors at all temperatures, but more in cold weather due to impaired skin barrier function. 4. UK children with filaggrin mutations are more prone to the effects of climatic factors such as cold and heat than individuals who are wild type for filaggrin. 5. Any combination of {{greater than or equal to}} three exposures at any time is associated with worsening of eczema. The exposures assessed included: dust, exposure to pets, shampoo, sweating, swimming, nylon clothing next to the skin and a change in mean temperature of more than 3 Â°C from the previous weekly average. Methods: Pilot study: 30 children with moderate to severe eczema aged 0 to 15 years participated in a panel study over a one month period in June 2003 in Cork, Ireland. This study involved daily completion of a paper diary recording eczema severity and exposures. Feasibility of a panel study design was assessed and associations between exposures and disease severity were analysed. Main study: A prospective cohort study (n= 60) of children aged up to 15 years with moderate to severe eczema was studied for between six and nine months with overlapping start dates to allow study of seasonal factors. Exposures studied included: temperature, relative humidity, sun exposure, sweating, clothing, cleansing products/ washing, outdoor pollen level, extent and nature of exposure to household pets, dusty environments and swimming. Children or their parents completed daily novel electronic diaries recording eczema severity and exposures. Portable dataloggers were used to record indoor temperature and relative humidity. External meteorological data was obtained from a local monitoring centre. The primary outcome was a daily "bother" score and the secondary outcomes were daily "scratch" scores and flares of eczema. Autoregressive moving average models (ARMA) were used to model the impact of each exposure on eczema severity for each individual. Standard random effects meta-analysis techniques were used to pool estimated coefficients across participants. Heterogeneity of responses as detected using Chi-squared tests represented inter-individual variation. The body site-specificity of reactions was also examined as was the interaction between filaggrin mutations and disease worsening with exposures. Findings. Pilot study: The pilot study highlighted the issue of drop outs and missing data during the study. 83 % (n= 25) returned the diaries at the end of the study period, and within these, recording of disease severity was good (97 % complete). However, there was variability in recording of exposures (65 % to 83 % complete). Preliminary findings suggested a temporal association between eczema severity and <b>heat</b> (<b>lag</b> 0, i. e. the day of exposure, p= 0. 04), damp (lag day 2, p= 0. 03), sweating and stress (lag day 3, p= 0. 03 and p= 0. 02 respectively) and damp (lag day 4, p= 0. 001). Main study: Primary outcome: "bother scores": Increased disease severity was associated with direct contact with nylon clothing (pooled regression coefficient 0. 23, 95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 43), increasing exposure to dust (pooled regression coefficient 0. 53, 0. 23 to 0. 83), exposure to unfamiliar pets (pooled regression coefficient 0. 22, 0. 10 to 0. 34), sweating (pooled regression coefficient 0. 24, 0. 09 to 0. 39) and shampoo exposure (pooled regression coefficient 0. 07, 0. 01 to 0. 13). The association between shampoo use and worsening of eczema was enhanced in cold weather (pooled regression coefficient 0. 30, 0. 04 to 0. 57). Body site specificity was observed for the reactions to nylon clothing, which was greater on covered sites (trunk p= 0. 02, limbs p= 0. 03), reactions to wool clothing on truncal covered sites (p= 0. 03) but not limbs (p= 0. 62), while worsening of hand eczema was associated with exposure to pets (p< 0. 001). The only interaction with filaggrin mutations was observed for the 2282 del 4 mutation and worsening of eczema in summer. Significant heterogeneity of responses between individuals was observed for exposure to grass pollen and outdoor temperature. In regard to the final hypothesis, a combination of any three of seven likely variables was associated with worsening of eczema (pooled regression coefficient 0. 41, 0. 20 to 0. 63). Secondary outcome: "scratch" scores: Increased disease severity was seen associated with swimming (pooled regression coefficient 0. 14, 0. 00 to 0. 28), exposure to wool clothing (pooled regression coefficient 0. 28, 0. 11 to 0. 45), sweating (pooled regression coefficient 0. 15, 0. 04 to 0. 26), shampoo (pooled regression coefficient 0. 07, 0. 01 to 0. 13), dust (pooled regression coefficient 0. 36, 0. 12 to 0. 59) and high grass pollen levels (pooled regression coefficient 0. 10, 0. 01 to 0. 73). Secondary outcome: flares of eczema: Only swimming was clearly associated with worsening of eczema using this outcome measure (pooled regression coefficient 0. 42, 0. 05 to 0. 80). Conclusions: The following factors were shown to be associated with disease worsening in children with eczema in this UK study: clothing (wool and nylon), sweating, shampoo, swimming, dust, contact with unfamiliar pets and high grass pollen levels. Relative to the study hypotheses, the association between shampoo exposure and eczema worsening was shown to be increased in cold weather. There was also evidence showing an association between various combinations of exposures and disease worsening. There was insufficient evidence to support the other hypotheses tested in this study but this may be explained by low prevalence of these exposures. The implications of the findings of this study for clinical practice are that for the first time, it has been shown that shampoo exposure may be associated with eczema worsening and that this is more pronounced in cold weather. This study also suggests that worsening of eczema may be more complicated in that multiple exposures acting in concert may be associated with worsening of disease. Future research with increased participant numbers is required to specifically study possible gene-environment interactions with filaggrin mutations and their relevance in relation to disease flares and to look at shampoo formulations in relation to worsening of eczema.

Transonic flow can be treated owing {{to the presence of}} a dissipative mechanism in the basic differential equation, but the results in this Mach number range are probably of limited practical value. The results show that cross-wind forces are unaffected in a first approximation, but that drag forces comparable with laminar skin friction values can arise {{as a result of the}} relaxation of the internal degrees of freedom. The magnitude and sign of these effects depend strongly on body shape and free stream Mach number.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTibet of China, with {{an average}} {{altitude}} of over 4000 m, has experienced noticeable changes in its climate over the last 50 years. The association between temperature and morbidity (most commonly represented by hospital admissions) has been documented mainly in developed countries. Little is known about patterns in China; nor have {{the health effects of}} temperature variations been closely studied in highland areas, worldwide. ObjectiveWe investigated the temperatureâmorbidity association in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet, using sex- and age-specific hospitalizations, excluding those due to external causes. MethodsA distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the nonlinear and delayed effects of temperature on morbidity (including total emergency room visits, total and cause-specific hospital admissions, sex- and age-specific non-external admissions). ResultsHigh temperatures are associated with increases in morbidity, {{to a greater extent than}} low temperatures. Lag effects of high and low temperatures were cause-specific. The relative risks (RR) of high temperature for total emergency room visits and non-external hospitalizations were 1. 162 (95 % CI: 1. 002 â 1. 349) and 1. 161 (95 % CI: 1. 007 â 1. 339) respectively, for lag 0 â 14 days. The strongest cumulative effect of <b>heat</b> for <b>lag</b> 0 â 27 days was on admissions for infectious diseases (RR: 2. 067, 95 % CI: 1. 026 â 4. 027). Acute <b>heat</b> effects at <b>lag</b> 0 were related with increases of renal (RR: 1. 478, 95 % CI: 1. 005 â 2. 174) and respiratory diseases (RR: 1. 119, 95 % CI: 1. 010 â 1. 240), whereas immediate cold effects increased admission for digestive diseases (RR: 1. 132, 95 % CI: 1. 002 â 1. 282). Those â¥ 65 years of age and males were more vulnerable to high temperatures. ConclusionWe provide a first look at the temperatureâmorbidity relationship in Tibet. Exposure to both hot and cold temperatures resulted in increased admissions to hospital, but the immediate causes varied. We suggest that initiatives should be taken to reduce the adverse effects of temperature extremes in Tibet...|$|R

30|$|Phase lags {{represent}} the time parameters {{required by the}} material to start up the heat flux and temperature gradient, after a thermal excitation has been imposed; larger phase lags are expected in material with smaller thermal conductivities, {{as is the case}} of granular matter [3]. Materials, in which the temperature gradient phase lag dominates, show a strong attenuation of the neat heat flux. In this case, the behavior is dominated by parabolic terms of the heat transport equation. In contrast, materials in which the <b>heat</b> flux phase <b>lag</b> is dominant show a slight attenuation of the heat flux, implying that a hyperbolic Cattaneo-Vernotte heat propagation is present. For a further discussion of the relationship between thermal conductivity and phase lags, Tzou's book [3] is recommended.|$|R

Therefore it is more advantageous than the Cattaneo-Vernotte model. Based on the single-phase-lagging heat conduction model, the condition for the occurrence of thermal vibration of heat conduction is established. In order to resolve the contradiction that the thermal vibration violates the second law of thermodynamics, the extended irreversible thermodynamics is improved and a generalized entropy definition is introduced. In {{the framework of the}} newly-developed extended irreversible thermodynamics the thermal vibration phenomena are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

40|$|Hazardârisk {{relationships}} in epidemiological studies are generally {{based on the}} outdoor climate, {{despite the fact that}} most of humans' lifetime is spent indoors. By coupling indoor and outdoor climates with a building model, the risk concept developed can still be based on the outdoor conditions but also includes exposure to the indoor climate. The influence of non-linear building physics and the impact of air conditioning on heat-related risks can be assessed in a plausible manner using this risk concept. For proof of concept, the proposed risk concept is compared to a traditional risk analysis. As an example, daily and city-wide mortality data of the age group 65 and older in Berlin, Germany, for the years 2001 â 2010 are used. Four building models with differing complexity are applied in a time-series regression analysis. This study shows that indoor hazard better explains the variability in the risk data compared to outdoor hazard, depending on the kind of building model. Simplified parameter models include the main non-linear effects and are proposed for the time-series analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the lag time of re-growth of heated spores of Bacillus cereus as a function of the conditions of the heat treatment: temperature, duration and pH of the recovery medium. For a given heating temperature, curves plotting lag times versus time of heating show more or less complex patterns. However, under a heating time corresponding to a decrease of 2 decimal logarithms of the surviving populations of spores, a linear relationship between the lag time of growth and the time of the previous heat treatment can be observed. The slope of this linear relationship followed itself a Bigelow type linear relationship, the slope of which yielded a ïº- value very close to the observed conventional z-value. It was then concluded that the slope of the regrowth lag time versus the heating time followed a linear relationship with the sterilisation value reached in the course of the previous heat treatment. A sharp effect of the pH of the medium which could be described by a simple "secondary" model was observed. As expected, the observed intercept of the linear relationship between <b>lag</b> time and <b>heating</b> time (<b>lag</b> without previous <b>heating)</b> was dependent on only the pH of the medium and not on the heating temperature...|$|R

Three generalizations of the Biot model of thermomechanics are considered: Lord-Shulman, dual-phase-lag (Tzou 1997), and modified dual-phase-lag (Awad 2012). It is found that when the response time is shortened, the material dimensions are small, or when the method of heating is changed, the dual-phase-lag model records a significant decrease in the lattice variables. The spurious serrations of the classical thermoelastic wave are smoothed in the dual-phase-lag wave.

Algebraic turbulence models are used within the DPLR and LAURA CFD codes. The benchmark heat transfer rates are derived from thermocouple measurements of the Space Shuttle orbiter Discovery windward tiles during the STS- 119 and STS- 128 entries. The thermocouples were located underneath the reaction-cured glass coating on the thermal protection tiles. Boundary layer transition flight experiments conducted during both of those entries promoted turbulent flow at unusually high Mach numbers, with the present analysis considering Mach 10 { 15. Similar prior comparisons of CFD predictions directly to the flight temperature measurements were unsatisfactory, showing diverging trends between prediction and measurement for Mach numbers greater than 11.

40|$|Surface {{energy balance}} is an {{important}} tool for sustainable water management and for estimating crop evapotranspiration. Net radiation is converted to latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, and soil heat flux at {{the surface of the}} earth. The soil heat flux component is challenging to determine because of the high degree of variation in soil moisture and temperature within the soil profile. Surface soil heat flux may be approximated using atmospheric and solar data but is more readily determined using soil heat flux measurements, which are typically made at a reference soil depth of 8 cm. However, the surface soil heat flux occurring at any moment in time is actually not measured at the reference depth until some time later because of the travel time for that heat to reach the heat flux plate 8 cm below. This means there is generally a time lag in the soil heat flux measurement relative to the atmospheric measurements. Consideration of the time lag between the soil surface and the sub-surface could improve the accuracy of energy balance calculations. Accurate soil surface heat flux estimation is crucial for modeling of energy and water-related processes as well as for validating sensor-based ET measurement techniques. Numerical models have been developed to simulate both soil-heat and -water dynamics. The objectives of this study were to estimate surface soil heat flux based on atmospheric data and soil heat flux measurements in the field and to investigate the soil <b>heat</b> flux time <b>lag</b> using the HYRDUS- 1 D model.

They have the advantage of not being rejected by consumers because of their natural origin. However, prior to their usage at a food factory scale, their precise effects on microorganisms have to be known. Nisin, a bacteriocin, and carvacrol and thymol, phenolic compounds present in the essential oil fraction of Oreganum and Thymus plants, have been shown to inhibit growth of different bacteria. This research was conducted to show the effect of a thermal treatment, applied previously, on the growth of B. megaterium cells in a culture medium with and without nisin, carvacrol and thymol. It has been shown that a thermal treatment able to kill 90 % of the spore population of B. megaterium had little effect on the growth of the survivors in nutrient broth at 30 Â°C. Nisin, in a concentration of 0. 05 mM, did not affect greatly the growth of unheated B. megaterium. When the same concentration of nisin was applied to the survivors of the <b>heat</b> treatment, <b>lag</b> phase was further increased and growth rate decreased. Thymol, applied at a concentration of 0. 6 mM, increased the lag phase duration almost three times, although it did not change the growth rate. Although carvacrol, at the same concentration (0. 6 mM), did reduce the growth rate to half its original value, it did not increase the lag phase duration significantly (only twice), resulting in a quite similar growth curve. The combination of thymol and carvacrol at these high doses (0. 6 mM) resulted in a further increase of the lag phase and significant decrease of the growth rate.

The predictions of the whole-building model were compared to field trial data, indicating that it provided a suitable test bed for energy performance assessment. Annual simulations indicated that the ASHP produced 12 % less carbon that an equivalent condensing gas boiler system, but was around 10 % more expensive to run. However, the proposed UK renewable heat incentive transforms this situation, with income from ASHP heat generation exceeding the fuel costs...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Variabilities in preform {{permeability}} {{can lead}} to the formation of dry spots and nonuniform flow progression during mold filling in the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. Real-time flow control can improve fill uniformity and eliminate potential fill related defects. Flow control schemes commonly manipulate the inlet pressures or flow rates and have been shown in the literature to be limited in their ability to steer the flow in regions far from the inlet ports [1]. A viable solution to this problem is localized heating of the resin during the mold filling process, which can reduce the local viscosity of the flowing resin to compensate for spatial preform permeability variation. In this paper localized heating is achieved using an induction heater with carbon fiber susceptors embedded in the preform layup. This type of control must be applied to the VARTM process {{in such a way as}} to <b>heat</b> in the <b>lagging</b> regions while avoiding overheating and thus prematurely curing the resin. To this end, this paper presents a real time control strategy that is demonstrated in a lab scale experimental setup, and is shown to be successful in improving the uniformity of the flow during mold filling of heterogeneous preform layups...|$|R

This {{is in terms of}} energetic renovation with particular reference to historical, artistic and landscape profiles, considering that the substantial character and aesthetic aspects of the buildings are not to be changed. These types of buildings must be preserved and enhanced, beyond a binding adaptation to the regulation requirements. This study analyses the use of an innovative material, the silica aerogel, with the aim of achieving a high level of energy improvement. In many of the cases subject of numerical studies, buildings equipped with the aerogel-based thermal insulation show better hygro-thermal performance than when using other insulating materials. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop numerical models in Energy Plus, based on a targeted case study, to examine different exterior wall structures insulation and related energy behavior, considering defined assessment criteria such as <b>heat</b> losses, time <b>lag,</b> decrement factor, comfort index. The thickness dependency on annual heating set point, the heating and cooling load, and the operating costs are also investigated. The thermal performance of walls with aerogel-based insulation is compared with different insulating materials and configurations, applied on the historical building structure. Finally, a cost analysis for the different solutions, different climates, in retrofitting of historical buildings, is taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Efforts {{to prevent}} and respond to heat-related illness would benefit by {{quantifying}} the impact of summer heat on acute population mortality. We estimated years of life lost due to heat in 14 European cities during the 1990 s accounting for harvesting. Methods: We combined {{the number of deaths}} attributable to heat estimated by the PHEWE project with life expectancy derived from population life tables. The degree of harvesting was quantified by comparing the cumulative effect of <b>heat</b> up to <b>lagged</b> day 30 with the immediate effect of heat, by geographical region and age. Next, an evaluation of years of life lost adjusted for harvesting was obtained. Results: Without accounting for harvesting, we estimated more than 23, 000 years of life lost per year, 55 % of which was among individuals younger than 75. When 30 day mortality displacement was taken into account, the overall impact reduced on average by 75 %. Harvesting was more pronounced in North-continental cities than in Mediterranean cities and was stronger among young people than among elderly. Conclusions: High ambient temperatures during summer were responsible for many deaths in European cities during the 1990 s, but a large percentage of these deaths likely involved frail persons whose demise was only briefly hastened by heat exposure. Differences in harvesting across regions and classes of age could reflect different proportions of frail individuals i...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{multitude}} of methods used to investigate coronal <b>heating,</b> the time <b>lag</b> method of Viall Klimchuk is becoming increasingly prevalent as an analysis technique that is complementary to those that are traditionally used.

40|$|In {{studies on}} the {{pasteurization}} of milk at ultra high temperatures {{it was observed that}} the surviving bacteria (less than 100 per ml) ex-hibited a prolonged lag phase during subsequent incubation of the heat treated milk sample (Kaufmann, 1957). Penfold (1914) concluded that, among other things, the size of the inoculum affects the lag phase of growth as determined by the generation time over the first 2 hr of the growth period. He reported little, if any pro-longation of the lag phase when the initial cell level ranged from about 100 to 4000 cells per ml. A lengthening of lag phase was observed, how-ever, when the inoculum was about 2 cells per ml. The prolonged lag phase observed following exposure to ultra high temperatures, therefore, may be attributed in part, to the low level of survivors. Heat has also been observed by Tobias et al. (1955) to affect the rapidity of bacterial recovery; these workers reported slow bacterial develop-ment with a heat-resistant Micrococcus MIS 102 even when the initial level of survivors was greater than 100 per ml. On the basis of this work, the high heat treatment rather than the low survivor level may have induced the prolonged lag. The present study was undertaken to de-termine the effect of <b>heat</b> on the <b>lag</b> phase ob-served on subculture of the surviving cells under conditions providing constant initial levels of inocula.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper focuses on numerically investigating the thermal response of gold nanoshells-embedded biological tissue phantoms with potential applications into photo-thermal therapy wherein the interest is in destroying the cancerous cells with minimum damage to the surrounding healthy cells. The tissue phantom has been irradiated with a pico-second laser. Radiative transfer equation (RTE) has been employed to model the light-tissue interaction using discrete ordinate method (DOM). For determining the temperature distribution inside the tissue phantom, the RTE has been solved in combination with a generalized non-Fourier heat conduction model namely the dual phase lag bio-heat transfer model. The numerical code comprising the coupled RTE-bio-heat transfer equation, developed {{as a part of the}} current work, has been benchmarked against the experimental as well as the numerical results available in the literature. It has been demonstrated that the temperature of the optical inhomogeneity inside the biological tissue phantom embedded with gold nanoshells is relatively higher than that of the baseline case (no nanoshells) for the same laser power and operation time. The study clearly underlines the impact of nanoshell concentration and its size on the thermal response of the biological tissue sample. The comparative study concerned with the size and concentration of nanoshells showed that 60 nm nanoshells with concentration of 5 x 10 (15) mm(- 3) result into the temperature levels that are optimum for the irreversible destruction of cancer infected cells in the context of photo-thermal therapy. To. the best of the knowledge of the authors, the present study is one of the first attempts to quantify the influence of gold nanoshells on the temperature distributions inside the biological tissue phantoms upon laser irradiation using the dual phase <b>lag</b> <b>heat</b> conduction model.

50|$|The Do 217 was a shoulder-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Its two-spar wing {{was built}} in three sections: the centre section, incorporating part of the fuselage, and two outer wing sections with very little taper on the leading and trailing edges, leading out {{to a pair of}} broad, semi-circular wing tips. The stress bearing skin was riveted to spars and ribs. Owing to its future use as a dive-bomber, stressed skin construction was employed with the use of Z-section frames and stringers. Slotted ailerons were fitted to the outer wing sections. The inner split flaps were electrically operated and had a maximum flap angle of 55Â°. The ailerons were linked to the flap system to permit partial operation as flaperons, meaning if the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped down.The design of the rear and front spar attachments revealed the flanges of the spar were flushed with the wing surface making the most efficient structure. The outer wing leading edges were double-skinned. In the wing space, a hot air feed was fitted, using <b>heat</b> pumped through <b>lagged</b> pipes from the engines to warm up and de-ice the wings. The ducts were located just forward of the front spar flanges and in between the main spars where they could escape into the wing. The hot air could escape through the apertures at the aileron hinges. A diversion pipe was also installed in the engine nacelle, which could shut down the hot air flow to the ducts and divert the air out through bottom end of the nacelle if de-icing was not required.The fuel and oil tanks were located in the wing and centre section. The two outer fuel tanks were located next to the outer side of the engine nacelle. The outermost fuel tank contained a 160 L fuel capacity, while the tank closest to the engine could accommodate 44 imp gal of oil. Both were sandwiched in between the main and rear main spar. Between the fuselage and inner side of the engine nacelle, the 795 L main tanks were located. In the centre section a 1050 L fuel tank was installed forward of the bomb bay.|$|R
40|$|The Hadean mantle was {{efficiently}} heated {{from high}} internal heat production, {{high rates of}} impact bombardment, and primordial heat from accretion. As a result a strong case is made for extremely high internal temperatures, low internal viscosities, and extremely vigorous mantle convection. Previous studies of mixing in such high-Rayleigh number convective environments indicate that chemically heterogeneous mantle anomalies should have efficiently remixed into the mantle on timescales of less than 100 Myr. However, 142 Nd and 182 W isotope studies indicate that heterogeneous mantle domains survived, without mixing, for over 2 Gyr-at odds with expected mixing rates. Similarly, concentrations of platinum group elements in Archean komatiites, purportedly due to the later veneer of meteoritic addition on the Earth, only achieve current levels at 2. 7 Ga-indicating a time lag of almost 1 to 2 Gyr in mixing this material thoroughly into the mantle. Previous studies have sought to explain slow Archean mantle mixing via mantle layering due to endothermic phase changes, or anomalously viscous blobs of material, with limited efficacy. Here we pursue another explanation for inefficient mantle mixing in the Hadean: tectonic regime. A number of lines of evidence suggest that resurfacing in the Archean was episodic, and extending these models to Hadean times implies the Hadean was characterized by long periods of tectonic quiescence. We explore mixing times in 3 D spherical-cap models of mantle convection, which incorporate vertically stratified and temperature-dependent viscosities. We show that mixing in stagnant-lid regimes is, at the extreme, over {{an order of magnitude}} less efficient than mobile-lid mixing, and for plausible Rayleigh numbers and internal <b>heat</b> production, the <b>lag</b> in Hadean convective recycling can be explained. The attractiveness of this model is that it not only explains the long-lived 142 Nd and 182 W anomalies, but also posits an explanation for the delay between accretion of the late veneer-between 4. 5 to 3. 8 Ga on a stagnant surface- and its fully mixed signature apparent in elevated PGEs in 2. 7 Ga komatiites. It also provides an explanation for the 400 Myrs of immobility of the mafic protolith from which the Jack Hill zircons were sourced, and retards early heat loss from the mantle, providing a solution to the "Archean thermal catastrophe" of parameterized Earth evolution models.

40|$|Natural {{antimicrobials}} are {{an alternative}} to the use of chemically synthesized preservatives and other technological treatments. They have the advantage of not being rejected by consumers because of their natural origin. However, prior to their usage at a food factory scale, their precise effects on microorganisms have to be known. Nisin, a bacteriocin, and carvacrol and thymol, phenolic compounds present in the essential oil fraction of Oreganum and Thymus plants, have been shown to inhibit growth of different bacteria. This research was conducted to show the effect of a thermal treatment, applied previously, on the growth of B. megaterium cells in a culture medium with and without nisin, carvacrol and thymol. It has been shown that a thermal treatment able to kill 90 % of the spore population of B. megaterium had little effect on the growth of the survivors in nutrient broth at 30 Â°C. Nisin, in a concentration of 0. 05 mM, did not affect greatly the growth of unheated B. megaterium. When the same concentration of nisin was applied to the survivors of the <b>heat</b> treatment, <b>lag</b> phase was further increased and growth rate decreased. Thymol, applied at a concentration of 0. 6 mM, increased the lag phase duration almost three times, although it did not change the growth rate. Although carvacrol, at the same concentration (0. 6 mM), did reduce the growth rate to half its original value, it did not increase the lag phase duration significantly (only twice), resulting in a quite similar growth curve. The combination of thymol and carvacrol at these high doses (0. 6 mM) resulted in a further increase of the lag phase and significant decrease of the growth rate. When carvacrol and/or thymol were combined with a previous thermal treatment (able to kill 90 % of the population), the growth of the survivors was inhibited for at least seven days. Therefore a combination of moderate conditions could be effective to control spoilage by sporeforming bacteria.
