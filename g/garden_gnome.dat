500|$|After an {{unauthorized}} paperback edition of The Lord of the Rings appeared from Ace Books in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine asked Tolkien to refresh {{the text of}} The Hobbit to renew the US copyright. This text became the 1966 third edition. Tolkien {{took the opportunity to}} align the narrative even more closely to The Lord of the Rings and to cosmological developments from his still unpublished Quenta Silmarillion as it stood at that time. These small edits included, for example, changing the phrase [...] "elves that are now called Gnomes" [...] from the first and second editions on page 63, to [...] "High Elves of the West, my kin" [...] in the third edition. Tolkien had used [...] "gnome" [...] in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the High Elves—the Noldor (or [...] "Deep Elves")—thinking [...] "gnome", derived from the Greek gnosis (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of its common denotation of a <b>garden</b> <b>gnome,</b> derived from the 16th-century Paracelsus, Tolkien abandoned the term.|$|E
