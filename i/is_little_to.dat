5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Pain's family {{originated}} in Normandy, but there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> {{suggest that he}} had many ties there, and {{he appears to have}} spent most of his career in England and the Welsh Marches. A son of a minor nobleman, he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry's reign. In 1115, he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress, thereby gaining control of the town of Ludlow and its castle, which he augmented with further acquisitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no rain.|$|E

Sometime importing difficulties may still arise (e.g. Atari 2600 games from regions the console is not from may introduce some glitches, such as missing colors).|$|R

5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created {{a distinction between the}} northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Lewknor was a {{supporter}} of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men-at-arms in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle. On Henry VII's accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> indicate how it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.|$|E
5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, {{with an average of}} six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E

5|$|The maxilla of Paranthodon {{preserves}} the tooth row, and {{shows that there}} <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no overhang. This differs from ankylosaurians, {{where there is a}} large amount of overhang of the maxilla. The teeth also have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on Kentrosaurus. Like all stegosaurians, the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to ankylosaurians. Also, like Huayangosaurus, but unlike Kentrosaurus and Stegosaurus, Paranthodon possesses a prominent buccal margination (a ridge beside the tooth row). Paranthodon teeth preserve wear, but wear is absent on most teeth, similar to Huayangosaurus, meaning it is likely that Paranthodon lacked occlusion between teeth. Paranthodon is distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large cingulum, and large ridges on the tooth crowns. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only autapomorphy found being the possession of a partial second bony palate on the maxilla.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, {{argues that the}} Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a balance that set up the debate, and was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. The early version of the poem was finished, according to Mason, in August 1742, {{but there is little}} evidence to give such a definite date. Mason argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> indicate that Mason would have such information.|$|E

Also, there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no inbreeding within the colonies.

25|$|One theory {{actually}} places {{their origins}} in the Silla dynasty, among the wonhwa, female predecessors of the hwarang. However, there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> suggest a concrete link between Silla's wonhwa and the later kisaeng. Also, the wonhwa {{seem to have been}} chosen from among the aristocracy, whereas kisaeng were always members of the lower classes. For these reasons, few contemporary scholars support this theory.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe {{has been}} blessed with many {{world-class}} rugby players over the years. Despite limited facilities and coaching, {{the country has been}} competitive up to high school level. However, there is little incentive for most players to play beyond high school level, and consequently the club rugby pool for adult players is very diluted. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> choose from at national level and this has been the reason for Zimbabwe's rugby decline.|$|E

It is known that rodents sometimes eat hexathelid spiders, although this is rare due to their sometimes painful bite. They are also hard to catch as they are usually very reclusive and will retreat inside their burrow at any sign of movement.|$|E

25|$|Mushrooms {{can be a}} good dietary {{source of}} vitamin D2 if exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light. Mushrooms contain high concentrations of ergosterol (provitamin D2).

Low values in mushrooms occur if there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no exposure to sunlight or UV light. When fresh mushrooms or dried powders are purposely exposed to artificial sunlight by use of an industrial ultraviolet lamp, vitamin D2 levels can be concentrated to much higher levels.|$|E
