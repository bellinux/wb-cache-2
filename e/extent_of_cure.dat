50|$|The use of accelerators and {{activators}} {{lowers the}} activation energy of vulcanization reaction to 80-125kJ/Mole from 210kJ/Mole which is necessary {{if we use}} ‘Sulphur’ alone. Accelerators and activators break sulphur chains. Accelerated sulphur vulcanization systems require only 5-15 sulphur atoms per cross-link as compared to 40-45 S atoms/crosslink for a non-accelerated sulphur vulcanization.There are many accelerators available for the vulcanization of rubber. That is {{because there is a}} wide range of rubber articles on the market {{with a wide variety of}} properties. For instance in a car tire alone there can be already up to eight different rubber compounds, each with specific properties. For instance the tread in a typical passenger car tire consists of a mixture of SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber) and BR (butadiene rubber). This rubber should have high abrasion resistance and high grip on both dry and wet roads. The side wall of the tire should have a high flexibility, meaning that it should resist many flexings during the running of the tire without cracking. It consists normally of a mixture of natural rubber and butadiene rubber. Inside the tire there is a rubber compound with as major function the adhesion between rubber and the steel cord of the belt. It typically consists of natural rubber with a very high sulfur level (up to 8 phr), to get a relatively stiff rubber, with sulfur promoting the adhesion with the steel cord. The basis of the tire is formed by the carcass, normally a mixture of NR (natural rubber), SBR and BR. It should have a very good adhesion to the polyester cord, used as reinforcement.And the inner side of the tire is formed by the inner liner, normally consisting of halogenated butyl rubber (IIR)For all these compounds with their different properties different accelerators and mixtures of accelerators have to be used to obtain the required properties.A vulcanization accelerator is typically used in combination with sulfur as the cross-linker, and with zinc oxide and stearic acid as activators. Other additives can be added too, but for the cross-linking reaction the abovementioned ones are the most important.The various types of rubber used in the various tire compounds all have different vulcanization characteristics, like speed of cure (cure is the crosslinking reaction) and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> (the number of cross-links). A typical passenger car tire is vulcanized for 10 minutes at 170 degrees C. This means that all the different compounds have to be cured to their optimum state of cure in this same 10 minutes. This is the reason why a lot of different accelerators or mixtures thereof are used in the same tire.|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} {{manufacture of}} thick-sectioned composites is challenging, since the highly exothermic nature of thermoset resins and limited temperature control {{make it difficult}} to avoid detrimental thermal and cure gradients within the composite. In order to make quality parts, it has been found experimentally that cure temperatures must be lowered as much as 50 % from those suggested for thin parts. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments of a vinylester resin system at these lower temperatures revealed a significant dependence on temperature for the maximum <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure.</b> If the resin is cured isothermally at 55 C, the final conversion of the resin was found to only reach 70 %.

Inhibitors, added to the resin to improve shelf-life, disappear rapidly at higher cure temperatures but can double the time required to cure a thick composite processed at 55 C. A zeroth order kinetic relationship was developed to estimate the amount of inhibitor in the system during the resin's cure.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to achieve a {{homogeneous}} morphology of carbon nanotubes in a polyimide matrix, characterize the resulting nanocomposite properties, and understand structure-property relationships. Melt-mixing {{was used as an}} effective method for dispersing multiwall nanotubes and carbon nanofibers in a phenylethynyl terminated imide resin where aggregation occurred only in particle-saturated systems. Particle network formation within the nanocomposites was studied using rheology and impedance spectroscopy; results showed that the electrical percolation threshold occurred at a lower particle loading than the rheological percolation threshold, consistent with the oligomer size in comparison to the distance for electrical conductivity (~ 5 nm). Thermomechanical analysis showed that the addition of nanoparticles enhanced the polyimide storage modulus and thermal behavior indicated that the nanoparticles restricted polymer motion to higher temperatures. A study of the cure mechanism of the oligomer with and without nanoparticles showed that the nanoparticles reduced the activation energy required for cure initiation while increasing the obtainable <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> at various isothermal temperatures.

40|$|Novel {{biodegradable}} cross-linked co-polymers {{were prepared}} from poly(propylene glycol) diglycidylether (PPGDGE) and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI). PPGDGE and PEI were mixed {{at ambient temperature}} with varying PEI concentrations of 10, 15, 18. 5, 25, 30, 40 and 50 wt%; the homogenous PPGDGE/PEI mixtures obtained were cured at elevated temperatures, resulting in formation of PPG-PEI cross-linked co-polymers via ring-opening reaction of PPGDGE with PEI. The physicochemical and biological properties of these co-polymers were dependent on the PEI content and the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> reaction. The glass transition temperature of PPG-PEI cross-linked co-polymers varied {{in the range from}} - 14 to + 42 degrees C, while the copolymers displayed composition-dependent mechanical behavior, from brittle to ductile with increasing PEI content from 18. 5 wt% to 40 wt%. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured on the PPG-PEI co-polymers; the MTT assay was used to measure cell viability and determine the cytotoxicity. The cell viability rate, relative to tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS), increased from 49 % to 125 % with increasing PEI content from 18. 5 wt% to 40 wt%. Although epoxy monomers usually exhibit cytotoxicity, the epoxy groups were exhausted via curing reaction in the fully cross-linked co-polymers. The PEI-cured PPG epoxy resin, i. e., PPG-PEI cross-linked co-polymers obtained in this study, showed excellent biocompatibility. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several dual-curable acrylic {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesives (PSA) were synthesized by {{the radical}} polymer-ization of acrylic monomers containing benzophenone, hydroxyl, and alkyl groups. The optimum <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> UV-induced <b>cure</b> {{was determined by}} varying {{the content of the}} benzophenone groups (the photoinitiator) from 0. 5 to 1. 5 wt%. The weight average molecular weight of the polymers obtained ranged from 300, 000 to 700, 000 amu. The coated pressure-sensitive adhesives were cured either by short UV exposure to induce the grafting of acrylic poly-mers, or by heating for 6 h at 60 oC to promote the reactions between the polyisocyanates and hydroxyl groups. The dual-curing behavior was determined by monitoring both processes quantitatively by infrared spectroscopy. The developed dual-curable acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives were found to compensate for the limitations in UV-induced <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> thick coatings...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{theory is}} outlined which allows calculation of crosslink density of solid propellant binders {{from a small}} number of predetermined parameters such as the binder composition, the functionality distributions of the ingredients, and the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>curing</b> reaction. The parameter which is partly dependent on process conditions is the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> reaction. The proposed theoretical model is verified by independent measurement of effective chain concentration and sol and gel fractions in simple compositions prepared from model compounds. The model is shown to correlate tensile data with composition in the case of urethane-cured polyether and certain solid propellants. A formula for the branching coefficient is provided according to which if one knows the functionality distributions of the ingredients and the corresponding equivalent weights and can measure or predict the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> reaction, he can calculate the branching coefficient of such a system for any desired composition...|$|R
