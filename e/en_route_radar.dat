5000|$|Nevertheless, the fix posting area {{method was}} the main {{technique}} used in U.S. en route system prior to the 1960s, for example, when <b>en</b> <b>route</b> <b>radar</b> became more widespread. This method evolved from similar techniques used in railroad dispatch. It simplifies conflict detection because aircraft on different routes can only possibly conflict at intersection points with other routes, or with aircraft on the same route. Each intersection point ("fix posting area") in the sector is made into a separate bay on the strip rack, and multiple strips are printed for each aircraft, one per bay. The controller then sorts strips within each bay by the estimated time the aircraft is expected over that point. Only aircraft estimated to cross within 10 minutes of each other are considered possible conflicts, at which point altitudes are then compared {{to determine if there}} actually is a conflict. Aircraft on the same route however (in either direction) must be checked for conflict regardless of time over the intersection.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the way Australian air traffic {{controllers}} manage their airspace. Fourteen controllers ranging from 7 to 30 years experience were sampled from the Brisbane air traffic control centre. All had previously been endorsed for <b>en</b> <b>route</b> <b>radar</b> sectors. Five static pictures varying in workload level (low, medium and high) were presented to participants. Controllers were asked to work through the scenarios and describe aloud how they would resolve any potential conflicts between the aircraft. Following this controllers were asked a set of probe questions based on the critical decision method, to extract further information about the way they manage their airspace. A content analysis was used to assess patterns in the way controllers scan, strategies used in conflict detection and conflict resolution and the effect of workload on strategy choice. Findings revealed that controllers use specific strategies (such as working in a left to right scan or prioritising levels) when managing their airspace. Further analyses are still planned however a model based on the processes controllers used to resolve conflicts has been developed and will be presented as a summary of the results...|$|E

50|$|Civilian Air Traffic Controllers' {{licensing}} is standardized {{by international}} agreement through ICAO. Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools, academies or colleges, often {{operated by the}} incumbent provider of air traffic services in that country, but sometimes privately. These institutions are structured to provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience. At the completion of academic training, the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license, which will include one or more Ratings. These are sub-qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained. ICAO defines five such ratings: Area (procedural), Area Radar, Approach (procedural), Approach Radar and Aerodrome. In the United States, controllers may train in several similar specialties: Tower, Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA), Terminal <b>Radar</b> Control, or <b>En</b> <b>route</b> Control (both <b>radar</b> and non-radar). This phase of training takes between 6 months and several years.|$|R

The TAPSS system consists of four-dimensional trajectory prediction, arrival runway balancing, aircraft separation constraint-based scheduling, traffic flow visualization and trajectory-based advisories to assist controllers in efficient metering, sequencing and spacing. The TAPSS system was evaluated and compared to today’s ATC operation through extensive series of human-in-the loop simulations for arrival flows into the Los Angeles International Airport. The test conditions included the variation of aircraft demand from a baseline of today’s capacity constrained periods through 5 %, 10 % and 20 % increases.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{concerns about}} the impact of aircraft noise on people have centered around the takeoff and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity of airport terminals. The development of the advanced turboprop (propfan) engine, modifications to air corridors, and the desire to maintain a natural environment in national parks and recreation areas have now focused attention on the impact at ground level of the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise produced by aircraft at cruise conditions and altitudes. Compared to terminal area noise, <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise is characterized by relatively low noise levels, lack of high frequency spectral content, and long durations. Much research has been directed towards understanding and quantifying the annoyance caused by terminal area aircraft noise, but relatively little research has been conducted for <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise. To address this need, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyance of people on the ground to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise generated by aircraft at cruise conditions. The objectives of the experiment are to determine the annoyance prediction ability of noise measurement procedures and corrections when applied to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise; to determine differences in annoyance response to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and takeoff/landing noise; and to determine differences in annoyance response to advanced turboprop <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and conventional jet <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise...|$|R

40|$|While airport {{congestion}} {{has long}} been viewed as a major air traffic management problem in the United States, congestion in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace is drawing an increasing amount of attention. Sources of <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion, such as severe weather, often cause the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to delay and reroute aircraft {{in order to ensure}} safety. Most current research into methods for managing <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion seeks to reduce delay or aid in aircraft rerouting. However, there has been less attention paid to delay and reroute allocation methods  an area in which {{there appears to be a}} pressing, practical need. Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is a movement within the air traffic management community that has combined the interests of the FAA and industry to develop a universally-accepted resource rationing process for congested airports. There is high expectation that CDM can achieve similar success in developing a parallel rationing process for the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace. The CDM-inspired research underlying this thesis led to the development of a software tool, the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> Resource Allocation Prototype (ERAP), that supports the analysis of alternative <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace rationing methods. In this thesis, we define a basic <b>en</b> <b>route</b> traffic flow management scenario, conduct experiments, and derive ERAP results which provide insight into rationing resources in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace domain.
