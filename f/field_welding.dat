40|$|Fourteen {{years after}} {{completion}} of Ford's 39 -foot space simulation chamber, leaks {{began to appear in}} its LN 2 shroud. Although the shroud had been tight since its acceptance, cracks appeared in 1983 in some of the <b>field</b> <b>welds</b> of the one inch tubes which interconnect the LN 2 panels. The resulting leaks were large enough to prevent pump down to high vacuum and could be heard easily when the chamber was at ambient conditions. New cracks appeared during each thermal cycle making it impossible to utilize the chamber for thermal vacuum testing. The analysis presented here implies that many, if not all, of the aluminum LN 2 shrouds now in use may be in various stages of fatigue failure. The probability is high that fatigue cracks are working through the aluminum tubing in heat-affected zones of some <b>field</b> <b>welds.</b> The cracks may not be apparent yet, but after the shroud has experienced a certain number of thermal cycles these cracks will work through the material and become serious leaks.

40|$|A new posttensioned T-stub {{connection}} (PTTC) for earthquake resistant steel moment resisting frames (MRFs) is introduced. The proposed connection {{consists of}} high strength posttensioned (PT) strands and bolted T-stubs. The post-tensioning strands {{run through the}} column and are anchored against the flange of the exterior column. The T-stubs, providing energy dissipation, are bolted to the flange of beam and column and no <b>field</b> <b>welding</b> is required.

PTTC provides similar characteristic behavior of the posttensioned connections. Both theoretical behavior and design methods are proposed, and the design methods are verified based on parametric studies and comparison to analytical results. The parametric studies prove the desired self-centering behavior of PTTC and show that this connection can reduce or eliminate the plastic rotation by its self-centering behavior as well as providing required strength and stiffness under large earthquake rotations...|$|E
40|$|Transportation {{departments}} {{have been using}} aluminum overhead sign structures since the early 1960 ’s. It is well documented that cracks develop in the welds between diagonal and chord members, due to fatigue stresses by wind-induced vibration of slender members. The cracks propagate to complete failure of the members, which causes signs to fall and inflict injuries. The original design of overhead sign structures did not consider fatigue as a limit state. In addition, <b>field</b> <b>welding</b> of aluminum structures for any possible repairs is prohibited. A repair method for the cracked aluminum welded connections between diagonals and chord members using {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} composites (GFRP) has been investigated. The static tensile load carrying capacity of the welded connection and the cracked connection repaired with GFRP composites were established. This article describes the surface preparation of the aluminum tubular members, the application of GFRP composites to repair the connection, and the experimental results from monotonic static tests. The experimental results of specimens from actual sign structures show that the GFRP repaired connection achieved 1. 17 to 1. 25 times the capacity of the uncracked aluminum welded connection. These results, along with the minimal traffic disruption anticipated in the application, make this repair method a good candidate for implementation...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} demand, from both engineers and their clients, for structures {{that can be}} rapidly returned to occupancy following an earthquake, while also maintaining or reducing initial costs. One possible way towards this goal {{is to ensure that}} seismic damage occurs only within elements that can be removed and replaced following a damaging earthquake. For concentrically braced frames that use hollow structural sections, the current design practice requires <b>field</b> <b>welding</b> of the brace to the gusset in a way that causes the brace to buckle out-of-plane. In the event of a damaging earthquake, the out-of-plane brace buckling may damage both the gusset plate and also any adjacent exterior cladding. The plate cannot be easily replaced, resulting in expensive and time-consuming repairs, and the damaged cladding could endanger the lives of people evacuating the building and of other pedestrians. This paper discusses the development of an alternative connection that can be bolted into place and that confines damage to replaceable components. The proposed connection is expected to result in reduced erection costs and be easier to repair following a major earthquake. Moreover, the new connection causes buckling to occur in plane, preventing dangerous damage to the cladding. Potential challenges in the design of such a connection are discussed and evaluated, and a finite element model that was created to confirm the performance of the proposed connection is also introduced. Finally, future areas of research and development of the connection are identified...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the ability of phased-array ultrasonic techniques to detect and accurately determine the size of flaws from the far-side of wrought austenitic piping welds. The work was sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Contract DE-AC 06 - 76 RLO 1830; NRC JCN Y 6604; Ms. Deborah Jackson, Program Monitor. Far-side inspections of these welds are currently performed on a “best effort ” basis and do not conform to ASME Code Section XI Appendix VIII performance demonstration requirements. For this study, four circumferential welds in 610 mm diameter, 36 mm thick ASTM A- 358, Grade 304 vintage austenitic stainless steel pipe were examined. The welds were fabricated with varied welding parameters; both horizontal and vertical pipe orientations were used, with air and water backing, to simulate <b>field</b> <b>welding</b> conditions. A series of saw cuts, electro-discharge machined (EDM) notches, and implanted fatigue cracks were placed into the heat affected zones of the welds. The saw cuts and notches range in depth from 7. 5 % to 28. 4 % through-wall. The implanted cracks ranged in depth from 5 % through wall to 64 % through wall. The welds were examined with two phased-array probes, a 2. 0 MHz transmit-receive longitudinal wave array and a 2. 0 MHz transmit-receive shear wave array.

40|$|A single {{weld bead}} {{deposited}} {{on a flat}} plate is a deceptively simple problem that is in practice a challenge for both measurement and prediction of weld residual stresses. Task Group 1 of the NeT collaborative network has examined this problem in a two-phase programme extending from 2002 to 2008. Ten independent sets of residual stress measurements have been reported using diverse techniques, and over forty finite element simulations have been performed. This paper reviews Phase 2 of the Task Group 1 round robin. Here, the finite element simulations all made use of optimised thermal solutions, in which the global welding parameters, including efficiency, were fixed, and only the detailed heat source geometry was varied. These resulted in accurate far <b>field</b> <b>welding</b> temperature distributions, with significant variability only close to the weld bead itself. The subsequent mechanical analyses made use of kinematic, isotropic, and mixed isotropic-kinematic material constitutive models, and made a variety of assumptions about the introduction of weld filler material to the structure and the handling of high temperature inelastic strains. The large database of measurements allowed the derivation of statistical best estimates using a Bayesian “duff data” approach, and these best estimates were compared with the predictions to establish the most accurate material constitutive models. The most accurate predictions of residual stress were made using non-linear kinematic or mixed isotropic-kinematic constitutive models. The methods used to handle high-temperature inelastic strains influenced the predicted stresses only in regions where very high temperatures were predicted during welding. The results emphasise the importance and value of both well-characterised benchmark problems and international collaboration {{in the development of}} technologies to both measure and predict weld residual stresses...|$|E
