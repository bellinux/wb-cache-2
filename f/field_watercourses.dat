Assuming no changes in the EU level policies after CAP reform 2003 we focus on national level policy measures such as full or partial de-coupling of national support from production, payments for reduced nutrient surpluses of N and P, and N fertiliser tax. None of the analysed policy measures is superior one with respect to environmental performance, since full decoupling of national support would be the most effective in reducing P surpluses while payment for reduced nutrient surplus performed best with respect to N surpluses. Economic performance (farmers compliance cost per %-reduction of N or P surplus) of full and partial de-coupling of national support is clearly better than that of specialised agri-environmental policy instruments, because both decoupling scenarios result in the increase of farmers income in comparison to base scenario, and thus compliance costs are in fact negative in these two cases. Our analysis confirms the fact that the overall policy package matters a lot for the effectiveness of agrienvironmental policy measures. Environmental performance of agri-environmental policy measures may be significantly reduced, if they are implemented jointly with production coupled income support policies. Thus, in order to increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental policy measures agricultural income support policies should be decoupled from production and this alone would bring substantial reduction in nutrient surpluses. ...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} {{may result}} in nitrate losses, diminished surface water quality and widespread groundwater aquifer contamination. Many works have identified preferential flow through macropores as an important feature that may increase nitrate losses. Subsurface drainage collectors may intercept preferential flow and indicate changing unsaturated/saturated processes. Antecedent conditions are important in determining runoff response. It is unclear how tile drains modify the antecedent soil moisture regime and water tables in near stream areas. Vegetated riparian buffer zones found beetween agricultural <b>fields</b> and <b>watercourses</b> may attenuate nitrate in shallow groundwater pathways. However, little work recognizes the close proximity of buffer strips and tile drainage systems nor studied their interactions. This thesis provides results from sstudy at two sites within the 3. 5 km 2 Strawberry Creek Agricultural Watershed in southern Ontario. The goal {{of the study was}} to identify some of the features controlling runoff and nitrate export from tile drained fields in agricultural watersheds with macroporous soils and narrow vegetated riparian zones. Evaluation of a two-year data set including meteorological data, water table levels, nitrate chemistry and tile/stream discharges indicate that antecedent moisture conditions exhibit control on watershed runoff response and nitrate exports. Initial wetting periods are needed to promote large-scale nutrient export. Greater moisture deficits and preferential flow mechanisms are thought to reduce nitrate export during drier periods. Moist soils and high water tables allowed better transport pathways and consequently greater runoff and nitrate export. Maximum export rates from the study basin were 282 kg NO 3 -N d- 1 (0. 8 kg NO 3 -N ha- 1 d- 1) during a mid-winter rain/melt event in 1998. At one site near the basin outflow, an investigation of tile flow and nitrate export during a single storm detected the effects of preferential flow in upland tile drains. Bypassing of event water caused a marked dilution in both tile drainage and basin outflow. This bypassing event occurred when soils had significant soil moisture deficits (3 ̆e 50...|$|R

Indicators of biodiversity can provide standardized measures that make it easier to compare and communicate changes to an ecosystem. In agricultural landscapes the amount and variety of available habitat is directly correlated with biodiversity levels. Linear woody features (LWF), including hedgerows, windbreaks, shelterbelts as well as woody shrubs along <b>fields,</b> roads and <b>watercourses,</b> {{play a vital role in}} supporting biodiversity as well as serving a wide variety of other purposes in the ecosystem. Earth observation can be used to quantify and monitor LWF across the landscape. While individual features can be manually mapped, this research focused on the development of methods using line intersect sampling (LIS) for estimating LWF as an indicator of habitat availability in agricultural landscapes. The methods are accurate, efficient, repeatable and provide robust results. Methods were tested over 9. 5 Mha of agricultural landscape in the Canadian Mixedwood Plains ecozone. Approximately 97, 000 km of LWF were estimated across this landscape with results useable both at a regional reporting scale, as well as mapped across space for use in wildlife habitat modelling or other landscape management research. The LIS approach developed here could be employed at a variety of scales in particular for large regions and could be adapted for use as a national scale indicator of habitat availability in heavily disturbed agricultural landscape...|$|R

An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0 - 3 y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection...|$|R

It is, indeed, a noble map, and of noble things; but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine speculations of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know must be the case in every part of the world, (the necessity of a previous provision of habitation, seed, stock, capital,) that map will show you that the uses of the influences of Heaven itself are in that country a work of art. The Carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or running streams, and it has rain only at a season; but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command. This is the national bank of the Carnatic, on which it must have a perpetual credit, or it perishes irretrievably. For that reason, in the happier times of India, a number, almost incredible, of reservoirs have been made in chosen places throughout the whole country: they are formed, for the greater part, of mounds of earth and stones, with sluices of solid masonry; the whole constructed with admirable skill and labor, and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit. From these reservoirs currents are occasionally drawn over the <b>fields,</b> and these <b>watercourses</b> again call for a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly levelled.

40|$|Buffer {{zones are}} vegetated strip-edges of {{agricultural}} <b>fields</b> along <b>watercourses.</b> As linear habitats in agricultural ecosystems, buffer strips dominate {{and play a}} leading ecological role in many areas. This thesis focuses on the plant species diversity of the buffer zones in a Finnish agricultural landscape. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to identify the determinants of floral species diversity in arable buffer zones from local to regional levels. This study was conducted in a watershed area of a farmland landscape of southern Finland. The study area, Lepsämänjoki, is situated in the Nurmijärvi commune 30 km to the north of Helsinki, Finland. The biotope mosaics were mapped in GIS. A total of 59 buffer zones were surveyed, of which 29 buffer strips surveyed were also sampled by plot. Firstly, two diversity components (species richness and evenness) were investigated to determine whether {{the relationship between the two}} is equal and predictable. I found no correlation between species richness and evenness. The relationship between richness and evenness is unpredictable in a small-scale human-shaped ecosystem. Ordination and correlation analyses show that richness and evenness may result from different ecological processes, and thus should be considered separately. Species richness correlated negatively with phosphorus content, and species evenness correlated negatively with the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil. The lack of a consistent pattern in the relationship between these two components may be due to site-specific variation in resource utilization by plant species. Within-habitat configuration (width, length, and area) were investigated to determine which is more effective for predicting species richness. More species per unit area increment could be obtained from widening the buffer strip than from lengthening it. The width of the strips is an effective determinant of plant species richness. The increase in species diversity with an increase in the width of buffer strips may be due to cross-sectional habitat gradients within the linear patches. This result can serve as a reference for policy makers, and has application value in agricultural management. In the framework of metacommunity theory, I found that both mass effect(connectivity) and species sorting (resource heterogeneity) were likely to explain species composition and diversity on a local and regional scale. The local and regional processes were interactively dominated by the degree to which dispersal perturbs local communities. In the lowly and intermediately connected regions, species sorting was of primary importance to explain species diversity, while the mass effect surpassed species sorting in the highly connected region. Increasing connectivity in communities containing high habitat heterogeneity can lead to the homogenization of local communities, and consequently, to lower regional diversity, while local species richness was unrelated to the habitat connectivity. Of all species found, Anthriscus sylvestris, Phalaris arundinacea, and Phleum pretense significantly responded to connectivity, and showed high abundance in the highly connected region. We suggest that these species may play a role in switching the force from local resources to regional connectivity shaping the community structure. On the landscape context level, the different responses of local species richness and evenness to landscape context were investigated. Seven landscape structural parameters served to indicate landscape context on five scales. On all scales but the smallest scales, the Shannon-Wiener diversity of land covers (H') correlated positively with the local richness. The factor (H') showed the highest correlation coefficients in species richness on the second largest scale. The edge density of arable field was the only predictor that correlated with species evenness on all scales, which showed the highest predictive power on the second smallest scale. The different predictive power of the factors on different scales showed a scaledependent relationship between the landscape context and local plant species diversity, and indicated that different ecological processes determine species richness and evenness. The local richness of species depends on a regional process on large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool, while species evenness depends on a fine- or coarse-grained farming system, which may relate to the patch quality of the habitats of field edges near the buffer strips. My results suggested some guidelines of species diversity conservation in the agricultural ecosystem. To maintain a high level of species diversity in the strips, a high level of phosphorus in strip soil should be avoided. Widening the strips is the most effective mean to improve species richness. Habitat connectivity is not always favorable to species diversity because increasing connectivity in communities containing high habitat heterogeneity can lead to the homogenization of local communities (beta diversity) and, consequently, to lower regional diversity. Overall, a synthesis of local and regional factors emerged as the model that best explain variations in plant species diversity. The studies also suggest that the effects of determinants on species diversity have a complex relationship with scale. This study conducted on plant species diversity of field boundary habitat in agricultural landscapes. Along waterways, the vegetation boundaries, called buffer zones here, served to protect water in agricultural ecosystems. In recent decades, plant species diversity in these linear landscape structures has declined severely. Recently, emphasis has been laid on the importance of buffer zones for maintaining and enhancing the biodiversity of agricultural environments. The linear habitats have a leading ecological role on many aspects. Animal and plant species can use the linear habitats as corridors or refuges in agricultural ecosystem. The diversity of vegetation (for example, species richness, vertical structure, and species composition) in the buffer zones is important for its function to protect from agrochemicals and from eroded soil. With their year-round vegetation cover, buffer zones significantly decrease (by about 20 %) the amount of solid particles and their bound nutrients reaching waterways. Buffer zones also efficiently prevent pesticides from spreading from one field to another and into the surrounding environment, and provide habitats for animal species. In Finland, a typical field margin includes a grassy ditch bank. Maintaining plant species diversity in the linear habitats is a major aim of sustainable agricultural land-use. However, since the 1950 s, with extension and intensification of agriculture Finnish rural landscape has become simplified and the semi-natural linear habitats have been declined rapidly, particularly in southern Finland. It has resulted mainly from a shift to subsurface drainage, and associated to enlargement of parcel size and homogenization of parcel shape. This change is believed to have a subsequent adverse impact on farmland wildlife. To restore and maintain species diversity in the landscapes, This study served to understand the relationships between plant species diversity and factors from local to regional scale...|$|R

Here the road to economy lies not through receipt, but through expense; and in that country nature has given no short cut to your object. Men must propagate like other animals, by the mouth. Never did oppression light the nuptial torch; never did extortion and usury spread out the genial bed. Does any one of you think that England, so wasted, would, under such a nursing attendance, so rapidly and cheaply recover? But he is meanly acquainted with either England or India, who does not know that England would a thousand times sooner resume population, fertility, and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from both--revenue, than such a country as the Carnatic. The Carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile soil. The general size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise. It is some days since I moved, that a curious and interesting map, kept in the India house, should be laid before you. The India House is not yet in readiness to send it; I have therefore brought down my own copy, and there it lies for the use of any gentleman who may think such a matter worthy of his attention. It is indeed a noble map, and of noble things; but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine speculations of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know must be the case in every part of the world (the necessity of a previous provision of habitation, seed, stock, capital), that map will show you, that the uses of the influences of Heaven itself are in that country a work of art. The Carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or running streams, and it has rain only at a season; but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command. This is the national bank of the Carnatic, on which it must have a perpetual credit, or it perishes irretrievably. For that reason, in the happier times of India, a number, almost incredible, of reservoirs have been made in chosen places throughout the whole country; they are formed for the greater part of mounds of earth and stones, with sluices of solid masonry; the whole constructed with admirable skill and labour, and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit. From these reservoirs currents are occasionally drawn over the <b>fields,</b> and these <b>watercourses</b> again call for a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly leveled. Taking the district in that map as a measure, there cannot be in the Carnatic and Tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs of the larger and middling dimensions, to say nothing of those for domestic services, and the uses of religious purification. These are not the enterprises of your power, nor in a style of magnificence suited to the taste of your minister. These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These were the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind.|$|R
