5|$|After {{six months}} of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a {{difficult}} choice: <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sue for peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon {{fully aware of the}} details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.|$|E
5|$|OKW {{operations}} chief Alfred Jodl {{was present}} for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, Karl Koller, {{at a meeting}} a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first {{in the line of}} succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers, the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead. He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassed by {{the events}} at the press conference, Đính {{returned}} to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters. His colleagues, led by General Trần Văn Đôn, were plotting a coup against Diệm because of the Buddhist crisis, and attempted to play on Đính's ego to convince him to join them. They knew that without Đính's assistance, a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured Đính {{that he was a}} national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. Đính's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Diệm's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised Đính to ask Diệm to promote him to interior minister, Dương Văn Minh to defence minister, and Trần Văn Minh to education minister. The other generals hoped that would reject Đính and wound his pride. As a result, Đính and his fellow generals met Diệm at the palace, where Đính asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister. Diệm bluntly chastised Đính in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of Đà Lạt to rest. Đính felt humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his colleagues that he would be successful. The Ngô brothers had been alarmed by Đính's request, and put him under surveillance. Đính found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. Đính agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> switch sides.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Beck {{essentially}} supplanted Tobin as {{the real}} power in the Teamsters union. On April 22, 1948, the Machinists (which was {{not a member of}} the AFL) struck Boeing in Seattle, Washington. On May 28, Beck announced that Teamsters would seek to organize the workers at Boeing, and formed Aeronautical Workers and Warehousemen Helpers Union Local 451 to raid the Machinists. Beck and Boeing officials made a secret agreement in which Boeing would hire members of Local 451—essentially hiring Teamsters as scabs and strikebreakers. After as many as a third of the Machinists had joined the Teamsters, the Machinists agreed to return to work without a contract. Beck's actions were nearly universally condemned by members of the AFL Executive Council. The AFL Executive Council met in August 1948 to take action against Beck. The day before the meeting, Tobin privately told associates that he would repudiate Beck. But at a secret meeting that afternoon, Beck and his followers on the West Coast confronted Tobin with a fait accompli: Beck had allied with his long-time enemy Jimmy Hoffa. He now had more than enough votes on the Teamsters executive board to overrule Tobin <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> fire Beck. At the AFL meeting the next day, Tobin was forced to defend Beck's actions. Unwilling to embarrass an AFL vice president and create a confrontation with the Teamsters, the AFL Executive Council condoned the Teamster raid on the Machinists.|$|E

500|$|In July 1980, Bill Lyon of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{wrote that}} many fans unfairly stereotyped McBride as a lazy player {{because of his}} bad knees and his low-key personality. McBride ran with a {{lopsided}} gait, which fans interpreted {{as a lack of}} effort. Lyon wrote that because McBride did not talk about his injuries a lot to the public, most people did not realize that his knee joint had significantly eroded and that he was [...] "essentially, a one-legged player." [...] Lyon said that McBride's Afro hairstyle and his isolated nature furthered the stereotypes that many fans held.

500|$|Brezhnev had, {{according}} {{to some of his}} closest advisers, been concerned {{for a very long time}} about the growing military expenditure in the 1960s. Advisers have recounted how Brezhnev came into conflict with several top-level military industrialists, the most notable being Marshal Andrei Grechko, the Minister of Defense. In the early 1970s, {{according to}} Anatoly Aleksandrov-Agentov, one of Brezhnev's closest advisers, Brezhnev attended a five-hour meeting to try to convince the Soviet military establishment to reduce military spending. In the meeting an irritated Brezhnev asked why the Soviet Union should, in the words of Matthew Evangelista, [...] "continue to exhaust" [...] the economy if the country could not be promised a military parity with the West; the question was left unanswered. When Grechko died in 1976, Dmitriy Ustinov took his place as Defense Minister. Ustinov, although a close associate and friend of Brezhnev, hindered any attempt made by Brezhnev to reduce national military expenditure. In his later years, Brezhnev lacked the will to reduce defense expenditure, due to his declining health. According to the Soviet diplomat Georgy Arbatov, the military–industrial complex functioned as Brezhnev's power base within the Soviet hierarchy even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> scale-down investments.|$|E

They also threatened to blow up the school if government forces attacked. To avoid being overwhelmed by gas attack like their comrades in the 2002 Moscow hostage crisis, insurgents quickly smashed the school's windows. The captors prevented hostages from eating and drinking (calling this a [...] "hunger strike", which they said they joined too) until North Ossetia's President Alexander Dzasokhov would arrive to negotiate with them.

[...] After this, Celia attempted to plead with Newsom’s family members and with Newsom himself. Sometime on or around June 23, 1855, Celia begged Newsom to leave her alone because she was sick and pregnant.

2500|$|The railroad's charter gave it {{two years}} to be built. However, like the {{original}} plan for the line, numerous difficulties were encountered. One such issue was the acquisition of the necessary property for the line's right-of-way. Many property owners refused to sell their land, {{which was in the}} way of the proposed line. To prevent the loss of the line's charter, in 1853, the company successfully petitioned for an extension of two more years to build the line. A bill was passed in 1853 that gave the company the right to operate ferry service between New York and Staten Island. Still facing difficulties, in January 1855, the company applied to the New York State Legislature for a three-year extension to complete the project. After all of the property required for the right-of-way was completed, construction commenced in November 1855. However, after construction had started they had run out of money to complete the line. Therefore, they asked Cornelius [...] "Commodore" [...] Vanderbilt, the sole Staten Island-to-Manhattan ferry operator, for a loan. Vanderbilt agreed to finance the railroad, but he changed the northern terminal of line from Stapleton to his ferry landing further east, Vanderbilt's Landing. Vanderbilt tried to stop competitors who had previously owned the railroad's lease. Vanderbilt appointed James R. Robinson to build a structure to block his competitors, but on July 28, 1851, people tried to take apart the almost-finished structure, threatening to hurt Robinson <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> block them.

That night, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was defaced with graffiti containing the phrase. Resulting debates about whether citizens have the right to offend members of the royal house as part of their freedom of speech, and thus the prohibition on lèse-majesté should be repealed, appeared to show a majority of political parties in favour of repeal, although the proposal has not been voted on yet. On 20 May, king Willem-Alexander told American journalists that he would accept repealing the prohibition on lèse-majesté, regardless of his personal opinion, because [...] "his tongue would fall off <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> comment on the issue because it is not in his power to discuss political issues."
