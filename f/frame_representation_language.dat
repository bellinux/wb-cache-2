40|$|The <b>Frame</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>Language</b> (FRL) is an {{experimental}} language written {{to explore the}} use of frames as a knowledge representation technique. The term 'frame' as used in FRL was inspired by Minsky's [75] development of frame theory. FRL extends the traditional Property List representation scheme by allowing properties to have comments, defaults and constraints, to inherit information from abstract forms of the same type, and to have attached procedures triggered by adding or deleting values, or if a value is needed. We introduce FRL {{with the aid of}} a simple example: WHOSIS, a database of AI persons' names, addresses, interests and publications. A second section contains an abridged manual describing FRL's most-used commands and conventions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aside {{from this}} {{difference}} in emphasis, KL-ONE This paper describes an extension of FRL (<b>Frame</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>Language)</b> which supports the encoding of reasoning knowledge within a frame-based formalism. The extension is called HPRL (Heuristic Programming and Representation Language). The declarative representation of reasoning knowledge in the same formalism {{that is used to}} represent domain knowledge results in a powerful tool for the construction of expert systems. Reasoning knowledge is easy to describe, examine and modify. Rules can be reflexive, allowing the construction of powerful meta-rules. HPRL runs on a Vax 11 / 780, and on the HP- 9836. It has been used for various exploratory projects at Hewlett-Packard, including a program to diagnose faults during IC manufacturing, a program for analyzing dual-channel ECG information to diagnose arrhythmias, and a program for analyzing spectra from infrared and mass spectrometers...|$|E
40|$|Ever since Woods's "What's in a Link" paper, {{there has}} been a growing concern for {{formalization}} in the study of knowledge representation. Several arguments have been made that <b>frame</b> <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> and semantic-network languages are syntactic variants of the first-orde/. predicate calculus (FOPC). The typical argument proceeds by showing how any given <b>frame</b> or network <b>representation</b> can be mapped to a logically isomorphic FOPC representation. For the past two years we have been studying the formalization of knowledge retrievers as well as the <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> that they operate on. This paper presents a <b>representation</b> <b>language</b> in the notation of FOPC whose form facilitates the design of a semantic-network-like retriever...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we encode {{some of the}} {{reasoning}} methods used in <b>frame</b> based knowledge <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> in answer set programming (ASP). In particular, we show how “cloning ” and “unification ” in frame based systems can be encoded in ASP. We then show how some {{of the types of}} queries with respect to a biological knowledge base can be encoded using our methodology. We also provide insight on how the reasoning can be done more efficiently when dealing with a huge knowledge base...|$|R
40|$|In this {{position}} statement, we describe our on-going research project on resolving semantic differences for multi-agent systems in electronic commerce. The approach {{we are taking}} can be characterized by the following: 1) the semantic differences between heterogeneous agents are resolved at runtime and in an incremental fashion; 2) concepts and their classes are represented as frames based on daml+oil semantic markup language; and 3) the resolution is viewed as an abductive reasoning process and thus necessarily involves approximation and default reasoning.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{fashion in}} {{knowledge}} <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> {{is to use}} XML as the low-level syntax. This tends to make the output of these knowledge <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> easy for machines to parse, {{at the expense of}} human readability. The strength of XML lies in its simplicity to represent data and knowledge. It is used to develop modeling languages that are tailored to specific knowledge, and specific data structures and hierarchies. This paper considers an approach to <b>frame</b> knowledge <b>representation</b> using XML. A generalized XML model of the frame-based representation is proposed. The implementation of the XML generator, which is built into the interactive tool for <b>frame</b> <b>representation</b> is described...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ARLO, a <b>representation</b> <b>language</b> loosely modelled after Greiner and Lenant's RLL- 1. ARLO is a structure-based <b>representation</b> <b>language</b> {{for describing}} structure-based <b>representation</b> <b>languages,</b> including itself. A given <b>representation</b> <b>language</b> is specified in ARLO by {{a collection of}} structures describing how its descriptions are interpreted, defaulted, and verified. This high level description is compiles into lisp code and ARLO structures whose interpretation fulfills the specified semantics of the representation. In addition, ARLO itself- as a <b>representation</b> <b>language</b> for expressing and compiling partial and complete language specifications- is described and interpreted {{in the same manner}} as the language it describes and implements. This self-description can be extended of modified to expand or alter the expressive power of ARLO's initial configuration. Languages which describe themselves like ARLO- provide powerful mediums for systems which perform automatic self-modification, optimization, debugging, or documentation. AI systems implemented in such a self-descriptive language can reflect on their own capabilities and limitations, applying general learning and problem solving strategies to enlarge or alleviate them...|$|R

40|$|The Semantic Web {{initiative}} defines important {{challenges for}} knowledge representation and database systems. Recently, several standards for <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> {{have been proposed}} (RDF, DAML+OIL, OWL). We briefly discuss the logical basis of these <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> by referring to description logic (DL) inferences systems. By introducing the DL inference system Racer we demonstrate that practically usable query engines for Semantic Web <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> are available. Then, we argue that current <b>representation</b> <b>languages</b> for the Semantic Web are not sufficient for simple and well-defined representation problems that naturally arise {{in the context of}} Semantic Web applications. In particular, we mention different kinds of algebraic constraints over various domains such as the reals or the natural numbers. We report on practical experiences with DL reasoning systems (e. g., Racer) already supporting these representation means and argue for extensions to DAML+OIL or OWL. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Frame</b> <b>representations,</b> which {{correspond}} to overcomplete generalizations to basis expansions, {{are often used}} in signal processing to provide robustness to errors. In this thesis robustness is provided {{through the use of}} projections to compensate for errors in the representation coefficients, with spe-cific focus on quantization and erasure errors. The projections are implemented by modifying the unaffected coefficients using an additive term, which is linear in the error. This low-complexity im-plementation only assumes linear reconstruction using a pre-determined synthesis frame, and makes no assumption on how the representation coefficients are generated. In the context of quantization, the limits of scalar quantization of <b>frame</b> <b>representations</b> are first exam-ined, assuming the analysis is using inner products with the frame vectors. Bounds on the error and the bit-efficiency are derived, demonstrating that scalar quantization of the coefficients is suboptimal. As an alternative to scalar quantization, a generalization of Sigma-Delta noise shaping to arbitrary <b>frame</b> <b>representations</b> is developed by reformulating noise shaping as a sequence of compensations for the quantization error using projections. The total error is quantified using both the additive nois...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an optimal key <b>frame</b> <b>representation</b> {{scheme based on}} global {{statistics}} for video shot retrieval. Each pixel in this optimal key frame is constructed by considering the probability of occurrence of those pixels at the corresponding pixel position among the frames in a video shot. Therefore, this constructed key frame is called temporally maximum occurrence frame (TMOF), which is an optimal representation of all the frames in a video shot. The retrieval performance of this representation scheme is further improved by considering the k pixel values with the largest probabilities of occurrence and the highest peaks of the probability distribution of occurrence at each pixel position for a video shot. The corresponding schemes are called k-TMOF and k-pTMOF, respectively. These key <b>frame</b> <b>representation</b> schemes are compared to other histogram-based techniques for video shot representation and retrieval. In the experiments, three video sequences in the MPEG- 7 content set were {{used to evaluate the}} performances of the different key <b>frame</b> <b>representation</b> schemes.
