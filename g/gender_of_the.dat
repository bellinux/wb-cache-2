5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammatical subject, creating {{a set of}} four verb subclasses. The {{distinction between the two}} genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to define the {{depression}} symptom levels and the mobbing executions’ levels they are subjected to according to <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> vocational high school students. <b>The</b> ranks <b>of</b> being subjected to mobbing and the depression levels are examined via <b>the</b> <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. According to the findings, there is a significant correlation between <b>the</b> <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students and being subjected to mobbing, but there is no statistical correlation between <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students and <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> depression symptoms. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statistical analysis, even though the male students are subjected to mobbing more than the female students, there is no statistical difference between <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> depression symptoms...|$|R

5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noun.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E

40|$|The article {{comprehensively}} {{reviews the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} work on gender and the knowledge society and introduces <b>the</b> articles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special issue. Three {{ways in which the}} knowledge society and economy are gendered are distinguished: <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> human capital; <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> networks and <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge society. Using data from the Labour Force Survey, an original analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK knowledge economy is presented. It finds that <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge economy makes a difference to its gender composition: the more centred on technology and fixed capital, the more masculine, the more centred on human capital, the more gender balanced. The knowledge economy provides better work and conditions. Gender gaps are narrower in the knowledge economy than the overall economy: occupational hierarchies are narrowed to women's advantage, while differences in work temporalities are narrowed to men's advantage...|$|R

5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive verb. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate the <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> addressee).|$|E
