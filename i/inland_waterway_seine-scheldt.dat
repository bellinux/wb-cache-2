40|$|Climate {{change may}} affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> {{transport}} through disturbances in waterway hydrology: longer periods with strong water swells and drops. To allow fully loaded barges, {{the water level}} must be neither too high (limited air draught) nor too low (limited draught). Therefore, the water level impacts the load factor of barges and thus the transportation costs. Moreover, in winter, ice jams can paralyze <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> traffic on the river. In this paper, the effect of various climatological changes on the capacity of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> in terms of barge transport is examined. The paper focusses {{on the development of}} a methodology for assessing the sensitivity of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> systems to climatological changes and takes into account an experts' opinion survey that provides insight into the perceived likelihood of the different scenarios that are investigated. The analysis focusses on the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> systems in Belgium, which has the second highest density of European <b>inland</b> <b>waterways.</b> It enables the integration of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in the intermodal supply chain. The results are related to investment planning and management in <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> transport.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} to analyse {{and compare the}} transport costs of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport and road-only-transport. The influence of the economies of scale in <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport. By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport, while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport...|$|R

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of transport operations for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in North West Europe under several climate scenarios.
