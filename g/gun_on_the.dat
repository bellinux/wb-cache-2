5000|$|Invincible {{was one of}} {{the first}} trio of a new and longer type of 74-gun ships. Until 1738, French 74s had been little more than 154 (French) feet in gundeck length, {{carrying}} just thirteen pairs of 36-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower deck, fourteen pairs of 18-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck and eight pairs of 8-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quarterdeck and forecastle, with the balance of the 74 guns made up of four small 4-pdr <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poop.|$|R
5|$|The ship's {{original}} armament {{consisted of}} a single Bofors 40 mm D70 gun mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple Strela 2 launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20mm M-75 <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stern. Eight MDB-MT3 depth charges could be carried for anti-submarine warfare duties. Located on the sides were two double-barrel 128mm illumination launchers. Sensors included a Racal Decca RM 1216 A surface search radar and a Simrad SQ 3D/SF sonar.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E

5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons {{at it from the}} roof of a house in the Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E

5|$|The Leopard 2A6 and its longer L/55 main gun {{have been}} {{exported}} {{for use by}} the Canadian Army, and the Netherlands upgraded part of its original fleet of Leopard 2s with the more powerful armament.

Two Challenger 2s were modified to undergo firing trials. Although South Korean K2 Black Panther is equipped with a L/55 main gun and shows similar characteristics as its German counterpart, it is indigenously developed by Agency for Defense Development and World Industries Ace Corporation (WIA), a Korea-based powertrain company affiliated with Hyundai Kia Motors Group.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} put three heavy <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> platform at the top, with five <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> (second) floor below, sharing the 14 cannon ports.

After some improvement, it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage. However, the supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient for production needs, so a new gun shield was used. This was designated the M3A1 GMC.|$|E

5|$|Filming of Big Money Rustlas, a Western spoof, {{began in}} January 2009, and {{concluded}} on February 24, 2009. The tenth Gathering of the Juggalos {{took place at}} Hogrock in Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, from August 6 to 9. The event had the largest attendance in Gathering history with over 20,000 people. Over 120 musical artists performed at the event, including the likes of Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth Kings, Ice Cube, GWAR, Coolio, Vanilla Ice, Onyx, Scarface, The Dayton Family, Bizarre, Esham, and NATAS. At the event, the Big Money Rustlas trailer was screened twice. An infomercial for the event was released online by Psychopathic Records. After the event, a friend of Esham's handed Bruce {{a copy of his}} album I Ain't Cha Homey, which depicted a clown committing suicide with a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front cover. Bruce listened to the album and saw it as a diss towards Insane Clown Posse. While Esham claimed that the album was not a diss in his podcast, the album strained the relationship between Bruce and Esham, and the two have not spoken since its release.|$|E

5|$|Just before dawn, Howard summoned his platoon {{commanders to}} a meeting. With their senior {{officers}} dead or wounded, numbers One, Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals. Howard's second in command, Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing. Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons {{had a full}} complement of officers and NCOs. The landings at Sword began at 07:00, preceded by a heavy naval bombardment. At the bridges, daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot. The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75mm anti-tank <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville, the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area. At 09:00, two German gunboats approached the canal bridge from Ouistreham. The lead boat fired its 20mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT, hitting the wheelhouse of the leading boat, which crashed into the canal bank. The second boat retreated to Ouistreham. A lone German aircraft bombed the canal bridge at 10:00, dropping one bomb. The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate.|$|E

Ross returns to his former life as an ordinary beat constable.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Verdeja program's end {{came with}} the arrival of {{military}} equipment from the United States, beginning in 1953. From 1954, the Spanish Army received 389 M47 Patton Tanks, replacing the T-26s, Panzer Is and Panzer IVs then in service. The Verdeja had become completely obsolete when compared to larger, more potent tanks such as the German Panther, the Soviet T-54 and the US M47. The T-54 had 200millimetre of steel armor on the turret mantlet, far greater than the Verdeja 2's maximum armor thickness of 40millimetres. The Soviet 45millimetre model 1932 gun was replaced by the T-34's 76.2millimetre gun, while the Germans adopted the 75millimetre L/70 tank <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Panther. By 1950, Soviet tanks such as the T-54 were armed with the D-10T 100millimetre tank gun, and American tanks adopted the 90millimetre main gun. Although the Verdeja was Spain's most successful indigenous design, it was outclassed as foreign countries produced superior products. Furthermore, the need for self-propelled artillery was soon eliminated as the United States offered Spain M37 and M44 self-propelled howitzers. As a result, interest in the Verdeja dried up after 1954. Spain would not attempt another indigenous tank until the advent of the Lince main battle tank in the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The Sibylle {{class was}} {{a class of}} five 32-gun sail frigates {{designed}} by Jacques-Noël Sané and built for the French Navy in the late 1770s.

5000|$|John Williams, the Surveyor of the Navy, {{designed}} the {{class as a}} development of his 1773 design for the 20-gun Sphinx class. The 1776 design enlarged the ship, which permitted the mounting of an eleventh pair of 9-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck and two smaller (6-pounder) <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quarterdeck.|$|R
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main deck and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight {{of these were}} also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main deck {{and the other three}} served as chase <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon—commanded by Lieutenant Les Tranter—also {{engaged with}} Splintex from their 90mm RCLs, firing {{across the front}} of the mortars and {{relieving}} the immediate pressure on them. However, with the North Vietnamese having successfully achieved a break-in, and faced with the possibility of imminent annihilation, the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon second-in-command—Lieutenant Tony Jensen—was forced to direct the RCLs onto his own position, to which Bennett agreed. As the North Vietnamese attempted to turn the captured mortars against the Australians, the flechette darts swept the area, clearing everything above ground, causing heavy casualties among the assaulting force and damaging a number of mortar tubes. Elsewhere, the North Vietnamese assault had reached the Australian gun position, over-running two guns as desperate close quarters fighting broke out between the emplacements. The attackers subsequently succeeded in capturing No. 6 <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> extreme edge of the gun-line and then attempted to destroy it with satchel charges. In both the mortar and artillery positions the North Vietnamese and Australians occupied adjacent pits, fighting each other at close range for their possession. The gun position officer—Captain Ian Ahearn—co-ordinated the defence, and the Australians finally drove off the assault with grenades and small arms, as well as Splintex rounds fired from the Anti-Tank Platoon. Meanwhile, with the assault falling mainly on 1 RAR and 102nd Field Battery, to the west 3 RAR had largely remained out of contact.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{examines}} McMahon {{and finds}} {{her to be}} physically normal, Doggett thinks {{that they may be}} onto something whilst Reyes remains skeptical. Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer. Reyes tries {{to find out more about}} McMahon's history and learns that she is a Department of Justice employee and had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans to contaminate the water supply. The Lone Gunmen intercept a call from the captain to Wormus, who tells him to contact the FBI, Knowle Rohrer is nearby eavesdropping. The captain then pulls a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Navy Seal guarding the entrance to the lab, demanding that Nordlinger surrender the project's data. He does not notice Rohrer creeping up behind him. After hearing Reyes' findings, Scully, Reyes and Doggett go to the ship. They expect to meet the captain, but instead find Rohrer. Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the ship, which is abandoned, and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
