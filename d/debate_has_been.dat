5|$|<b>Debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{going on}} about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was {{likely to have been}} much more {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E

25|$|The Great Latke-Hamantash Debate - Since 1946, {{an annual}} <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> held, mainly between faculty members - most (but not all) {{of whom are}} Jewish - about the {{relative}} merits of latkes and hamantashn. These two Jewish delicacies are associated with the holidays of Hanukkah and Purim, respectively.

The event is currently sponsored by University of Chicago Hillel chapter and Alpha Epsilon Pi, the Jewish fraternity.|$|E
25|$|There are not {{too many}} {{instances}} of limiting primary picketing.

The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is BCGEU v. BC (1988) where employees at the British Columbia Supreme Court, who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.|$|E

25|$|Lawson and Wooliscroft (2004) {{drew the}} link between human nature and the {{marketing}} concept, not explicitly biology, where they considered the contrasting views of Hobbes and Rousseau on mankind. Hobbes believed man had a self-serving nature whereas Rousseau was more forgiving towards the nature of man, suggesting them to be noble and dignified. Hobbes saw {{the need for a}} governing intermediary to control this selfish nature which provided a basis for the exchange theory, and also links to Mcgregor’s Theory of X and Y, relevant to management literature. He also considered cooperation and competition, relevant to game theory as an explanation of man’s motives and can be used for understanding the exercising of power in marketing channels.

500|$|The <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{often cited}} {{in the history of}} {{nanotechnology}} due to the fame of its participants and its commentary on both the technical and social aspects of nanotechnology. It has also been widely criticized for its adversarial tone, with Drexler accusing Smalley of publicly misrepresenting his work, and Smalley accusing Drexler of failing to understand basic science, causing commentators to {{go so far as to}} characterize the tone of the debate as similar to [...] "a pissing match" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of [...] Saturday Night Live sketch".|$|E
500|$|In response, Yeats {{delivered}} {{a series of}} speeches that attacked the [...] "quixotically impressive" [...] ambitions {{of the government and}} clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of [...] "medieval Spain." [...] "Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry."

500|$|The <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely {{criticized for}} its {{adversarial}} tone.

[...] Zyvex founder James von Ehr remarked that [...] "Eric [...] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a Nobel-prize winner." [...] An article in The New York Times called the debate [...] "reminiscent of that old Saturday Night Live sketch... Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," [...] referring to a version of the long-running Weekend Update segment.|$|E

500|$|An {{issue of}} {{academic}} <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> regarding {{the connection between}} the New Age movement and contemporary Paganism, or Neo-Paganism. The two phenomena have often being confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques. Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a [...] "significant overlap" [...] between the two religious movements, while Aidan A. Kelly stated that Paganism [...] "parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways". Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena which share overlap and commonalities. Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement [...] particularly those which pre-dated the movement [...] other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age. Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of occulture (occult culture) that merge at points.|$|E
500|$|Cristina Rodriguez, a {{professor}} at the New York University School of Law, has argued that Wong Kim Ark's situation was [...] "similar in all meaningful respects" [...] to that of children of illegal immigrants, because [...] "they both involve immigrant parents ineligible for full membership in the polity, or immigrant populations that were tolerated but disdained or considered legally erasable." [...] Rodriguez goes on to claim that the Wong Kim Ark ruling was [...] "a powerful rejection of the idea that one's status depends on his parent's status." [...] Noting contrary arguments (such as those put forth by Schuck and Smith), Rodriguez says that [...] "For all practical purposes, this <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> resolved. [...] Though renewed interest {{over the last few years}} in immigration reform has prompted the introduction of legislation in Congress to deny the children of the unauthorized jus soli status, these measures have been political non-starters, in large part because of the widespread view that the Supreme Court would strike down any such legislation as unconstitutional." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this <b>debate</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E
