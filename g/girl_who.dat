40|$|Almost {{one-third of}} the {{population}} in developing countries is under age 15. Hence improving the effectiveness of policy interventions that target adolescents might be especially important. We analyze the intention to participate in training programs of adolescent girls in Uganda, a country with perhaps the most skewed age distribution anywhere in the world. The training program we focus on is BRAC's Adolescent Development Program, which emphasizes the provision of life skills, entrepreneurship training, and microfinance. We find that <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are more likely to benefit from the program are more likely to intend to participate. The program attracts <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are likely to place a high value on financial independence: single mothers and <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are alienated from their families. The program attracts <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are more likely to benefit from training: <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> believe they could be successful entrepreneurs but currently lack the quantitative skills to do so. Reassuringly, <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> are in school full-time are less likely to intend to participate. We also find that the program attracts girls from poorer villages but we find no evidence that poorer girls within each village are more likely to want to participate. Finally, <b>girls</b> from villages <b>who</b> have previously been exposed to NGO projects are less likely to intend to participate...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the current}} study is to test the {{validity}} and reliability of the Shame Questionnaire among traumatized girls in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: The Shame Questionnaire was validated through both classical test and item response theory methods. Internal reliability, criterion validity and construct validity were examined among a sample of 325 female children living in Zambia. Sub-analyses were conducted to examine differences in construct validity among <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> reported sexual abuse and <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> did not. Results: All girls in the sample were sexually abused, but only 61. 5 % endorsed or reported that sexual abuse had occurred. Internal consistency was very good among the sample with alpha =. 87. Criterion validity was demonstrated through a significant difference of mean Shame Questionnaire scores between <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> experienced 0 - 1 trauma events and more than one traumatic event, with higher mean Shame Questionnaire scores among <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> had more than one traumatic event (p=. 004 for 0 - 1 compared to 2 and 3 events and p=. 016 for 0 - 1 compared to 4 + events). <b>Girls</b> <b>who</b> reported a history of witnessing or experiencing physical abuse had a significantly higher mean Shame Questionnaire score than <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> did not report a history of witnessing or experiencing physical abuse (p<. 0001). There {{was no significant difference in}} mean Shame Questionnaire score between <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> reported a sexual abuse history and <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> did not. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a two-factor model of the Shame Questionnaire, with an experience of shame dimension and an active outcomes of shame dimension. Item response theory analysis indicated adequate overall item fit. Results also indicate potential differences in construct validity between <b>girls</b> <b>who</b> did and did not endorse sexual abuse. Conclusions: This study suggests the general utility of the Shame Questionnaire among Zambian girls and demonstrates the need for more psychometric studies in low and middle income countries...|$|R
