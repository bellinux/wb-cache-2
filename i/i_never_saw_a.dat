500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I {{want to say is}} that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E
500|$|Miranda Seymour in The New York Times {{remarks on}} the [...] "breathless passion" [...] of the narrator's voice as being {{absolutely}} convincing, citing as an example Nancy's statement to her sister {{at the start of}} the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler:... It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E
500|$|During the Drowned World Tour of 2001, Madonna {{was asked}} whether she had really sent the book for Morton's well-being. She replied sarcastically: [...] "Why yes, I always send bibles and {{philosophy}} books to my biographers." [...] Motioning to her then husband Guy Ritchie she continued, [...] "Just ask my husband, he'll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course." [...] Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement that [...] "None of this [...] is true. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old." [...] Morton remained unabashed, saying that he wrote the book because of {{his interest in the}} star, not least because she has made a [...] "difference" [...] to pop culture and modern culture. He added: ...|$|E

500|$|Fingleton wrote, [...] "He {{crouched}} {{a little}} at the crease...he tapped the ground impatiently with his bat while awaiting the ball, and his feet were so eager {{to be on the}} move that they began an impulsive move forward just before the ball was bowled. This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> better forcer of the ball to the on-side, and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position." [...] However, Ponsford was not a stylish batsman. Bradman said [...] "There were more beautiful players, but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal ?" [...] Robinson described Ponsford as the [...] "founder of total batting, the first to make a habit of regarding 100 as merely the opening battle in a campaign for a larger triumph." [...] The New South Wales and Australian bowler Arthur Mailey later said that [...] "I don't think it was the rungetting Ponny enjoyed so much as the bowlers' discomfort, especially when those bowlers came from New South Wales." ...|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for me to think of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> mean act on his part. [...] He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.|$|E
2500|$|The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, {{is neither}} too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but {{a mixture of}} the two. He {{is a man of}} black hair and large skull. His {{complexion}} has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long al-masrubah which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> man like him before him or after him.|$|E
2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he sat back on his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E

2500|$|Twain was an adamant {{supporter}} of {{the abolition of slavery}} and the emancipation of slaves, even {{going so far as to}} say, [...] "Lincoln's Proclamation... not only set the black slaves free, but set the white man free also". He argued that non-whites did not receive justice in the United States, once saying, [...] "I have seen Chinamen abused and maltreated in all the mean, cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature... but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Chinaman righted in a court of justice for wrongs thus done to him". He paid for at least one black person to attend Yale Law School and for another black person to attend a southern university to become a minister.|$|E
2500|$|Cleghorn {{was hit by}} a car on his way to work on June 27, 1956 on Montreal's Commissioners Street. He {{sustained}} {{head injuries}} and a fractured cervical vertebrae. Two weeks later, on July 12, 1956, he died of his injuries at St. Luc Hospital. He was 66, and was survived by his brother Odie as well as three sisters. His funeral was held at First Presbyterian Church in Montreal on July 14 and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery. Upon his death, his brother, Odie remarked, [...] "He was my brother, and I don't like to boast, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> tougher or better defenceman than Sprague." [...] Two days later, Odie died in his sleep of heart failure and was found by his sister just hours before Sprague's funeral.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2005 Curry {{was caught}} making {{anonymous}} edits to the Podcast Wikipedia page, deleting several sections concerning contributions made by fellow podcasting pioneers, Kevin Marks and Stephen Downes, while adding material that emphasized his own {{involvement with the}} development of the medium. Curry went on to evoke ignorance as his primary defense stating, [...] "I edited out the Marks part previously because <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> full front-to-back solution that he was credited for...Once I saw the video of the session where he does demo it, after saying he had spoken to me and I had 'challenged' him to create it, I realized I was in error." [...] He also claimed to have difficulty with the Wikipedia interface, claiming he had originally planned to revise the paragraphs to include his recollections of events but instead became [...] "exasperated" [...] with the process and decided to give up.|$|E

2500|$|An {{officer in}} the attack wrote of the {{importance}} of Wellesley's personal leadership: [...] "The General was {{in the thick of the}} action the whole time... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> man so cool and collected as he was... though I can assure you, 'til our troops got the order to advance the fate of the day seemed doubtful..." [...] With some 6,000 Marathas killed or wounded, the enemy was routed, though Wellesley's force was in no condition to pursue. British casualties were heavy: the British losses were counted as 409 soldiers being killed out of which 164 were Europeans and the remaining 245 were Indian; a further 1,622 British soldiers were wounded and 26 soldiers were reported missing (the British casualty figures were taken from Wellesley's own despatch). Wellesley was troubled by the loss of men and remarked that he hoped [...] "I should not like to see again such loss as I sustained on 23 September, even if attended by such gain". Years later, however, he remarked that Assaye and not Waterloo, was the best battle he ever fought.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E
2500|$|From his {{earliest}} years Lucas {{had been a}} martyr to hereditary gout, which rendered him a complete cripple, and latterly obliged him to be carried to the House of Commons. Nevertheless, says an eye-witness, [...] "the gravity and uncommon neatness of his dress, his grey, venerable locks, blending with a pale but interesting countenance, in which an air of beauty was still visible, altogether excited attention, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> stranger come into the house without asking who he was." [...] He died at his residence in Henry Street, Dublin, on Monday 4 November 1771. His remains were honoured with a public funeral of imposing solemnity. He was interred in the family burial-ground in St. Michan's churchyard. Lucas’s son Henry and other relatives were in attendance at his funeral, as were his friends Lord Charlemont, Flood and Adderley. The mourners also included officers and many hundred brethren of the guilds and the Lord Mayor {{with representatives of the}} Corporation and the Vice-Provost and scholars of Trinity College.|$|E

2500|$|Vanderbilt's {{best player}} {{that day was}} Hek Wakefield, {{showcasing}} his skill in tackling Michigan's runners. [...] "I never saw a greater exhibition of end play," [...] said Fielding Yost, referring to Wakefield. The Kingsport Times reported that governor Austin Peay had given Hek praise for his play that day. Thomas Ryan also had a fine game, out-punting the famed Harry Kipke. The Michigan Alumnus attributed this to Ryan's superior line, claiming Kipke was under constant threat of a blocked punt. The Alumnus also said Kipke could not seek to return punts, for fear of fumbling. As soon as he received the ball, Vanderbilt ends Hek Wakefield or Lynn Bomar would crash into him. After the game, the referee McDonald approached guard Tuck Kelly and told him, [...] "You are the first individual I've complimented after {{a game in which}} I officiated, but I {{want to tell you that}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> better guard than you are." [...] Steger was Michigan's best runner that day. [...] The Wolverines' backfield having three men who could pass the ball in Kipke, Steger, and Uteritz, was said to help them throughout the game by vexing Vanderbilt's secondary.|$|E
