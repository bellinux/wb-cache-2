5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling {{it on her}} chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp {{to keep it from}} floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

25|$|Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> siege, {{gathered}} {{from people who}} were there, people who were not, and taken from historical Marine documents. Con Thien was the battle before Tet, a battle commanders at the time dismissed, and later forgotten maybe a little embarrassed because it showed how unprepared the US was for the 1968 Tet offensive.|$|E
25|$|Much {{has been}} written in books about the first two of the {{preceding}} branches of the Forcade family. These genealogical texts typically focus directly or indirectly on proving their lineage from a family member in Orthez, either by drawing upon letters patent that were issued, the opinions issued by royal genealogists or from the decisions and judgments of judicial entities. Much less <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> third of the preceding branches, or about the Forcades of Orthez themselves. Whereas the first two branches were required at various times throughout history to prove their lineage from the family in Orthez, many generations or several hundred years earlier, the third branch and {{the core of the}} family, who are essentially one and the same, had little difficulty proving their lineage. During the 17th century, the third branch and the core of the family were still geographically situated in or near Orthez and Pau.|$|E

500|$|Schulz {{worked in}} the {{insurance}} business, including as a state agent for an insurance company in Michigan, from 1924 {{until his death in}} 1951. [...] After retiring from football in the early 1920s, Schulz led a private life, and little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> last 30years of his life. [...] At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Schulz was living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with his wife, Emilie V. Schulz (age 35), his mother-in-law, Emilie V. Sabovian (age 82), and his sister-in-law, Louise Sabovian. His occupation was listed in the 1930 Census as an insurance salesman.|$|E
500|$|Otto Finsch was {{the first}} naturalist to visit the island of Nauru, {{stopping}} for six hours on 24 July 1880 while travelling from the Marshall Islands to the Solomon Islands. His 1881 report included a warbler he initially identified as the Carolinian reed warbler. By 1883 he considered {{it to be a}} new species, Calamoherpe rehsei. The generic name Calamoherpe is now recognised as a synonym of Acrocephalus, leading to the current binomial name. The generic name Acrocephalus derives from the Greek akros, meaning [...] "topmost", and kephale, meaning [...] "head". The akros part of the name may have been given through confusion with acutus, and taken to mean [...] "sharp-pointed", referring to the angular head shape typical of this genus. The synonym Calamoherpe is from the Greek kalamos, meaning [...] "reed", and herpes, meaning [...] "creeping thing". Finsch named the species after Ernst Rehse, a German ornithologist and collector and one of Finsch's travelling companions. Since the original descriptions, little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> species, and details about its ecology and behaviour are poorly known.|$|E

I have never understood the controversy. I had no idea if Iraq was or was not involved, {{but it would have}} been irresponsible for any administration not to have asked the question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pre-Columbian Mexico {{had a great}} {{tradition}} {{for thousands of years}} of making sculptures and figurines in clay, much of which was lost during the Spanish colonization of the Americas and Mexican Colonial period. [...] The tradition began to make a comeback in the mid 20th century with artists such as Juan Soriano, Francisco Toledo and Mathias Goeritz. [...] Many of these artists used clay to make rough drafts of works to be done in other materials such as metals, but eventually turned to clay as the primary medium. Clay sculpting came back to the forefront of Mexican art with an exhibition called [...] "Terra incognita" [...] at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1981, although relatively little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon. Some of the best known current artists in this medium include Gerardo Azcunaga, Adriana Margain, Javier Marin and Miriam Medrez.|$|E

2500|$|Though much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> MacCrimmon pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, {{there is}} little {{reliable}} information on them. The genealogy of the [...] "hereditary pipers" [...] has also {{been the subject of}} debate and speculation. The MacCrimmon of whom there is the most reliable information is Red Donald (Dòmhnull Ruadh) [...] (d July 31, 1825). Red Donald held tacks at Borreraig and Shader, and at Trien in Waternish, and also a farm at Glenelg. Red Donald's older brother was Black John (Iain Dubh) (d 1822), who also held the Boreraig tack. Interestingly the MacCrimmon brothers had their most formative years during the Disarming Act. Today it is accepted that these MacCrimmon brothers were sons of Malcolm (Calum), son of Pàdraig Òg, who were both pipers to the chiefs of MacLeod and who also held land from them. Red Donald and Black John's father and paternal uncle (Donald Ban) both piped for the Government forces in the 1745–46 Jacobite Rising.|$|E
2500|$|Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{unpleasant}} side of Hooke's personality, {{starting with}} comments {{by his first}} biographer, Richard Waller, that Hooke was [...] "in person, but despicable" [...] and [...] "melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous." [...] Waller's comments influenced other writers for well over two centuries, so that a picture of Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon dominates many older books and articles. [...] For example, Arthur Berry said that Hooke [...] "claimed credit {{for most of the}} scientific discoveries of the time." [...] Sullivan wrote that Hooke was [...] "positively unscrupulous" [...] and possessing an [...] "uneasy apprehensive vanity" [...] in dealings with Newton. Manuel used the phrase [...] "cantankerous, envious, vengeful" [...] in his description. More described Hooke having both a [...] "cynical temperament" [...] and a [...] "caustic tongue." [...] Andrade was more sympathetic, but still used the adjectives [...] "difficult", [...] "suspicious", and [...] "irritable" [...] in describing Hooke.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, {{those schools}} of thought, at least for trout fishing were: the formalists (imitation matters) and the colourists (color matters most). [...] Today, some flies are called attractor {{patterns}} because in theory, they do not resemble any specific prey, but instead attract strikes from fish. [...] For instance, Charles Jardine, in his 2008 book [...] "Flies, Ties and Techniques," [...] speaks of imitators and attractors, categorizing the Royal Wulff as an attractor and the Elk Hair Caddis as an imitator, whereas [...] "... in sea trout and steelhead fishing there is a combination of imitation and attraction involved in fly construction". [...] Paul Schullery in American Fly Fishing - A History (1996) explains however that although much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> imitation theories of fly design, all successful fly patterns must imitate something to the fish, and even a perfect imitation attracts strikes from fish. [...] The huge range of fly patterns documented today for all sorts of target species-trout, salmon, bass and panfish, pike, saltwater, tropical exotics, etc. are not easily categorized as merely imitative, attractors or [...] something else.|$|E

2500|$|Initial successes with Whiteman were {{followed}} by disaster when they reached New York {{and for a while}} Whiteman must have thought of letting them go. Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris made all the difference to the act and [...] "The Rhythm Boys" [...] were born. The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success. A year touring with Whiteman performing and recording with musicians Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang and Hoagy Carmichael, provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> escapades of the three men during this period and clearly they were living life to the full. Despite all of this, Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer. He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio.|$|E
2500|$|The Tour of Ireland was a cycling stage {{race that}} was run in Ireland between 1953 and 1984. It was {{organised}} originally by the Cumann Rothaíochta na hÉireann (CRE) which was later renamed the Federation of Irish Cyclists. In 1953 the Irish Government initiated An Tóstal, a cultural festival, and asked all Irish sporting bodies to participate. As {{part of this}} the CRE ran a four-day Tour of Ireland. With sponsorship from An Tostal, Aspro and Hercules cycles, the event {{was known as the}} Tostal Tour and was a big success throughout most of the country, although it was said to have [...] "had a hard time in the NCA heartlands of Kerry" [...] There is limited information about the race available on the internet and no book <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> event. The inaugural edition was a 4-day race won by Brian Haskell from John Perks and A Walker. Seamus Elliot who later won a stage and wore the yellow jersey in the 1963 Tour de France finished tenth overall. Briton Brian Robinson who also won a stage in the Tour de France finished fifth in this first edition. According to Alf Buttler, an amateur cyclist during and after the second world war the leader’s jersey was purple and the race continued but as a seven-day race the following year, 1954, beginning on Thursday 29 April. The 1954 race was covered by J B Wadley and photographer Bill Lovelace for The Bicycle magazine and a full report appeared in the 5 May issue. Bernard Pusey (England A team) won from Seamus Elliott (Ireland A team) and Tony Hoar (England B team). According to , an Irish cycling club from Bray, Wicklow, the event continued until 1957 when it stopped but was revived in 1965. During the seventies the race was known as the Raleigh Dunlop Tour of Ireland. The event continued to 1984. Winners during this period include Doug Dailey (1971, 1973), Liam Horner (1972), a double Olympian, Tony Lally (1974), a 1980 Olympian and the youngest ever winner at age 20, Pat McQuaid (1975, 1976), former UCI President, Angel Arroyo (1977), runner up in 1983 Tour de France, John Shortt (1978) and Ron Hayman (1979) who was followed home by Phil Anderson, Stephen Roche and Robert Miller in 2nd, 3rd and 4th.|$|E
60|$|XXXVIII. Now, why {{it should}} be that color is best seen under these {{circumstances}} I will not here endeavor to determine; nor whether the lesson we are to learn from it be that it is God's will that all manner of delights should never be combined in one thing. But the fact is certain, that color is always by Him arranged in these simple or rude forms, and as certain that, therefore, it must be best seen in them, and that we shall never mend by refining its arrangements. Experience teaches us the same thing. Infinite nonsense <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> union of perfect color with perfect form. They never will, never can be united. Color, to be perfect, must have a soft outline or a simple one: it cannot have a refined one; and you will never produce a good painted window with good figure-drawing in it. You will lose perfection of color as you give perfection of line. Try to put in order and form the colors {{of a piece of}} opal.|$|E
