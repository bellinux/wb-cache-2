Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National <b>Formulary</b> in the United States and United Kingdom.

In {{this study we}} explore the composition of 3, 346 <b>formularies</b> in terms of outpatient prescription coverage, medication class coverage, and cost implications. Our analysis revealed that 42 % of <b>formularies</b> are duplicative and that the unique <b>formularies</b> contain variability for medications that contribute little in terms of cost or overall use. These results lead us to believe the number and complexities of <b>formularies</b> can be dramatically reduced leading to more intuitive decision support for physicians when writing prescriptions...|$|R
40|$|Several {{states have}} enacted {{restrictive}} drug <b>formularies</b> {{in order to}} control the costs of their Medicaid pharmaceutical programs. This study investigates the restrictiveness of these <b>formularies</b> by analyzing the delay in approving new drug products for Medicaid reimbursement. A restrictiveness index is developed which relates the drug product months which are denied to Medicaid patients to the potential product months of availability if all products which were newly approved for general use were simultaneously made available to the Medicaid population. The study then relates the restrictiveness of state <b>formularies</b> to Medicaid drug program costs and to total Medicaid program costs. We find that restrictiveness of <b>formularies</b> is not associated with lower drug costs, but that total Medicaid costs are lower in states with more restrictive <b>formularies.</b> We suggest that restrictive <b>formularies</b> may occur in states with other Medicaid cost-containment measures, so that total Medicaid exoenditures are contained in those states, even though there is no reduction in drug expenditures. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{financial}} {{accessibility of}} antimicrobial drugs to the outpatient community in Canada is governed at the provincial level through <b>formularies.</b> Each province {{may choose to}} list particular drugs or impose restriction criteria on products in order to guide prescribing and/or curtail costs. Although changes to <b>formularies</b> {{have been shown to}} change patterns in the use of individual products and alter costs, no comparison has been made among the provincial antimicrobial <b>formularies</b> with regards to flexibility/stringency, or an assessment of how these <b>formularies</b> impact overall antimicrobial use in the provinces. Objectives: To summarize provincial antimicrobial <b>formularies</b> and assess whether their relative flexibility/stringency had a statistical impact upon provincial prescription volume during a one year period. Methods: Provincial drug plan <b>formularies</b> were accessed and summarized for all prescribed antimicrobials in Canada during 2010. The number of general and restricted benefits for each plan was compiled by antimicrobial classification.

Since the VHA provides healthcare directly, it maintains its own <b>formulary</b> and negotiates prices with manufacturers. Studies show that the VHA pays dramatically less for drugs than the PDP plans Medicare Part D subsidizes. One analysis found that adopting a <b>formulary</b> similar to the VHA’s would save Medicare $14 billion a year (over 10 years the savings would be around $140 billion).|$|E
30|$|The {{methodology}} {{used for}} building the PDE list {{began with an}} inventory of the available drug <b>formularies</b> used in nursing homes in Alsace.

40|$|Background Biological {{medicines}} {{are starting}} to lose their patent protection, so similar, inexact copies (biosimilars) are being developed and licensed. The high acquisition costs of biologics for healthcare providers could be reduced by switching to biosimilars, thus alleviating budgetary pressures and increasing patient access. Therefore, the acceptance of biosimilars by prescribers in Great Britain (GB; England, Scotland, Wales) needs to be described and understood. Objective To determine uptake of {{the first wave of}} biosimilars (somatropin, epoetin, filgrastim) by local <b>formularies</b> (lists of preferred medicines for prescribing in local healthcare settings). Settings This study targeted local <b>formularies</b> in GB. Method In November 2014, local <b>formularies</b> (medicines <b>formularies</b> of Acute Trusts and Health Boards in GB) were screened for their approach to listing of biologics and their biosimilars as well as recommendations on usage of these pharmaceuticals. Main Outcomes Measures Listing frequencies of biosimilars. Results One hundred and forty-six British local <b>formularies</b> were screened. Amongst the 80 % of <b>formularies</b> in which brand names were specified, biosimilar filgrastim was the most frequently listed when compared to the other targeted biosimilars. Biosimilars were listed in preference to reference biologic medicine in 49 % of local <b>formularies</b> for filgrastim, 11 % for somatropin and in only 6 % for epoetin. Conclusion Although the market for biosimilars can act in parallel to the generic market, their uptake measured using local British <b>formularies</b> was less than what is expected given that the British market for medicines has a strong focus on generics. Finally, geographical variability within GB requires further investigation...|$|R

25|$|The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is {{a central}} {{component}} of the Australian healthcare system. The scheme provides reimbursement to community pharmacy for the costs of dispensing prescription medicines prescribed {{in accordance with the}} PBS Schedule, a comprehensive but closed <b>formulary.</b> Drugs are added to the <b>formulary</b> on the basis of an assessment of comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness compared to the therapy most likely to be replaced in practice.

25|$|Pharmacy {{professionals}} have extensively studied {{the causes of}} errors in the prescribing, preparation, dispensing and administration of medications. As {{far back as the}} 1930s, pharmacists worked with physicians to select, from many options, the safest and most effective drugs available for use in hospitals. The process is known as the <b>Formulary</b> System and the list of drugs is known as the <b>Formulary.</b> In the 1960s, hospitals implemented unit dose packaging and unit dose drug distribution systems {{to reduce the risk of}} wrong drug and wrong dose errors in hospitalized patients; centralized sterile admixture services were shown to decrease the risks of contaminated and infected intravenous medications; and pharmacists provided drug information and clinical decision support directly to physicians to improve the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmacists are recognized experts in medication safety and have made many contributions that reduce error and improve patient care over the last 50 years. More recently, governments have attempted to address issues like patient-pharmacists communication and consumer knowledge through measures like the Australian Government's Quality Use of Medicines policy.|$|E

50|$|Most generic {{drugs are}} {{available}} on <b>formularies,</b> except in cases where that class of drugs are no longer considered safe and efficacious.

These interesting documents, including the <b>formularies,</b> have been collected and edited by Göller in [...] "Die papstliche Poenitentiarie bis Eugen IV." [...] (Rome, 1907).|$|R
25|$|The British National <b>Formulary</b> {{recommends}} a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Joanne Moncrieff {{has suggested that}} the withdrawal process might itself be schizo-mimetic, producing schizophrenia-like symptoms even in previously healthy patients, indicating a possible pharmacological origin of mental illness in a yet unknown percentage of patients currently and previously treated with antipsychotics, but the limited evidence was found to support this hypothesis for antipsychotics other than clozapine.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{and the treatment}} of an overdose are largely {{the same as for}} the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National <b>Formulary</b> notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. Alternative agents, SSRIs and SNRIs, are safer in overdose, though they are no more efficacious than TCAs. English folk singer Nick Drake died from an overdose of Tryptizol in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The British National <b>Formulary</b> {{recommends}} a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. While withdrawal symptoms can occur, {{there is no}} evidence that tolerance develops to the drug's antipsychotic effects. A patient can be maintained for years on a therapeutically effective dose without any decrease in effectiveness being reported. Tolerance appears to develop to the sedating effects of chlorpromazine when it is first administered. Tolerance also appears to develop to the extrapyramidal, parkinsonian and other neuroleptic effects, although this is debatable.|$|E
25|$|This anticlericalism was {{not left}} unanswered.

Possibly by Voetius also, but in any case by someone close to him, was the Resurrected Barnevelt, in which the anonymous writer, writing in Dutch, attacked the provincial-supremacy doctrine and the prayer <b>formulary</b> as an insidious attempt to make the other six provinces subservient to Holland. To which possibly De Witt himself replied with a scalding pamphlet, entitled Schotschen Duyvel in which he denounced Voetius by name as a master-mutineer.|$|E
25|$|Telepharmacy is the {{delivery}} of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where {{they may not have}} direct contact with a pharmacist. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine, as implemented in the field of pharmacy. Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for prescription drugs, and monitoring of <b>formulary</b> compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.|$|E
