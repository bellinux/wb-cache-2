5|$|Orientalism {{proposed}} that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, {{meant for the}} self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E

5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E
5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> {{remains of a}} plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on {{the eastern edge of}} the Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> {{upper and lower}} jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks {{could be used to}} crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Roman times, a new Roman mythology {{was born}} through syncretization of {{numerous}} Greek {{and other foreign}} gods. This occurred because the Romans had little mythology of their own, and inheritance of the Greek mythological tradition caused the major Roman gods to adopt characteristics of their Greek equivalents. The gods Zeus and Jupiter are {{an example of this}} mythological overlap. In addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions, the association of the Romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations. For instance, the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian's successful campaigns in Syria. The Asiatic divinities Mithras (that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> Sun) and Ba'al were combined with Apollo and Helios into one Sol Invictus, with conglomerated rites and compound attributes. Apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with Helios or even Dionysus, but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments. The traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice. The worship of Sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{sentiment}} analysis aims {{to determine the}} attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).|$|E

A connector with ground terminal is described as having more wires than poles, e.g. two-pole, three-wire; or four-pole, five-wire; etc. A non-grounding device may be two-pole, two-wire; three-pole, three-wire; etc.|$|E
25|$|That <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> {{principles}} of dramaturgy {{to be observed}} in writing {{a particular type of}} Sanskrit drama are completely ignored by an author of Attakkatha. Delineation of a particular rasa is an inevitable feature with Sanskrit drama, whereas in an Attakkatha all the predominant rasas are given full treatment, and consequently the theme of an Attakkatha often loses its integrity and artistic unity when viewed as a literary work.|$|E
25|$|During this period, a {{sense of}} a Sicilian people and nation emerged, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} was no longer divided between Greek, Arab and Latin peoples. Catalan was the language of the royal court, and Sicilian was the language of the parliament and the general citizenry. These circumstances continued until 1409 when because of failure of the Sicilian line of the Aragonese dynasty, the Sicilian throne became part of the Crown of Aragon.|$|E

In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi.
