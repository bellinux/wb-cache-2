5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a <b>family</b> <b>room</b> containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs.

The majority of freshman males live in Dominic Hall, while most freshman females reside in either Joan of Arc Hall (commonly referred to as JOA) or Baroody Hall. Dominic Hall is a freshman dorm, located adjacent to the Coffee Shop and in close proximity to Alumni Hall and Bradley House. Dominic Hall houses over 205 students, offering mostly doubles, very few singles and several [...] "quads", or four-person rooms. Dominic is affectionately nicknamed [...] "Dirty Dom"; however, new lights, windows, doors and ceiling tiles have been installed and the custodial staff cleans the hallways and communal bathrooms five days a week. Joan of Arc is a female freshman residence hall where double-type rooms predominate. However, freshmen may be placed in any residence hall on campus. The Lowers are located near the NHIOP at the bottom of Saint Anselm Drive; these apartments were built in the mid-1990s and have a kitchen, one and a half bathrooms, a <b>family</b> <b>room</b> and bedrooms. A similar setup is available in Uppers; however, these dorms are slightly newer and are the favorite of seniors because they are located closer to central campus. Traditionally, residence halls have been single sex, though this began to change in the 2007–2008 academic year, when Brady Hall had female residents on its third floor while the bottom two floors were male. Hilary, Bertrand and Brady Halls are some of the largest on campus, as they can house over 120 students each.

40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>rooms</b> in {{hospitals}} are clinical-free spaces away from children 2 ̆ 7 s wards to support families of hospitalised children. This publication outlines {{a plan to}} review the literature about hospital <b>family</b> <b>rooms,</b> including economic costs and benefits, and {{the impact on the}} wellbeing of children, families and hospital staff. Introduction Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) Australia is commissioning research to build an evidence base on the value of their support program for families with seriously ill children. This project is a review of the Australian and international literature on the role, alternatives to, and value of Ronald McDonald <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms,</b> including their economic costs and benefits, and impact on the wellbeing of children, families and the hospital. <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> are ‘clinical-free spaces’ that aim to offer support to families with children who are hospitalised, outpatients or undergoing same day surgery, by providing services, for example kitchen and laundry facilities, and embracing an approach to care that focuses on the family as a whole (family-centred care). The review will report on existing evidence from all relevant fields, including child, family, health care and service system perspectives, in order to draw evidence-based practice implications {{about the ways in which}} <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> and their alternatives can have a positive impact on families’ and children’s wellbeing and health care effectiveness. Central to the success of the review is the identification of all relevant national and international studies, comparing relevant findings, interventions and research methodologies across different settings and disciplines, and building on the research findings of current and previous RMHC Global research. The findings of the literature review will be complemented by summaries of routinely collected administrative data on the use of the <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> in Australia. They will inform the development of RMHC investment strategies and research program and be of interest across different communities of research and practice that operate family-centred programs and require evidence of their effectiveness, for example government, nongovernment and private providers. RMHC is a quasi-federated organisation with a national body and local House Chapters that support families with seriously ill children via a suite of programs, of which the <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> are a key strategic priority. A unique feature of the RMHC structure lies in the corporate relationship with McDonalds Australia Ltd (McDonalds). As McDonald’s preferred charity, RMHC receives significant funding from the corporation. <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> reflect an approach to care that focuses on the family as a whole. When a child is admitted into hospital, the whole family is affected, rendering a need for the impact of the child 2 ̆ 7 s admission on all family members to be considered by the hospital, nurses, and doctors. 2 ̆ 7 Family-centred care 2 ̆ 7 (FCC) is an approach to paediatric health care founded on the belief children’s and families’ wellbeing are best achieved by involving the whole family in the plan of care, enabling them to meet the needs of their child. Although there is no agreed definition of FCC in the literature, there is a growing agreement on the principles that inform FCC, in particular, information sharing, respect and dignity, partnership and collaboration, negotiation, and care in the context of family and community. These principles qualify FCC as the main theoretical framework within which to investigate and understand the function of <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> in Australia and internationally. This review will explore the available evidence on the role, alternatives to, and value of <b>Family</b> <b>Rooms</b> from the perspectives of all parties involved, i. e. the children and their families, House Chapters, volunteers, hospital staff members and main stakeholders, and with reference to a wide range of health and wellbeing outcomes and their relevance in relation to FCC and support. This approach will enable RMHC to identify best practices, understand how support can be best delivered to families and children and contribute to the international evidence base...|$|R
