5|$|Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 {{and lasted}} about {{one and a}} half years. The game was {{unveiled}} at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game, and developer tri-Ace was hired to help with the game's design, art, and programming. The development team wanted to exceed Final Fantasy XIII <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> while making the story's tone mysterious and darker than the previous game. The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used in Final Fantasy XIII and includes a less linear overall design.|$|E

5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|The Compsognathus {{specimen}} {{discovered in}} Germany in the 19th century featured only two digits on each forelimb, leading scientists {{to conclude that}} this was how the creature appeared in life. However, the fossil discovered later in France revealed the manus (hands) to have had three digits, similar to other members of compsognathid genera. The fossilization of the German Compsognathus had simply failed to preserve the specimen's hands completely. Bidar supposed that the French specimen had webbed hands, which would look like flippers in life. In the 1975 book The Evolution and Ecology of the Dinosaurs, L. B. Halstead depicts the animal as an amphibious dinosaur capable of feeding on aquatic prey and swimming {{out of reach of}} larger predators. Ostrom debunked this hypothesis by showing conclusively that the French specimen was nearly identical to the German specimen <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> but its size. Peyer confirmed these conclusions.|$|E

5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, she was involved <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone {{to be used by}} a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{were outraged}} by {{the attack on the}} factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 Arab {{merchant}} ships at anchor in the harbor. Around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire. Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement. The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa. Moreover, the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish. The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices. The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> of the trade. The letter from King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut, which was translated by the ruler's Arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of Arab traders. The Muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods, and attempted to sway the Hindu ruler against the Portuguese. The Portuguese and Arabs were extremely suspicious of each other's every action.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> of life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded {{throughout the history of}} Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and {{it can be argued that}} this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} flag of Ecuador, {{which consists of}} horizontal bands of yellow (double width), blue and red, was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 {{with the addition of}} the coat of arms {{in the center of the}} flag. Before using the yellow, blue and red tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect,</b> but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.|$|E
