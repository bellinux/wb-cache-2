25|$|As {{the term}} alphasyllabary suggests, abugidas have been {{considered}} an intermediate step between alphabets and syllabaries. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from abjads (vowelless alphabets).

Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese hiragana syllabary: か ka, き ki, く ku, け ke, こ ko <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> to indicate k; while ら ra, り ri, る ru, れ re, ろ ro have neither anything in common for r, nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the k set.|$|E

500|$|Further {{allegations}} that Elizabeth used racist slurs {{to refer to}} black people were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess. Major Burgess was the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, a mixed-race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales's Household of racial abuse. Queen Elizabeth made no public comments on race, but according to Robert Rhodes James in private she [...] "abhorred racial discrimination" [...] and decried apartheid as [...] "dreadful". Woodrow Wyatt records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non-white countries <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with [...] "us", she told him, [...] "I am very keen on the Commonwealth.

500|$|Several English and American {{paintings}} including The Death of Major Pierson by John Singleton Copley (1738–1815)—also painted {{within two}} years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: Watson and the Shark (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like The Raft of the Medusa, concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782 (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault's work; and [...] (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition. A further important precedent for the political component was the works of Francisco Goya, particularly his The Disasters of War series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece The Third of May 1808. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply Shipwreck (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with The Raft of the Medusa.

2500|$|Its final {{redaction}} probably {{belongs to}} the end of the 4th century, but the individual scholars who brought it to its present form cannot be fixed with assurance.

The two terms for taking interest, [...] "neshekh" [...] (interest), and [...] "tarbit" [...] (increase), used in (...) are explained and illustrated by examples (ch. v. 1–10). According to the Mishnah [...] "the lender, who takes interest, the borrower who pays it, the witnesses, the security, and the clerk who writes the document, are all guilty of having broken the law concerning interest" [...] (ch. v. 11).

2500|$|Due to {{the notoriety}} {{surrounding}} how {{the band was}} signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him.

2500|$|According to his {{promoter}} Cisek, Theodorescu-Sion's organic {{treatment of}} nature emanates from [...] "the fundamental law" [...] of Romania's ancient folk arts, namely: [...] "man does not master surrounding nature; he grows from the stony and craggy soil [...] like plants, like trees, like animals." [...] This, Cisek argues, was {{the revelation of}} a true artistic expression of the Romanian soul, opposed to the idyllic canvasses of Impressionist master Nicolae Grigorescu, but akin to the Poporanist prose of Calistrat Hogaș. In 1926, he assessed: [...] "It has been said—and many among the artistically illiterate continue to repeat as much to this day—that only Grigorescu's art can ever be Romanian, and that Theodorescu-Sion's painting can <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with the substance of our soil. [...] tomorrow perhaps, [...] may find himself able to overturn skeptical impressions and theories". Cisek depicts Sion as Romania's [...] "best connoisseur of artistic techniques", with a [...] "sovereign mastery", locating him {{at the opposite end}} from post-Grigorescu official art. Sion's understanding of national specificity, he argues, had nothing in common with the [...] "mulligan" [...] traditionalism of Octav Băncilă and Kimon Loghi: [...] "if Mr. Loghi is a painter, then Teodorescu-Sion must surely be something else entirely! One should bear in mind that Mr. Teodorescu-Sion is still developing, whereas 'Master' Loghi has reached his summit. The summit of mediocrity." [...] Contrarily, Nichifor Crainic, who was a Grigorescu aficionado, posthumously described Sion as Grigorescu's one equal; however, he noted, Sion bowed to commissions, and as such never produced an actual masterpiece.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Hanson has {{appeared}} {{to reject the}} term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column [...] "Hillary's Neoliberals" [...] that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the Cold War. Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for Hillary Clinton as preferable to Donald Trump on grounds that Clinton {{has a long history}} of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as [...] "neoliberals" [...] who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 as opposed to converting to conservatism. [...] Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America — the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton. Hanson wrote: [...] "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the other side of the aisle than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS, and the New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio, and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and Brent Scowcroft, and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties." ...|$|E
