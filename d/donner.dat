An 1847 story printed in the California Star described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party, reporting that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen <b>Donner,</b> but after interviewing Keseberg he concluded that no murder occurred.

5|$|The <b>Donner</b> Party, or Donner-Reed Party, was a {{group of}} American pioneers led by George <b>Donner</b> and James F. Reed who set out for California in a wagon train in May 1846. They were delayed by a series of mishaps and mistakes, and spent the winter of 1846–47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the pioneers resorted to {{cannibalism}} to survive.|$|E
5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the <b>Donner</b> Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary <b>Donner</b> suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac <b>Donner,</b> Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating human flesh.

At {{the rear of the}} train, a group of nine wagons {{containing}} 32members of the Reed and <b>Donner</b> families and their employees left on May12. George <b>Donner,</b> born in North Carolina, had gradually moved west to Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, with a one-year sojourn to Texas. In early 1846, he was about 60 years old. With him were his 44-year-old wife Tamsen and their three daughters Frances (6), Georgia (4), and Eliza (3), and George's daughters from a previous marriage: Elitha (14) and Leanna (12). George's younger brother Jacob (56) also joined the party with his wife Elizabeth (45), teenaged stepsons Solomon Hook (14) and William Hook (12), and five children: George (9), Mary (7), Isaac (6), Lewis (4), and Samuel (1). Also traveling with the <b>Donner</b> brothers were teamsters Hiram O. Miller (29), Samuel Shoemaker (25), Noah James (16), Charles Burger (30), John Denton (28), and Augustus Spitzer (30).|$|E

Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob <b>Donner.</b> Inside the tent, Elizabeth <b>Donner</b> refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen <b>Donner</b> was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E

For this purpose, fourteen ruminal and duodenal fistulated dairy cows were fed a diet containing 60 % concentrate with a wheat portion of 55 % (Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat [mycotoxin period] or control wheat [control period]) and ration was completed with maize- and grass silage (50 : 50) on a DM basis. Daily <b>DON</b> intakes ranged from 16. 6 up to 75. 6 mg in the mycotoxin period at DM intakes of 5. 6 up to 20. 5 kg. <b>DON</b> was almost completely biotransformed to de-epoxy <b>DON</b> (94 - 99 %) independent of the DON/feed intake, and the flow of <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> at the duodenum related to <b>DON</b> intake ranged between 12 and 77 % when the Fusarium toxin contaminated wheat was fed. In the serum samples, de-epoxy <b>DON</b> was detected in the range of 4 up to 28 ng/ml in the mycotoxin period, while concentrations of <b>DON</b> were all below the detection limit. The daily excretion of <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> in the milk of cows fed the contaminated wheat varied between 1 and 10 µg and 14 and 104 µg, respectively. The total carry over rates as the ratio between daily excretion of <b>DON</b> and de-epoxy <b>DON</b> into milk and <b>DON</b> intake were in the range of 0. 0001 up to 0. 0002 and 0. 0004 up to 0. 0024, respectively.

Quantification of viable cells, apoptotic and necrotic cells indicate following toxicity ranking: <b>DON</b> 3 G << 3 ADON < <b>DON</b> ≈ 15 ADON. For the in vivo part, cross-over animal trials were performed with intravenous and oral administration of <b>DON</b> 3 G and <b>DON</b> to broiler chickens and pigs.

Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to unravel phase II metabolism of <b>DON.</b> Data were processed via tailor-made compartmental toxicokinetic models. The results in broiler chickens indicate that <b>DON</b> 3 G is not hydrolysed to <b>DON</b> in vivo. Furthermore, the absolute oral bioavailability of <b>DON</b> 3 G in broiler chickens was low (3. 79 ± 2. 68 %) and comparable to that of <b>DON</b> (5. 56 ± 2. 05 %).
