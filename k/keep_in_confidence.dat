This study examined the factors that influence trust in a group of student housing professionals at a large public university. Eight participants were asked in interviews to define trust in the workplace and to discuss what factors influenced their ability to trust. Data analysis suggests that in this group of professionals, trust is influenced by three factors: predictability, competency, and positive intent. Predictability is determined by four sub-themes: consistency of word and deed, directness, knowledge/relationship, and confidentiality. Consistency of word and deed involves showing a consistency between our words and actions. It also involves the sending of a consistent message regardless of the audience or situation. The ability of others to be direct with us helps to increase predictability because {{there is no need to}} guess how they feel about us as a person or about our work. Participants varied to the extent that they mentioned the need for a friendship or relationship with their co-workers. All seem to indicate that some basic knowledge of the other person is required for trust to be established. How co-workers handle confidentiality also influences the development of trust according to this group of participants. For trust to develop, it seemed to be important to some that they had a clear idea of what information co-workers would <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>confidence</b> and what information the co-workers would share with others. Being predictable did not seem sufficient to establish trust in the workplace for these volunteers. They also wanted their co-workers to effectively share the work load. Subordinates hoped supervisors were effective advocates. Peers wanted each other to "do his/her part. " Each of the participants in this study expressed how demanding their work was and how much effort it took. For trust to develop, co-workers needed to be able to contribute or at least show they were willing to put forth an appropriate effort. Participants indicated they trusted co-workers more when the co-worker seemed to be motivated by a desire to help the work group or to serve the students who lived in the residence halls...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{ever-increasing}} court {{congestion and}} contemporary policy favoring {{the resolution of}} disputes outside the courtroom, {{now more than ever}} a privilege for communications with an ombudsman is needed. Although statistics demonstrate that an ombudsman can quickly and effectively resolve disputes, courts have been inconsistent in recognizing such a privilege. This failure to consistently recognize a privilege for communications with an ombudsman places practicing ombudsmen in a catch- 22. Ombudsmen are left to decide between disregarding standards of practice they have sworn to follow, most notably that ombudsmen <b>keep</b> communications <b>in</b> <b>confidence,</b> on the one hand, or of violating a court order requiring disclosure of the communications made to the ombudsman, on the other. Recognizing an ombudsman privilege will eliminate this dilemma without unduly impeding access to evidence, as an ombudsman privilege is merely a different embodiment of privileges and rules of evidence already in effect...|$|R
50|$|Taos {{speakers}} {{have historically}} been reluctant to provide linguists with language data {{to work with and}} have preferred to keep their language secret from outsiders. G. Trager had to work with his consultants <b>in</b> private and <b>keep</b> their identities <b>in</b> <b>confidence.</b> The tendency for secrecy is a continuing general Pueblo reaction starting in the 17th century in large part due to the oppressive persecution (including public executions and torture) of Pueblo religious practices by the colonial Spanish. The Taos community has been particularly guarded about revealing their language (and culture) to outsiders when compared with other eastern pueblos in New Mexico. Due to secrecy practices, the details of language preservation are not known outside of the community.|$|R
40|$|Each {{company has}} trade {{strategies}} {{that should not}} be known by other parties; therefore, Trade Secret is necessary to protect them. Trade secret emerges from an agreement between employees and company, one of which is by implementing Non-Competition Clause in that agreement. This article accordingly discusses how the implementation of Non-Competition Clause and the legal consequence of the implementation of Non-Competition Clause as the form of trade secret protection. Regarding the issue discussed in this paper, the result shows that the implementation of Non-Competition Clause in employment agreement must be conducted based on Trade Secret Law which causes legal consequence like employees prohibitions as an effort to <b>keep</b> their commercial <b>in</b> <b>confidence.</b> However, the implementation of Non-Competition Clause has not been effectively implemented for there is no detailed explanation in the agreement resulting in the different clause interpretation between company and employees. Therefore, it is necessary to have separated and detailed regulation concerning Non-Competition Clause in the employment agreement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Information {{and theory}} beyond copula {{concepts}} {{are essential to}} understand the dependence relationship between several marginal covariates distributions. In a therapeutic trial data scheme, most of the time, censoring occurs. That {{could lead to a}} biased interpretation of the dependence relationship between marginal distributions. Furthermore, it could result in a biased inference of the joint probability distribution function. A particular case is the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), which has shown its utility in many medico-economic studies and where censoring often occurs. Methods This paper discusses a copula-based modeling of the joint density and an estimation method of the costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALY) in a cost-effectiveness analysis in case of censoring. This method is not based on any linearity assumption on the inferred variables, but on a punctual estimation obtained from the marginal distributions together with their dependence link. Results Our results show that the proposed methodology keeps only the bias resulting statistical inference and don’t have anymore a bias based on a unverified linearity assumption. An acupuncture study for chronic headache in primary care was used to show the applicability of the method and the obtained ICER <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> the <b>confidence</b> interval of the standard regression methodology. Conclusion For the cost-effectiveness literature, such a technique without any linearity assumption is a progress since it does not need the specification of a global linear regression model. Hence, the estimation of the a marginal distributions for each therapeutic arm, the concordance measures between these populations and the right copulas families is now sufficient to process to the whole CEA...|$|R
