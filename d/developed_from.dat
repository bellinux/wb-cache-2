5|$|During the season, three hurricanes <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> five named storms. This {{was below}} {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and {{represented}} the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|Poole {{is made up}} of {{numerous}} suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Poole as the town grew.|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} clockmakers {{came from the}} guilds of locksmiths and jewellers. Clockmaking <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.|$|E
25|$|Serous carcinomas may <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, {{rather than}} <b>developing</b> spontaneously <b>from</b> ovarian tissue. Other carcinomas <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> {{cortical}} inclusion cysts, which are groups of epithelial ovarian cells inside the stroma.|$|R
50|$|Hymenoptera largely {{reproduce}} through facultative parthenogenesis, where haploid males <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> unfertilized eggs (arrhenotoky) and diploid females <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> fertilized eggs.|$|R

5|$|A {{community}} centre was built alongside the council chambers in 1982, adjoining the library. The entire council complex was upgraded first in 1996, {{together with an}} upgrade of the Burnside Swimming Centre. The Burnside Village shopping complex was <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> circa 1980 with further upgrades taking place in 2001, resulting in a modern library and {{community centre}} for residents.|$|E
50|$|Haplodiploidy is a sex-determination {{system in}} which males <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> unfertilized eggs and are haploid, and females <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> fertilized eggs and are diploid. Haplodiploidy is {{sometimes}} called arrhenotoky.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} plant with amphicarpy, one fruit type is {{underground}}. These underground fruits usually <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> self-pollinating flowers. The fruits that <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> the aerial flowers may often {{be the result}} of cross-pollination.|$|R
5000|$|A mixed {{language}} {{is different from}} a creole language. Creoles are thought to <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> pidgins as they become nativized. Mixed languages <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> situations of code-switching. (See the distinction between code-mixing and pidgin above.) ...|$|R
5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|Aang's {{character}} was <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, depicting a bald {{man with an}} arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into {{a picture of a}} child with a flying bison. Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Continuity-based {{theories}} {{are held by}} a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Delores <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> a {{tropical}} wave which moved from Africa to the Atlantic on June 7. And {{it was not}} until June 22 when it gained organization and was identified as an area of disturbed weather south of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, pilot of the B-29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped the Fat Man nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. During his tenure, the wing <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> a rather new unit to {{the mainstay of}} air defense in the Northeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|Twins are two {{offspring}} {{produced by}} the same pregnancy. Twins can be either monozygotic ("identical"), meaning that they <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic ("fraternal"), meaning that they <b>develop</b> <b>from</b> two different eggs. In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Michelle <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> a {{tropical}} wave that {{moved across the}} Atlantic, and formed into {{a tropical}} depression on October 29. Convection increased, and the system formed into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, reaching its peak strength as a Category 4. One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|On October10, another {{tropical}} depression formed {{further to the}} north of the previous storm. It possibly <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> the same tropical wave that spawned the previous depression, although they were not the same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October12.|$|E

5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> sources {{including}} medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, {{at the moment when}} she has been shot in the eye. He referred to the still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Several modern {{organizations}} {{of various sizes}} claim to follow the tenets of Thelema. The two most prominent are both organizations that Crowley headed during his lifetime: the A∴A∴, an Order founded by Crowley, based on the grades of the Golden Dawn system; and Ordo Templi Orientis, an order which initially <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> the Rite of Memphis and Mizraim {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and which includes Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica as its religious arm.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they <b>developed</b> <b>from</b> thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the pink fungus stages showed that among the five stages, cobweb stage is the most important, since this stage may form the other four stages. I. Cobweb stage, develops following the germination of either basidiospores or conidia both on exposed and shaded side of branches. II. Pseudonodular stage, <b>develops</b> <b>from</b> symphogenous aggregation of cobweb stage mycelia {{on the surface of}} lenticel or cracks on shaded bark. III. Teleomorph, develops in two ways: a. Teleomorph incrustation <b>develops</b> <b>from</b> cobweb stage mycelia through four layers: basal layer, intermediate layer, subhymenial layer, and hymenial layer; b. Teleomorph pustule, <b>develops</b> <b>from</b> pseudonodular stage, through four layers, mirror to teleomorph incrustation. IV. Nodular stage, <b>develops</b> <b>from</b> meristogenous aggregation of cobweb stage mycelia on exposed bark. V. Anamorph, develops in two ways: a. From nodular stage; b. From cobweb stage mycelia on exposed bark...|$|R
