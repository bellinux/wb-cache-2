5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their <b>initial</b> <b>month</b> was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E

500|$|In September 2010 he {{went out}} on another month's loan, this time to League One club Walsall, where he had spent time as a junior. The Birmingham Mail {{reported}} that on his debut, in a defeat at Rochdale, he had [...] "a quiet first half but showed some impressive touches {{in the second period}} and fitted well into Walsall's 4–3–3 formation." [...] His captain, Darren Byfield, [...] "thought David was superb. Usually when you have players who love to tackle and get in your face, they can't use the ball– but he was playing balls around the corners and off the strikers. You can see already he's not one of those who come from the Premiership thinking 'what am I doing here?' He's listening to people and his attitude is superb." [...] He played the whole of Walsall's six matches during his <b>initial</b> <b>month,</b> apart from the last 15 minutes against Swindon Town when he was stretchered off with an injured ankle. The first five of those sixfour losses and a drawsaw Walsall drop from 13th place to bottom of the table, and, again according to the Mail, Davis [...] "did as well as can be expected from a 19-year-old pitched into a team in freefall". The loan was extended for another month, but because Wolves had injury problems, manager Mick McCarthy included a clause allowing them to recall him at 24 hours notice if they needed him. Davis played just once more for Walsall before he was recalled. With three first-team midfielders unavailable, McCarthy included him on the bench for Wolves' Premier League visit to Chelsea; he remained unused.|$|E
