25|$|Because Joe {{purchased}} the land believing {{that there would}} be access to the bridge and the driveway and Joe then paid for a house and a connection, Joe can be said to rely on Ray's promise of an easement. Ray materially misrepresented the facts to Joe. In order to preserve equity, the court will likely find an <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if Ray had offered {{access to the}} bridge and {{driveway}} after selling Joe the land, {{there may not be}} an <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>estoppel.</b> In this instance, it is merely inconvenient if Ray revokes access to the driveway. Joe did not purchase the land and build the house in reliance on access to the driveway and bridge. Joe will need to find a separate theory to justify an easement.|$|E
25|$|For example: Ray sells land to Joe on {{the promise}} that Joe can use Ray's {{driveway}} and bridge to the main road at any time, but Ray {{does not include the}} easement in the deed to the land.

2500|$|There is also {{an unwritten}} form of {{easement}} referred to as an implied <b>easement</b> or <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> implication, arising from the original subdivision of the land for continuous and obvious use of the adjacent parcel (e.g., for access to a road, or to a source of water) such as the right of lot owners in a subdivision to use the roadway on the approved subdivision plan without requiring a specific grant of easement to each new lot when first conveyed. An <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> necessity is distinguished from an <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> implication in that the <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> necessity arises only when [...] "strictly necessary", whereas the <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> implication can arise when [...] "reasonably necessary". <b>Easement</b> <b>by</b> necessity is a higher standard by which to imply an easement.|$|R

25|$|When a {{property}} owner misrepresents {{the existence of}} an easement while selling {{a property}} and does not include in the deed to the buyer an express easement over an adjoining property that the seller owns, a court may step in and create an easement. Easements by estoppel generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an <b>easement</b> <b>by</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
