25|$|Productive {{behavior}} {{is defined as}} employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E

Kanye spits about his presence being a present to us all, Jay-Z comes through with what might be his strongest verse in years, and that's where Nicki comes in, more than holding her own against the bad boys." [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal reported that Minaj gave the verse of her life, and applauded the contributions by Ross, who added a [...] "hallucinatory tone" [...] to the song.

He started by hugging Bobby Rush (who had been upset that Jackson's wife was being positioned for Rush's seat when Rush had been ill earlier in the year) and then he hugged Debbie Halvorson, who as been at odds with him over the proposed airport.

500|$|Duke {{received}} a mostly positive reception from music critics. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke noted that [...] "Turn It On Again" [...] is [...] "vibrant rock & roll" [...] {{and thought that}} [...] "Man of Our Times", [...] "Duchess", [...] "Duke's Travels", and [...] "Duke's End" [...] "possess a refreshing urgency". Fricke points out the band's losses without Gabriel and Hackett in the line-up, yet summarised Duke as [...] "comforting: a reassurance that Genesis aren't for an exodus yet." [...] Sounds Hugh Fielder gave the album four stars out of five, enjoying the opening of [...] "Behind the Lines" [...] and considering Collins's vocals to be [...] "more convincing than ... before". He felt the first side {{was better than the}} second, and criticised some lyrics, but concluded [...] "no Genesis fan could be disappointed". The Los Angeles Times Steve Pond described the album's music as [...] "identifiably Genesis, but it is toned-down" [...] and a [...] "a more confident and successful album than ...And Then There Were Three...". He criticised the album as inconsistent with a lack of [...] "melodic invention" [...] on side one, but thought [...] "Duke's Travels" [...] and [...] "Duke's End" [...] were [...] "one of the best and most consistent pieces of music that band <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> some time".|$|E
500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] is a downtempo {{hip-hop and}} pop song, that {{opens with a}} [...] "simple piano intro" [...] and a [...] "delicate vocal verse from Skylar Grey". It was written by Diddy, Skylar Grey, Jay-Z, J. Cole, and Alex [...] "da Kid" [...] Grant, and {{produced}} by Jay-Z and Grant. When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat {{that makes me feel}} like a white man in a basement in Atlanta". Diddy later called [...] "Coming Home" [...] a gift from Jay-Z and Kid. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by EMI Music Publishing, the song was written in the key of D major with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 69 beats per minute. It follows the basic chord progression of GDBmFm. [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy's life, [...] "referencing mistakes he <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the past and that he wants to put behind him." [...] Rodriguez also noted the song's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G, in the line [...] "I miss you, B.I.G." [...] The chorus features vocals from the group's female members, Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard, as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie. The trio use a vocal range of A3A4. Grey also sings some of the vocals, predominately during the song's opening chorus.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone staff writer Keith Harris gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "like Neil Young at his most deliberately despondent, Pearl Jam sound purposefully tired."

[...] Q gave the album three out of five stars. The review called the album [...] "An adult rock record in which nuance succeeds over bombast." ...|$|E
500|$|A Girl in Every Port is {{considered}} by film scholars {{to be the most}} important film of Hawks's silent career. It is the first of his films to utilize many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first [...] "love story between two men," [...] with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. Hawks wrote the original story and developed the screenplay with James Kevin McGuinness and Seton Miller. In the film Victor McLaglen and Robert Armstrong play two merchant seamen who are archrivals when it comes to women, with McLaglen constantly finding Armstrong's tattoo on the women that he is attempting to seduce. Eventually the two rivals become friends. Louise Brooks plays the cabaret singer with whom the two men fall in love. The film was shot from October to December 1927 and released in February 1928. It was successful in the US, and a hit in Europe where Louise Brooks was developing a cult following. In France, Henri Langlois called Hawks [...] "the Gropius of the cinema" [...] and Swiss novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars said that the film [...] "definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema." [...] Hawks went over budget once again with this film, though, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "This is the worst picture Fox <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> years." ...|$|E
500|$|The free-associative [...] "Champion" [...] is {{primarily}} composed of motivational lyrics, but West also briefly {{touches on the}} strained relationship he had with his father–who divorced from his mother {{when he was just}} three-years-old–eventually reaching the conclusion that even with their ups and downs, in the end, his father was a champion in his eyes. West described [...] "Stronger" [...] as an [...] "emancipation", as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the past. He describes his tribulation's with music critics and media causing his return as a [...] "Stronger" [...] rapper, as the song title implies. [...] "I Wonder" [...] carries an introspective tone, retaining a chorus about finding one's dreams, while West uses the verses to describe the struggle a person experiences in determining the meaning behind their life and achieving those dreams. Inspired by watching Bono open stadium tours, West concentrated on speaking volumes without using too many words on the song and delivers his raps in an exuberant, staccato manner. Using the same vocal stylings, [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] tells the operatic narrative of man contemplating the complexities of a tragic relationship. [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothing" [...] serves as West's reflection on his fame and is characterized by bitter remorse and defiant self-awareness. West begins the song by expounding his conflicted feelings regarding wealth and desire, describing a compulsion to spend that overwhelms any and all other objectives in life. He ties this into his perceived overall inability to keep himself together even as he grows into an increasingly prominent figure in the public eye.|$|E
