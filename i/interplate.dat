5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from {{earthquakes}}: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and <b>interplate</b> earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than <b>interplate</b> seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Cape Mendocino {{earthquakes}} (or 1992 Petrolia earthquakes) occurred {{along the}} Lost Coast of Northern California on April 25 and 26. The three largest events were the M7.2 thrust mainshock that struck near the unincorporated community of Petrolia midday on April 25 and two primary strike-slip aftershocks measuring 6.5 and 6.6 that followed {{early the next}} morning. The sequence encompassed both <b>interplate</b> and intraplate activity that {{was associated with the}} Mendocino Triple Junction, a complex system of three major faults (including the Cascadia subduction zone, San Andreas Fault, and Mendocino Fracture Zone) that converge near Cape Mendocino. The total number of aftershocks that followed the events exceeded 2,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (<b>interplate)</b> Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
25|$|Most of the foreshocks are <b>interplate</b> {{earthquakes}} with thrust-type focal mechanisms. Both <b>interplate</b> and intraplate earthquakes {{appeared in}} the aftershocks offshore Sanriku coast with considerable proportions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main types of fault, {{all of which}} may cause an <b>interplate</b> earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal and reverse {{faulting}} are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is {{in the direction of}} dip and movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where {{the two sides of the}} fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia {{is largely}} seismically stable with no modern history of {{volcanic}} activity, being situated {{entirely on the}} Sunda tectonic plate, between two major boundaries of the Australian Plate and Eurasian Plate in the west of Peninsular Malaysia, and the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate at Borneon Malaysia. While Peninsular Malaysia is more accustomed to only light tremors caused by quakes along the Sumatran islands of Indonesia generated predominantly by the Great Sumatran fault and Sunda megathrust, the Borneon states, particularly Sabah, is at risk of more moderate <b>interplate</b> and intraplate earthquakes as a byproduct of its closer proximity to active tectonic activities from the Ring of Fire, with record earthquakes in the country occurring {{in the state in}} 1976 and 2015 at an average of 6.0 Mw. As is with Singapore, the effects of tremors are also felt more significantly on skyscrapers common in populated centres in Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|Earthquakes in Ecuador {{stem from}} two major interrelated tectonic areas: the {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and the [...] Andean Volcanic Belt. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which {{were created by}} the subduction of the [...] Carnegie Ridge. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shock waves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both [...] <b>interplate</b> and intraplate seismicity.|$|E
500|$|Earthquakes {{are common}} in Ecuador. Near the Nazca {{subduction}} zone the recorded history of [...] <b>interplate</b> earthquakes spans 80years. At the time it struck the 1949 Ambato earthquake was the second-worst earthquake in Ecuador's modern history topped only by the 1797 Riobamba earthquake, and the most devastating earthquake in the Western Hemisphere since the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Several major earthquakes have occurred throughout the country since 1949, including the [...] 1987 Ecuador earthquakes and the 1997 Ecuador earthquake. The 2007 Peru earthquake also affected the country.|$|E
500|$|North of the Mendocino Triple Junction, the Gorda {{plate is}} subducting beneath the North American Plate at the Cascadia {{subduction}} zone, with a convergence rate of [...] per year, but comparisons with other subduction zones {{have led to}} a belief that the convergence may be taking place aseismically. The distinct lack of <b>interplate</b> events there has generated contention regarding the zone's seismic hazard, though there are strong indications that substantial historic events have occurred in the Pacific Northwest. Submerged wetlands and raised marine terraces both illustrate the presence of past events, and radiocarbon dating of rock layers has revealed that three seismic events took place in the last 2,000 years, with the most recent event being the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The Gorda Plate is undergoing a process of intraplate deformation and experiences large intraplate earthquakes that {{may be the result of}} north-south compression of the oceanic crust along the Mendocino Fracture Zone.|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by a rupture along the Abiz Fault, part of the Sistan suture zone of eastern Iran. Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block. Most of Iran is contained on one microplate, causing seismic activity mainly along its borders. Both the 1968 Dasht-e-Bayez earthquake (magnitude 7.3, resulting in 12,000–20,000deaths) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike-slip faults, meaning that the crustal blocks {{on either side of the}} faults shifted against each other horizontally. The Qayen earthquake {{was caused by}} right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault. In addition to the dominant strike-slip displacement, there was also local evidence of reverse faulting. The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop, more consistent with an <b>interplate</b> earthquake than an intraplate event. The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6.9 meters per second—nearly three-quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall—and occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. The crustal layer involved in the rupture was [...] thick. The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake's magnitude. There were at least 155aftershocks, reaching a magnitude of up to 5.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to [...] below the surface.|$|E
50|$|Most of the foreshocks are <b>interplate</b> {{earthquakes}} with thrust-type focal mechanisms. Both <b>interplate</b> and intraplate earthquakes {{appeared in}} the aftershocks offshore Sanriku coast with considerable proportions.|$|E
50|$|This {{earthquake}} {{was located}} near the junction of the Kuril Trench and the Japan Trench. It is an <b>interplate</b> earthquake. The focal mechanism of this earthquake shows movement on a thrust fault with a considerable slip-strike component. The sum of <b>interplate</b> seismic moment release by seismic and aseismic faulting in this earthquake is about 28×1020 N m. The 1960s was noted {{as one of the}} peak periods of <b>interplate</b> seismic moment release in the offshore Sanriku region.|$|E
50|$|<b>Interplate</b> {{earthquakes}} {{differ from}} intraplate earthquake in {{the intensity of}} stress drop which occurs after the quake. Intraplate earthquake have, on average, more stress drop {{than that of the}} <b>interplate</b> earthquake. <b>Interplate</b> earthquakes also differ fundamentally from intraplate earthquakes in the way stress is released and recovered. An <b>interplate</b> earthquake results in an immediate stress drop along the fault. Following this is a period of postseismic stress restoration. This restoration occurs quickly within the first few decades following the rupture and is due to tectonic loading and viscous relaxation in the lower crust. This results in a transfer of stress to the upper crust. Later on, a period of steady stress increase occurs due to tectonic loading.|$|E
50|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from {{earthquakes}}: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and <b>interplate</b> earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than <b>interplate</b> seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
50|$|An intraplate {{earthquake}} {{occurs in the}} interior of a tectonic plate, whereas an <b>interplate</b> earthquake is one that occurs at a plate boundary.|$|E
50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the region of the Middle America Trench. It was an <b>interplate</b> earthquake. It had a reverse faulting focal mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The 9 April 1985 {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the same fault area as the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, and is considered by University of Chile Seismological Service a thrust fault-type <b>interplate</b> earthquake.|$|E
50|$|This was an <b>interplate</b> {{earthquake}} {{between the}} Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. In this region, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate. The subduction interface around this region include the Nankai Trough and the Ryukyu Trench.|$|E
50|$|This {{earthquake}} {{was located}} {{close to the}} 1939 Chillán earthquake. However, the focal mechanism of the 1953 Concepción earthquake was reverse faulting, while that of the 1939 Chillán earthquake was normal faulting. It was {{not clear whether the}} 1953 Concepción earthquake was an <b>interplate</b> or intraplate earthquake.|$|E
50|$|This {{was one of}} the {{recurring}} <b>interplate</b> earthquakes at the offshore Miyagi with a recurrence interval of about 37 years. Although not officially named by the Japanese Meteorological Agency, in Japanese, this earthquake is commonly known as 1936年宮城県沖地震 (Sen-kyūhyaku-sanjūroku-nen Miyagi-ken-oki Jishin) or 1936年金華山沖地震 (Sen-kyūhyaku-sanjūroku-nen Kinkasan-oki Jishin).|$|E
50|$|The {{rupture zone}} of the 1978 {{earthquake}} occurred at the westernmost limit of known <b>interplate</b> earthquakes, some 150 km back from the trench. This deepest part of the rupture zone, about 40 km, is interpreted to represent the depth of transition to aseismic creep on the plate interface.|$|E
50|$|This {{earthquake}} is Canada's largest historic onshore earthquake. However, {{the greatest}} earthquake in Canadian history recorded by seismometers was the 1949 Queen Charlotte earthquake, an <b>interplate</b> earthquake that {{occurred on the}} ocean bottom just off the rugged coast of Graham Island, which reached magnitude 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale.|$|E
50|$|The <b>interplate</b> {{earthquake}} {{began in}} the ocean bottom just off the rugged coast of Graham Island. It ruptured along the Queen Charlotte Fault both northward and southward more than 500 km. Shaking was felt throughout British Columbia, parts of Washington, Oregon, Alberta, the Yukon, and Alaska. No deaths were reported in this earthquake.|$|E
50|$|An <b>interplate</b> {{earthquake}} is {{an earthquake}} that {{occurs at the}} boundary between two tectonic plates. Earthquakes of this type {{account for more than}} 90 percent of the total seismic energy released around the world. If one plate is trying to move past the other, they will be locked until sufficient stress builds up to cause the plates to slip relative to each other. The slipping process creates an earthquake with land deformations and resulting seismic waves which travel through the Earth and along the Earth's surface. Relative plate motion can be lateral as along a transform fault boundary or vertical if along a convergent subduction boundary or a rift at a divergent boundary. At a subduction boundary the motion is due to one plate slipping beneath the other plate resulting in an <b>interplate</b> thrust or megathrust earthquake, which are the most powerful earthquakes.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Subducting plate {{geometry}} and the kinematically defined <b>interplate</b> zones. The locked zone {{is the most}} shallow where the two plates are locked together, the transient slip zone is downdip of the locked zone and {{is the site of}} SSEs, and the stable slip zone is where the two plates are continuously slipping at their interface.|$|E
50|$|The 1963 Su-ao {{earthquake}} {{occurred on}} February 13 at 16:50 local time (08:50 UTC). The epicenter was located {{off the coast}} of Taiwan, near Su-ao, Yilan County. It had a magnitude of Mw 7.3. Three people were reported dead. A landslide occurred in the Su-ao-Hualien highway. The earthquake showed a weakly coupled <b>interplate</b> boundary in the nearby region.|$|E
50|$|Megathrust {{earthquakes}} {{occur at}} subduction zones at destructive convergent plate boundaries, where one tectonic plate is forced underneath another. These <b>interplate</b> earthquakes are the planet's most powerful, with moment magnitudes (Mw) that can exceed 9.0. Since 1900, all earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater have been megathrust earthquakes. No {{other type of}} known terrestrial source of tectonic activity has produced earthquakes of this scale.|$|E
50|$|Intraplate {{earthquakes}} {{are relatively}} rare. <b>Interplate</b> earthquakes, which occur at plate boundaries, are more common. Nonetheless, very large intraplate earthquakes can inflict heavy damage, particularly because such areas are {{not accustomed to}} earthquakes and buildings are usually not seismically retrofitted. Examples of damaging intraplate earthquakes are the devastating Gujarat earthquake in 2001, the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes, the 1811-1812 earthquakes in New Madrid, Missouri, and the 1886 earthquake in Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
50|$|Earthquakes in Ecuador {{stem from}} two major interrelated tectonic areas: the {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and the Andean Volcanic Belt. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which {{were created by}} the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shock waves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both <b>interplate</b> and intraplate seismicity.|$|E
50|$|For earthquakes, it {{all starts}} with an {{embedded}} penny-shaped crack as first envisioned by Brunehttp://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1987/A1987J040600001.pdf. As illustrated, an earthquake zone may start as a single crack, and grow to form many individual cracks, and collections of cracks along a fault. The key to fault growth {{is the concept of}} a ‘following force’, as conveniently provided for <b>interplate</b> earthquakes, by the motion of tectonic plates. Under a following force, the seismic displacements eventually form a topographic feature, such as a mountain range.|$|E
50|$|Earthquakes {{are common}} in Ecuador. Near the Nazca {{subduction}} zone the recorded history of <b>interplate</b> earthquakes spans 80 years. At the time it struck the 1949 Ambato earthquake was the second-worst earthquake in Ecuador's modern history topped only by the 1797 Riobamba earthquake, and the most devastating earthquake in the Western Hemisphere since the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Several major earthquakes have occurred throughout the country since 1949, including the 1987 Ecuador earthquakes and the 1997 Ecuador earthquake. The 2007 Peru earthquake also affected the country.|$|E
50|$|From the Cretaceous period {{until about}} 29 {{million years ago}} (29 Ma), the oceanic Farallon Plate subducted eastward beneath {{the west coast of}} the North American Plate. The arrival of the Pacific-Farallon {{spreading}} center at the trench formed two triple junctions that migrated in opposite directions, northward and southward, along the coast. This stopped subduction and formed an <b>interplate</b> transform boundary. The southward-migrating triple junction passed San Quintín about 17 Ma and tip of Baja around 12 Ma, ending subduction in the Baja peninstula.|$|E
50|$|This {{earthquake}} is {{the strongest}} event recorded in the Hyūga-nada Sea region. The maximum slip {{was estimated to be}} 4 m. It was estimated that, in the Hyūga-nada Sea region, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7.6 occur with a period of about 200 years, while earthquakes with magnitudes about 7.1 occur with a period of about 20 to 27 years. It has been pointed out that there is a tendency of occurrence of inland earthquakes in Kyushu before and after large <b>interplate</b> earthquakes in the Hyūga-nada Sea region.|$|E
50|$|This {{earthquake}} was an <b>interplate</b> earthquake {{between the}} Cocos Plate and the North American Plate. It {{occurred in the}} Colima region of the Middle America Trench. This earthquake {{was very close to}} where the 1973 Colima earthquake occurred. From the locally recorded time intervals between the arrival of the S wave and the P wave (S-P times) and from the felt intensities, it is suggested that the rupture zone of this earthquake was larger than the 1973 earthquake and may have extended into the rupture zone of the 1985 Michoacán earthquake.|$|E
50|$|This was an <b>interplate</b> earthquake, with a low-angle {{reverse fault}} focal mechanism, which {{ruptured}} {{part of the}} plate interface. The region of the largest slip in this earthquake coincides with the region of low seismic moment release in the 1968 Offshore Tokachi earthquake on May 16, 1968, implying that the 1994 Offshore Sanriku earthquake completed the incompleted fault slip in the source region of the 1968 Offshore Tokachi earthquake. The average slip of the fault {{was estimated to be}} 0.4 m and the maximal slip about 1.2 m.|$|E
5000|$|The 1965 Oaxaca {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} Mexico on August 23 at [...] with a moment magnitude of 7.5. Five people were reported dead in Mexico City and 1 in Oaxaca. There was an anomalous change in seismic activities before the earthquake. There was a quiescent stage from late 1963 to mid-1964, {{and it was}} followed by a renewal of seismic activities before the main shock. This earthquake was a shallow thrust earthquake in the <b>interplate</b> subduction zone, in which the Cocos Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate.|$|E
