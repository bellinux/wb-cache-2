40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} has not econometrically, for countries with non-developed financial markets, estimated the impact domestic credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality or the impact income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account. Based {{on a very}} comprehensive panel data set, which includes 152 different countries, we econometrically estimate the impact changes in domestic credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality {{as well as the}} impact changes in income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account. Based on the econometric results in this paper, we are able to identify that the impact credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality goes in opposite directions depending on if the financial market is developed or non-developed. Moreover, we were able to estimate the positive effects increased income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account for countries with non-developed financial markets, a result previous research only has estimated theoretically...|$|R

5|$|An EastEnders {{spokesperson}} {{stated that}} programme-makers {{were working in}} close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively, commenting that the show aims {{to raise awareness of}} real-life issues, and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence, rape and HIV. John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue. Sara Nathan of The Sun reported that the story had been planned since the previous year, and would begin with Whitney worrying about Tony's release from prison and the effect it would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> her family.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions <b>have</b> <b>on</b> depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

5|$|Betty {{has gained}} weight {{over the past}} few months, causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline. This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty goes to the doctor's office in an attempt to obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to offset}} the impact that the tour would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the environment, Music for Relief and {{environmental}} non-profit Rewerb promoted greener touring practices such as recycling throughout the venue, free water stations for refillable bottles, reusable products and carpooling incentives. Touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. Non-profit organizations Love Hope Strength and HeadCount joined the tour for select dates.|$|E
5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it {{was considered to be}} the greatest football game ever played. The game further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the prevalence of the sport.|$|E

5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses <b>have</b> <b>on</b> agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
