Bizarrely, the British release, with considerable airplay of [...] "Giving it All Away" [...] (first lines [...] "I paid all my dues so <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> shoes, I {{got up and walked}} away") coincided with news reports of The Who being sued for unpaid damage to their hotel on a recent tour, including a TV set being thrown out of the window.|$|E
2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. I had discovered that publicly performing my own work placed me in an exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe now that I was basically uncommitted to my work and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions. [...] I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked. [...] When the audience and my peers turned on me, <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> marbles and went home. [...] I just decided to stop making work.|$|E

But here also the vile vinchucas found me, and there were, moreover, dozens of fleas that waged a sort of guerilla warfare all night, and in this way exhausted my strength and distracted my attention, while the more formidable adversary took up his position. My sufferings were so great that before daybreak <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> rugs and went out a distance from the house to lie down on the open plain, but I carried with me a smarting body and got but little rest.

6000|$|My own ticket {{was given}} me at once, and an oldish man, who {{preserved}} {{his head in}} the midst of this turmoil, got my baggage registered, and counselled me to stay quietly where I was till he should give me the word to move. I had taken along with me a small valise, a knapsack, which I carried on my shoulders, and in the bag of my railway rug the whole of [...] "Bancroft's History of the United States" [...] in six fat volumes. It was as much as I could carry with convenience even for short distances, but it insured me plenty of clothing, and the valise was at that moment, and often after, useful for a stool. I am sure I sat for an hour in the baggage-room, and wretched enough it was; yet, when at last the word was passed to me, and <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> bundles and got under way, it was only to exchange discomfort for downright misery and danger.|$|E
60|$|To lie in {{wait for}} me now {{would mean that the}} {{creature}} had appreciated what had happened to me, and this in turn would argue some power connecting cause and effect. Surely it was more likely that a brainless creature, acting solely by vague predatory instinct, would give up the chase when I disappeared, and, after a pause of astonishment, would wander away in search of some other prey? I clambered {{to the edge of the}} pit and looked over. The stars were fading, the sky was whitening, and the cold wind of morning blew pleasantly upon my face. I could see or hear nothing of my enemy. Slowly I climbed out and sat for a while upon the ground, ready to spring back into my refuge if any danger should appear. Then, reassured by the absolute stillness and by the growing light, I took my courage in both hands and stole back along the path which I had come. Some distance down it <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> gun, and shortly afterwards struck the brook which was my guide. So, with many a frightened backward glance, I made for home.|$|E
