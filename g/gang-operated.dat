High-voltage switches are available for the highest transmission voltages, up to 1 million volts. This switch is <b>gang-operated</b> so that all three phases are interrupted at the same time.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of an oxide core destructive test {{program at the}} Spert I reactor facility are reviewed. The proposed experimental program of destructive tests on a low-enriched oxide core, the experimental results of nondestructive transient tests that were obtained on the test core and the extrapolation of these results to the destructive case, {{an analysis of the}} hazards involved in performing such destructive tests, and {{a detailed description of the}} reactor facility and environmental conditions are presented. The supervision and control of personnel during and after each destructive test, and of the plans for reentry, cleanup, and restoration of the facility are discussed. The water- moderated core that will be used for these experiments is mounted in the Spert I open-type reactor vessel, which has no provision for pressurization or forced coolant flow. The core is comprised of approximately 600 4 %-enriched UO/sub 2 / fuel rods clad with stainless steel, and four blade-type, <b>gang-operated</b> control rods for reactor control. Reactor transients are initiated at ambient temperature by step-insertions of reactivity, using for this purpose a special control rod that can be quickly ejected from the core. On the basis of the results obtained from previous nondestructivelkinetic tests, an analysis was made to determine the nature of the results to be expected for an assumed 1. 8 - sec- period test in which tetal core destruction occurs. An evaluation of hazards involved in conducting the 1. 8 -msec test, based on conservative assumptions regarding fission product release and weather conditions, indicated that with the procedural controls normally exercised in the conduct of any transient test at Spert and the special controls to be in effect during the destructive test series, no significant hazard to personnel or to the general public will be incurred.
