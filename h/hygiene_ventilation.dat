40|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} of pathogens is recognised {{as a potential}} transmission route for hospital acquired infections, however {{little is known about}} the link between health care worker (HCW) contacts’ with contaminated surfaces, the transmission of infections and hospital room design. We combine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of bioaerosol deposition with a validated probabilistic HCW-surface contact model to estimate the relative quantity of pathogens accrued on hands during six types of care procedures in two room types. Results demonstrate that care type is most influential (p< 0. 001), followed by the number of surface contacts (p< 0. 001) and the distribution of surface pathogens (p= 0. 05). Highest hand contamination was predicted during Personal care despite the highest levels of hand <b>hygiene.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> rates of 6 ac. h− 1 vs 4 ac. h− 1 showed only minor reductions in predicted hand colonisation. Pathogens accrued on hands decreased monotonically after patient care in single rooms due to the physical barrier of bioaerosol transmission between rooms and subsequent hand sanitation. Conversely, contamination was predicted to increase during contact with patients in four-bed rooms due to spatial spread of pathogens. Location of the infectious patient with respect to ventilation played a key role in determining pathogen loadings (p= 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Data {{show that}} between the years 1998 and 2006 an {{estimate}} of more than 14, 000 occupational injuries associated with the horse-racing industry were treated in U. S. hospital emergency rooms. Further, between 1992 and 2006, 79 deaths occurred to those working in this industry. These numbers are almost certainly underestimates of the true numbers. The data demonstrate that jockeys {{are not the only}} workers exposed to hazards in this industry. Trainers, grooms, exercise riders, and various others encounter many of the same hazards as jockeys, and it is important that these occupations have the same health and safety protections, for example, wearing safety vests and helmets when in close proximity with horses. The true risk for injuries in this industry cannot be properly evaluated without sustained data collection {{over an extended period of}} time, including collecting data on the number of workers in this industry and the injuries and fatalities that occur. It is not within the scope of current national surveillance systems to collect data to the detail necessary to accurately capture these injuries. Furthermore, without appropriate denominator data, injury rates cannot be calculated. The calculation of injury rates would allow for meaningful comparisons to workers in other industries. In order to accurately collect these data, a standardized injury report form could be created to collect critical information about injury incidents. This information could then be recorded and maintained in a centralized database. The development of such a system would allow for meaningful analyses to determine the etiology of injury in the United States for this industry. Northern California has implemented a system where track-side Board of Stewards provide independent reports on the purported cause, final reported status, and outcomes of injuries to jockeys. Other states could use the Northern California system as a model for their own horse racing injury surveillance. The variation of regulations between states creates an additional complication for worker safety and health. Safety and health concerns could be more easily managed if regulations were more synchronized among states. This would help improve health and safety requirements and PPE use regulations. To be competitive in this sport, jockeys must be vigilant in maintaining a low body weight. To keep a minimum weight, jockeys often resort to weight-reducing techniques, commonly known in the industry as 'wasting' and 'flipping. ' These techniques pose a hazard to a jockey's long-term health. These activities may also lead to more immediate hazards if a jockey is dehydrated or otherwise not fit to ride. Representatives in other sports where weight can be an issue, like wrestling, have examined alternatives to weight requirements for keeping athletes healthy, such as minimum body fat requirements [NFHS 2006]. These alternatives should be evaluated for relevance in the horse-racing industry. Also, providing some form of health and nutritional education to jockeys would be prudent. Many opportunities exist for research regarding worker safety and health in the horse-racing industry and injury prevention. The possibility for lead exposure should be quantitatively assessed. If it is found that the exposure limits exceed current standards, this hazard could be remedied either by using an alternative to lead weights, such as weighted pads, or by encapsulating all lead weights. An evaluation of the effect of silica or synthetic fibers on the respiratory health of workers also is needed. The potential benefits of synthetic surfaces for the well-being of the horse should be weighed against possible respiratory ailments that jockeys and horses may suffer. As with all emerging safety and health issues, NIOSH will do its best to continue monitoring the health and safety of these workers. An effort on the part of horse-racing industry representatives (race tracks, racing commissions, and horse owners) can be taken to lessen the many hazards faced by workers in the horse-racing industry. However, the responsibility to improve the safety and health of employees in this industry lies among all participants. Below are some measures for consideration. Industry Representatives (Race Tracks, Racing Commissions, and Horse Owners) : 1. Make safety and health issues a part of the everyday, decision-making processes (e. g., whether races are held, conditions for canceling a race, assessments of a jockey's fitness to ride); 2. Work with jockeys and other professional associations to ensure adequate insurance and support for injured workers, while encouraging primary injury prevention practices; 3. Assess the health implications of the current weight requirements and options for adjusting weights consistently in consultation with health experts; 4. Develop and maintain a track-, state-, or corporate-level monitoring system to collect data on workers and their injuries and illnesses, which could serve as a model for developing a national-level surveillance system; 5. Develop standards for quality on-track and off-track medical care for all facilities that include the use of staff certified in Advanced Cardiac Life Support and adequate medical equipment; 6. Explore workplace and jockeys' room conditions with the intent of developing criteria for design, safety, <b>hygiene,</b> <b>ventilation,</b> and habitation; 7. Integrate the safety of both humans and animals into the design of equipment and facilities (e. g., padded starting gates and safety rails); 8. Support independent scientific inquiry into the dynamic health status of workers in the horse-racing industry; and, 9. Develop and provide appropriate education, consultation, referral, and treatment for jockeys regarding eating and weight control issues. Jockeys: 1. Become educated about proper nutrition and consider healthy alternatives for weight management; 2. Wear PPE and ensure that it is properly fitted and in good condition; and, 3. Work with industry representatives and professional associations to ensure appropriate support and follow up for injured workers, while encouraging primary injury prevention practices. Professional Associations: 1. Promote the safety and health of jockeys and other race track staff by working with industry representatives; 2. Work with industry representatives and jockeys to ensure appropriate support and follow up for injured workers; 3. Work with industry representatives to ensure adequate on-track and off-track medical care is available at all facilities; 4. Work with industry representatives to develop criteria for safe, clean jockeys' rooms; and, 5. Support industry representatives and jockeys in the development of appropriate education, consultation, referral, and treatment for eating and weight control issues. Other Race Track Workers: 1. Become educated and trained in safety issues relevant to work responsibilities; 2. Consider wearing PPE (e. g., helmets and vests) when in the vicinity of a horse; and, 3. Work with industry representatives and professional associations to ensure appropriate support and follow up for injured workers, while encouraging primary injury prevention practices.

40|$|Scabies is {{a common}} skin disease among {{students}} (Santri) of Qoran schools (Pondok Pesantren). It is caused by infestation of mite of Sarcoptes scabiei that spreads easily from human to human, from animal to animal or from human to animal vice versa. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure prevalence of Scabies disease and to analyse environmental sanitation factors influencing the prevalence of Scabies among students of Qoran schools in regency of Lamongan, East Java. This study was designed as a cross-sectional observational study, carried out in 12 dormitories of Qoran schools across Lamongan regency, East Java, in October 2003 until June 2004. The total population was 59. 650 students with 338 student samples taken by a multistage random sampling method. The environmental sanitation factor included dormitory sanitation, personal hygiene, and health behaviour. Association of each parameter of these variables with the prevalence of Scabies was analysed by using Chi-square statistical test. All parameters significantly associated with the prevalence of Scabies were put together for statistical analysis purposes of Multiple Logistic Regression. The results showed that most of Qoran schools including dormitories had poor sanitation, personal hygiene, and health behaviour. The prevalence of Scabies among students of Qoran schools was high i. e. 48. 81 %, and sanitation factors influenced the disease were bedroom sanitation, personal <b>hygiene,</b> room <b>ventilation,</b> and unsanitary behaviour (Multiple Logistic Regression, all p< 0. 05). It is concluded that environmental sanitation factors influencing the prevalence of Scabies among students of Qoran schools are bedroom sanitation, personal <b>hygiene,</b> room <b>ventilation,</b> and unsanitary behaviour. It is suggested to school management to put more effort for personal hygiene and environmental sanitation such as better water supply, improvement of bedroom and bathroom sanitation, reducing population density of dormitory, and to establish standard procedure with tight monitoring of dormitory sanitation, personal hygiene and healthy behaviour.

30|$|This {{utilisation}} {{concept is}} designed primarily for interventional endovascular or percutaneous procedures. The abdominal cavity is only opened {{in case of}} an emergency. The room ventilation system was implemented without a laminar airflow (LAF) system. The angiography system interferes with the LAF to the point that a low turbulence suppression flux cannot be achieved. The same is true when additional devices, such as a C-arm, are brought into a regular OR. An LAF ventilation system is only required for aseptic procedures with a particularly high risk of infection [12 – 16]. Such high-risk procedures are not planned in our utilisation concept. If a serious adverse event occurs in the angiosuite (e.g., conversion to an open AAA repair), the open operation is done directly on the angiography table in the angiosuite. It should be noted at this point that from a hygiene point of view LAF cannot be warranted in any room concept if an x-ray device is used. In December 2009, the German Commission for the Prevention of Infection and Hospital <b>Hygiene</b> downgraded LAF <b>ventilation</b> systems to the category of “unresolved questions". Thus, it is likely that in the future even procedures with an increased risk of infection (e.g. implantation of hip prostheses) will not require LAF.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In Pakistan, {{the reports}} on benzene {{exposure}} among workers in chemical industries are almost non-existing due to limited research {{work in the}} field of exposure science. This study aimed to investigate such exposure in a widely adopted occupation in Rawalpindi city. Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 blood samples (N = 20 /group) of mechanics (MCs), spray painters (PNs) and control participants (CN) were analyzed. The socio-economic and demographic information of workers and that of workplaces was documented using a short questionnaire. Results: We identified that the workers in spray-painting occupation are highly at risk of benzene exposure. The results showed that PNs were more at risk of exposure to benzene than MCs, and this exposure was significantly correlated with long working hours (r = 0. 68, p < 0. 001). Moreover, there are several limitations in workplace setups, which need to be addressed in order to mitigate workers health risk in this occupation. In addition to the reckless use of chemicals, other identified predictors of exposure included active and passive smoking, poor workplace <b>hygiene</b> and substandard <b>ventilation.</b> Conclusions: To mitigate workplace exposure, it is necessary to reduce working hours and encourage regular use of self-protective equipments and adoption of proper hygiene in chemical workplaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Routine {{exposure}} to chemical contaminants in workplace {{is a cause}} for concern over potential health risks to workers. In Pakistan, reports on occupational exposure and related health risks are almost non-existent, which reflects the scarce availability of survey data and criteria for determining whether an unsafe exposure has occurred. The current study was designed to evaluate blood naphthalene (NAPH) levels as an indicator of {{exposure to}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among automobile workshop mechanics (MCs) and car-spray painters (PNs). We further determined the relationship between blood NAPH levels and personal behavioural, job related parameters and various environmental factors that may further be associated with elevated risks of occupational exposures to PAHs. Methods Sixty blood samples (n = 20 for each group i. e. MC, PN and control group) were collected to compare their blood NAPH levels among exposed (MCs and PNs) and un-exposed (control) groups. Samples were analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data regarding demographic aspects of the subjects and their socioeconomic features were collected using a questionnaire. Subjects were also asked to report environmental hygiene conditions of their occupational environment. Results We identified automobile work areas as potential sites for PAHs exposure, which was reflected by higher blood NAPH levels among MCs. Blood NAPH levels ranged from 53. 7 to 1980. 6 μgL - 1 and 54. 1 to 892. 9 μgL - 1 among MCs and PNs respectively. Comparison within each group showed that smoking enhanced exposure risks several fold and both active and passive smoking were among personal parameters that were significantly correlated with log-transformed blood NAPH levels. For exposed groups, work hours and work experience were job related parameters that showed strong associations with the increase in blood NAPH levels. Poor workplace <b>hygiene</b> and <b>ventilation</b> were recognized as most significant predictors related to differences among workplaces that may enhance the extent of exposure to chemical contaminants. Conclusions It appeared that chemical exposure at the workplace may be influenced by multiple environmental factors, but poor workplace hygiene and duration of exposure (long work hours) were the most important factors. Smoking and negligence of workers regarding self protection were among some of the important personal behaviours than can be addressed with better training. There is also a need to improve workplaces hygiene and to rationalize work hours to minimize health risks. Since smoking was an important confounding factor that supplemented most of the actual occupational exposure, a study based on non-smoker subjects is needed to separate out the effects of smoking and other confounding factors that may obscure measurements of actual extent of occupational exposure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives : A {{national}} plan {{of management}} for flu-like illnesses {{was developed by the}} Saudi Ministry of Health after the first outbreak in Saudi Arabia in June. We describe the clinical presentation of the H 1 N 1 cases attending King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) between July through September 2009 and identify the high-risk age groups. Methods : All patients presenting with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in the H 1 N 1 clinics during the specified period were clinically examined and tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Those who were clinically diagnosed and confirmed positive for novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) were included in the study. Results : Over a 6 -week period, 117 cases of laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in KKUH with a mean (SD) age of 19. 6 (16. 7) years, of whom 72 (62. 1 &#x 0025;) were males. Most reported cases were Saudis (n= 99, 85. 3 &#x 0025;); 94 (81 &#x 0025;) had no travel history outside the country; 100 (86. 2 &#x 0025;) had had no contact with an H 1 N 1 -identified patient; 33 &#x 0025; were aged 5 - 14 years and 28. 4 &#x 0025; were aged 15 - 29 years. The most commonly reported symptoms were fever in 99 (85. 3 &#x 0025;), cough in 9 (81 &#x 0025;), runny nose (33. 6 &#x 0025;) and sore throat (21. 3 &#x 0025;). All 117 cases were confirmed positive using real time RT-PCR testing. Thirty-one cases (26 &#x 0025;) were admitted and 22 of those (71 &#x 0025;) recovered after receiving oseltamivir. Two deaths were attributed to the 2009 pandemic. One patient died of chronic pulmonary disease. The other cause of death was unknown.

40|$|Bovine Respiratory Disease, or BRD, {{are common}} in young cattle {{in the first year}} of life but occurs mainly before 6 months. A peak of {{incidence}} is noticed between 2 - 10 weeks, due to a decline of immunity. BRD is associated with the well-known shipping-fever that may come from cumulative stress. This condition can reach 5 - 20 % case fatality rate and a morbidity rate up to 100 %. Most of the time, the treatment administered is effective. In other cases, a relapse within 2 weeks, associated or not with mortality, can be observed. BRD induces economic losses with treatments (antibiotics), prevention (vaccination) and mortalities. There are also zootechnical consequences with growth retardation, circulation of infectious agents, and increased sensitivity to other pathogens. Cattle are more susceptible to BRD for many reasons. They have narrow upper airways that increase air speed and allow a deeper colonization of particles in the lower respiratory tract. There is also a link between the digestive and respiratory system in bovines. Inhalation of eructation gaz occurs regularly. The respiratory tract in cattle is more sensitive to endotoxins. In case of rumen acidosis, a paralysis of the mucociliary escalator is observed. Finally, cases such liver abscess or Vena Cava Caudale thrombosis, a metastatic pneumonia can follow. BRD often begins with virus attack, which may be complicated with surroundings bacterial infections. Among the different viral aetiologies, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (B-RSV), Parainfluenza virus (PI- 3), Bovine Herpes Virus (BHV- 1 or IBR), Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVD, for its immunosuppression effect) are the most frequent encountered. Adenovirus and Coronavirus, BHV- 4, Rhinovirus, Reovirus, and Enterovirus can also be present, in a lesser extent. Among bacteriological causes, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Trueperella pyogenes, and Mycoplasma bovis (dispar) are commonly met. Chlamydophila and Salmonella dublin can sometimes also provoke pneumonias. An onset of BRD can begin with only an increased rectal temperature. That is why it is recommended to the owner to check for temperature in the different batches of animals. After, other symptoms will appear, such as cough, nasal discharge, dyspnea, etc. BRD can be categorized in 4 clinical grades, from 1 to 4, according to the severity of the disease. Grade I does not need a treatment, as well as grade IV that is so severe that the animal may probably die within a few days. Other scores exist and they also take into account symptoms such cough, rectal temperature, nasal discharge, etc. The grade or score of the disease is important to establish a treatment, a prognosis or an ancillary exam. Measurement of blood L-Lactate (with portable spectrophotometer, e. g. Accutrend-Plus, Cobas, ~ 150 € and ~ 3 €/test) allows on the field the determination of the grade of BRD as well as prognosis. L-Lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L in calves with BRD (up to 13 months) is associated with grade IV BRD and poor prognosis (death within 3 days) with 95 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity (Coghe et al., 2000). Another study shows that L-Lactate > 3. 7 mmol/L is associated with 44 times more risk to die in calves with BRD, compared to calves with L-Lactate < 1. 3 mmol/L (Buczinski et al., 2014). BRD is clearly a multifactorial disease. Its management must include the resistance of animal (genetic, nutrition, vaccination), the environment (<b>ventilation,</b> <b>hygiene)</b> and the identification of the infectious agents. This conference is focused on the last topic. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydronic}} radiant {{system is}} a type of the space thermal environment control system using a heated or cooled surface of building components such as floor, wall, and ceiling. The systems have been reported to have advantages in improving occupants??? thermal comfort and reducing heating and cooling energy consumption. Although the system has advantages for the thermal comfort of occupants and energy saving potential, it also has drawbacks to be overcome. The most important disadvantages of the conventional radiant system are {{that it is hard to}} control the ventilation requirements and the system capacity for cooling operation decreases due to surface condensation in most humid climate conditions. Several incorporation models, which combine the hydronic radiant system and the forced all-air system, have been implemented into actual buildings and have been used to evaluate the system performance. However, there are no attempts to develop a new radiant system that controls the fresh air for the space without additional components such as heating and cooling coils. This study developed a new radiant system having a concentric tube heat exchanger in a radiant panel and evaluated the system characteristics. The concentric tube heat exchanger allows two fluids, air and water, to flow in the same direction. The outdoor air for the space ventilation requirement passes through an inner tube of the heat exchanger and exchanges heat with an outer water tube of the heat exchanger. The primary heat transfer medium, water, flows through the outer tube exchanging heat with the radiant panel and the air tube. At the outlets of the heat exchanger, both fluids have an identical temperature. The air is delivered into the space directly and the water returns into the plant side. The system configuration enables simultaneous satisfaction of the space thermal loads and ventilation loads without additional components for conditioning the outdoor air. Moreover, the outdoor air can circulate through the air tube during the nighttime in the summer season to damp the heat sink source for daytime cooling loads. The flexibility of using the heat transfer medium, air or water, is recognized in the naming of the hybrid heat source radiant (HHSR) system. This conceptual idea has been evaluated by a numerical analysis model based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Comparing with the result of a typical hydronic radiant system and a hydronic radiant system incorporated with a convective forced-air system under steady state analysis with the same conditions, the proposed system can also provide an acceptable local thermal environment in terms of the vertical temperature difference, the floor surface temperature, and the percentage of discomfort due to draft. A transient energy simulation model of the proposed {{system is a}}lso developed for a whole building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus. Three different analysis models have been studied for the transient model to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of the concentric tube heat exchanger with a non-adiabatic outer shell condition. A modified effectiveness and number of transfer unit (??-NTU) method, which considered the heat capacity properties of the radiant panel and the heat mediums, is selected and the semi-numerical analysis model is interpreted as a program module for the whole building energy and indoor thermal environment simulation program. The water outlet temperature and space mean air temperature of both models of the CFD and EnergyPlus are in agreement with each other in the acceptable tolerance under the given conditions. Finally, the case study is conducted to investigate the system capability and characteristics under 16 different climate conditions in the United States for two different building types, a medium size office and residential units. The building types and climate conditions are based on the presentation of the Department of Energy in the U. S. for the standardized energy simulation models for commercial and residential buildings and the representative locations for 16 different climates. The hourly heating and cooling energy consumption and thermal environment condition for each building type in the 16 climate zones are predicted for three different radiant systems: a typical hydronic radiant system, an outdoor air control system incorporated with the typical radiant system, and the HHSR system. From the annual energy consumption simulation, it was shown that the system performance of the HHSR system allows the system to be considered as a viable HVAC system compared with the conventional radiant system types for the office building type. The HHSR system provides acceptable indoor thermal comfort indices in terms of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and has energy saving potential for heating and cooling operating in the most locations. The configuration of the proposed system also effectively prevents system interruption due to surface condensation during cooling periods in humid climates. In addition, the system expected an additional day time cooling energy saving, when passive cooling using outdoor air ventilation is applied in the night time. Comparing the case of residential units, the results are different from those of the office building case. Although the HHSR system can provide similar indoor thermal conditions to other conventional radiant systems, the heating and cooling energy saving potential depends on the climate condition. By the internal heat gain condition of the residential units, the proposed system does not expect as substantial energy saving benefits as the office building in a particular climate condition. This study also found that some limitations should be considered when the proposed system is implemented and operated in buildings. For the HHSR system, the ventilation air temperature depends on the water outlet temperature, so the water flow rate control scheme impacts the air temperature. Therefore the overall system performance might be changed by the water flow rate logic. Another important consideration is water condensation in the air tube. Although the proposed system can prevent surface condensation on the radiant panel, the water condensation is predicted in the air tube in most humid locations. Internal condensation should be carefully controlled for to assure the <b>hygiene</b> of <b>ventilation</b> air. Future works that should be done based on this study include the experimental validation of the proposed system, the development of a practical tube connection and split methods between the fluids (air and water) supply/delivery side and the concentric tube heat exchanger, and a lifecycle assessment (LCA) of the HHSR system from the manufacturing stage to the demolition stage...|$|R
