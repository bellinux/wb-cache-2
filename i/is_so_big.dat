25|$|Disneyland Paris has {{strict rules}} {{designed}} to prevent visitors from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not {{for the public to}} see. Numerous gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade cars etc. When gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered part of the Disney magic. Therefore, from the second the gates are open, all of the crew must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big,</b> shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the park via roads behind the parks.|$|E
500|$|In {{every event}} and conversation, the protagonist draws {{parallels}} to something he has read in comics. [...] He has a withdrawn personality averse to risk-taking; he declares himself a [...] "true adherent of avoidism", and quotes the character Linus from CharlesM. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts: [...] "No problem <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> or so complicated that it can't be run away from." [...] His mother's home, {{which he calls}} [...] "sealed in amber" [...] as it never changes, provides him a safe berth from the ever-changing modern world.|$|E
500|$|The joke, {{which plays}} on the {{similarity}} of the phrases [...] "fishsticks" [...] and [...] "fish dicks" [...] when spoken, becomes a hit throughout South Park. When Cartman begins taking half credit for the joke, Kyle tells Jimmy he should stand up to Cartman. When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's ego <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important. This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on, showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit.|$|E

500|$|Following this, Gore shares anecdotes that {{inspired}} {{his interest in}} the issue, including his college education with early climate expert Roger Revelle at Harvard University, his sister's death from lung cancer and his young son's near-fatal car accident. Gore recalls a story from his grade-school years, where a fellow student asked his geography teacher about continental drift; in response, the teacher called the concept the [...] "most ridiculous thing [...] ever heard." [...] Gore ties this conclusion to the assumption that [...] "the Earth <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big,</b> we can't possibly have any lasting, harmful impact on the Earth's environment." [...] For comic effect, Gore uses a clip from the Futurama episode [...] "Crimes of the Hot" [...] to describe the greenhouse effect. Gore refers to his loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election as a [...] "hard blow" [...] yet one which subsequently [...] "brought into clear focus, the mission [...] had been pursuing for all these years." ...|$|E
500|$|Brütal Legend {{follows the}} story of Eddie Riggs (voiced by Jack Black), who is [...] "the world's best roadie" [...] for [...] "the world's worst 'heavy metal' band", Kabbage Boy. Much of the game takes place in an unnamed world {{inspired}} by heavy metal music, created by, according to the game's mythology, Ormagöden, The Eternal Firebeast, Cremator of the Sky, and Destroyer of the Ancient World. In this alternate world, the human race is enslaved by a race of demons, led by Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil, (voiced by Tim Curry). Doviculus is assisted by his glam metal human minion, General Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford and based on David Bowie with the name being an allusion to glammetal band White Lion) whose hair <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> [...] "and luscious" [...] that he uses it to fly, flapping it {{like a pair of}} broad wings. Leading the fight against Doviculus are a small band of human resistance fighters with whom Eddie joins forces: Lars Halford (voiced by Zach Hanks), his sister Lita (voiced by Kath Soucie), and Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale), whom Eddie takes a romantic interest in. Their group is later joined by the stage manager Mangus (Alex Fernandez), the bass-playing healer Kill Master (voiced by, and patterned after Lemmy Kilmister), the motorcycle-riding Fire Baron (also voiced by Halford, as well as visually inspired by him too), and the Amazonian Rima (voiced by Lita Ford and based on KISS characters). Also supporting Eddie is the Guardian of Metal (voiced by Ozzy Osbourne, who also lent his appearance to the character) that assists in upgrading his equipment.|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{counties}} had major subdivisions. Of these, {{the most significant}} were the divisions of Yorkshire: the East Riding, West Riding, North Riding and the ainsty of York. Since Yorkshire <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big,</b> its ridings became established as geographical terms quite apart from their original role as administrative divisions. The second largest county, Lincolnshire, was divided into three historic [...] "parts": Parts of Lindsey, Holland and Kesteven. Other divisions include those of Sussex into East Sussex and West Sussex and Suffolk into East Suffolk and West Suffolk, and, more informally and hence more vaguely, of Kent into East Kent and West Kent.|$|E
2500|$|Complexity. Doubts were {{expressed}} as to workability of FATCA {{due to its}} complexity, and the legislative timetable for implementation was pushed back multiple times. According to U.S. national taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in regards to FATCA: [...] "This {{is a piece of}} legislation that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> and so far-reaching, and [...] so many different moving pieces, and is rolling out in an incremental fashion (...) that you really won’t be able to know what its consequences are, intended or otherwise,’ Olson said. [...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually be a little too late to go, [...] "Oops, my bad, we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS help center is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{scenario}} basis, the {{clue to the}} phenomenal success {{of the project was}} the work of Ivan Okhlobystin himself: his doctor, Andrei Evgenievich Bykov, the head of the therapeutic department of the hospital {{and the head of the}} internship department, is the central figure of the entire movie, and the importance of this personality <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>big</b> that the rest of the hospital employees and, in fact, the interns themselves, seem to be a kind of [...] "Bykov's army", corresponding to one of several traits of his character. Okhlobystin, through a [...] "paradoxical and ironic rationalism with which he tends to percept the reality," [...] according to a TV critic Valery Zaitsev, creates around him a special, [...] "Okhbystin" [...] space. In a way he reminds very much Hugh Laurie, the British actor playing the main role in the American television series Doctor House. [...] However, the similarity ends there: the character of Okhlobystin, as well as the mentality of all the TV series shot by TNT, is purely Russian, full of love, respect and tenderness as to the profession of the doctor and human suffering. It's no accident that Dr. Bykov regularly [...] "mocks" [...] at a foreign colleague, and in one of the first episodes, having learned that the tiresome intern Levin, just like House, is going to treat rare and complex illnesses, he comes back with a question: who is going then to treat ordinary patients, filling up the hospitals? ...|$|E
