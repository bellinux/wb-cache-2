Herein, we show that an anthelmintic drug, Pyrvinium pamoate, which has been previously shown to compromise cancer cell survival under glucose starvation condition, also disables cardiac fibroblast survival specifically under glucose deficient condition.

Here, we demonstrate that endosialin gene transcription is induced by hypoxia predominantly through a mechanism involving hypoxia-inducible factor- 2 (HIF- 2) cooperating with the Ets- 1 transcription factor. We show that HIF- 2 activates the endosialin promoter both directly, through binding to a hypoxia-response element adjacent to an Ets-binding site in the distal part of the upstream regulatory region, and indirectly, through Ets- 1 and its two cognate elements in the proximal promoter. Our data also suggest that the SP 1 transcription factor mediates responsiveness of the endosialin promoter to high cell density.

40|$|Abstract Background In Malawi {{essential}} {{drugs are}} provided {{free of charge}} to patients at all public health facilities {{in order to ensure}} equitable access to health care. The country thereby spends about 30 % of the national health budget on drugs. In order to investigate the level of drug shortages and eventually find the reasons for the drugs shortages in Malawi, we studied the management of the drug supplies for common and life threatening diseases such as pneumonia and malaria in a random selection of health centres. Methods In July and August 2005 we visited eight {{out of a total of}} 37 health centres chosen at random in the Lilongwe District, Malawi. We recorded the logistics of eight essential and widely used drugs which according to the treatment guidelines should be available at all health centres. Five drugs are used regularly to treat pneumonia and three others to treat acute malaria. Out-of-stock situations in the course of one year were recorded retrospectively. We compared the quantity of each drug recorded on the Stock Cards with the actual stock of the drug on the shelves at the time of audit. We reviewed 8, 968 Patient Records containing information on type and amount of drugs prescribed during one month. Results On average, drugs for treating pneumonia were out of stock for six months during one year of observation (median value 167 days); anti-malarial drugs were lacking for periods ranging from 42 to 138 days. The cross-sectional audit was even more negative, but here too the situation was more positive for anti-malarial drugs. The main reason for the shortage of drugs was <b>insufficient</b> <b>deliveries</b> from the Regional Medical Store. Benzyl penicillin was in shortest supply (4 % received). The median value for non-availability was 240 days in the course of a year. The supply was better for anti-malarial drugs, except for quinine injections (9 %). Only 66 % of Stock Card records of quantities received were reflected in Patient Records showing quantities dispensed. Conclusion We conclude that for the eight index drugs the levels of supply are unacceptable. The main reason for the observed shortage of drugs at the health centres was <b>insufficient</b> <b>deliveries</b> from the Regional Medical Store. A difference between the information recorded on the Stock Cards at the health centres and that recorded in the Patient Records may have contributed to the overall poor drug supply situation. In order to ensure equitable access to life saving drugs, logistics in general should be put in order before specific disease management programmes are initiated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{unsatisfactory}} {{treatment of}} myocardial infarction (MI) {{is due to}} the unbridled inflammation and the delayed diagnosis at the early stage. To address these problems, firstly, phosphatidylserine (PS) was used to modulate the phenotypes of macrophages (MF) and resolve the early inflammation via binding to PS receptors (PSR) on macrophage surface. Secondly, highly-sensitive magnetic iron oxide nanocubes (MIONs) were adopted to realize the early visualization via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the major drawback for MIONs as contrast agents was their hydrophobic properties and <b>insufficient</b> <b>delivery.</b> Hence, zwitterionic biodegradable copolymer poly(lactide) polycarboxybetaine (PLA-PCB, PP), companied with PS, was used to provide a good colloidal stability and long blood circulation for the nanocubes. Given the above, a theranostic nanosystem (PP/PS@MIONs) was constructed for early treatment of MI. With external magnetic field-induced targeting and PS targeting, the nanosystem enhanced the accumulation in infarcted area, and accelerated the resolution of early inflammatory responses. Moreover, the nanocubes in system were promoted to escape from endosomes/lysosomes via protonation of PCB, which contributes to accurate MRI. This nanosystem showed good inflammation-resolving effects and imaging ability in MI model rats. Therefore, this theranostic nanosystem can realize accurate visualization and significantly improve the treatment efficacy of MI at early stage...|$|E

In the previous issue of Critical Care, the report by Ploppa and colleagues reveals an interrelation among neutro phil activation, endothelial cells, platelets and shear forces that may underlie the unwanted accumulation of neutrophils in vascular beds unrelated to the infection site [1]. A hallmark feature of neutrophils is their ability to rapidly accumulate at sites of infection, where they kill invading pathogens through the release of their cytotoxic granule contents, the generation of reactive oxygen species and, under certain critical conditions, the release of enzyme-laden DNA that forms large web-like structures or neutrophil extracellular traps [2].

In vitro and in vivo human skin model systems {{were used in the}} present study to quantitate ACV disposition and absorption in skin and blood following two routes of administration and to investigate whether bioavailability differences were the result of insufficient drug delivery. Physicochemical and physiologic parameters determined from these experiments were used to develop a mathematical model to predict ACV disposition and absorption in human subjects. Model predictions and in vivo data agree; topical administration of commercial 5 % ACV ointment and cream result in a 48 times greater total epidermal ACV concentration than after oral administration. Mathematical modeling of the ACV concentration gradient through the epidermis revealed, however, that the drug concentration in the target site of HSV- 1 infections, the basal epidermis, is 2 - 3 times less after topical administration than after oral administration. Thus, the observed lack of clinical efficacy with topical ACV therapy in the recurring HSV- 1 infection likely reflects the <b>insufficient</b> <b>delivery</b> of the drug to the target site of the HSV- 1 infection, the basal epidermis...|$|E

40|$|Copper is an {{integral}} part of a number of proteins and thus an essential trace metal. However, free copper ions can be highly toxic and every organism has to carefully control its bioavailability. Eukaryotes contain three copper chaperones; Atx 1 p/Atox 1 which delivers copper to ATP 7 transporters located in the trans-Golgi network, Cox 17 which provides copper to the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, and CCS which is a copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1. Here we describe the knockout phenotype of the Drosophila homolog of mammalian Atox 1 (ATX 1 in yeast). Atox 1 -/- flies develop normally, though at reduced numbers, and the eclosing flies are fertile. However, the mutants are unable to develop on low-copper food. Furthermore, the intestinal copper importer Ctr 1 B, which is regulated by copper demand, fails to be induced upon copper starvation in Atox 1 -/- larvae. At the same time, intestinal metallothionein is upregulated. This phenotype, which resembles the one of the ATP 7 mutant, is best explained by intestinal copper accumulation, combined with <b>insufficient</b> <b>delivery</b> to the rest of the body.

Treatment of sPLA 2 -secreting tumor cells in vitro with liposomes consisting of proAELs resulted in growth inhibition comparable with addition of the AELs alone. Using a specific sPLA 2 inhibitor, we showed the low cytotoxicity of the nonhydrolyzed proAEL liposomes and have proven the sPLA 2 dependency of the activation of proAELs to cytotoxic AELs. In addition, we showed that our proAEL liposomes circumvent the inherent hemolytic toxicities {{associated with the use of}} etherlipids, thereby allowing i. v. administration of such therapeutics as nontoxic prodrug liposomes. Furthermore, using a sPLA 2 -secreting human colon cancer xenograft model, we showed that the proAEL liposomes are capable of inducing a tumor growth delay in vivo. Taken together, these data support the validity of this novel tumor-selective liposomal prodrug delivery strategy. This new approach also provides a promising system for tumor-selective delivery and release of conventional chemotherapeutics encapsulated in the sPLA 2 -degradable prodrug liposomes...|$|E

With the declining duration of dialysis treatments in the United States, there has been concern that {{a significant proportion of}} patients may be receiving inadequate therapy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to survey hemodialysis practices and treatment outcomes in our metropolitan area. Sixteen area nephrologists volunteered to study their outpatient hemodialysis patients (N = 617). Demographic data and urea kinetic modeling results were then analyzed at the lead center.

The mean KT/V was 1. 03 ± 0. 25 with nearly half of patients failing to attain a KT/V of 1. 0. In 55 % of patients the reason for a low KT/V was the prescription of an insufficient amount of dialysis treatment. In the remainder, <b>insufficient</b> <b>delivery</b> of prescribed dialysis contributed to the low KT/V.

Current efforts to implant large engineered structures are hindered by significant cell death in areas that exceed the limits of oxygen diffusion due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>delivery</b> of oxygen and nutrients, and waste removal. The work presented in this dissertation describes a novel strategy for generating constructs containing highly aligned 2 ̆ 2 cords 2 ̆ 2 of endothelial cells which trigger the formation of new capillaries {{along the length of}} the patterned cords after implantation. In Chapter 2, we describe the temporal dynamics of vessel formation. Specifically, we show that the resultant vessels become perfused with host blood as early as 3 days post implantation, and become progressively more mature through 28 days. Next, we show that prescribing the geometry of the cords prior to implant provides a template that defines the neovascular architecture in vivo. Finally, to explore the utility of this geometric control, we implanted primary hepatocyte constructs. We found substantially enhanced hepatic survival and function in constructs containing ordered cords following transplantation in mice as opposed to randomly seeded controls. ^ In Chapter 3 we explore the versatility of our strategy for use in various tissue engineering applications. We first show that the diameter of the EC cords prior to implant can be used to tailor the localization and density of the resultant capillary network to meet tissue specific needs for various parenchymal tissue. Specifically, the localization of blood vessels and hence, blood is more dense in implants containing smaller diameter cords and more dispersed in implants containing larger cords. We next explore the contribution of mural cells to the vascularization response. We then demonstrate that cords composed of clinically relevant endothelial cells become vascularized for eventual translational purposes. Finally, we show that our approach can be used with parenchymal cell types to add additional levels of geometric control within engineered tissue. ^ In Chapter 4 we describe some exciting applications and future directions of our strategy. ^ Overall, this dissertation describes our unique approach to engineer and control vasculature within engineered tissue and the importance of multicellular architecture in tissue integration and function. ...|$|E

Severe stenoses in the three main mesenteric vessels as demonstrated with CT-angiography or MR-angiography are sufficient to proof mesenteric ischemia, for example in patients who present with weight loss, postprandial pain and diarrhea. Still in many clinical situations mesenteric ischemia {{is only one of}} many possible explanations. Especially in patients with a single vessel stenosis in the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery with postprandial pain, mesenteric ischemia remains a diagnosis of probability or assumption without functional proof of actual ischemia. This review is aimed to provide an overview of all past, present and future ways to functionally proof CMI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
