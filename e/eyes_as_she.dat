5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{checks the}} {{rear-view}} mirror, {{her face in}} the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in Sierra Leone, Africa where young girls are {{mutilated}} every year. The number of girls mutilated in Africa per year has risen to 3 million. Rugiatu Turay, founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement, protects young girls from being circumcised by other women in secret societies like Sande and other female practitioners who still engage in the ceremonial tradition today. Girls as young as the age of five assist in the mutilation of other young girls in the country. At the age of 12, Turay was snatched by female family members, held down and had her clitoris cut off with a knife. She was beaten, forced to walk, and had hot pepper water poured in her <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> was mutilated, the women sang, danced, and clap ceremoniously. According to these women, Turay had become a woman. However, females are generally mutilated under the age of 15. Girls who are trained to assist in this ceremony are trained as young as five years old. Turay has convinced 400 practitioners to stop the practice of female mutilation, but 97 million females have been mutilated within the country and the numbers remain constant, even increasing. The practice has been enforced by politicians within the country and locals refer to the practice as a ceremony that initiates womanhood, prepares females for marriage, and restricts their sexual conduct.|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, [...] "The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce." [...] Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, [...] "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater {{from left to right}} throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano is as easy on the <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is on the ears." [...] John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as [...] "lavish". Andy Kellman from Allmusic wrote, [...] "The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{a slight}} dimple of {{mischief}} in her cheek, and a quaint sparkle in her dark <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> turned her questioning gaze on Arthur. He caught her hand and raised it respectfully to his lips.|$|R

60|$|The {{wine was}} delicious; perhaps a TRIFLE, only a trifle, heady. He was {{conscious}} of a slight exaltation. There was also a smile upon the girl's lip and a roguish twinkle in her <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at him.|$|R
6000|$|She {{glanced at}} him as he leaned pensively on the low wall, looking down into the lake, with the level rays of {{sunshine}} on his comely face and figure. Something softer than pity stole into her <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said, anxiously,-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you like}} it, Polly?" [...] I asked. She never answered, but gazed long, {{and at last}} a {{darkness}} went trembling through her sensitive <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said, [...] "Put me down."

60|$|The softest {{gratitude}} animated her <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{lifted it}} a moment. She had yet more to say, but seemed hesitating about time and place.

6000|$|... "If {{you will}} be so kind," [...] he answered, and {{departed}} with a bow. There was a mischievous mirth in her <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> took {{her place in the}} window.

6000|$|...
