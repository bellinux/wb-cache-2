5|$|On 5 April 1957, {{the signal}} box was {{destroyed}} by a fire due to an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault.</b> The station was consequently put out of action. Using hand signals, a skeleton service {{was put in place}} on 8 April. A temporary signal box was erected which came into operation on 5 May. Steam locomotives were temporarily banned from using the station, with Hastings Units being introduced into service earlier than planned. A full service was resumed from 6 May. Construction of a new signal box began on 19 April and it came into service on 16 December.|$|E
5|$|The Supporters' Club raised £20,000 {{to pay for}} a roof {{at one end of the}} Feethams {{ground and}} for floodlights, which were first used on 19 September 1960. Later that night, the West Stand burned down due to an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault.</b> Darlington's {{attendance}} record, of 21,023 against Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup fourth round, was set two months later. Under the management of Lol Morgan, they won promotion to the Third Division in 1966. A crowd of 16,000 watched the draw against Torquay United on the last day of the season which ensured they finished as runners-up, but they were relegated the following year.|$|E
5|$|While McLaren {{once again}} succeeded in {{advancing}} both cars into Q2, Fernando Alonso's car {{stopped in the}} first corner due to an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault</b> {{at the start of}} the second session, and he took no further part in qualifying. Team mate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte Dévote. The second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not make it into Q3.|$|E

50|$|This {{method has}} been shown to be useful to {{locating}} intermittent <b>electrical</b> <b>faults.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{other factors}} affect the {{locations}} where <b>electrical</b> <b>faults</b> occur. <b>Electrical</b> <b>faults</b> {{do not always}} occur where fire first reaches a conduit, but preferentially occur at bends in a conduit or at locations where wires are pressed together. The elevation of an electrical line has a strong effect on its exposure to heat, since temperatures in a fire are generally highest near ceiling level, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the point of origin. Protection from the fire is an important consideration: being located within a wall or being covered in fiberglass insulation will offer some protection to an electrical line, and will delay <b>electrical</b> <b>faults.</b>|$|R
5|$|Becky first {{appears in}} Coronation Street {{as a friend}} of local factory worker Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), whom she frames for theft at the Underworld {{lingerie}} factory. After betraying Kelly, she leaves the area for several months, returning later in the year when she meets former workmate Hayley Cropper, who is teaching an ex-offenders literacy class. Becky promises Hayley she will reform, and is offered a job at Roy's Rolls, the cafe owned and run by Hayley's partner, Roy. She doesn't change as promised and soon begins breaking the Croppers' property, threatening customers and stealing money from the till. Slug, a former acquaintance of Becky's, arrives in Weatherfield and the two joyride in the Croppers' newly acquired Morris Minor. Becky loses the couple's trust and her job. Hayley refuses Becky's apologies and when the cafe catches fire and Becky is rescued from the burning building, the Croppers assume she was responsible. Hayley apologises to Becky on learning that the fire was caused by an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault</b> and the two resume their friendship, with Becky re-employed at Roy's Rolls.|$|E
5|$|Feethams was {{originally}} used by Darlington Cricket Club, but {{began to be}} used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand {{at the turn of the}} century and the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. Floodlights were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault</b> gutted the West stand in a fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all-seater stand, but its cost had a major negative effect on the club's finances. George Reynolds came in to the club, paid its debts and initiated construction of a new stadium. The last match played at Feethams was a 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient on 3 May 2003. Following the closure of the ground, the floodlights were sold to Workington A.F.C. and the stadium demolished. A housing estate was planned for the cleared site.|$|E
5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault</b> caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E

5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault.</b> Smoke {{bellowed}} from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} swept {{frequency}} (SFM) and low voltage impulse methods (LVI) for making frequency response analysis measurements. The principles of these measurements are explained. Practical {{examples of the}} application to a 30 MVA transformer with simulated mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>faults</b> are presented. For mechanical faults neither method is very successful, but this probably because the simulated fault was not severe enough. For <b>electrical</b> <b>faults</b> the swept frequency method gives better results {{because it has a}} finer resolution at low frequencies. In a final comparison of the two methods the swept frequency method is found to be superior in most respects, but the low voltage impulse method is found to have some important advantages. 1...|$|R
25|$|It {{was in the}} North Shaft that a fire {{occurred}} in 1952, which caused the greatest single loss {{of life in the}} mine's entire history. An <b>electrical</b> <b>fault</b> one weekend may have started the fire. When the men went to work on the Monday morning (7 July 1952), the air compressor was started up, and air from a broken air line fanned the flames, releasing poisonous carbon monoxide gas which began to circulate round the mine. Some of the men began to collapse when they reached the 175Fathom Level. Four men who had descended the 940N Winze were killed, and rescuers were driven out of the mine by the gas. The bodies could not be recovered until 16 July, and the mine did not reopen until 1 September.|$|E
25|$|Just before 8am on 28 November 2003 an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault</b> {{caused some}} {{equipment}} to overheat, which set off fire alarms.

25|$|As {{was normal}} practice, the gunners 'stood to' at 06.30 {{and so were}} ready for action when the German {{warships}} approached. The Germans planned to bombard the batteries for 15 minutes to suppress them before turning the attention to the town. The Seydlitz opened fire at 08.10 and Lt-Col Robson rushed from his home to take up his post as Fire Commander and Battery Medical Officer at Heugh Battery. The first shell cut the Fire Commander's telephone lines, so the whole action was fought by the Battery Commanders on their own under standing orders. At ranges of 4000 to 5000 yards the German shells fell round the batteries without scoring a direct hit. Heugh Battery engaged first the Seydlitz and then the Moltke until they passed out of its arc of fire, and then concentrated on the stationary Blucher which was firing at Lighthouse Battery. Lighthouse Battery scored a direct hit on Blucher's forebridge, disabling two guns of the secondary armament, but suffered a number of misfires due to an <b>electrical</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Photovoltaic {{systems have}} {{played a key role}} over the last decade in the {{evolution}} of the electricity sector. In terms of safety design, it's important to consider that a PV plant constitutes a special system of generation, where the Direct Current (DC) presence results in changes to the technical rules. Moreover, if certain <b>electrical</b> <b>faults</b> occur, the plant is a possible source of fire. Choices regarding the grounding of the generator and its protection devices are fundamental for a design that evaluates fire risk. The subject of the article is the analysis of the relation between electrical phenomena in PV systems and the fire risk related to ensuring appropriate fault detection by the electrical protection system. A description of a grid-connected PV system is followed firstly by a comparison of the design solutions provided by international Standards, and secondly by an analysis of electrical phenomena which may trigger a fire. A study of two existing PV systems, where <b>electrical</b> <b>faults</b> have resulted in fires, is then presented. The study highlights the importance of checking all possible failure modes in a PV system design phase, to assess fire risk in advance. Some guidelines for the mitigation of <b>electrical</b> <b>faults</b> that may result in a fire are finally provided...|$|R
