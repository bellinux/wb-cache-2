5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} streamwise-localized turbulent flow (turbulent puff) in a horizontal square duct heated from above are performed at Richardson numbers 0 ≤ Ri ≤ 0. 58 to characterize differences between isothermal and non-isothermal puffs. It is {{found that the}} structure of the non-isothermal puff exhibits significantly different properties from that of the isothermal puff. In particular, differences are observed in wall shear stresses. In the upstream part of the non-isothermal puff, <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> appears on the horizontal walls than the vertical ones. In the downstream part, meanwhile, <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> appears on the vertical walls than the horizontal ones. The <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> on the horizontal walls in the upstream part is interpreted in terms of coherent streamwise vortices induced by buoyancy in the corner regions. The <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> on the vertical walls in the downstream part {{is considered to be a}} consequence of higher wall-normal (horizontal) turbulence intensity on the vertical walls under the weaker constraint of the stable stratification...|$|R
30|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>shearing</b> rate in {{the direct}} shear tests of rough rock joints under the {{constant}} normal displacement loading conditions promotes the asperity degradation but constraints the volume dilation, which result in <b>higher</b> peak <b>shear</b> resistance, more gouge formation and grinding, and smoother new joint surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Recuperative {{thickening}} can intensify {{anaerobic digestion}} {{to produce more}} biogas and potentially reduce biosolids odour. This study elucidates the effects of sludge shearing during the thickening process on the microbial community structure {{and its effect on}} biogas production. Medium shearing resulted in approximately 15 % increase in biogas production. By contrast, excessive or <b>high</b> <b>shearing</b> led to a marked decrease in biogas production, possibly due to sludge disintegration and cell lysis. Microbial analysis using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that medium shearing increased the evenness and diversity of the microbial community in the anaerobic digester, which is consistent with the observed improved biogas production. By contrast, microbial diversity decreased under either excessive <b>shearing</b> or <b>high</b> <b>shearing</b> condition. In good agreement with the observed decrease in biogas production, the abundance of Bacteroidales and Syntrophobaterales (which are responsible for hydrolysis and acetogenesis) decreased due to <b>high</b> <b>shearing</b> during recuperative thickening...|$|R
5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, before {{the onset of}} the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. This double peak occurs because {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones. <b>High</b> <b>shear</b> explains why no cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{noticeable}} material strengthening via solution strengthening, one should alloy with solutes of <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> modulus, hence increasing the local shear modulus in the material. In addition, one should alloy with elements of different equilibrium lattice constants. The greater the difference in lattice parameter, the higher the local stress fields introduced by alloying. Alloying with elements of <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> modulus or of very different lattice parameters will increase the stiffness and introduce local stress fields respectively. In either case, the dislocation propagation will be hindered at these sites, impeding plasticity and increasing yield strength proportionally with solute concentration.|$|R

25|$|Many of the {{complications}} associated with MHV {{can be explained}} through fluid mechanics. For example, thrombus formation is a debilitating side effect of <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> stresses created by {{the design of the}} valves.

25|$|The nanocellulose fibrils may be {{isolated}} from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> forces, ripping the larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonic homogenizers, grinders or microfluidizers can be used. The homogenizers are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the nanosized fibrils. This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/tonne are not uncommon.|$|E

25|$|Turbulence and <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> {{stresses}} {{are also}} major issues with MHV, {{as they can}} fracture the valve housing or components, or induce blood damage. A large flow gradient can lead to these factors, so flow separation and stagnation should be as small as possible. High stresses are created {{at the edges of}} the annular jet in caged-ball valves, in narrow regions {{at the edges of the}} major orifice jet in tilting-disc valves, and in regions immediately distal to the valve leaflets in bileaflet valves. The implications of blood damage from these stresses are discussed in the next section.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper studies Lagrangian mixing in a twodimensional {{barotropic}} model for hurricane-like vortices. Since such flows show <b>high</b> <b>shearing</b> in the radial direction, particle separation across shear-lines is diagnosed through a Lagrangian field, {{referred to as}} R-field, that measures trajectory separation orthogonal to the Lagrangian velocity. The shear-lines are identified with the level-contours of another Lagrangian field, referred to as S-field, that measures the average shear-strength along a trajectory. Other fields used for model diagnostics are the Lagrangian field of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE-field), the Eulerian Q-field, and the angular velocity field. Because of the <b>high</b> <b>shearing,</b> the FTLE-field is not a suitable indicator for advective mixing, and in particular does not exhibit ridges marking the location of finite-time stable and unstable manifolds.

25|$|For use in {{pharmaceutical}} products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters {{is being}} used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles liposomes or transfersomes with a particular size of a narrow size distribution. The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.|$|E
500|$|Because Irene {{was in an}} {{environment}} laden with dry air and <b>high</b> <b>shear,</b> it soon weakened to a tropical depression, on August 8. On the morning of August 10, as it was passing north of the Lesser Antilles, Irene nearly dissipated into a remnant low, but forecasters predicted with [...] "very low confidence" [...] that the storm would survive. Contrary to these expectations, warmer waters and less wind shear allowed Irene to become gradually more organized while south of Bermuda, {{and it became a}} tropical storm once again early on August 11.|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor is}} rapid cooling with height, {{which allows the}} release of the heat of {{condensation}} that powers a tropical cyclone.

Lastly, a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather. [...] Tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously. [...] Low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{provide an}} {{experimental}} demonstration of positive rheotaxis (rapid and continuous upstream motility) in wild-type Escherichia coli freely swimming over a surface. This hydrodynamic phenomenon is dominant below a critical shear rate and robust against Brownian motion and cell tumbling. We deduce that individual bacteria entering a flow system can rapidly migrate upstream (> 20 μm/s) {{much faster than}} a gradually advancing biofilm. Given a bacterial population with a distribution of sizes and swim speeds, local shear rate near the surface determines the dominant hydrodynamic mode for motility, i. e., circular or random trajectories for low shear rates, positive rheotaxis for moderate flow, and sideways swimming at <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> rates. Faster swimmers can move upstream more rapidly and at <b>higher</b> <b>shear</b> rates, as expected.

500|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form due to {{latent heat}} driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm-core with well-defined circulations. [...] Certain criteria {{need to be}} met for their formation. [...] In most situations, water temperatures of at least [...] are needed down {{to a depth of}} at least waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms. Another factor is rapid cooling with height, which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone. High humidity is needed, especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere; when {{there is a great deal}} of moisture in the atmosphere, conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop. Low amounts of wind shear are needed, as <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> is disruptive to the storm's circulation. [...] Lastly, a formative tropical cyclone needs a pre-existing system of disturbed weather, although without a circulation no cyclonic development will take place. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. [...] Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear.|$|E
