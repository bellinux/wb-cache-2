25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a serial data stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a single wire. Figure 9 shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. The numbers on the shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 serial transmission phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked to latch a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{senior editor}} of AllMusic, called My Love: Essential Collection an {{overcompensation}} for <b>how</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> Way... A Decade of Song (1999), concentrated on newer recordings {{at the expense of}} hits. According to him, My Love: Essential Collection [...] "fits the bill well" [...] for those listeners who are looking for an overview of Celine Dion's two decades as an international superstar, as it has all her big adult contemporary hits. Erlewine also noted that although Dion has had more hits in the ten years since All the Way... A Decade of Song, apart from her cover of Roy Orbison's [...] "I Drove All Night", almost none of her new-millennium hits are as memorable as her singles from the '90s.|$|E

The artwork featured Mulan with blue eyes, bigger lips, noticeably lighter skin, and golden clothing which does not resemble any outfit she has worn in the film. Her new appearance has caused an uproar due to the whitewash of her character. This was particularly troubling as Mulan {{is one of the}} few princesses of color. Shavon L. McKinstry of SPARK Movement writes that Mulan's redesign [...] "seem to be directly counter to her personality and character in her film", and also notes <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> princesses of color have been [...] "noticeably pushed to the back or left out completely" [...] from the new Disney merchandise which featured the redesigns.|$|E

After Carey's friend and past {{collaborator}} David Cole died, she began writing and developing {{a song that}} would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along the life's journey. Carey had the idea and chorus composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, {{as well as the}} melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song.

500|$|Conrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its [...] "horrible localization" [...] as a {{main reason}} for negativity. Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: [...] "It's really {{annoying}} <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers." [...] Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive. Staff of GamesRadar admitted, [...] "At least the song fits. Can't imagine Sonic listening to Undergrounds wailing Meat Loaf light rock, but he'd definitely jam to Sonic X." [...] Jones praised the rock music from Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, {{as well as the}} [...] "pretty piano music" [...] and [...] "catchy" [...] Japanese intro and outro themes.

[...] Rex Huffman of The Times-Reporter cited it as [...] "an amusing episode", and Ology's Josh Harrison described it as [...] "legitimately funny". Harrison noted that [...] "seeing so many futuristic versions of familiar characters put an interesting spin on the holiday season." [...] He also commented: [...] "The whole episode hinges on a surprisingly heartfelt scene that sees Bart and Lisa—both a bit sloshed—meeting up in the treehouse to discuss the challenges of parenting." [...] Similarly, Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] found [...] "a sweet spot that combined a barrage of non-stop jokes with a tenderness often lacking in latter-day Simpsons episodes. There is even a conversation between the adult Bart and Lisa that rings surprisingly true for adult siblings wrestling with their shared familial past." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's sound {{team was}} {{composed}} of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director Eric Brosius. According to Brosius, {{each member of the}} audio department did [...] "everything", without clear demarcations between roles. Like Thief, Thief II features a sound engine that simulates propagation in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the level editor and to a [...] "separate [...] database", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on [...] "the physical room characteristics [...] <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> different rooms and areas are connected together". For example, noise travels freely through an open door but is blocked when the door is closed. The team used the new [...] "occlusion" [...] feature in EAX 2.0 to make Thief IIs sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original Thief. Thief IIs score, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to [...] "blur ambient [...] and music" [...] together. However, Brosius later stated that, while Thiefs soundtrack is composed of [...] "simple and hypnotic" [...] loops only a few seconds in length, Thief II features longer and [...] "more thoughtfully" [...] constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment.|$|E
500|$|... "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] was {{directed}} by Nick Hurran, who directed [...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] and [...] "The God Complex" [...] of the previous series, {{as well as the}} fifth episode of the seventh series. [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] contains many of the Dalek types that the Doctor has faced over the years, including the Special Weapons Dalek from the 1988 story, Remembrance of the Daleks. According to The Daily Telegraph, the production team located the remaining models of the various versions of the Daleks and shipped them to the studios in Cardiff Bay. This included a Dalek owned by Russell T Davies, Moffat's predecessor. Executive producer Caroline Skinner knew Davies well and asked to borrow his replica. She stated that he was [...] "thrilled" [...] that it was canonised. The total number of different Daleks was around 25, with models from 1963 to 2010; Skinner said that [...] "there was just a real magic and sense of history about having them". Moffat was concerned about <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> different Daleks would look together, but was pleased once he saw them; he commented that the diversity made them look like a species, rather than identical robots. Many of the props were built from scratch. The snow scenes on the asylum planet were filmed in Spain during the production of [...] "A Town Called Mercy". Music featured in the episode are the [...] "Habanera" [...] from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen, which is used diegetically, and [...] "Feel the Love" [...] by Rudimental is also featured. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a Dalek, in keeping with the varied [...] "blockbuster" [...] themes for each of the opening titles {{of the first half of}} the series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{defects in}} Boole's system (such {{as the use}} of the letter v for existential propositions) were all {{remedied}} by his followers. [...] Jevons published Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify exclusive or, which allowed Boole's system to be greatly simplified. [...] This was usefully exploited by Schröder when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his Vorlesungen (1890–1905). [...] Peirce (1880) showed <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, [...] "neither ... nor ..." [...] and equally well [...] "not both ... and ...", however, like many of Peirce's innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until Sheffer rediscovered it in 1913. [...] Boole's early work also lacks the idea of the logical sum which originates in Peirce (1867), Schröder (1877) and Jevons (1890), and the concept of inclusion, first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).|$|E

2500|$|The Halliwell Manuscript, {{also known}} as the Regius Poem, is the {{earliest}} of the Old Charges. It consists of 64 vellum pages of Middle English written in rhyming couplets. In this, it differs from the prose of all the later charges. The poem begins by describing how Euclid [...] "counterfeited geometry" [...] and called it masonry, for the employment of the children of the nobility in Ancient Egypt. It then recounts the spread of the art of geometry in [...] "divers lands." [...] The document relates how the craft of [...] masonry was brought to England during the reign of King Athelstan (924–939). It tells <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> masons of the land came to the King for direction as to their own good governance, and how Athelstan, together with the nobility and landed gentry, forged the fifteen articles and fifteen points for their rule. This is followed by fifteen articles for the master concerning both moral behaviour (do not harbour thieves, do not take bribes, attend church regularly, etc.) and the operation of work on a building site (do not make your masons labour at night, teach apprentices properly, do not take on jobs that you cannot do etc.). There are then fifteen points for craftsmen which follow a similar pattern. Warnings of punishment for those breaking the ordinances are followed by provision for annual assemblies. There follows the legend of the Four Crowned Martyrs, a series of moral aphorisms, and finally a blessing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} [...] "Catherine of Aragon" [...] was {{originally}} {{a piece that}} Wakeman wrote for Fragile with a working title of [...] "Handle With Care".

Recorded at Trident Studios in London, the track features Yes's guitarist Steve Howe and bassist Chris Squire with percussionist Ray Cooper. By the time production began on [...] "Catherine Howard", engineer Ken Scott was replaced by Paul Tregurtha.

2500|$|The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is {{an artist}} {{who works in the}} motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous {{characters}} throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn’t think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots, seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves( [...] p.13 [...] "people get up from the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw"). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the [...] "Mall Murderers") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line [...] "No one has taken responsibility" [...] — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.|$|E
