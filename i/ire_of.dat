50|$|The {{first human}} studies have proven the safety <b>of</b> <b>IRE</b> for the {{ablation}} of renal masses; however, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>IRE</b> through histopathological examination of an ablated renal tumor in humans {{is yet to}} be known. Wagstaff et al. have set out to investigate the safety and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>IRE</b> ablation <b>of</b> renal masses and to evaluate the efficacy of ablation using MIR and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. In accordance with the prospective protocol designed by the authors, the treated patients will subsequently undergo radical nephrectomy to assess IRE ablation success.|$|R

5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{the shrine}} {{has become a}} controversial symbol for Japanese nationalists. While many citizens of various political persuasions visit the site to honor relatives killed in battle, whose kami (spirit) {{are said to be}} enshrined there, so too are the kami of several class-A war criminals. These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which has raised the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E

40|$|Irreversible {{electroporation}} (IRE) {{is a novel}} tumor ablation technique using a non-thermal {{energy to}} create innumerable permanent nanopores in the cell membrane to disrupt cellular homeostasis. This disruption of cellular homeostasis initiates apoptosis which leads to permanent cell death. In our translational research, we have demonstrated that IRE can be a safe, fast and powerful method of tumor treatment. In this review, we present an overview <b>of</b> <b>IRE</b> ablation including a brief history <b>of</b> <b>IRE,</b> advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>IRE</b> and clinical and research implications <b>of</b> <b>IRE...</b>|$|R

Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the war and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U-boats. On 24 April 1916, UB-13 was sunk with all hands.|$|E
5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but also proved {{to be one of the}} most controversial appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion rights groups and the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and religious leaders. The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E
50|$|The medal {{was created}} by the Institute <b>of</b> Radio Engineers (<b>IRE)</b> as the <b>IRE</b> Medal <b>of</b> Honor. It became the IEEE Medal <b>of</b> Honor when <b>IRE</b> merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the IEEE in 1963. It was decided that <b>IRE's</b> Medal <b>of</b> Honor would be {{presented}} as IEEE's highest award, while the Edison Medal would become IEEE's principal medal.|$|R

5|$|After the 1971 primary, Combs {{retired from}} {{politics}} and resumed his law practice, maintaining {{an office in}} Frankfort. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> local environmentalist and author Harry M. Caudill, who asserted that Combs claimed to represent the powerless while actually representing the powerful. He {{was active in the}} formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education. He also served on President Jimmy Carter's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament.|$|E
5|$|As {{territorial}} {{governor of}} Montana, Leslie quickly drew the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> {{the press for}} his pro-temperance position. The territory's political machinery also turned against him, and he was removed from office by President Benjamin Harrison. When Grover Cleveland succeeded Harrison {{for a second term}} in office, he appointed Leslie district attorney for Montana. Leslie continued to practice law well into his eighties, and was being considered for a district court judgeship in Montana when he fell ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
50|$|Early {{participants}} in the inaugural conference in 1954 belonged to the Institute <b>of</b> Radio Engineers (<b>IRE)</b> Circuit Theory Group and the <b>IRE</b> subcommittee <b>of</b> Transistor Circuits. The conference was held in Philadelphia and local chapters <b>of</b> <b>IRE</b> and American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) were in attendance.

5|$|In the 1936 senatorial {{contest in}} Kentucky, {{incumbent}} Democrat Marvel Mills Logan {{was seen as}} vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary. This endorsement drew the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> Chandler's former ally, Democratic Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr., who believed that, {{in exchange for his}} support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler's political enemy {{for the rest of his}} political career.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miller {{earned the}} further <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> his CO by flying {{unauthorised}} leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports {{saying that the}} Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller {{came back to the}} air base and bellylanded. The plane broke apart and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Lindwall did not bounce Edrich, but Miller did, earning the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> the crowd. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, as England reached 174/3 at the close, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the pitching staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> Phillies fans, who were tired of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested he should be traded to another team.|$|E
5|$|The War Production Board {{was asked}} to keep stores in Oak Ridge {{well-stocked}} {{in order to reduce}} absenteeism among the workers. When shortages occurred, the relatively well-paid Oak Ridge residents bought up scarce goods in surrounding areas. In both cases, they attracted the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> their residents. Personnel employed by the Manhattan District were not exempted from being drafted under the Selective Service System. Efforts were made to employ draft-exempt personnel, and deferments were requested only for critical personnel, mainly young scientists and technicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{efforts of}} Miller and Lindwall against Hutton {{had led the}} English {{selectors}} to drop the Yorkshireman for the Third Test. The Australians were surprised by the move and {{thought that it was}} a bad move by their opponents. Miller had a quiet Third Test at Old Trafford, taking one wicket and scoring 31 as the match ended in a draw. In a rain-shortened match, Miller again earned the <b>ire</b> <b>of</b> the crowd, after aiming a series of bouncers at Edrich, in apparent retaliation to the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman ordered him to stop.|$|E
