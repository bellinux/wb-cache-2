40|$|AbstractA hybrid sulfur (HyS) {{flowsheet}} {{using an}} ionic liquid absorbent to separate SO 2 from oxygen has been developed. The key chemical reactors in the HyS flowsheet are a sulfuric acid distillation column, a sulfuric acid vaporization and decomposition reactor, a <b>knock-out</b> <b>drum</b> to separate SO 2 /O 2 -mixed {{gas from the}} SO 3 /H 2 O-recombined and condensed aqueous phase, a separation part of SO 2, and a SO 2 -depolarized electrolysis cell. The separation part of SO 2 consists of SO 2 absorption and desorption columns adopting a temperature swing methodology. The hydrogen production thermal efficiency of 39 % can be expected by this HyS process...|$|E
30|$|A {{protective}} layer or barrier {{on the material}} to avoid the {{direct contact with the}} process media will enhance the material and equipment life. The barrier layer can be paint, a coating or a lining, or a metallic lining or metallic sheets. There are also non-metallic linings like fiber glass, glass flake, epoxy, and rubber which are normally carried out on the equipment like separators, <b>knock-out</b> <b>drums,</b> and storage tanks. Nickel, zinc, and cadmium coatings are also preferred at times on certain components like flanges and bolting [20]. The Phillips Ekofisk wells with low levels of H 2 S, 90 lb in.− 2 CO 2, and up to 30, 000 ppm chloride levels were completed with N- 80 tubing. Even with batch inhibition, the tubing lasted only 19 months before it became perforated, and therefore, an extensive coating program was undertaken [64]. Where no inhibitor was injected, the coated tubing still only lasted about 19 months. Plastic coating on N- 80 pipe with inhibitor batch treatment every 30 days gave a tubing life of 7 years [65].|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{absolute}} {{necessity of}} compulsory fuel utilities, no matter small or big has resulted into substantial high hazards pollutants. Petroleum refineries are major industrial installations {{that are necessary}} for providing the best suited fuel for various necessary utilities, but are responsible of the emission of several hazardous pollutants into the atmosphere. Hydrocarbons {{are among the most}} perilous air pollutants that are emitted from almost all refining processes in petroleum refineries. Approach: Every day leaks and gaseous discharge from relief valves and liquid discharge, which are often directed to <b>knock-out</b> <b>drums,</b> are flared to minimize the impact of hydrocarbons emissions. But these flares are not that efficient and result into partial discharge of pollutants that have severe impact on the industrial area and urban localities in the vicinity of industrial refining complex. Results: In the present study, a thorough investigation has been completed to estimate the total emissions of sulfur dioxide SO 2 and non methane hydrocarbons NMHC (VOCs) and to assess their impact on the air quality in industrial and suburban areas. The latest version AMS/EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD) specially designed to support the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) s was used to predict the ground level concentrations of SO 2, VOCs from AL-Ahmadi and Al-Shuiba Refineries of total refining capacity of 646 thousand barrels/day. Conclusion/Recommendations: These concentrations are compared with EPA standards to indicate the ambient air quality. The dispersion model was corroborated with extensive one year hourly record of the surface and upper air meteorological data for year 2006 and emission rates of the specified pollutants, with detailed refinery stacks parameters, such as stack height, diameter, exit flue gas velocity and temperature to determine the fraction of total study area in the vicinity of refineries that had substantially high concentration of these pollutants. Its found that 10 % of selected area under study has exceedance for SO 2, 13 % exceedance for non-methane hydrocarbons NMHC, and there is no exceedance for NO 2 which is considered about 50 % of total NOx emissions...|$|R
40|$|Monoethanolamine (MEA) is {{commonly}} used in {{oil and gas industry}} as absorption medium to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) from gaseous stream. Upon usage, the MEA solution is contaminated with hydrocarbon and suspended solids. Heavily contaminated MEA solution reduces its effectiveness in stripping the CO 2 gas and also causes foaming phenomenon in the CO 2 removal unit which further reduces the overall performance of the unit. There are many instances in which during operation, the solution overshoot and mix with condensed water in the <b>knock-out</b> <b>drum.</b> At this point, all the solution (the contaminated solution and the condensed water) is discharged as wastewater and replaced with fresh solution. It is common, in the range of 60 – 80 tons of MEA wastewater is generated per month. This study was conducted to examine the best method of treating the MEA wastewater for {{the best interest of the}} company. Characterization of the MEA wastewater suggested that the most rational way of treating the wastewater was to achieve quality suited for the purpose of recycling it back into the system. Adsorption method was used for the treatment with four different types of adsorbent, namely chitosan, activated carbon, alum and zeolite, were investigated. Five different variables, namely adsorbent dosage, pH, temperature, mixing time and mixing speed were varied to examine the effect on the parameters such as percentage of residue oil, suspended solids, MEA concentration and COD level. The results showed that chitosan was the best adsorbent in treating the MEA wastewater, followed by activated carbon, alum and zeolite. Adsorbent dosage was the main variable affecting the performance of the adsorbent in removing the residue oil, suspended solids and reducing the COD level. Chitosan indicated two mechanisms of adsorption in treating the MEA wastewater, in which at low adsorbent dosage chitosan functioned through chemical adsorption, while at high dosage, electrostatic adsorption started to accompany. In all adsorbents investigated in this study, MEA concentration was not affected by the adsorption treatment...|$|E
40|$|The Liquid Phase Methanol (LPMEOHTM) Demonstration Project at Kingsport, Tennessee, is a $ 213. 7 million {{cooperative}} {{agreement between}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Air Products Liquid Phase Conversion Company, L. P. (the Partnership). Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) and Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman) formed the Partnership to execute the Demonstration Project. The LPMEOIYM Process Demonstration Unit was built at a site located at the Eastman complex in Kingsport. During this quarter, comments from the DOE on the Topical Report "Economic Analysis - LPMEOHTM Process as an Add-on to IGCC for Coproduction" were received. A recommendation to continue with design verification testing for the coproduction of dimethyl ether (DIME) and methanol was made. DME design verification testing studies show the liquid phase DME (LPDME) process will have a significant economic advantage for the coproduction of DME for local markets. An LPDME catalyst system with reasonable long-term activity and stability is being developed. A recommendation document summarizing catalyst targets, experimental results, and the corresponding economics for a commercially successful LPDME catalyst was issued on 30 June 1997. The off-site, product-use test plan was updated in June of 1997. During this quarter, Acurex Environmental Corporation and Air Products screened proposals for this task by {{the likelihood of the}} projects to proceed and the timing for the initial methanol requirement. Eight sites from the list have met these criteria. The formal submission of the eight projects for review and concurrence by the DOE will be made during the next reporting period. The site paving and final painting were completed in May of 1997. Start-up activities were completed during the reporting period, and the initial methanol production from the demonstration unit occurred on 02 April 1997. The first extended stable operation at the nameplate capacity of 80, 000 gallons per day (260 tons per day) took place on 06 April 1997. Pressure drop and resistance coefficient across the gas sparger {{at the bottom of the}} reactor increased over this initial operating period. The demonstration unit was shut down from 08 May - 17 June 1997 as part of a scheduled complex outage for the Kingsport site. During this outage, the gas sparger was removed, cleaned, and reinstalled. After completion of other maintenance activities, the demonstration unit was restarted, and maintained stable operation through the remainder of the reporting period. Again, the gas sparger showed an increase in pressure drop and resistance since the restart, although not as rapidly as during the April-May operation. Fresh oil was introduced online for the first time to a new flush connection on the gas inlet line to the reactov the flush lowered the pressure drop by 1 psi. However, the effects were temporary, and the sparger resistance coefficient continued to increase. Additional flushing with both fresh oil and entrained slurry recovered in the cyclone and secondary oil <b>knock-out</b> <b>drum</b> will be attempted in order to stabilize the sparger resistance coefficient...|$|E
