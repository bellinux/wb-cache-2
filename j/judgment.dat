40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the relationship between metacognitive <b>judgments</b> and accuracy in syllogistic reasoning. In three experiments, the participants made different types of metacognitive judgments: confidence <b>judgments,</b> <b>judgments</b> of performance and <b>judgments</b> of task difficulty. The confidence <b>judgments</b> were made (a) after producing a conclusion that logically followed from given premises (Experiment 1) and (b) after choosing the conclusion from a list of choices (Experiment 2), and <b>judgments</b> of performance were made (c) after a quick overview of a problem (Experiment 3). <b>Judgments</b> of difficulty were made before (Experiment 3) and after (Experiment 2) solving syllogistic problems. A total of 166 psychology students participated in the experiments. In all three experiments, participants were generally overconfident. The relative accuracy of <b>judgments</b> was generally low, with the exception of Experiment 1. The results do not indicate clearly that <b>judgments</b> made after solving tasks are more accurate than <b>judgments</b> made before solving them. The additional analysis by items showed positive correlations between different metacognitive <b>judgments</b> but lower correlations between <b>judgments</b> and reasoning accuracy, and negative correlations between metacognitive <b>judgments</b> and response times...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative <b>judgments</b> are an {{integral}} part of business valuation practice.

The solution to this problem is not the elimination of qualitative <b>judgments.</b> This is neither desirable nor possible.

40|$|The {{application}} of the formal framework of causal Bayesian Networks to children’s causal learning provides the motivation to examine the link between <b>judgments</b> about the causal structure of a system, {{and the ability to}} make inferences about interventions on components of the system. Three experiments examined whether children are able to make correct inferences about interventions on different causal structures. The first two experiments examined whether children’s causal structure and intervention <b>judgments</b> were consistent with one another. In Experiment 1, children aged between 4 and 8 years made causal structure <b>judgments</b> on a three-component causal system followed by counterfactual intervention <b>judgments.</b> In Experiment 2, children’s causal structure <b>judgments</b> were followed by intervention <b>judgments</b> phrased as future hypotheticals. In Experiment 3, we explicitly told children what the correct causal structure was and asked them to make intervention <b>judgments.</b> The results of the three experiments suggest that the representations that support causal structure <b>judgments</b> do not easily support simple <b>judgments</b> about interventions in children. We discuss our findings in light of strong interventionist claims that the two types of <b>judgments</b> should be closely linked. 10857...|$|R
