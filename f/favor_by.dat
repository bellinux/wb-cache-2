5|$|In 1920 {{the heirs}} of Venancio Sanchez {{filed a lawsuit}} against James Deering, {{claiming}} an undivided half interest in his Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort on Cape Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, the suit was finally decided in Deering's <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came too late for Deering; he had died the previous year.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|The {{democratic}} party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing {{to follow a}} populist policy in order to cajole the public. According to Aristotle, Pericles' stance {{can be explained by}} the fact that his principal political opponent, Cimon, was both rich and generous, and was able to gain public <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune. The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.|$|E

5|$|The two daily round-trips were branded Turboliner, {{replacing}} the individual names Abraham Lincoln and Prairie State. Amtrak repeated this {{experiment with the}} Detroit and Milwaukee corridors. Track conditions limited the new trainsets to , but they were clean, comfortable, quiet and reliable. In the first year, the Chicago–St. Louis running time dropped from 5.5 to 5 hours. The Federal Railroad Administration refused a request from Amtrak to raise the speed limit to , citing inadequate signalling along the route. The new trains {{had fallen out of}} <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> the end of 1974: food service was inadequate, and the five-car fixed consist could not handle demand. Amfleet coaches and new conventional diesels replaced both of the Turboliner trainsets in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, {{there have been some}} high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir {{maintained}} ties with, {{launched an}} assault on the Hajj caravan as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government), and discredited the governor of Damascus and amir al-hajj, Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is <b>favored</b> <b>by</b> the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not <b>favored</b> <b>by</b> the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species <b>favored</b> <b>by</b> a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less <b>favored</b> <b>by</b> that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|R

5|$|Multi-purpose types {{like the}} Charolais and the Morvan were slowly supplanted in farmers' <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> draft horses. The Nivernais breed, in particular, was {{preferred}} by farmers and threatened {{the existence of}} the Charolais. Thus, the original small multi-purpose strain of Charolais gave way to a type of small draft horse that was next crossed with purebred and crossbred Thoroughbreds until, by 1850, it had become a horse for cavalry purposes. It was thought by some enthusiasts, however, that this outcrossing reduced the quality of the breed, and many missed the old-style Charolais, which had disappeared {{due to a lack of}} demand and use. However, others thought that the outcrossings had benefited the Charolais breed: in 1919, one author stated that the breeding of the Charolais type was in excellent condition, and a report from the time stated that the favorite horse of King Albert I of Belgium was a Charolais named Titanic.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} earthquake, the News-Miner placed {{an order for}} a modern offset {{printing}} press. To house the new press, which could not fit in the Lathrop Building, Snedden ordered {{the construction of a}} new printing facility and office—named the Aurora Building—north of the Chena River. The Alaska Railroad sold Snedden the land for the building, which was built at a cost of $1 million in 1965. Snedden ordered the foundation for the new building to be raised 22 inches above the 100-year flood line. This fact saved the News-Miner two years later, when a massive flood swept through Fairbanks. The water was three inches deep throughout the paper's offices and even deeper in the press and boiler rooms, which were slightly below that raised level. The flood halted production for a time, and the Anchorage Times reciprocated the post-earthquake <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> publishing the News-Miner's masthead on its editions and posting occasional stories from Fairbanks until electrical power was restored to the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, {{president}} Teikun Ō is found dead, and Bansai attempts to rig Miwa's trial in her <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> manipulating Mikagami through {{the kidnapping of}} her adopted son, Shimon Aizawa. Edgeworth prevents this, and investigates the murder, learning that Teikun Ō has been dead for twelve years: the person previously {{thought to be the}} president was a body double, who had hired Hōinbō to kill the president to take his place, and was helped by Miwa and Bansai to cover up the crime. Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hyōdō to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hyōdō forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. Hōinbō found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw Hōinbō kill Teikun Ō on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed Hōinbō, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, manipulating them into killing Naitō and Kagome, and killing the body double. In addition, {{he was the one who}} attacked and framed Kay to ensure that Edgeworth got involved and exposed Bansai. Sarushiro is imprisoned, and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor.|$|E
