40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{is a critical}} variable in global change sciences. While most of the current global datasets provide only the <b>total</b> <b>downward</b> solar <b>radiation,</b> we aim to develop a method to estimate the downward global land surface solar radiation and its partitioned direct and diffuse components, which provide the necessary key meteorological inputs for most land surface models. We developed a simple satellite-based computing scheme to enable fast and reliable estimation of these variables. The global Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products at 1 ° spatial resolution for the period 2003 – 2011 were used as the forcing data. Evaluations at Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) sites show good agreement between the estimated radiation and ground-based observations. At all the 48 BSRN sites, the RMSE between the observations and estimations are 34. 59, 41. 98 and 28. 06 W∙m− 2 for total, direct and diffuse solar radiation, respectively. Our estimations tend to slightly overestimate the total and diffuse but underestimate the direct solar radiation. The errors {{may be related to}} the simple model structure and error of the input data. Our estimation is also comparable to the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) data while shows notable improvement over the widely used National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis data. Using our MODIS-based datasets of <b>total</b> solar <b>radiation</b> and its partitioned components to drive land surface models should improve simulations of global dynamics of water, carbon and climate...|$|R

25|$|Medical X-rays are a {{significant}} source of man-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the United States. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of <b>total</b> American <b>radiation</b> exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including nuclear medicine) accounted for 14% of <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than {{was the case in the}} early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular computed tomography (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.|$|R

40|$|The {{radiative}} {{heat transfer}} in oxy-fuel flames is compared to corresponding conditions in air-fuel flames during combustion of lignite in the Chalmers 100 kW oxy-fuel test facility. In the oxy-fuel cases the flue-gas recycle rate was varied, so that, in principle, the same stoichiometry was kept in all cases, whereas the oxygen fraction in the recycled flue-gas mixture ranged from 25 to 29 vol. %. Radial profiles of gas concentration, temperature and <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> intensity were measured in the furnace. The temperature, and thereby the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> intensity of the oxy-fuel flames, increases with decreasing flue-gas recycle rate. The ratio of gas and <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> intensities increases under oxy-fuel conditions compared to air-firing. However, when radiation overlap between gas and particles is considered the ratios for air-firing and oxy-fuel conditions become more similar, since the gas-particle overlap is increased in the CO 2 -rich atmosphere. A large fraction of the radiation in these lignite flames is emitted by particles whose radiation was not significantly influenced by oxy-fuel operation. Therefore, an increment of gas radiation due to higher CO 2 concentration is not evident because of the background of particle <b>radiation,</b> and, the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> intensities are similar during oxy-fuel and air-fuel operation {{as long as the}} temperature distributions are similar...|$|R

As the interatomic separation increases, the atomic population oscillates between these two states.
