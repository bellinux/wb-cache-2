25|$|Many {{species of}} animal live on Lüneburg Heath, {{particularly}} birds that are {{at home in the}} wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas.

In the Lüneburg Heath the population of the very rare black grouse is rising continually. In 2007 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003 the number of grouse has doubled.|$|E
25|$|As remarked above, the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> has {{apparently}} become extinct as a breeding bird in Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Overall, its stocks {{seem to be}} declining in the European part of its range since the 1970s. In North America, the populations {{seem to have been}} stable by contrast, except in the east. The increase and decline seem to be reactions to changing land use, with an increase as the number of agricultural workers declined after World War II and land fell fallow, declining again when land consolidation (see e.g. Flurbereinigung) had seriously depleted the number of hedgerows and similar elevated growth formerly common amidst the agricultural landscape. For such a predatory bird, the indiscriminate use of pesticides (which will accumulate in adult carnivores and inhibit breeding success) around the 1960s probably had a detrimental influence on stocks too.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> {{is common}} and {{widespread}} and {{not considered a}} threatened species by the IUCN (though they still include L. meridionalis in L. excubitor). Wherever it occurs, its numbers are usually many hundreds or even thousands per country. Its stronghold is the region around Sweden, where at least almost 20,000, {{perhaps as many as}} 50,000 were believed to live in the late 20th century. However, in some countries it is not robustly established; in Estonia only a few hundred are found, with less than 200 in Belgium and some more or less than 100 in Latvia and Lithuania, respectively. The few dozen in the Netherlands and the 10 birds or so in Denmark might disappear because of a few years of adverse circumstances. By contrast, in Luxembourg plentiful high-quality habitat is found; though the number of great grey shrikes in this tiny country is necessarily limited, the average population density there is 25 times as high as in Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|Most Lanius shrikes are solitary, {{except when}} {{breeding}} and are highly territorial. Northern or temperate {{species such as}} the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> and red-backed <b>shrikes</b> are migratory and winter well south of the breeding range.|$|R
25|$|Usually {{more than}} half of all nests manage to hatch at least one young, and around three-quarters of all eggs laid hatch, {{suggesting}} that if eggs are lost before hatching, it usually is the entire clutch. Half to three-quarters of the hatched young successfully fledge under most circumstances. They will become sexually mature in their first spring and often attempt to breed right away. On average, <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> get a chance at four breeding attempts during their life, with most birds in the wild getting eaten by a bird of prey or carnivorous mammal or dying of other causes before the end of their fifth winter. Raptorial birds are the main threat to shrikes after fledging, with regular predators including species as small as little owls (which are close to the same size as the shrike). The maximum documented lifespan, however, is 12 years.|$|R
25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by hitting {{it with the}} hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. <b>Great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and pulling it over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|R
25|$|The {{flight of}} the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> is undulating and rather heavy, but its dash is {{straight}} and determined. It is, as noted above, also capable of hovering flights, which last briefly but may be repeated time after time because of the birds' considerable stamina. It will usually stay low above the ground in flight, approaching perches from below and landing in an upward swoop. In social interactions, birds signal an aggressive stance by a bold upright posture, fanning and then flicking the tail and eventually the wings also as the bird gets more excited. It signals its readiness to strike at an intruder by shifting to a horizontal pose and fluffing its feathers, raising them into a small crest {{along the top of}} the head. Birds appease conspecifics by head-turns away from them (if close by), or by imitating the crouching fluttering pose and calls given by fledglings begging for food (if sitting father apart). The submission gesture to prevent an imminent attack by a conspecific is pointing the beak straight up.|$|E

25|$|<b>Great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> breed {{during the}} summer, {{typically}} once per year. In exceptionally good conditions, they raise two broods a year, {{and if the}} first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one. Their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter; birds often choose a different mate than the year before. To seek out potential mates, males will venture outside their breeding territories. If a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking, she will visit {{to see whether they}} get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer. The courtship period is generally longer than in the southern <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. meridionalis), usually starting about March and lasting to April/May. At first, the female rebuffs the male, only allowing him to feed her. Males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and turning away from the female. He also occasionally turns to sit at a right angle to her. Eventually, the female will join in the male's displays, and the songs will become duets. To feed females and to show off their hunting prowess, males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time. When presenting nesting sites, males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail.|$|R
500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrikes</b> or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and common teal, while common scoters, common eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|R

2500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> literally means [...] "sentinel butcher": Lanius is the Latin term for a butcher, while excubitor is Latin for a watchman or sentinel. This refers to the birds' two most conspicuous behaviours – storing food animals by impaling them on thorns, and using exposed tree-tops or poles to watch the surrounding area for possible prey. Use of the former by Conrad Gessner established the quasi-scientific term lanius for the shrikes. Linnaeus chose his specific name because the species [...] "observes approaching hawks and announces [...] of songbirds" [...] as he put it. This habit was also put to use in falconry, as fancifully recorded by William Yarrell later. The common English name [...] "shrike" [...] is from Old English scríc, [...] "shriek", referring to the shrill call.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> eats small {{vertebrates}} {{and large}} invertebrates. To hunt, this bird perches on the topmost {{branch of a}} tree, telegraph pole or similar elevated spot in a characteristic upright stance some meters/yards (at least one and up to [...] ) above ground. Alternatively, it may scan the grassland below from flight, essentially staying in one place during prolonged bouts of mainly hovering flight that may last up to 20 minutes. It will drop down in a light glide for terrestrial prey or swoop hawk-like on a flying insect. Small birds are sometimes caught in flight too, usually by approaching them from below and behind and seizing their feet with the beak. If no prey ventures out in the open, great grey shrikes will rummage through the undergrowth or sit near hiding places and flash their white wing and tail markings to scare small animals into coming out. As noted above, it will sometimes mimic songbirds to entice them to come within striking distance.|$|E

2500|$|A falconer's {{name for}} the <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> was mattages(s)(e), which is related to mat'agasse from the western Alps.

Shrike, meanwhile, is of Germanic origin also and dates back at least to Middle or Early Modern English schricum. This is related to such words as Norwegian and Swedish skrika ("shriek, [...] "), German Schrei ("scream") or Icelandic shrikja ("shrieker"). But it seems to have become the dominant term only in rather recent times, for as late as the 18th century, the species was still widely known as [...] "greater butcher-bird" [...] in English, just like it was known as the boucher ("butcher") in the French Jura.

As it seems, once an individual <b>great</b> <b>grey</b> <b>shrike</b> has found a wintering territory it likes, it will return there subsequently and perhaps even try to defend it against competitors just like a summer territory.
