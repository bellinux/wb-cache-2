5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that were {{closely tied to}} the political structure of the city. Some had acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first major group of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established formal and informal political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people <b>in</b> <b>African-American</b> neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white and increasingly Irish-American, seemed little inclined to try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E

5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention <b>in</b> <b>African-American</b> autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E

40|$|From the authors: In {{response}} to the letter from REICH [1], we are far from believing that sarcoidosis mortality is higher <b>in</b> <b>African-Americans</b> than <b>in</b> Caucasians, since we stated that mortality rates are reported to be similar among races [2]. We therefore agree with J. M. Reich 9 s qualification that findings of higher age-adjusted mortality rates reported among African-Americans than among Caucasians in the USA [3] reflect those of sarcoidosis incidence [4]. With reference to ethnic differences in disease severity, {{there is a general}} con-sensus from the review of large series that sarcoidosis in Blacks is more severe, and that Whites are more likely to present with asymptomatic disease [5]. As an example, the paper of GIDEON and MANNINO [3] reported that mortality rate <b>in</b> <b>African-Americans</b> peaked about 2 decades earlier than in Caucasians (ages 45 – 54 versus 75 – 84 yrs). This finding is taken as a further support of the notion that sarcoidosis <b>in</b> <b>African-Americans</b> has an earlier onset and a more aggressive course [4]...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the association of vitamin D 3 levels with breast cancer risk and progression <b>in</b> <b>African-Americans</b> and Hispanics. Methods: A total of 237 African-American (Cases = 119, Control = 118) and 423 Hispanic women (Cases = 124, Control = 299) were recruited in the study. Blood samples were collected {{at the time of}} breast cancer screening and prior to cancer treatment for 4 weeks on average for the cases. The serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D 3) was measured at a Quest-Diagnostics facility. Results: The results showed that 69. 2 % of African-Americans and 37. 8 % of Hispanics had 25 (OH) D 3 levels below 20 ng/mL. The 25 (OH) D 3 level below 20 ng/mL was significantly associated with breast cancer <b>in</b> both <b>African-Americans</b> (OR = 2. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 3 – 4. 8) and Hispanics (OR = 1. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 3. 0). However, the predicted probabilities of breast cancer <b>in</b> <b>African-Americans</b> were significantly higher than in Hispanics (p < 0. 001). The 25 (OH) D 3 below 20 ng/mL was significantly associated with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) <b>in</b> <b>African-Americans</b> (OR = 5. 4, p = 0. 02, 95 % CI = 1. 4 – 15), but not in Hispanics in our cohort of participants. Levels of 25 (OH) D 3 below 26 ng/mL predicts a decrease in disease-free survival, but it was not an independent predictor. Conclusions: Our data shows an association between 25 (OH) D 3 levels and the risk of breast cancer. Further studies on the relationship between 25 (OH) D 3 level and breast cancer risk are warranted...|$|R
