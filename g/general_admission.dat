Two wooden <b>general</b> <b>admission</b> seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats.

Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315people watched the Sounds play against the Columbus Astros.|$|E

5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the <b>general</b> <b>admission</b> area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
5|$|In {{its opening}} season, PNC Park's tickets were priced between $9 and $35for <b>general</b> <b>admission.</b> One {{of only two}} teams not to {{increase}} ticket prices entering the 2009 season, PNC Park ranked as having the third-cheapest average ticket prices {{in the league in}} 2009.

5|$|The first North American tickets {{went on sale}} in late March. Fans who {{purchased}} <b>general</b> <b>admission</b> {{tickets were}} given seating closest to the stage on a first-come, first-served basis. Presales were held for U2.com subscribers, with those holding membership the longest getting the first chance to purchase tickets. Sales were strong, with initial dates in Chicago and outside Boston and New York selling out within minutes once the public sale began, and with second shows being added at each venue. Due to the higher capacity of the 360 degree configuration, the shows often set records for the largest concert attendance at each venue; tour director Craig Evans claims the tour set attendance records for 60 different venues. Two of the U2 360° Tour's concerts remain {{in the top five}} highest-attended single concerts in the United States ever, with the 25 October performance in Pasadena, California, setting the record at 97,014 attendees.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with <b>general</b> <b>admission</b> tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E

According to newspaper reports, the tickets were non-transferable, and had the person's name printed on them.

The concert was held along with an accompanying art auction and dinner, to benefit Madonna's Raising Malawi foundation to support their projects like Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi, as well as art and education initiatives for impoverished children in the country. Madonna herself auctioned some of her art collection, as well as never-before-seen pictures from her marriage to actor Sean Penn, photographed by Herb Ritts.

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{finds that}} total revenues at {{minor league baseball}} games are influenced by marketing, economic factors, scheduling, and the weather. In particular, total gross revenues are an increasing function of marketing/promotions such as low value merchandise giveaways, high value merchandise giveaways, group discounts, and fireworks displays. Revenues are also an increasing function of the metropolitan area population and a decreasing function of poverty rates. Teams with higher priced <b>general</b> <b>admissions</b> tickets also experience higher revenues. Revenues are generally higher on Fridays and Saturdays and during July and August (and possibly June), while being lower on Mondays and Tuesdays and during May. Finally, inclement weather, especially rain, reduces revenues. ...|$|R
