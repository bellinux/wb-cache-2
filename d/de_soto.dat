5|$|At the New York Navy Yard, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{was fitted}} out for naval service, {{including}} {{the installation of}} a battery consisting of one 30-pounder Parrott rifle and eight 32-pound guns. She was then commissioned as USS <b>De</b> <b>Soto,</b> with Commander William M. Walker placed in command.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> replied that the previous relationship should stand. <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent to Key West for adjudication. On 27 April, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> continued the run of good luck, seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolutionary}} {{disturbances}} in, and friction between, Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{returned to the}} West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th. The steamer also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, {{with an eye on}} the unsettled conditions in Mexico, where a guerrilla war raged against the French occupation of the country. <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> remained in the region {{through the rest of the}} year before returning to Hampton Roads in the spring of 1867.|$|E
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{came to the}} chiefdom of Ichisi on March 25, 1539, {{and told}} the locals he would be merciful if their chief submitted. He visited two small towns and entered the main town of Ichisi, at the Lamar Mounds and Village Site, on March 30. The chief of Ichisi cooperated fully, and {{informed}} the Spanish about the nearby paramount chief, Ocute. <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> erected a wooden cross {{on one of the}} mounds before heading to Ocute.|$|E

5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> steamed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 28 August, {{and then}} {{proceeded}} to the New York Navy Yard in early September. There she was decommissioned on 11 September 1868.|$|E

25|$|Cars and lorries {{were also}} {{manufactured}} in Kew. After Chrysler bought the Maxwell Motor Company and their Kew works, the cars of the lighter Chrysler range– Chrysler Airflows, <b>De</b> <b>Sotos</b> and Plymouths— were assembled here until the Second World War. Dodge trucks assembly moved to Kew after Chrysler bought Maxwell. The various models of <b>De</b> <b>Sotos</b> were named Richmond, Mortlake and Croydon; Plymouths Kew Six and Wimbledon.|$|R
5000|$|One {{tradition}} says, {{the community}} was named for a member of <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> expedition, the maestro de campo (field commander) Luis de Moscoso (the source mistakenly indicates Francisco Coronado southwest expedition, but at this time Moscoso {{was a member of}} <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> expedition, furthermore he took command of the expedition after <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> death). During the settlement name registration there were a series of mistakes. The residents, in their application for a post office, had shortened it to Mosco. A postal clerk in Washington, upon receipt of their petition, being in a helpful spirit, and thinking the hay-seeds in the west didn't know their spelling, added a [...] "w" [...] to the name, changing it to Moscow.|$|R
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> then {{determined}} {{to set out}} for Cofitachequi. The people of Ocute explained that the great wilderness separated them, {{and that no one}} alive had ever crossed it due to the war, despite what De Soto's guide had claimed. Nevertheless, the army departed on April 13. A party from Ocute initially joined the Spanish to raid Cofitachequi, but <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> sent them home upon realizing there was no easy way through the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> was {{originally}} a privately owned vessel, built for passenger service between New York and New Orleans. With {{the outbreak of}} the Civil War in 1861, she was purchased by the Navy, commissioned as USS <b>De</b> <b>Soto,</b> and sent to assist with the blockade of Confederate ports. De Sotos speed made her an effective pursuit ship, and she would capture or bring about the destruction of a total of eighteen blockade runners during the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{withdrew the}} next day as well, {{carrying}} the wounded British sailors to Jamaica before putting into Port-au-Prince, to debark the many foreign refugees picked up at Cape Haiten. After consultations with the American Consul, Capt. Walker took <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> back to Cap-Haïtien on 7 November. There, he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS Galatea {{in the hopes of}} averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town, particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti. These talks failed and on 9 November, the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President Geffrard's forces. With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces, the rebel leaders took refuge on <b>De</b> <b>Soto.</b> Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the Dominican Republic. <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> returned to Cape Haiten {{to keep an eye on}} events until 13 December when she sailed for home, arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 December.|$|E

5|$|The steamer put to sea on 19 November with {{ordnance}} {{stores for}} Fort Pickens, Florida, and {{vessels in the}} Gulf of Mexico, arriving off Southwest Pass, Mississippi River, after 11 December. Joining the Gulf Blockading Squadron at that time, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> patrolled for Confederate blockade runners near Barataria Bay. Given the sometimes light winds of the Gulf and inshore waters, the vessel's shallow draft and steam power gave <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> an advantage over her mainly sail-powered prey. Cmdr. Walker's first month in the region began poorly, however, when his ship collided with the French war steamer Milan, then adrift off South West Pass, Mississippi River. Although damage to <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> was slight, the Milan was disabled and thus needed a tow into the Union anchorage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, <b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{continued}} {{to serve with}} the Navy, mostly in South American waters, until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship. She caught fire and was burned to the waterline in December 1870.|$|E
5|$|<b>De</b> <b>Soto</b> {{appears to}} have entered service in August 1859, {{carrying}} mail, passengers and specie between New York and New Orleans, with an intermediate stop at Havana, Cuba.

5000|$|Empirical {{studies by}} Argentine economists Sebastian Galiani and Ernesto Schargrodsky have taken issue with <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> link between titling and the {{increase}} in credit to the poor, but have also pointed out that families with titles [...] "substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and improved the education of their children relative to the control group". A study commissioned by DFID, an agency of the U.K. government, further summarized many of the complications arising from implementing <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> policy recommendations when insufficient attention is paid to the local social context.|$|R
5000|$|Ocala {{is located}} near what {{is thought to}} have been the site of Ocale or Ocali, a major Timucua village and chiefdom {{recorded}} in the 16th century.

The Spaniard Hernando <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> expedition recorded Ocale in 1539 during his exploration through what is today the southeastern United States. Ocale is not mentioned in later Spanish accounts; it appears to have been abandoned in the wake of <b>de</b> <b>Soto's</b> attack.|$|R
