5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic. The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in a synagogue reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. The ADL {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of <b>Jews,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fact that the character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published the strip, issued a similar statement in their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing the strip.|$|E

5|$|This passage {{has often}} been {{interpreted}} as {{a reference to the}} benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands. The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The two edicts (one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a post hoc fabrication. The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text of the biblical edicts.|$|E
