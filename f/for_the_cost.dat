5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create significant cost savings, but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were {{in line with the}} conclusions of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E

The £500,000 bill <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the expedition {{was sent to the}} Egyptian Government in Cairo for payment by the Egyptian taxpayers. The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E

A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E

While Borislow maintained that his company's actions were not illegal, he reached a settlement on April 15, agreeing to pay the state of Florida $125,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the investigation.

5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the financial responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E

5|$|The folios {{are made}} of vellum {{parchment}} primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.)

5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid.

In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of building another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million.
