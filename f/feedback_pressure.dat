40|$|Commercially used {{prostheses}} {{are essentially}} open-loop devices and provide {{little or no}} feedback to the amputee {{as to how much}} force they exerting with the terminal device, despite numerous attempts to provide closed loop control in prosthetics [1]. Providing <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback</b> clearly has great value for function of the prosthesis—the goal is for the amputee to ‘feel’ what they are holding. Indirect <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback</b> has been attempted by methods including vibration [2] and functional electrical stimulation [3, 4]. The information contained in these forms of feedback is not in the same modality as that which they sense. As a result, while providing information to the user, it is likely that it comes at the cost of increased mental load and low level of information transfer [5]. Patterson and Katz [6] have obtained better qualitative <b>feedback</b> with <b>pressure</b> to <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback</b> than with <b>pressure</b> to vibratory or electrical stimulation feedback, offering support for this suggestion. An adaptive process is still involved since the subject must learn to associate pressure in one area with pressure in another area. Ideally, the sensory nerve endings of the amputated area need to be stimulated in direct correlation to the function of the prosthesis. The recent work of Kuiken [7] has made this concept feasible by the use of targeted reinnervation. The potential thus exists for the subject to feel as if touch, pressure and even hot or cold temperatures are being exerted on their hand.

The essence of the control is to create a local perturbation, using piezo-ceramic actuators, on the surface near {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil, thus modifying the airfoil-vortex interactions. Both open- and closed-loop controls are used, where the surface perturbation was controlled by an external sinusoidal wave and a <b>feedback</b> <b>pressure</b> signal from a pressure transducer installed at the leading edge, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} anode and cathode compartments of a polymer electrolyte mem-brane (PEM) fuel cell stack is regulated along with the anode and cathode humidities using an anode recirculation system. The pressure regulation requirement stems from membrane safety considerations. The regulation of average humidities in the two compartments is a necessary (although not a sufficient) require-ment for stack water management. Two actuators in the anode recirculation system are considered, namely the dry hydrogen flow and the anode back pressure valve. These actuators are adjusted using a static output feedback controller that relies on pressure and humidity measurements on the anode side of the fuel cell stack. As the water mass dynamics and the character-istics of the water transport through the PEM are significantly different between subsaturated conditions (water is present only in vapor phase) and saturated conditions (liquid water along with water vapor), we show that {{the performance of the}} static output feedback controller with a fixed set of gains for subsaturated condition deteriorates significantly under a saturated condition. A gain-scheduled controller is therefore developed to compensate for a water-vapor saturated cathode condition. Analysis and sim-ulation provide insights on some of the design and implementation issues for the gain-scheduled output feedback system.

40|$|We present cosmological {{hydrodynamic}} simulations {{performed to}} study evolution of galaxy population. The simulations follow timed release of mass, energy, and metals by stellar evolution and employ phenomenological treatments of supernova feedback, pre-supernova feedback modeled as <b>feedback</b> by radiation <b>pressure</b> from massive stars, and quenching of gas cooling in large halos. We construct the fiducial model {{so that it}} reproduces the observationally estimated galaxy stellar mass functions and {{the relationships between the}} galaxy stellar mass and the host halo mass from $z = 4 $ to 0. We find that the fiducial model constructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, the galaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of the star-forming galaxies. The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling in large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2 $ and fail to reproduce galaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback</b> from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation. Furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes too steep at low redshift without the radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback.</b> The metallicity dependence in the radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback</b> is a key to explain the observed mass-metallicity relation. These facts indicate that these two processes in addition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution.

40|$|Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are {{the highly}} {{energetic}} explosions of massive stars (≳ 8 M☉) that are pervasive in their influence throughout astrophysics. They are the phenomenon with {{primary responsibility for}} enriching the universe {{with many of the}} heavy elements (like carbon and oxygen) that are needed for life, provide a critical <b>feedback</b> <b>pressure</b> which helps to shape the galaxies that host them, and are the likely formation mechanism for stellar mass black holes. In the past decade, the study of these explosions has been revolutionized by the advent of wide field, untargeted transient searches like Pan-STARRS 1 (PS 1). These new searches permit the discovery of SNe at unprecedented rates, and absent of many of the selection effects that have enforced biases on past, targeted transient searches. This thesis presents a broad survey of core-collapse SN phenomenology exhibited in the discoveries of untargeted searches, and statistically quantifies population properties of these explosions that link them to distinct classes of progenitor stars. Through studies of the host galaxy and explosion properties of extreme PS 1 -discovered events, and controlled samples of specific classes of core-collapse objects, we constrain the effect of progenitor star chemical composition (metallicity) on their eventual death states. We provide a new observational, photometric tool which lowers the cost of precisely and accurately measuring the metallicities of distant galaxies and supernova host environments. Moreover, we develop and apply a novel, multi-level Bayesian model for optical transient light curves which we apply to simultaneously interpret more than 20, 000 PS 1 images. This study illustrates how population-level modeling of data from large photometric surveys can yield improved physical inference on their progenitor stars through comparison to physical models. In the coming era, as next-generation facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come online, the supernova discovery rate will accelerate, far outpacing the community's capacity for detailed individual observational follow-up. New observational and statistical tools like those presented here will be critical to enable the next generation of studies in supernova astrophysics...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to assess the effect of synthetic jets on flow separation and provide a feedback control strategy for flow separation using synthetic jets. The feedback control synthesis is conducted based upon CFD simulation for a rounded backward-facing step. The results of the synthetic jet experiments on an airfoil showed that synthetic jets have the potential for controlling the degree of flow separation beyond delaying the onset of flow separation. In the simulation, while the jet is ejected slightly upstream from the separation point, the <b>feedback</b> <b>pressure</b> signal is acquired at a downstream wall point where the vortex is fully developed. Due to the uniqueness of synthetic jets, i. e. "zero-net-mass flux", the profile of synthetic jet velocity cannot be arbitrarily generated. The possible control variables are the magnitude or frequency of the oscillating jet velocity. Consequently, the fluidic system in simulation consists of the actuator model and the NARMAX (Nonlinear Auto Regressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) flow model. This system shows a strong nonlinear pressure response to the input jet frequency. Low-pass filtering of the pressure response, introduced for pressure recovery, facilitates a quasi-linear approximation of the system in the frequency domain using the describing function method. The low-pass filter effectively separates the pressure response into two frequency bands. The lower frequency band below the filter pass frequency includes the quasi-linear response targeted by the feedback control and the higher band above the filter stop frequency contains the attenuated higher harmonics, which are treated as nonlinear disturbances. This quasi-linear approximation is utilized to design a PI controller for the fluidic system including the synthetic jet. To ensure one-to-one correspondence of the jet frequency and the filtered pressure response, the upper bound of the jet frequency is set at the frequency of the maximum pressure. The response of the resulting closed loop feedback control system, comprised of a PI controller, low-pass filter, SJA model and NARMAX model, is shown to track the desired pressure command with an improvement in the transient response over the open-loop system...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{consequences}} of a nuclear criticality accident in aqueous fissile solutions is necessary to design the processing equipment for such solutions. The data at the disposal of designers before 1967 was provided by actual critically accidents. In 1968, the Service d'Etudes de Criticite of the French Commissariat a L'Energie Atomique initiated a program of systematic experimental aqueous solution nuclear excursions which were initiated intentionally to obtain solution criticality accident data. This program was designated "Consequence Radiologiques d'un Accident de Criticite" (CRAC). Although not intended to study the evolution of a solution nuclear criticality accident, the Kinetic Experiment on Water Boiler (KEWB) demonstrated the dependence of the nuclear excursion on parameters such as solution temperature and radiolytic gas. Similarly, the CRAC program results indicated the excursion was governed by parameters such as the solution addition rate, initial neutron population, solute concentration, and thermal and radiolytic gas feedback. The energy deposited in a fissile solution is the sum of the energies contributed by the radiation sources. The majority of the energy is deposited by the fission fragments. One feature of the energy deposition is a commensurate increase in the system temperatures which affects the solution volume and thereby the neutron leakage probability. A second feature is the decomposition of the water molecule which results in release of H(, 2) and O(, 2) in the solution. Microbubbles are nucleated in the fissile solution by a localized thermal spike generated by a fission fragment. Initially, the microbubble contains a mixture of radiolytic gas and water vapor. Below the boiling point the vapor condenses quickly, leaving a gas microbubble. Unless the solution is supersaturated, the gas bubble will dissolve in a few microseconds. However, in a supersaturated solution the bubble will grow and produce negative feedback by increasing neutron leakage. The analysis for this study employs two mathematical models for the radiolytic gas feedback. One assumes the radiolytic gas concentration is a linear function of the energy release and the nucleation rate is a linear function of the power (Energy model). The other assumes a correlation between the system pressure and the radiolytic gas <b>feedback</b> (<b>Pressure</b> model). Both models have been incorporated into a space-independent kinetic computer code, MACKIN, while the pressure model was also incorporated into a space-dependent code, AZPAD, (Space-dependent model). The model incorporation provides a numerical tool with which to analyze a nuclear excursion in an aqueous fissile solution. The models have been successful in predicting the peak power, burst energy, and maximum system pressure for the first burst in both KEWB and CRAC experiments...|$|E

This thesis discusses the vibration problems in the cranes used in commercial forestry machines. Two control methods, adaptive filtering and semi-active damping, are presented.

The payload estimation algorithm, filtering of control signal and algorithm for calculation of the lowest natural frequency of the crane are presented. The semi-active damping method is basedon <b>pressure</b> <b>feedback.</b> The <b>pressure</b> vibration, scaled with suitable gain, is added to the control signal of the valve of the lift cylinder to suppress vibrations. The adaptive filter cuts off high frequency impulses coming from the operatorand semi-active damping suppresses the crane?s oscillation, which is often caused by some external disturbance.

The case of British Petroleum's (BP) Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill is discussed by analyzing the supply chain of information flow throughout the incident. The slow recovery of DWH was due to inadequate information flows within BP. The misinterpretation of {{the scale of the}} spill was due to inadequate communication between BP and the external bodies (i. e. media, regulators and governmental bodies). This inadequacy was due to a risk culture within the supply chain of information flow, leading to a case of systematic risk of information flow, illustrated in this study by the "Swiss Cheese" theory. The different incentives of engineers (i. e. keeping their jobs), top management and chief executive (i. e. reducing costs), played a major part in the build up to the DWH disaster, as the company chose to protect shareholders' interest by aiming to maximize profit; leading BP to adopt a hidden polluting culture. The lessons learnt from DWH will determine the possibilities of mitigating such crises in future through changing the culture of risk management by incorporating an agile information flow system into oil companies' supply chain.
