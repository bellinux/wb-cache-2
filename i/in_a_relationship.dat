40|$|Romantic <b>relationship,</b> <b>a</b> {{widespread}} {{feature of}} human society, {{is one of}} the most influential factors in daily life. Although stimuli related to romantic love or being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship</b> commonly result in enhancement of activation or functional connectivity of the reward system, including the striatum, the structure underlying romantic relationship-related regions remain unclear. Because individual experiences can alter gray matter within the adult human brain, we hypothesized that romantic relationship is associated with structural differences in the striatum related to the positive subjective experience of being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship.</b> Because intimate romantic relationships contribute to perceived subjective happiness, this subjective enhancement of happiness might be accompanied by the experience of positive events related to being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship.</b> To test this hypothesis and elucidate the structure involved, we compared subjective happiness, an indirect measure of the existence of positive experiences caused by being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship,</b> of participants with or without romantic partners (N = 68). Furthermore, we also conducted a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study of the effects of being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship</b> (N = 113). Being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship</b> was associated with greater subjective happiness and reduced gray matter density within the right dorsal striatum. These results suggest that being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship</b> enhances perceived subjective happiness via positive experiences. Furthermore, the observed reduction in gray matter density in the right dorsal striatum may reflect <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> saliency of social reward within <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship.</b> Thus, being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>relationship</b> is associated with positive experiences and a reduction of gray matter density in the right dorsal striatum, representing a modulation of social reward...|$|R
