40|$|International audienceIntroduction Muscle {{vibration}} {{can be used}} {{to improve}} the center of pressure (CoP) shift. Several muscle sites have been used for various diseases without that we know their respective interest. Objective To compare the effects and post-effects of neck muscle vibrations (NMV) and gluteus medius vibrations (GMV) on balance in healthy subjects Methods Thirteen healthy subjects, mean: 23 years, right handed were tested on posturography, closed eyes, in standing position. They received successively left NMV and right GMV in a randomized order. The variation of the deviation of CoP on the médiolatéral plane was evaluated under vibration stimulation (5  min), {{at the end of the}} vibration and 5 minutes after. Results GMV induce a CoP movement to left side (9 responders) (mean: 5. 21 mm; SD: 4. 79; P = 0. 003). At the end of the vibration, the effect remained significant (mean: 4. 73, SD: 4. 02; P = 0. 001) and after 5 minutes, the subjects restored their initial balance (mean: 1. 25, SD: 6. 82; P = 0. 33). For NMV, a movement toward left side was observed only in 5 subjects but this deviation seemed to be maintained at 5  min. The CoP deviation was not significant during (P = 1), immediately after (P = 0. 72), and after 5 minutes of NMV (P = 0. 89). Discussion GMV cause a lateral shift in 70 % of the subjects of nearly 5 mm. The effect of NMV was lower and less constant (only 5 responders) but sustainable. This could be explained by a sensorimotor peripheral action for GMV while NMV would involve <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>body</b> representation in spac...|$|E

College men (N= 100) were surveyed on these variables. It was hypothesized that males with greater body dissatisfaction would have lower levels of self-esteem. Further, it was expected that males who were more frequently exposed to the body ideal would have <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, and that males who do not participate in a college sport would have <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction than those who do. Results show a significant relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem, such that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction are associated with low levels of self-esteem. A positive correlation was found between exposure to the media ideal and <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, such that increased exposure was associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the hypothesis that mental health impairment in underweight women, where this occurs, is due to an association between low body weight and elevated <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and/or eating-disordered behaviour. Methods Subgroups of underweight and normal-weight women recruited from a large, general population sample were compared on measures of body dissatisfaction, eating-disordered behaviour and mental health. Results Underweight women had significantly greater impairment in mental health than normal-weight women, even after controlling for between-group differences in demographic characteristics and physical health. However, {{there was no evidence}} that <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction or eating-disordered behaviour accounted for this difference. Rather, underweight women had significantly lower <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and eating-disordered behaviour than normal-weight women. Conclusions The findings suggest that mental health impairment in underweight women, where this occurs, is unlikely to be due to <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction or eating-disordered behaviour. Rather, lower <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and eating-disordered behaviour among underweight women may counterbalance, to some extent, impairment due to other factors. </p...|$|R

A new approach, object-oriented programming, was used to develop a finite element code that is easier to apply, understand, and modify. Object-oriented code is easier to understand, as the characteristics and operations associated with a physical phenomena are grouped in a class whose structure closely parallels the modeled entity. Elements, bodies, joints, and mechanisms are modeled as classes. Program application is facilitated by a hierarchy of class structure. Manipulation of <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>body</b> and mechanism class types direct the complicated, lower level code of element calculations. Lower level code is hidden in an object library resulting in a shorter, simpler driver program for an analysis.

The paper analyzes changes in local resource management strategies and {{the environmental impact of}} centralized irrigation {{management in}} the Indus Basin since the mid- 19 th century.

The study examined reasons for exercise and level of exercise as potential moderators of the relationship between body appreciation and exercise. Three hypotheses were tested: there will be sex differences in <b>level</b> of <b>body</b> appreciation, there will be a positive relationship between <b>body</b> appreciation and <b>level</b> of exercise, and the relationship will be moderated by reason for exercise - either health or appearance reason and exercise level. Two-hundred-eighty-nine participants selected from an introductory psychology course pool responded to four questionnaires: the Body Appreciation Scale (BAS), the Reasons for Exercise Inventory (REI), the Exercise Motivations Inventory- 2 (EMI- 2), and an inquiry about physical activities. The first two hypotheses were supported: males had <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>body</b> appreciation than females, and the more males and females exercised, the <b>higher</b> the <b>level</b> of <b>body</b> appreciation.
