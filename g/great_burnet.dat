50|$|On 18 March 1718 he {{was created}} Viscount Fordwich and Earl Cowper, {{and a month}} later he {{resigned}} office on the plea of ill-health, but probably in reality because George I accused him of espousing the Prince of Wales's side in his quarrel with the king. Taking the lead against his former colleagues, Cowper opposed the proposal brought forward in 1719 {{to limit the number}} of peers, and also the Bill of Pains and Penalties against Atterbury in 1723. Cowper was not a <b>great</b> lawyer, but <b>Burnet</b> says that he managed the Court of Chancery with impartial justice and great despatch; the most eminent of his contemporaries agreed in extolling his oratory and his virtues. It is notable that Queen Anne, despite her prejudice against the Whigs in general, came to have a great respect and liking for Cowper, and continued to seek his advice even after he left office as Lord Chancellor.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} wooded, with {{some areas of}} rough pasture and herbs, {{and a large number}} of slowworms. The {{grassland}} has a variety of wild flowers including burnet saxifrage and the rare <b>great</b> <b>burnet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Damp {{areas within}} the meadows provide habitat for ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi), <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> (Sanguisorba officinalis), {{northern}} marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza purpurella), devil’s bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh ragwort (Senecio jacobea) and carnation-grass (Carex panicea).|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{traditionally}} managed grassland on calcareous loam, which {{is rare in}} Britain. It has mature hedgerows {{and it has a}} rich variety of plants such as salad burnet, dropwort, <b>great</b> <b>burnet,</b> green-winged orchid and adder's-tongue fern.|$|E
50|$|This {{hay meadow}} is {{traditionally}} managed. The main flora are crested dog's-tail and common knapweed, with meadow foxtail and <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> in wet areas. Springs produce seepages which {{are rich in}} mosses and sedges. Dry upper slopes are species poor.|$|E
50|$|This meadow {{has never}} been {{ploughed}} and it is managed in a traditional way to encourage uncommon plants, such as <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> and pepper-saxifrage. There are amphibians including frogs and toads, and butterflies including meadow browns, orange-tips, peacocks, ringlets and small tortoiseshells.|$|E
50|$|Signs {{of medieval}} ridge and furrow still survive on these {{traditionally}} managed hay meadows in Mill Crook {{on the bank}} of the River Tove. It has diverse flora, with grasses such as meadow foxtail and sweet vernal-grass, and herbs including <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> and ribwort plantain.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} typical {{unimproved}} London Clay grassland. Damp, herb rich areas have uncommon plants characteristic of old meadows such as <b>great</b> <b>burnet,</b> sneezewort and devil's bit scabious. The brook is lined by sedges and water-cress, while breeding birds include yellowhammer and spotted flycatcher.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of {{this species}} look like {{caterpillars}}, but they have five pairs of prolegs, while caterpillars have four pairs. The larvae feed on the leaves of brambles (hence the common name), mainly blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> (Sanguisorba officinalis).|$|E
50|$|Species {{that are}} present in {{abundance}} include <b>great</b> <b>burnet,</b> Sanguisorba officinalis, wood crane's-bill, Geranium sylvaticum, and meadowsweet, Filipendula ulmaria, while common spotted orchid, Dactylorhiza fuchsii, and early purple orchid, Orchis mascula, are among the species found on the steeper, uncut banks within the meadows.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is old {{ridge and}} furrow {{grassland}} {{which has been}} traditionally managed. The dominant grasses are Common Bent, Red Fescue, Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog. Flowering herbs include Cowslip, Pepper Saxifrage, Yellow-rattle, Ox-eye Daisy, <b>Great</b> <b>Burnet,</b> the Green-winged Orchid and Corky-fruited Water Dropwort.|$|E
50|$|The reserve flora {{includes}} {{common meadow-rue}} and <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> which {{is typical of}} old, unimproved neutral meadows. There are {{a large number of}} plant types recorded in the wooded bank, fields, and ditches. There is golden dock, trifid bur-marigold, purple loosestrife and several species of sedge.|$|E
50|$|This site is in two areas, Wicksteed Water Meadows and Castle Field. Water meadows are flooded {{by people}} for {{agricultural}} purposes, unlike flood meadows which are under water when river levels are high. Flora include <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> and marsh marigold, {{and there are}} also grass snakes.|$|E
50|$|Rowley Lodge Field {{is an old}} hay meadow, with flower rich {{grassland}} {{and scattered}} oak trees. It has a good diversity of wild flowers, including <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> and pignut, both characteristic of unimproved grassland. Patches of acid grassland are dominated by red fescue, and also contain abundant sheep's sorrel and tormentil.|$|E
50|$|The main {{interest}} in the site lies in its traditionally-managed hay meadows, which support {{a wide variety of}} grasses, such as common bent, Agrostis capillaris, sweet vernal-grass, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and red fescue, Festuca rubra, and forbs, such as meadowsweet, Filipendula ulmaria, marsh marigold, Caltha palustris, and <b>great</b> <b>burnet,</b> Sanguisorba officinalis.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 rare fungus Haasiella venustissima, {{previously}} {{found in}} only two localities in Czechoslovakia, {{was found in the}} area. Also found in the reeds are tufted sedge (Carex cespitosa), bistort (Persicaria bistorta) and <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> (Sanguisorba officinalis). In the past western marsh orchids and black poplars, could be found, but they have not been seen in recent years.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{important}} as preserving a rich assemblage of plant species, in a habitat that {{is becoming increasingly}} scarcer {{as a result of}} intensive agricultural practices. A wide variety of flowering plants is found, many in abundance, such as wood cranesbill, Geranium sylvaticum, meadow saxifrage, Saxifraga granulata, melancholy thistle, Cirsium helenioides, and <b>great</b> <b>burnet,</b> Sanguisorba officinalis.|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{grasses and}} herbs which {{are typical of}} wet neutral meadows. Species include narrow-leaved water-dropwort (Oenanthe silaifolia), {{which is one of}} the largest populations in Great Britain. There is crested dog's tail, meadow foxtail, meadow buttercup, <b>great</b> <b>burnet</b> and meadow vetchling. The national scarce mousetail is recorded for this site (one of three locations in Gloucestershire).|$|E
5000|$|The larva of {{this species}} first feeds on Sanguisorba officinalis (<b>great</b> <b>burnet),</b> then moves onto ant nests and is a {{predator}} of the ant brood. Myrmica rubra and Myrmica scabrinodis have been reported as frequent host ant species. A recent microhabitat preference study indicates that grazing is necessary for maintaining the present distribution and abundance of these butterflies.|$|E
