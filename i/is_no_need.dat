5|$|In recent years, {{this latter}} {{argument}} has been fortified by {{the theory of}} connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning {{and other forms of}} representation are highly distributed and parallel. This would tend to indicate that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They {{are often}} called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship {{and for their}} ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.|$|E

5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart {{instead of his}} mind. Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E
5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even {{tens of thousands of}} hours.|$|E

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need,</b> under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data sequentially, the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file. If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block. It will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the read-erase-modify-write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

25|$|High {{concentrations}} of cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the catalyst {{of one of}} the rate-limiting steps of glycolysis. This effect is advantageous: high {{concentrations of}} citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ATP, another sign that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to carry out glycolysis.|$|E
