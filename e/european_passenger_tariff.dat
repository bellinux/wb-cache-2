50|$|As {{a result}} of capitalization, the state succeeded in {{transforming}} subsidies {{in the order of}} $10 million annually to the former ENFE into income through taxes and fees of about $2.5 million. The private companies met their investment commitments. In addition, the average train speed increased; less derailment occurred and the cost of freight transportation was reduced. However, <b>passenger</b> <b>tariffs</b> were raised, in part because they were previously subsidized. At the same time, the coverage of the rail system was reduced by closing several unproductive branches, which Were returned by the private companies to the State. In fact, 3692 km were transferred to private enterprises in 1997 and in 2011 they operated 1954 km, that is 47.1% less.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{service was}} {{abandoned}} in 1932 and the railway operated solely as a freight line, {{with the exception}} of offering passenger carriage in the line's cabooses. This situation lasted until the 1960s, with the parent company reportedly having forgotten to formally abandon the <b>passenger</b> <b>tariff.</b> The electrification was dismantled after this point except in Modesto, where a city ordinance prohibited the operation of steam locomotives. The railway therefore retained 2.1 miles of electrification within Modesto, and the railway's two steeplecab electric locomotives. Outside Modesto, all freight traffic was now steam hauled. Additional steam locomotives were borrowed from the Western Pacific when needed. In 1940, a former Sierra Railroad steam engine was acquired.|$|R
