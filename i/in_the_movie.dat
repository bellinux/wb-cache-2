40|$|This study {{assessed}} whether smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> {{was associated}} with smoking in young adults. A national web-enabled cross-sectional survey of 1528 young adults, aged 18 – 25, was performed between September and November 2005. Logistic regression and path analysis using probit regression {{were used to assess}} relationships between exposure to smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> and smoking behavior. Analysis was completed in December 2006. Exposure to smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> predicted current smoking. The adjusted odds of current smoking increased by a factor of 1. 21 for each quartile increase in exposure to smoking (p� 0. 01) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies,</b> reaching 1. 77 for the top exposure quartile. The unadjusted odds of established smoking (100 � cigarettes with current smoking) increased by 1. 23 per quartile (p� 0. 001) of exposure, reaching 1. 86 for the top quartile. This effect on established smoking was mediated by two factors related to smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movies: positive expectations about smoking and exposure to friends and relatives who smoked, with positive expectations accounting for about two thirds of the effect. The association between smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> and young adult smoking behavior exhibited a dose–response relationship; the more a young adult was exposed to smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies,</b> <b>the</b> more likely he or she would have smoked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 30 days or have become an established smoker.
