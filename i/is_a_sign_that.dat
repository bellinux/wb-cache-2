5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E

25|$|A 2015 {{study by}} climate {{scientists}} Michael Mann of Penn State and Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research {{suggests that the}} observed cold blob in the North Atlantic during years of temperature records <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the Atlantic Ocean’s Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may be weakening. They published their findings, {{and concluded that the}} AMOC circulation shows exceptional slowdown in the last century, and that Greenland melt is a possible contributor.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a trunk rot caused by Poria spiculosa. Cankers vary {{in size and}} {{appearance}} depending on their age. A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound. On large trees these may become prominent burl-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering. A single trunk canker near the base <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull.|$|E
25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared {{and go back to}} sleep for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the winter is not over yet. If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E
25|$|During the Byzantine times Patras {{continued}} {{to be an important}} port as well as an industrial center. In 551 AD it was laid in ruins by an earthquake. In 807 AD it was able without external assistance to repulse a Slavonian siege, though most of the credit of the victory was assigned to St Andrew, whose church was enriched by the imperial share of the spoils, and whose archbishop was made superior of the bishops of Methone, Lacedaemon and Corone. Besides, one of the most scholarly philosophers and theologians of the time, Arethas of Caesarea was born at Patras, at around 860. In the 9th century there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the city was prosperous: the widow Danielis from Patras had accumulated immense wealth in land ownership, carpet and textile industry and offered critical support in the ascent of Basil I to the Byzantine throne.|$|E

25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched {{after a minute or}} so of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E
25|$|In early 2012, the infighting {{between the}} Rojos and the Metros that left bloody {{confrontations}} and high-ranking arrests has diminished. Nonetheless, the Gulf Cartel {{had to change}} its logistics and reconstruct how it manages regional bosses, while other sources say that the Rojos are no longer part of the cartel. In the end, the control fell to the cartel members of the Metros faction, although the Rojos still has significant manpower. The Rojos and the forces loyal to the Cardenas drug family have barricaded in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, while their leader Juan Mejía González has fallen off the radar {{and has not been}} heard off since then. A day after several members of the Metros put up banners commemorating the late Samuel Flores Borrego on 6 August 2012, gunfighting occurred in the city, and the Metros' push in Matamoros <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> they are determined to remove people who turned against the organization in the past.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} terminus of the freeway, SR 143 {{begins at the}} intersection of 48th Street and Broadway, climbing over Interstate 10 on the original 48th Street bridge built without any shoulder lanes in 1967. Traffic heading southbound at this point is warned of a traffic signal that hides over the optical horizon of the overpass to most traffic. To combat safety issues raised by the lack of visibility of the main traffic signals, a second traffic signal was installed at a higher elevation so that it is visible to traffic on the northern approach of the overpass. At one point, the second signal included a high-intensity strobe embedded in the red signal; however, the strobe has since been removed. In addition to the strobing signal light, rumble strips have been cut into the bridge deck at several intervals, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> turns on if the signal is red and the speed limit is reduced, further alerting traffic that the freeway is ending.|$|E

500|$|Courtship {{begins with}} the {{dominant}} male approaching the female, who then assumes a low-head posture and urinates. Unresponsive females run away on being pursued by a male.

On mounting, the males tries to clasp her flanks tightly. If she stands firmly, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> she is ready to mate.

500|$|Known as Manulab to {{the people}} of Nissan Island, the white-bellied sea eagle is {{considered}} special and killing it is forbidden. Its calls at night are said to foretell danger, and seeing a group of calling eagles flying overhead <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> someone has died. [...] Local Malay folk tales tell of the white-bellied sea eagle screaming to warn the shellfish of the turning of tides, and a local name burung hamba siput translates as [...] "slave of the shellfish". Called Kaulo in the recently extinct Aka-Bo language, the white-bellied sea eagle was held to be the ancestor of all birds in one Andaman Islands folk tale. On the Maharashtra coast, their name is kakan and its call is said to indicate the presence of fish in the sea. They sometimes nest on coconut trees. Owners of the trees destroy the nest to avoid attacks when harvesting the coconuts.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Lennon and Ono {{released}} an 81-minute film {{to accompany the}} Imagine album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park {{as well as in}} New York City. A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song [...] "Imagine" [...] begins. Above the front door to their house <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> reads: [...] "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression. At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.|$|E
500|$|Following the episode's release, ScreenRant's Andre Dyce {{reviewed}} the series' ratings performance {{up to that}} point, noting that over 7 million viewers is [...] "still {{a far cry from}} trouble on their own", but as the show [...] "continues to slip in both viewers and demographics, the trend could become problematic." [...] He noted that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had [...] "some of the highest ratings in recent history" [...] for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but [...] "the fact that [...] can’t seem to hold steady in its fifth week <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> it may be charting troubled waters ... A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience." [...] He remembered that much of the MCU films' large fanbase had been expected to watch the series and provide [...] "a healthy viewership", and how, if this was going to happen, [...] "enthusiasm seems to be waning" [...] among those fans now.|$|E

500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.|$|E
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|She {{appeared}} as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer (Sean Combs), in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball. Her performance {{was awarded the}} National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress; in an interesting coincidence {{she became the first}} woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Actress (earlier in her career, she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge, the first African American to be nominated for Best Actress, and who was born at the same hospital as Berry, in Cleveland, Ohio). The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, {{and it would be a}} really special script that would require something like that again." ...|$|E
