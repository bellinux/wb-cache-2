5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross was {{released}} on the PlayStation on November 18, 1999 in Japan and on August 15, 2000 in North America. The story <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> remake of Radical Dreamers, and as such replaces it as Chrono Triggers successor. The protagonist Serge, faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, struggles to uncover his past and meets Kid, a thief seeking the mysterious Frozen Flame artifact. Serge and Kid's fates are ultimately revealed to find their roots in the events of Chrono Trigger.|$|E

25|$|Canadian whiskies are {{available}} {{throughout the world}} and are a culturally significant export. Well known brands include Crown Royal, Canadian Club, Seagram's, and Wiser's among others. The historic popularity of Canadian whisky in the United States <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> result of rum runners illegally importing it into the country {{during the period of}} American Prohibition.|$|E
25|$|According to Aurobindo, {{the body}} <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> {{creation}} of the inconscient or subconscient. According to The Mother, the ordinary, false consciousness, which is common to material body-consciousness, {{is derived from the}} subconscient and the inconscient. According to Aurobindo, the outer being depends on the subconscient, which hinders the spiritual progress. Only by living in the inner being can this obstacle be overcome.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, the Jewellery Quarter was {{mentioned}} as being {{at risk of}} flooding by Gareth Morgan, an environment expert at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, due to the rising water table {{in the city and}} its location adjacent to Birmingham's canal network. The rising water table <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> result of the loss of heavy industry which used to remove large quantities of water.|$|E

25|$|In many quarters, {{electrolytic}} capacitors are considered very unreliable components {{when compared to}} other passives. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> function of the history of these components. Capacitors manufactured during and before World War II sometimes suffered from contamination during manual manufacturing, and in particular chlorine salts were often the reason for corrosive processes leading to high leakage currents. Chlorine acts on aluminum as a catalyst for the formation of unstable oxide without becoming chemically bound itself.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, UV {{intensity}} can {{be higher}} or lower for surfaces at different angles to the horizontal. For example, if people are walking or standing outdoors, UV exposure to the eyes and vertical surfaces of skin, such as the face, can actually be more severe {{when the sun is}} lower (though UVB:UVA ratio can also differ), such as the end of a summer's day, or winter afternoons on a ski trail. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> consequence {{of the fact that the}} measurement equipment upon which the index is based is a flat horizontal surface.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} 1797–1801 Burney wrote three comedies {{that were not}} to be {{published}} in her lifetime: Love and Fashion, A Busy Day and The Woman Hater. The last <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> reworking of subject-matter from The Witlings, but with the satirical elements toned down and more emphasis placed on reforming her characters' faults. The play, first performed in December 2007 at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, UK, retains one of the central characters, Lady Smatter – an absent-minded but inveterate quoter of poetry, perhaps meant as a comic rendering of a Bluestocking. All the other characters in The Woman Hater differ from those in The Witlings.|$|E

It <b>is</b> also <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> statement of his views on wilderness and the state of the environmental movement.|$|R

25|$|The {{angle of}} view of a lens depends upon its focal length and the camera's image sensor size; a sensor smaller than 35mm film format (36×24mm frame) gives a {{narrower}} {{angle of view}} for a lens of a given focal length than a camera equipped with a full-frame (35mm) sensor. As of 2017, only a few current DSLRs have full-frame sensors, including the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, EOS 5D Mark IV, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS 6D Mark II; Nikon's D5, D610, D750, D810, and Df; and the Pentax K-1. The scarcity of full-frame DSLRs <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> result of the cost of such large sensors. Medium format size sensors, such as those used in the Mamiya ZD among others, are even larger than full-frame (35mm) sensors, and capable of even greater resolution, and are correspondingly more expensive.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic Church {{broke from}} the other Eastern Orthodox Churches in 451 AD. After that date, the Copts, then a great {{majority}} of the Egyptian population, were shunned and often persecuted by their Byzantine rulers until the conquest of Egypt by Islam, after which the slowly declining Coptic population was in a rather precarious position. Coptic architecture therefore lacked the lavish patronage of rulers and the Court, which was directly responsible for most of the important buildings of Byzantine and medieval Catholic architecture. Most buildings are small, conservative in design, and remain closer to vernacular styles. They also have a tendency to massive construction, which <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> surviving Egyptian taste from the Pharaonic period, partly reflects the need to semi-fortify buildings, partly is an inevitable result of mudbrick construction of large structures, and is also partly to keep them cool in the Egyptian climate.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with María Elvira Samper, García Márquez has admitted that his portrayal of Bolívar <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> self-portrait. He identifies with Bolívar in many ways, since their method of controlling their anger is the same and their philosophical views are similar: neither [...] "pays much attention to death, because that distracts one from the most important thing: what one does in life".|$|E

500|$|The {{cultural}} historian Panikos Panayi {{describes the}} book as a tour de force, seminal, and richly illustrated; and he notes that Food in England <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> recipe book, partly a history. He contrasts it favourably with Philip Harben's Traditional Dishes of Britain, published a year earlier, which he criticises as accepting the [...] "stereotypical stalwarts of British food", whereas Hartley rightly accepts (Panayi quotes) that [...] "foreign dishes ... like the foreigners, become 'naturalised English'".|$|E
500|$|Box Car Racer was {{inspired}} by and <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> tribute to bands DeLonge credited as an influence, such as Quicksand, Fugazi, and Refused. Musically, it is not drastically different than Blink-182, though it puts more emphasis on [...] "slower, heavier rhythms" [...] instead of being fast-paced. Stylically, reviewers variously dubbed the album post-hardcore, pop punk, punk rock, hardcore punk, emo, post-punk, or power pop. The subject matter found on Box Car Racer explores the apocalypse, conspiracies and Freemasonry. The album follows a central storyline, regarding an unnamed boy during {{the end of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements. He scored the vocal parts for four soloists: soprano, alto, tenor and bass. The choral writing is in four parts, {{and the work}} can be sung with just four singers, the so-called OVPP approach. Some performances deploy more singers in the choral sections. [...] The use of a larger choir <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> question of balance with the relatively large instrumental forces, {{but there is also}} supporting evidence for the use of more than four singers in the score, where a marking implies that Bach envisaged the option of a vocal ensemble that is separate from the four soloists.|$|E

For musical inspiration, Harrison drew {{from the work}} of master sitarist Ravi Shankar, who became his sitar tutor shortly after the recording was completed. In its lyrical themes, [...] "Love You To" [...] <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> love song to Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, while also incorporating philosophical concepts inspired by his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. In the context of its release, the song served {{as one of the first}} examples of the Beatles expressing an ideology aligned with that of the emerging counterculture.|$|E
500|$|... "Pathetic" [...] {{is a tale}} of [...] "abject self-pity in {{the face}} of {{collapsed}} relationship." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. The song's themes include maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well I guess this is growing up." [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. [...] "Waggy" [...] was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. [...] "Untitled" [...] is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene, and [...] "Emo" [...] by its namesake, which <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> tribute to DeLonge's favorite band, Jimmy Eat World.|$|E
500|$|... "A parish, in the poorlaw {{union of}} Cardiff, hundred of Kibbor, county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, 3½ miles (N. W. by W.) from Cardiff; {{containing}} 279 inhabitants. This parish probably derives its name, signifying [...] "a cataract," [...] from the rushing {{waters of the}} river Tâf, by which it is bounded on the north-east. It was formerly comprehended within the hundred of Miskin, but has been recently separated therefrom. It comprises about eleven hundred acres of arable and pasture land, inclosed and in a profitable state of cultivation: the surface is in some parts elevated, and in others flat, but no where subject to inundation; the soil is a strong brown earth, favourable {{to the production of}} good crops of grain of all kinds, potatoes, and hay. The substratum <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>a</b> hard brown stone, and partly limestone of very good quality. Radyr Court, formerly the seat of the family of Matthew, ancestors of the late Lord Llandaf, has been partially taken down, and the remainder has been modernised, and converted into a farmhouse. The turnpike-road leading from Cardiff to Llantrissent passes a little to the south of the parish; and the Tâf-Vale railway runs through it, nearly parallel with the river, which is crossed by the line in this vicinity. Some of the inhabitants are employed at the iron-works in the parish of Pentyrch.|$|E
