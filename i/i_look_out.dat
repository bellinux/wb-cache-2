500|$|Gulfton {{includes}} several scattered areas {{of commercial and}} light industrial properties. Gulfton gained {{a large number of}} immigrants in the mid-1980s and the regional economy could not support the increasing pressure of the new workers. This led to higher unemployment rates and families tended to [...] "double-up" [...] housing, where multiple families shared the same unit to reduce family expenditures. Scott Van Beck, head of the Houston Independent School District's West Region in the Gulfton area, stated in a 2006 keynote address to the Rotary Club of Bellaire, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> my window on Chimney Rock, I don't see big corporations; I see Gulfton; I see mom and pop businesses." [...] The Houston Metropolitan Chamber, previously the Greater Southwest Houston Chamber of Commerce, provides economic assistance in Gulfton.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{said of the}} CityYear program: [...] "Who’s {{the next}} {{generation}} {{that is going to}} lead us and inspire us and build an America we can all be proud of? When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at all of the City Year corps members who have been giving so much of themselves for a cause that is so much larger than themselves, I think I have an answer to that question.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} waiting to hear the plates removed {{to tell you how}} frightened we are at {{something}} we hear at the back-door. It seems like robbers muttering; but when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> there's nobody there!' ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>Looked</b> <b>Out</b> {{into the}} Morning (1951); words by James Thomson (B.V.) ...|$|R
60|$|We {{entered her}} room. Keeping {{cautiously}} behind the window-curtain, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|I sighed as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of {{the window}} toward the jewelers' shops.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he went on}} to say: [...] "Well, you've {{had your}} little adventure, and I hope now you've had enough of it. So go up-stairs and get your things {{together}} while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for a hansom." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am roused at last by Uncle David's {{pleasant}} voice, [...] "Wake up, boys, and pay y'r lodging!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> and perceive {{him standing}} beside the wheel. I see a house and I {{hear the sound of}} Deborah's voice from the warmly-lighted open door.|$|E
60|$|His Chinese {{house is}} by the fire; and he lies within it, on his bed of flannel, querulously trying to sleep. The bright moon is high and clear. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on the night, my tears fall fast, and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavily--heavily.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} again. A nameless fear crept over me, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> on the bridge.|$|R
60|$|PATTY. Nor have I, ma'am, as yet. But <b>I</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out,</b> {{and thinks}} <b>I</b> to myself, {{at any moment}} he may turn the corner. <b>I</b> ha' been <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> at windows {{waiting for him to}} oblige by turning the corner this fifteen years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still keeping silence, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> {{over the}} sea. I don't know why, except that <b>I</b> instinctively <b>looked</b> {{anywhere}} rather than look at him.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the vital}} riddle of our time. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> upon the windy Channel {{and think of}} all those {{millions}} just over there, who seem to get busier and keener every hour. I could imagine the day of reckoning coming like a swarm of birds.|$|E
6000|$|... "All over me at once?"--Mr. Bender {{took refuge}} in easy humour. [...] "Well, I'm a large man--so when I want to feel so much <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for {{something}} good. But what, if he suffers from the blot on his ermine--ain't that what you wear?--does our friend propose to do about it?" ...|$|E
60|$|June 20th.--Eight o'clock. The sun {{is shining}} in a clear sky. I have not been near my bed--I have not once closed my weary wakeful eyes. From the same window at which I looked out into the {{darkness}} of last night, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> now at the bright stillness of the morning.|$|E
60|$|With {{the words}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> below me, {{to see the}} old hunter {{standing}} in the glade waving his arms.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} room and found that {{everyone}} had gone, except Ercole Piacentini, who was talking to the Count in undertones.|$|R
60|$|When I had done, he shaded his face, and {{continued}} silent. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> {{of the window}} for a little while, and occupied myself with the plants.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have not I eyes, {{though some}} folk have not? Could not <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at a chink on a fine summer morning, {{when you thought}} the {{children}} asleep? Could not I climb up to your precious cave as well as yourself; and hear the iron clink under the stone. Ha, ha! and you and Patience thought no one knew but yourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. I {{have only}} {{met him in}} the twilight. He seems robed in a long cloak, with a peaked cap or hood like the elves in my nursery stories. Sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of the window here, I see him passing round this house like a shadow; and see his pointed hood, dark against the sunset or the rising of the moon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Father!" [...] {{said the}} Queen, [...] "how should not my heart fail me when I {{think of the}} many high spirits who have fallen for my sake? Ay, and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on yonder {{peaceful}} vales and happy homesteads, and think of them ravaged by those furious Spaniards and Italians, whom my brother of Anjou himself called very fiends!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir," [...] tears {{starting}} in her eyes, [...] "the first time <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of this window, I said 'never, never shall I weary of this.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes I {{glanced at}} the newspaper; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at the pleasant Southern garden, where the fountain flashed and fell among weeping willows, and laurels, orange-trees, and myrtles.|$|R
60|$|We left Lancaster {{within an}} hour or two, on our way towards Carlisle. Next morning, at daybreak, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> again for the strange young man. I did not see him. But next morning <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> again, {{and there he was}} once more. I sent another hail after him, but as before he gave not the {{slightest}} sign of being anyways disturbed. This put a thought into my head. Acting on it I watched him in different manners and at different times not necessary to enter into, till I found that this strange young man was deaf and dumb.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's so easy {{to imagine}} there is," [...] said Anne. [...] "Every night before I go to bed, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes I look for her {{footprints}} in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't give up your faith in the dryad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me don't tink dey try any more, sah. Anyhow, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> sharp." [...] So saying, Dan, {{fastening}} {{up one of}} the horses, {{rode the}} other in a circle round and round the house and little plantation, so {{that it would not be}} possible for anyone to cross the clearing without being seen. Vincent returned to the house, and found Miss Kingston just recovering consciousness. She sat upon the ground in a confused way.|$|E
60|$|THE wind is fainter, {{but there}} is still no calm. The rain is ceasing, {{but there is}} still no sunshine. The view from my window shows me the mist heavy on the earth, and a dim gray veil drawn darkly over the sky. Less than twelve hours since, such a {{prospect}} would have saddened me for the day. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at it this morning, through the bright medium of my own happiness, and not the shadow of a shade falls across the steady inner sunshine that is poring over my heart.|$|E
60|$|After I {{went up to}} my room <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> the window. It {{was only}} about ten o'clock, but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> upon a silent town. The drizzle continued, {{spangled}} with dim lights, as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the Ladies' Exchange.|$|R
6000|$|Hearing {{voices on}} the terrace below, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of window, and saw the two gentlemen {{walking up and down}} together. Answering for my daughter, I said, [...] "Mr. Franklin is on the terrace, miss." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{night as}} {{we were going to}} bed <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of the window at the barn which {{contained}} the cow, and was astonished to see that there was a light inside of the building.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I pray God that I may not willingly {{yield to}} these gloomy unloving feelings. As often as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of myself upon Him, His love and goodness, then I catch a bright gleam. I {{think that you}} will not suspect me of being in a morbid state of mind. You will say, [...] "Poor old fellow! he was seedy and {{depressed}} when he wrote all that." [...] And that's true, but not the whole truth. I have much need of your prayers, indeed, for grace and strength to correct faults of which I am conscious, to say nothing of unknown sin.|$|E
60|$|As I sit {{working at}} my back window, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> {{on a long}} row of other people's back windows; and it is quite {{impossible}} for me to help seeing and being interested in my neighbours. There are a good many children in those houses; and though I don't know one of their names, I know them a great deal better than they think I do. I never spoke a word to any of them, and never expect to do so; yet I have my likes and dislikes among them, and could tell them things that they have said and done, which would astonish them very much, I assure you.|$|E
60|$|Oh, Rufus Dingwell, {{it is such}} a rainy day! And the London street which <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on from {{my hotel}} window {{presents}} such a dirty and such a miserable view! Do you know, I hardly feel like the same Amelius who promised to write to you when you left the steamer at Queenstown. My spirits are sinking; I begin to feel old. Am I in the right state of mind to tell you what are my first impressions of London? Perhaps I may alter my opinion. At present (this is between ourselves), I don't like London or London people--excepting two ladies, who, in very different ways, have interested and charmed me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at the room window, but all I could see was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{but three}} arrows tapped against the wall, so I fired one barrel {{to call you}} up, and have been <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> for someone {{to take a shot}} at with the other; but I have not seen anyone, though, as you may imagine, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> sharply." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> and saw {{a number}} of people walking up and down the street. No one {{appeared}} to be watching me, and waiting a favorable opportunity, I slid out of the window to the sidewalk below.|$|R
