50|$|Because of {{governmental}} stipulations that an Indian could sell {{no more than}} one half of a 160 acre allotment, the men made plans to purchase 320 acre from four different <b>Indians</b> - <b>Hays,</b> Shoe-Boy, Nowahy, and Night Killer - and paid them each $2,000 for 80 acre to begin the small settlement of Washita Junction.|$|R

500|$|There are [...] {{of trails}} at Black Moshannon State Park that {{are open to}} hiking, {{mountain}} biking, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. All trails are open to hiking, most are open to skiing during the winter months, and select trails are open to snowmobiles and mountain bikes. The park is especially popular among cross-country skiing enthusiasts due to its high elevation. Skiers will find trails that are largely free of rocks, {{with a layer of}} grass beneath the snow. Sleepy Hollow, Seneca, <b>Indian,</b> and <b>Hay</b> Road Trails are most frequently used. Seven of the park's thirteen trails are described above, the remaining six follow.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1867, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Hickok {{had come to}} stay in Hays City, Kansas. He became a Deputy U.S. marshal, and on March 28, 1868, he picked up eleven Union Army deserters who {{had been charged with}} stealing government property. Hickok was assigned to bring the men to Topeka for trial, and he requested a military escort from Fort Hays. He was assigned William F. Cody, a sergeant, and five privates. They arrived in Topeka on April 2. Hickok remained in Hays through August 1868, when he brought 200 Cheyenne <b>Indians</b> to <b>Hays</b> to be viewed by [...] "excursionists".|$|R

2500|$|A {{wilderness}} addition {{was proposed}} for areas {{just outside the}} present boundaries including <b>Indian</b> Meadow (near <b>Hay</b> Meadow) and the lake for which the wilderness is named. [...] These [...] have been identified by the forest service for having ancient forests of white fir, western white pine, sugar pine, lodgepole pine, red fir, incense cedar and Jeffrey pine. This proposed addition {{did not make it}} into the 2006 Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of European Contact, Pender Island was {{inhabited}} by Coast Salish peoples speaking the North Straits Salish language. There is an <b>Indian</b> reserve at <b>Hay</b> Point on South Pender Island, which is home {{to members of the}} Tsawout and Tseycum First Nations. Carbon dating of artifacts in shell middens near Belden Cove identify an Indian village site that has been more or less continuously inhabited for five millennia. [...] The Poets Cove Resort was built on an ancient First Nations village site. The provincial government's 2007 settlement with the Tsawwassen First Nation included hunting and fishing rights on and around Pender Island—an arrangement to which the Sencot'en Alliance objected, saying those rights are theirs under the 1852 Douglas Treaty.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the attitudes toward education of the Slavey <b>Indian</b> adults at <b>Hay</b> River, Northwest Territories. An attempt was made to solicit opinions of the minority ethnic group on the present formal educational programs as well as what changes, if any, they perceived as necessary in these programs to meet their needs. Ten households were randomly selected to provide a sample of Slavey adults for interviewing purposes. The interviews were conducted from a previously designed questionnaire to determine their attitudes toward the existing formal education programs under the following topics: participation, Indian content, home-school relationships, and teacher training. The findings were then analyzed and several recommendations were made on the basis of the perceived needs of the Slavey adults. It was found that education was viewed by the Slaveys as a utility which could be used to enhance the employment opportunities of the children. The adults viewed education as necessary in terms of learning to read, write and speak the English language; however, beyond this their conception of formal education was very limited. Several proposals were presented by the adults for making the school a more meaningful institution for the Slavey adults. The results indicated a need for some major revisions in the school programs to include the indigenous minority culture of the Slavey Indians. Recommendations were made on curriculum development and inclusion, teacher training, recruitment and orientation, school-community relationships, teaching in and of the Slavey language and involving the Slavey adults in the participation of educational decision making. The study also points out the futility of developing educational policy for the Slaveys instead of developing policy, programs and facilities with their full co-operation and participation...|$|R
60|$|I had not {{intended}} to write again until {{the time of the}} departure of the next mail, as my last letter went off only yesterday morning; but two companies of the 33d regiment are to land this afternoon and to start at midnight, and as this is the first body of European troops who have landed, I think it as well to accompany them to Senafe, sixty miles distant, where Colonels Merewether and Phayre have gone up with the pioneer force. They will not advance beyond this point for some time, and I shall therefore, when I have seen the passes, return, after a few days’ stay there, to this place, which is at present the main point of interest. I should not move from it, indeed, were it not that there is some doubt whether the King of Tigré will permit us to pass. He is at present stationed near the head of the pass with a body of 7000 men, but I fancy his only object in this is to make us buy his friendship at as high a rate as possible. If he really means mischief {{it will be a very}} serious matter indeed; for, although we should of course scatter his forces easily enough, it would give us such an enormous line of march to be guarded that it would be impossible to move a step until we had completely subdued Tigré. I sincerely hope that this will not be the case. But another week or two will show; and in the mean time, as I shall have plenty of opportunities of writing on the subject, I must return to my present topic, which is the state of things at the landing-place here. It is not, as I said in my last, a cheerful place to look at from on board ship, but it is very far worse on landing. The pier is nearly finished, and is a very creditable piece of work indeed. It is of stone, and about 300 yards long, and is wide enough for a double line of rails. One line is already laid down, and saves an immensity of labour; for the goods are landed from the native boats, which bring them from the ship’s side, are put on to the trucks, and are run straight into the commissariat yard, which is fifty yards only from the end of the pier. Before this pier was finished everything had to be carried on shore upon the heads of the natives; and as a boat cannot approach within 300 yards of shore, owing to the shallow water, it may be imagined how slowly the work of debarcation went on. The pier is ridiculously insufficient for the purpose. Even now the ships are lying in the harbour for days, waiting for means of landing their goods, although lines of natives still supplement the pier, and pass bales of goods through the water on their heads. When the whole expedition is here there will be a complete dead-lock, unless a very great increase of landing accommodation is afforded. The commissariat yard is piled with enormous quantities of pressed <b>hay,</b> <b>Indian</b> and English, grain, rice, &c. They are well arranged, and in such weather as we have at present there is no fear of their taking damage from being exposed to the air, especially as the precaution has been taken to have trusses of pressed hay laid down as a foundation for the piles of grain-bags. The commissariat yard is distinguished by the fact that here only do we see women—bright-coloured, picturesquely-clad creatures, a hundred of whom have been sent across from India to serve as grinders of corn. Beside the commissariat tents are a few others belonging to the other departments, and these, with a large unfinished wooden storehouse, at which a dozen Chinese carpenters are at work, constitute the camp at the landing-place. But this is only a small portion of the whole, the main camp being a mile and a half inland; and, indeed, there are half-a-dozen small camps, a cluster of tents scattered within the circle of a mile.|$|R
