5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need hemodialysis {{or equivalent}} renal replacement therapy (RRT). If a kidney transplant is found {{for a patient}} on RRT, the disease will recur in the <b>graft</b> (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the <b>graft</b> will fail completely (requiring resumption of the RRT and a further transplant).|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The {{most frequently used}} is called guided bone <b>graft</b> augmentation where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the <b>graft</b> forming a new bony base for the implant.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate.

25|$|Skin {{grafting}} is patching of {{a defect}} with skin that {{is removed from}} another site in the body. The skin <b>graft</b> is sutured {{to the edges of}} the defect, and a bolster dressing is placed atop the <b>graft</b> for seven to ten days, to immobilize the <b>graft</b> as it heals in place. There are two forms of skin grafting: split thickness and full thickness. In a split thickness skin <b>graft,</b> a shaver is used to shave a layer of skin from the abdomen or thigh. The donor site regenerates skin and heals over a period of two weeks. In a full thickness skin <b>graft,</b> a segment of skin is totally removed and the donor site needs to be sutured closed.|$|E
25|$|A rhinoplastic {{correction}} can {{be performed}} on {{a person who is}} under sedation, under general anaesthesia, or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then corrects (reshapes) them as required, afterwards, sutures the incisions, and then applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage <b>graft</b> or a bone <b>graft,</b> or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contour(s). The autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage <b>graft</b> (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage <b>graft</b> (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient’s body. When the rhinoplasty requires a bone <b>graft,</b> it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of autologous <b>graft</b> is available, a synthetic <b>graft</b> (nasal implant) is used to augment the nasal bridge.|$|E

Materials and methods:In 64 infrainguinal bypass <b>grafts,</b> intravenous {{digital subtraction angiography}} {{was performed}} within the first postoperative week. Frontal and lateral projection angiograms with the knee joint extended and with a 80 – 90 ° flexion were taken. The distal anastomosis of the bypass was performed below-knee in 49 cases (18 in situ veins, 8 reversed veins with an anatomic course, 2 reversed veins with an extra-anatomic course, 4 composite <b>grafts,</b> 15 synthetic <b>grafts</b> with an anatomic course (14 polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), 1 polyurethane), and two synthetic <b>grafts</b> with an extra-anatomic course.

25|$|<b>Graft</b> patency is {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors, including the type of <b>graft</b> used (internal thoracic artery, radial artery, or great saphenous vein), the size of the coronary artery that the <b>graft</b> is anastomosed with, and, of course, the skill of the surgeon(s) performing the procedure.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} radiation <b>grafting</b> of styrene onto poly(tetrafluoroethylene- co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP) films was {{studied at}} room temperature.

Effects of the <b>grafting</b> {{conditions of the}} amines onto the pre-irradiated PTFE, such as <b>grafting</b> time, reaction temperature and pre-irradiation doses on the resulting <b>grafting</b> yield are reported.

30|$|In {{revision}} rhinoplasty, {{the use of}} <b>grafts</b> {{is indispensable}} when large amounts of tissue are required (Bussi et al. 2013).

The improvements in ROE satisfaction scores were similar in both <b>grafted</b> and non-grafted patients. Considering that <b>grafting</b> is generally needed in severe nasal deformities, the relatively high rates of satisfaction in <b>grafted</b> patients indicate the functional and cosmetic benefits of <b>grafting.</b> For this reason, surgeons should not hesitate to use <b>grafts</b> if needed. However, we think that longer follow-up time periods are needed to determine the actual satisfaction state in <b>grafted</b> patients.|$|R

25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK).

Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the long-term outcome of single and bilateral internal thoracic artery <b>grafting</b> with concomitant saphenous vein <b>grafting</b> for multivessel coronary artery bypass <b>grafting.</b> MethodsBetween March 1985 and April 1995, 6650 patients underwent primary isolated coronary artery bypass <b>grafting</b> with internal thoracic artery <b>grafts,</b> including 4382 patients with multivessel bypass <b>grafting</b> requiring at least 3 <b>grafts.</b> Outcomes of patients undergoing single internal thoracic artery plus saphenous vein <b>grafting</b> (n = 2547) and bilateral internal thoracic artery plus saphenous vein <b>grafting</b> (n = 1835) were obtained at a mean follow-up of 11 ± 3 years. ResultsPatients with bilateral internal thoracic artery <b>grafting</b> were younger, were mostly male, and had less diabetes, hypertension, unstable angina, and recent myocardial infarction than patients undergoing single internal thoracic artery <b>grafting.</b> Thirty-day mortality was 2. 3 % for the group undergoing single internal thoracic artery <b>grafting</b> versus 1. 2 % for those undergoing bilateral internal thoracic artery <b>grafting</b> (P =. 007). Survival probability at 10 years was 88 % for the single-graft group compared with 93 % for the bilateral-graft group (P <. 001). Multivariate analysis with propensity scoring showed that bilateral internal thoracic artery <b>grafting</b> decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0. 74; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 60 - 0. 90), myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0. 79; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 67 - 0. 93), and coronary reoperation (hazard ratio, 0. 41; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 21 - 0. 80) throughout the follow-up period. Other significant predictors of death were diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, need for intra-aortic balloon pump, chronic heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.
