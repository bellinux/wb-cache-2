50|$|Portugal’s {{restoration}} of independence freed it to pursue the course mapped out by the pioneers of commercial imperialism. During the seventeenth century, its economy depended largely upon entrepôt trade in tobacco and sugar, and the export of salt. During the eighteenth century, even though staples were not abandoned, the Portuguese economy came to be based more upon slaves, <b>gold,</b> <b>leather,</b> and wine. Portuguese trade, centered in the busy port of Lisbon, was most influenced by Anglo-Dutch capitalism and by the colonial economy in Brazil.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the fifteenth}} or sixteenth century, the {{technique}} reached the Low Countries, first in Flanders and Brabant, {{where it was}} further developed. Though there were craftsmen in several cities (such as Antwerp, Brussels, and Ghent), the major handicraft center for <b>gold</b> <b>leather</b> was Mechelen, where it was mentioned as early as 1504.

One of them, Hans le Maire, because of the smell, the need for water, wind and light, working {{at the edge of the}} city or in Vreeland, used up to 16,000 hides of calves and some 170,000 leaves of silver annually.|$|E

50|$|The {{region of}} Tripolitania, which {{included}} Misurata, {{came under the}} regency of the Ottoman Empire in 1551. By {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, Misrata had been established as a major center for the Trans-Saharan trade route, where caravans carrying <b>gold,</b> <b>leather,</b> and slaves, regularly stopped. Because of the rainfall along the coast, which was abundant compared to other cities in Tripolitania, and supplemental water from underground springs, Misrata's inhabitants were able to engage in unusually fertile agriculture in this largely arid region. The city was filled with thick areas of vegetable gardens while the surrounding countryside included fields of wheat, barley, date palms and olive orchards. Misrata's artisans also expanded on the city's ancient carpet industry for which it was regionally renowned. Although Misurata contained a well-built harbor, most of its long-distance trade was overland because the city of Benghazi to the east served as the preferable substitute for maritime shipping.|$|E
