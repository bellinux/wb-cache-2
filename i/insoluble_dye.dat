40|$|The {{field of}} drug {{delivery}} is developinq rapidly and is gaining {{the attention of}} scientists and the pharmaceutical Industry. Serious challenges in designing drug delivery systems are that many new drug entities such as cancer drugs are water-insoluble. Hyperbranched polymers, most notably dendrimers, are a class of macromolecules whose unique properties such as their degree of branching, multi-valency and defined molecular shape make them suitable as new scaffolds for drug delivery. Dendrimers can offer two different environments which are very important in drug delivery, namely the interior and the outer surface. The outer surface represents molecular features such as solubility where the terminal groups are located, and its interface with the surrounding medium. When a hydrophilic substituent is introduced into the surface (the periphery) the dendrimer becomes hydrophilic and water-soluble. The interior of these water soluble dendrimers gives a hydrophobic environment to the incorporated organic molecule. Having a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic surface makes dendrimers potentially very good drug delivery vehicles. The primary aim {{of this investigation was}} to synthesise a suitable water soluble dendritic material which was able to encapsulate the non-polar drugs (water <b>insoluble</b> <b>dye)</b> in a lower generation; the idea was that the large branching unit could the encapsulate drugs at lower generation. The selection of building blocks for the preparation of dendritic material was very important. In this project, the monomer selected to build the dendritic macromolecule was 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzyl alcohol, and initially ethyl 6 - bromohexanoate as a branching unit. The cores used were 4, 4 - dihydroxybiphenyl and 1, 1, 1 -tris (4 -hydroxy-phenyl) ethane; in the later stage of this project, physical and chemical properties of dendrimers such as solubility at different pH, maximum solubility at pH 7. 4, Absorptivity of the molecules, and finding their CMC using dye-encapsulatlon, surface tension, and molar conductivity were investigated. The first part of this investigation was the synthesis of dendritic macromolecules achieved by attaching first and second generation dendrons to 4, 4 -dihydroxybipnenyl and 1, 1, 1 -tris(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethane, and then hydrolysis prior to measurement of their physical-chemical properties. Some of the products had properties that could improve the solubility of a water <b>insoluble</b> <b>dye</b> by encapsulation. Their critical micelle concentration was found by surface tension measurement and was verified by two other analytical techniques (molar conductivity and dye encapsulation). Study of physico-chemical results and molecular modelling of these compounds revealed that they have a potential to be used in drug delivery systems, although further modification of structure would improve their properties for this purpose.

40|$|Enzyme histochemistry {{serves as}} a link between {{biochemistry}} and morphology. It is based on metabolization of a substrate provided to a tissue enzyme in its orthotopic localization. Visualization is accomplished with an <b>insoluble</b> <b>dye</b> product. It is a sensitive dynamic technique that mirrors even early metabolic imbalance of a pathological tissue lesion, combined with the advantage of histotopographic enzyme localization. With the advent of immunohistochemistry and DNA-oriented molecular pathology techniques, the potential of enzyme histochemistry currently tends to be underrecognized. This review aims {{to draw attention to}} the broad range of applications of this simple, rapid and inexpensive method. Alkaline phosphatase represents tissue barrier functions in brain capillaries, duodenal enterocyte and proximal kidney tubule brush borders. Decrease in enzyme histochemical alkaline phosphatase activity indicates serious functional impairment. Enzyme histochemical increase in lysosomal acid phosphatase activity is an early marker of ischemic tissue lesions. Over the last four decades, acetylcholinesterase enzyme histochemistry has proven to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease and is one of the most commonly applied enzyme histochemical methods today. Chloroacetate esterase and tartrate-resistant phosphatase are both resistant to formalin fixation, EDTA decalcification and paraffin embedding. Early enzyme histochemical insight into development of a pathologic tissue lesion and evaluation of function and vitality of tissue enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases. In this process, enzyme histochemistry constitutes a valuable complement to conventional histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology for both diagnostic and experimental pathology...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{is divided into two}} parts; the first is the {{synthesis}} of a ‘switch-on’ fluorophore to measure cell viability, and the second is the development of a fluorescent detection method for protein−peptide affinity assays applied in the identification of protein-protein inhibitors. Tetrazolium salts are often used in cytotoxicity assays as indicators of cell viability as they are reduced to deeply coloured formazans exclusively in healthy cells. However, measuring the absorbance of the formazan is prone to bias from other coloured species in the cell media, requires solubilisation and can be difficult to quantify. A preferable method of detection is direct fluorescence as it is easily quantified, more sensitive and would ideally remove the need to solubilise the <b>insoluble</b> <b>dye.</b> The aim of this project was to synthesise a tetrazolium salt that could be reduced to a soluble fluorescent formazan in healthy cells as an indicator of cell viability. A number of fluorescent formazans were synthesised by incorporation of a fluorophore. The corresponding tetrazolium salts were non-fluorescent and could be reduced to the formazan in vitro. Several formazans were synthesised to attempt to increase the emission wavelength and intensity to overcome cellular autofluorescence. Protein-protein interactions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases but until recently were considered undruggable. However, peptides have emerged as ideal compounds for targeting the large and relatively featureless protein interfaces. Work focussed on the discovery of peptide inhibitors for the E 3 ubiquitin ligase stationary-phase kinase associated protein (Skp 2). Potential peptide inhibitors were identified using CelluSpot synthesis and array technology to screen peptide libraries. Qualitative analysis of the protein affinity assay results by enhanced chemiluminescent detection was found to be misleading, and so a quantifiable and more sensitive fluorescent detection method was developed...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial food {{poisoning}} causes substantial suffering and financial loss worldwide. One way organisms enter foods is via cross contamination {{directly or indirectly}} from structural and food contact surfaces. An 'in situ' method was developed {{for the detection of}} surviving bacteria on surfaces. Samples of test surfaces were overlaid with agar and after incubation, colonies were visualised by reaction with nitroblue tetrazolium, which was reduced to a purple <b>insoluble</b> <b>dye.</b> It was shown that the death of bacteria applied as liquid films to surfaces, occurred largely at the point of drying. For impervious surfaces (ceramic, stainless steel, glass and polystyrene), surface type had little effect on survival. In contrast, survival was markedly affected {{by the nature of the}} suspension fluid in which cells were dried. In deionised water, survival was low and for Gram negative organisms was strongly influenced by cell density. Where cells were dried in simulated food films (containing brain heart infusion, NaCI, serum or sucrose), survival values increased with increasing concentrations and approached 100 % for Staphylococcus aureus cells suspended in 10 % w/v sucrose. The survival of Gram positive organisms on impervious surfaces was generally greater than for Gram negative organisms and consistent with this observation, scanning electron microscopy indicated that Gram negative cells collapsed during drying. On wood surfaces, survival was generally similar to or higher than on impervious surfaces. However, neither of the Gram positive organisms tested (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) could be recovered following inoculation onto the surface of the African hard-wood, iroko, although Gram negative organisms survived well. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that cells had not been adsorbed below the wood surface and an ethanol-soluble toxic factor was extracted from iroko, which killed Staphylococcus aureus cells, but had no effect on the viability of Salmonella enteritidis PT 4. In metabolic studies, it was also shown that this extract caused greater inhibition of ethanol and glucose oxidation in Gram positive than in Gram negative bacteria. Following the washing of iroko in ethanol for 36 days, the survival of Staphylococcus aureus was similar to or higher than on beech wood or ceramic, showing that the toxic factor had been effectively removed. The results are discussed in relation to current legislation and associated guidance concerning the use of surface materials in food businesses and domestic settings.

Primary [ilg] development was [first] used for [itself by Homolk[ilg]n 1907. He wanted [to] find developing agents whose oxidation products [ilg]re themselves insoluble and preferably colored. The [ilg] commonly known agent of such a type is of cou[ilg] pyro. A pyro develope[d] image shows the character[istic] brownish stain, and even after the silver has been removed by bleaching the stain image is very evident. The qualitity of sulfite in the pyro developer, as is [w]ell known, cont[ilg]s the amount of stain obtained. There are several other primary developing agents [s]ome even giving colored images that might be [u]sed in color photography where the spectral hues [req]uired are quite specific., Secondary color development is of most [ilg]rest at the [p]resent time because of its [ilg] rang[e] of color and control. Fischer and [ilg]ist published the first material on secondary [ilg] or development in 1914 and additions to the s[ilg] have been rapidly increasing for the last t[ilg] years. A large number of color formers are k[ilg] which couple in a manner still under disc[uss]ion. (although the present explanation is that t[h]e developer's oxidation product couples when it is formed with a color former to yield {{a more or less}} <b>insoluble</b> <b>dye).</b> Thus is secondary coupling we use not the oxidation product of the develop[ment] alone but compounds that unite with it and g[ilg] brightly colored dyes. The majority of the early d[y]e images w[ilg] of the indoaniline, indamine and indophenol group, although as the list has grown rapidly in rece[nt] years many new types have been used. The latest [c]onvenient summary of known couplers was published by Tull. T[he] dyes must of course be relatively [i]nsoluble after [ilg]mation, and for practical purposes fairly [ilg]st to lig[ilg] and of the proper hue., The actual application of dye coupling to m[ono]chrome photography has been oddly enough, rather rare. The research that ha[s] been done on dye couplers has generally been carries on with the idea of using the results in direct color photography. In view of the infinite variety of hues that may be obtained and the simplicity of their production, the use of single or multiple black and white prints should be interested in the making of monochrome prints or transparencies. An understanding of the procedure is also helpful in considering the more complicated applications of the same ideas in the color photography of today and the near future, The production of dye-coupled monochrome prints necessitates the same steps as are used in making a normal black and white print. The prints are exposed, developed, rinsed, fixed, washed and dried. The color of the final image will depend chiefly on the composition of the developing solution. If desired, completed black and white prints can be bleached and redeveloped to obtain similar results although the results obtained {{do not seem to be}} of as high quality in such prints as in those directly developed in [ilg] special developers. The emulsions useable for d[ye] coupling development are quite numerous al[th]ough some chlorides and chlorobromides do not work al all except by redevelopment. These papers make the dye form in the developing solution even before actual silver development is evident. Most of the common enlarging papers such as Kodabrom, Velous Black, Brovira, etc. work very well as do the transparency materials from the same manufacturers. The exposure of any of these sensitive emultions is approximately the same as that used when making a black and white print., The mixing of the developer solution probably offers the greatest deviation from normal procedure. The working solution is made up from tex parts of a fairly normal developer with one part of a color former or mixture of color formers. The developer solution is composed of, Sodium sulfite 18 grams, Sodium carbonate 40 grams, Potassium bromide 1 grams, Developing agent 0. 5 - 2. 0 grams, Water to make 1 liter, The composition of this developer for monochrome work is not as critical as for three color work. The quantities of sulfite or carbonate may be varied within reasonable limited but the quantity of developing agent does not have considerable effect on the result. As the quantity of developing agent increases, the strength and contrast of the image increases until there is considerable gerneral stain produced.

50|$|Solution dyeing, {{also known}} as dope or spun dyeing, {{is the process of}} adding {{pigments}} or <b>insoluble</b> <b>dyes</b> to the spinning solution before the solution is extruded through the spinneret. Only manufactured fibers can be solution-dyed. It is used for difficult-to-dye fibers, such as olefin fibers, and for dyeing fibers for end uses that require excellent colorfastness properties. Because the color pigments {{become a part of the}} fiber, solution-dyed materials have excellent colorfastness to light, washing, crocking (rubbing), perspiration, and bleach. Dyeing at the solution stage is more expensive, since the equipment has to be cleaned thoroughly each time a different color is produced. Thus, the variety of colors and shades produced is limited. In addition, it is difficult to stock the inventory for each color. Decisions regarding color have to be made very early in the manufacturing process. Thus, this stage of dyeing is usually not used for apparel fabrics.|$|R

The use of ultrasound in textile wet processing offers many potential advantages. Previous work has shown that the use of ultrasonics in dyeing provides the following benefits: (1) energy savings and reduced processing times, (2) environmental improvements, (3) process enhancement, and (4) lower overall processing costs. A fundamental understanding of the operative processes are needed so that meaningful application of ultrasonics in textile processing may be made. This project is directed at determining the phenomena responsible for the effects of ultrasound in textile wet processing and the relative importance of phenomena occurring in the bulk solution and in the fiber. Our studies show that ultrasound increases the swelling of both unmercerized and mercerized cotton. Although the beneficial effects of ultrasound are also observed to occur in polyester, no effect of ultrasound on the glass transition temperature was observed. An experimental approach has been developed that will enable a direct determination of the effect of ultrasound on the diffusion coefficient of the dye within polyester.

40|$|Detection of DNA by {{electrochemical}} impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{has been}} reported by many authors and assays have been developed using lab setups. However, as for most detection assay methods there are issues to address to enable the development for the sensor market: Long time-to-result & high complexity for labelled assays {{and a lack of}} sensitivity and reproducibility for label-free assays. This work considers two different approaches to address the issues of time-to-result and assay complexity. The first part presents work on achieving rapid sequence-specific electrochemical detection of DNA hybridisation to complementary DNA on an electrode surface. To accomplish assay sensitivity to low DNA target concentrations, a signal amplification strategy is often necessary. One approach is to couple an enzyme to the hybridised target molecules and to deposit <b>insoluble</b> <b>dyes</b> in the subsequent enzymatic reaction, which enhances sensitivity through an increase in the impedance signal in presence of a redox mediator. The time typically taken for this process (20 – 40 min) precludes the use outside lab setups. Therefore, a protocol for sensitive detection in the presence of redox mediator is demonstrated on a practical timescale required for use in sensor applications. Based on these results a model for the fundamental understanding of the amplification reaction is presented which explains the retention of sensitivity at these enhanced timescales. This also enabled further optimisation of the assay for application in single base pair mismatch detection in biologically relevant sequences. Moreover, direct detection of the precipitate formation is demonstrated which enables real-time measurement of the enzymatic reaction without redox agent addition and with enhanced mismatch discrimination. The second part investigates the possibility to detect DNA non-sequence-specifically by non-Faradaic means. This approach aims at reducing assay complexity by establishing whether it is possible to sense the presence of polymeric DNA in solution by measuring changes in the properties of the electrochemical double layer without DNA surface hybridisation. In a sensor setup this approach could be linked to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to discriminate polymer from nucleotide monomer and thereby enable PCR progress to be monitored. In this work the response in the electrochemical double layer at the interface of blocked metal electrodes and solutions containing DNA are studied by means of EIS. Blocking layers were applied to the electrode surface to prevent unspecific adsorption of molecules and ions to the metal surface whilst preserving the sensitivity to detection of changes in the double layer. The characteristics of surface blocking layers on disposable electrodes are studied as they are key to understand the double layer properties at a blocked surface. A number of self-assembled monolayers are compared with respect to their temperature stability and their blocking characteristics at different potentials and ion concentrations. This established the basis to study the effect of the presence of, initially, a model polyelectrolyte and, ultimately, DNA on the double layer. Polyelectrolyte detection is successfully shown for the model polyelectrolyte, polyacrylic acid. DNA detection was more challenging and possible causes for deviation from the polyacrylic acid response are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} synthesis of a new alkyne core functional hyperbranched polyglycerol and describes their use as potential monomolecular imprinting materials and increasing the photostability of fluorescent dyes. The first chapter describes two methods for {{the synthesis of}} the polymers and its formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition with organic azides {{in the presence of}} copper, commonly referred to as click chemistry. The two methods allow preparation of low molecular weight polymers, MW 100, 000 g/mol. The polymers and their derivatives are characterized by a variety of analytical techniques to establish the size, degree of branching, and initiator incorporation for both the low and high molecular weight material. A method for decreasing polydispersity, a common issue for hyperbranched polymers, is also described. This chapter includes two applications for these new polymers including attachment to the surface of a gold nanoparticle, and the synthesis of an acid sensitive unimolecular micelle. In the first application, the alkyne core is converted to an amine which allows the polymer to act as a ligand on the gold surface. Despite the presence of the amine, the particle’s remain neutral (zeta potential = - 0. 01) and are stable to salt induced precipitation. In the second application unimolecular micelles were tested for biocompatibility, and their ability to encapsulate and release a hydrophobic guest molecule. 	The second chapter describes the synthesis of branched star polymers or pseudodendrimers using an adenosine core in an effort to synthesize a water soluble organic nanoparticle capable of recognizing nucleic acid residues. A general route to highly cross-linked water soluble nanoparticles is presented which uses metathesis cross-linking and osmium catalyzed dihydroxylation. The nanoparticles could be hydrolyzed to remove the adenosine template. However, qualitative tests using equilibrium dialysis showed very low, nonspecific binding to nucleoside guests. The end of the chapter further studies the cross-linking process, and shows how the polymers stiffness changes with increasing cross-link density using 1 H NMR T 1 relaxation times. 	The third chapter describes two methods for the use of polyglycerol to increase the photostability of organic dyes. The first method uses the steric bulk of polyglycerol as a protective layer to prevent interaction of the dye with molecular oxygen or to increase the water solubility of stable but <b>insoluble</b> <b>dyes.</b> Polyglycerol modified with fluorescein at the core was shown to be up to 3 times more stable than free fluorescein in solution. The polymer conjugates were also less affected by iodide quenching. In both tests {{there was no difference between}} cross-linked and uncross-linked polymer. Polyglycerol was also used to alter the water solubility of the insoluble but stable perylene diimide dye. The second method uses polyglycerol not as a steric barrier, but as a scaffold to covalently link fluorescent dyes to antifading agents. The results show that the co-localization of the dye and antifading agents due to the covalent attachment to the polymer scaffold reduces photobleaching similarly to that observed for antifading agents in solution...|$|R
40|$|Microbiological {{proteolysis}} in Lake Champlain {{water was}} measured in situ and in vitro by the spectrophotometric measurement of the rate of release of soluble color from an <b>insoluble</b> azure <b>dye</b> derivative of hide powder. Water samples sterilized by microfiltration were never proteolytic. In situ proteolysis {{was found to be}} very dependent upon water temperature (1 to 23 °C). No measurable activity was observed below 4 °C. The in vitro proteolysis rate at 20 °C was found to be 2. 3 times the rate at 15 °C and 6 times the rate at 10 °C. Water taken from beneath the ice-covered lake throughout the winter and tested in the laboratory at 20 °C was found to show an increasing proteolytic potential during the winter months. The highest activity was obtained as the ice broke up in early spring. Microbiological proteolysis in water from Burlington Harbor was often four times that found in center lake water. In most experiments proteolysis was inhibited completely by 2 μg of Cu 2 + and inhibited 67 % by 0. 75 μg/ml. Proteolysis was markedly stimulated by 20 to 40 μg of Casitone or Casamino Acids per ml. The predominant bacteria growing in the proteolysis flasks were species of Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas required traces of Casitone, Casamino Acids, or yeast extract for proteolysis of hide powder azure, whereas those of Flavobacterium did not. The requirement could not be met by a mixture of 21 amino acids and eight vitamins...|$|R

This work has two parts, the former studies the action of Albegal B and some inorganic compounds, in the aggregation state of the dye, on the dyeing solution; {{the formation of a}} complex more <b>insoluble</b> than the <b>dye,</b> is observed in the initial phase and, at higher concentrations of Albegal B, a tedency -although not very marked- to the redisolution of the complex can be seen.

40|$|Exoprotease {{activity}} during 120 h of total energy and nutrient starvation was examined in two marine bacteria, Vibrio sp. strain S 14 and Pseudomonas sp. strain S 9. The activity {{was determined by}} spectrophotometric measurement of the rate of release of soluble color from an <b>insoluble</b> azure <b>dye</b> derivative of hide powder (hide powder azure). Starved cells of both strains (5 h for S 14, and 4 or 24 h for S 9) showed greater extracellular proteolytic activity than {{at the onset of}} starvation. The exoprotease activity of cells starved {{for longer periods of time}} then decreased, but was found to be present at significant levels throughout the starvation period studied (120 h). The accumulation of exoprotease activity in the bulk phase during starvation indicated that both strains constitutively excreted extracellular proteases. As deduced from experiments with chloramphenicol, de novo protein synthesis during starvation was required for the production and/or release of the exoproteases into the surrounding environment. The degradation of hide powder azure allowed an immediate increase in respiration rate, also by long-term-starved cells. This suggests that metabolic systems are primed to respond to the availability of substrates, allowing the cells to recover rapidly. The regulation of exoprotease activity was also studied and found to be different in the two strains. Casamino Acids repressed exoprotease activity in Pseudomonas sp. strain S 9, whereas a mechanism similar to catabolite repression was found for Vibrio sp. strain S 14 in that glucose repressed activity and cyclic AMP reversed this effect. The exoproteases appeared to be metalloproteinases because the addition of EDTA to cell-free starvation supernatants from both strains significantly inhibited the activity of the proteases...|$|R
40|$|A typical <b>insoluble</b> {{chlorinated}} aromatic <b>dye</b> (CAD), disperse red (DR), {{was used}} to explore the reaction mechanism and kinetics of photodegradation in non-ionic surfactant solutions. The use of an additional hydrogen source and photosensitizer is also studied to improve the decay rates. The decay rate of dye in surfactants depends on the Km of surfactants {{and their ability to}} offering an effective hydrogen source. The photodegradation of CAD can be divided into three stages: the initial lag stage, the fast degradation stage and the final retardation stage. The lag stage will vanish and the decay rates of dye can be greatly improved by 2. 5 - 3. 6 times after adding an additional hydrogen source (NaBH 4) or photosensitizer (acetone) to the surfactant micellar solution. However, the use of an additional hydrogen source or photosensitizer has dosage limitations in such applications. The photoreduction of DR is the main reaction mechanism, in which photodechlorination is observed first with the generation of HCl as the final product, then followed by photodecolorization by breaking the azo bond of the chromophore.

40|$|Emulsions are kinetically stabilised {{mixtures}} of two immiscible fluids (e. g. oil and water). They are encountered in many industrial applications including cosmetics, food, road, drug delivery and paint technology. Despite their wide spread use, {{the formulation of}} emulsions remains largely empirical. The nature {{of the relationships between}} ingredients, composition, emulsification method and energy input, defining the microstructure (e. g. droplet size distribution and surfactant packing at the oil/water interface), the dynamics (e. g. interdroplet exchange) and the lifetime of emulsions, is still poorly understood. In particular, little work has focused on the mutual interactions between emulsifier and oil molecules and how these affect the properties of the interfacial domain and emulsion dynamics. The emulsion system oil/Triton X- 100 /water was investigated, where Triton X- 100 is a commercially available non ionic surfactant and the oil is one of toluene, p-xylene or octane. The microstructure and the dynamics of these oil/Triton X- 100 /water emulsions were monitored upon varying oil type, oil concentration, emulsion age and ionic strength while maintaining the oil-to-surfactant weight ratio, temperature, energy input and emulsification method constant. For this purpose, laser scanning confocal microscopy, cryo scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR), macroscopic phase separation and light scattering techniques were used as experimental techniques. The occurrence of an oil exchange between oil droplets that is not coupled to droplet growth and emulsion destabilization is reported for the three oil systems: toluene, p-xylene or octane. The mixture of two separately stained emulsions, using green and red fluorescing dye molecules, leads to all droplets emitting yellow fluorescence under the confocal microscope within ∼ 10 min of mixing due to the interdroplet exchange of the two water <b>insoluble</b> <b>dyes.</b> Furthermore, the PFG-NMR data for both toluene and p-xylene systems indicate that, for long observation times, Δ, the echo attenuation of the oil signal decays as a single exponential upon increasing the diffusion parameters. In other words the individual motions of the droplets and oil molecules are described by a unique diffusion coefficient belying the system polydispersity and indicative of a dynamic process occurring on a time scale faster than the observation time. One way to explain this outcome is to consider a motional averaging of the oil diffusion arising from either oil permeation upon droplet collision or reversible coalescence of the droplets. These two mechanisms are supported by the extensive droplet contact observed by cryo-SEM. Such an oil transfer occurring in three distinct oil systems, independently of emulsion destabilization, has not been reported previously. Upon decreasing the NMR observation time below a specific value, Δswitch, a switch of the echo attenuation data was detected between a single exponential and a multiexponential decay, the latter indicative of the emulsion droplet size distribution. The time scale of the oil transfer, Δswitch, was probed upon varying oil type, oil concentration, emulsion age and ionic strength. In particular, the time scale of the oil exchange is an increasing function, spanning from ~ 300 ms to ~ 3 s, of droplet concentration in toluene emulsions despite the concomitant increase of the droplet collision frequency. Upon increasing the toluene content and decreasing the mean interdroplet spacing, the oil droplets are kinetically stabilized by the enhancement of the surfactant packing at the oil/water interface. In addition to the surfactant packing at the surface of the oil droplets, ionic strength and droplet size, the rate of oil exchange is controlled by the mutual interactions between oil and Triton X- 100 molecules. The rate of oil transfer is a decreasing function from toluene to p-xylene to octane. The increase of the mean droplet size in the same order cannot solely account for the observed slowdown of the oil exchange. The macroscopic phase separation data indicate that the Triton X- 100 layer is increasingly robust with respect to oil transfer from toluene to p-xylene to octane. This can be compared with the oil exchange process and explained in terms of oil penetration effects into the surfactant layer and energy cost for hole nucleation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIncreasing age {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a cause for adverse prognosis {{in the setting of}} myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, and cardiac surgery. This is attributed to a greater susceptibility of the senescent heart to ischemic injury and to a lower response to protective interventions. This study investigated the effect of aging on the tolerance to ischemia of the human myocardium and its response to ischemic preconditioning. MethodsRight atrial specimens from 128 patients undergoing elective heart surgery were collected, sliced, and equilibrated for 30 minutes before being randomized into 3 study protocols: (1) 210 minutes of aerobic incubation (time-matched control), (2) 90 minutes of simulated ischemia and 120 minutes of reoxygenation, and (3) ischemic preconditioning with 5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reoxygenation before 90 minutes of ischemia and 120 minutes of reoxygenation. Patients were subdivided into 3 age groups: 30 to 49 years, 50 to 69 years, and 70 to 90 years. At the end of each protocol, tissue injury and viability were assessed by the leakage of creatine kinase and the reduction of 3 -(4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide to <b>insoluble</b> formazan <b>dye.</b> ResultsThere were no differences among the 3 groups of patients in their comorbid conditions or their cardiac medications. Ischemic injury was similar in all 3 groups (creatine kinase = 4. 1 ± 0. 7, 3. 6 ± 1. 0, and 4. 3 ± 1. 1 U/g wet weight, respectively; 3 -(4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide = 64. 7 ± 31. 3, 96. 3 ± 32. 0, and 61. 0 ± 30. 4 mM/g wet weight, respectively, P = not significant in all cases), and ischemic preconditioning equally protected against ischemia at all ages (creatine kinase = 1. 9 ± 0. 5, 1. 8 ± 0. 4, and 2. 1 ± 0. 6 U/g wet weight, respectively; 3 -(4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide = 157. 9 ± 31. 5, 170. 7 ± 35. 3, and 138. 4 ± 43. 8 mM/g wet weight, respectively; P <. 05 in all cases vs ischemia alone). ConclusionAge does not influence the tolerance of the human myocardium to ischemia or the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effect of α 1 -adrenoceptor activity on the ischemic and reoxygenated human myocardium. Methods: Right atrial appendages (n = 6 per group) obtained during elective cardiac operations were sliced and stabilized in normoxic normothermic buffer solution for 30 minutes and then subjected to 90 minutes of simulated ischemia, followed by 120 minutes of reoxygenation. In study 1 the dose responses to the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (0. 01, 0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 μmol/L) and to the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 μmol/L) when administered for 10 minutes before ischemia, during ischemia, and during reoxygenation were examined. The influence {{of the time of}} administration (ie, before ischemia, during ischemia, or during reoxygenation) of phenylephrine (0. 1 μmol/L) and prazosin (10 μmol/L) was then investigated in study 2. In study 3 the effect of the combined administration of phenylephrine given before ischemia and prazosin given during ischemia was investigated. In study 4 the protective effect of phenylephrine given before ischemia (for 10 minutes or for 5 minutes with a 5 -minute washout period) was compared with that of ischemic preconditioning (5 minutes of ischemia and 5 minutes of reoxygenation). At the end of each protocol, the leakage of creatine kinase (in units per gram of wet weight) and the reduction of 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide to <b>insoluble</b> formazan <b>dye</b> (in millimoles per gram of wet weight) were measured. Results: Phenylephrine is maximally beneficial at 0. 1 and 1 μmol/L (creatinine kinase, 0. 97 ± 0. 06 and 0. 95 ± 0. 03 U/g, respectively; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 153. 0 ± 7. 8 and 156. 2 ± 6. 7 mmol/g, respectively) compared with ischemic control (creatine kinase, 1. 87 ± 0. 03 U/g; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 108. 5 ± 6. 8 mmol/g; P <. 05) but prazosin is detrimental at concentrations above 10 μmol/L (creatine kinase, 5. 22 ± 0. 29 U/g; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 69. 8 ± 2. 9 mmol/g; P <. 05 vs ischemic control). In addition, phenylephrine (0. 1 μmol/L) is protective when given before ischemia (creatine kinase, 2. 06 ± 0. 21 U/g; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 148. 5 ± 4. 5 mmol/g; P <. 05 vs ischemic control) but is detrimental when given during ischemia alone (creatine kinase, 4. 49 ± 0. 98 U/g; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 70. 5 ± 6. 1 mmol/g; P <. 05 vs ischemic control) and has no significant effect during reoxygenation. In contrast, prazosin (10 μmol/L) is beneficial when given during ischemia alone (creatine kinase, 1. 34 ± 0. 10 U/g; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 148. 5 ± 4. 5 mmol/g; P <. 05 vs ischemic control), is detrimental when given during reoxygenation alone (creatine kinase, 1. 5 ± 0. 16 U/g; 3 -[4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 85. 0 ± 4. 7 mmol/g; P <. 05 vs ischemic control), and has no effect when given before ischemia. The use of phenylephrine before ischemia alone is as protective as prazosin given during ischemia alone, but the combination of the two drugs does not cause additional benefit. Interestingly, the protection afforded by phenylephrine when given before ischemia is similar to that obtained with ischemic preconditioning. Conclusions: In the human myocardium activation of α 1 -adrenoceptors before ischemia is protective but is detrimental during ischemia, whereas blockade of α 1 -adrenoceptors is beneficial during ischemia but detrimental during reoxygenation. The degree of protection achieved by activation of the α 1 -adrenoceptors before ischemia is similar to that obtained with blockade of α 1 -adrenoceptors during ischemia and that of ischemic preconditioning.
