They asked that I release a statement expressing my admiration for Mr. Henley, along with my assistance pulling it off the web as much as possible. Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck? Why sue the new guy? I didn't make a dime off that song. I released it for free. If anything I'm paying homage." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

500|$|By early 1975, Nixon's {{health was}} improving. He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>if</b> I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing." [...] The interviews garnered 45–50million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000, after Kelly {{balked at}} {{returning}} to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: [...] "Oh, tie him up, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>if</b> he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess {{from the way he}} is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I’ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Previewing Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, GamePro {{praised the}} series' [...] "cartoony, bizarre, radical style" [...] {{and how the}} [...] "gorgeous {{character}} sprites endow the 'Toads and their foes with personality and attitude," [...] noting [...] "the Dark Queen definitely has more hex appeal than ever." [...] Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi called the Dark Queen the [...] "breakdown character", noting that [...] "in a time where princesses and queens were there to be kidnapped, the Dark Queen turned the depiction of video game matriarchy on its head and boldly declared that shed be the one doing the kidnapping." [...] Complex noted that [...] "where the TMNT had April O'Neil to flirt with, the most bodacious chick in the Battletoads universe is ironically the final boss who wants them all dead." [...] According to Charmaine Williams of WhatCulture, actually [...] "the only thing [...] had going for it was the sexy Dark Queen. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> you think your show wont live to see a full season, might has well have a character with big boobs that lives in a penis shaped castle." [...] Rare Gamer included the Dark Queen in their lists of [...] "Top 5 Classic Rare Villains Who Just Didn't Know When To Quit" [...] and [...] "Top 5 Rare Femme Fatales (That Would Have Us Switching Sides)". Raze described her as [...] "one bitch who deserves to die" [...] and the original game's ending where the Battletoads [...] "simply just allow her to escape" [...] was included on the 2010 list of ten biggest ending letdowns in video game history by Danny Gallagher of SPIKE. Requesting an 'awesome remake" [...] of Battletoads, Brian Cullen of Maxim wrote that [...] "we would rain hot, repressed justice all over our consoles, just {{for a chance to}} hate-fight the foxy, infuriating Dark Queen;" [...] Sean Velasco, lead designer of 2012's Double Dragon remake Double Dragon Neon, said: [...] "I wanna high five Zitz and punch the Dark Queen in the gut!"

5000|$|In 2007, Costello {{released}} a second full-length LP entitled In Vino Veritas. The album was generally well received by critics and listeners, and helped further establish the band's signature sound.

6000|$|Old Cap'n Billy did {{not answer}} before he had breathed awhile, and then, having tried his cigar and found it out, he scraped a match on his coat-sleeve.

There's something about people automatically hating you before you play that's kind of endearing. It gets to the point where it's over-the-top obnoxious.
