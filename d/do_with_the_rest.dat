In an {{interview}} with Phillymag, Larter gave reason for the move: [...] "I took some time off to define myself outside the pressures of the industry. Part of me really needed to know if this is what I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my life." [...] In January 2005, she moved to Los Angeles for a role in Heroes.|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny for what it was, but had absolutely nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh had a story in this episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good". He remarked that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] was [...] "a solid episode, if a bit too theme-y for my broad-sitcom liking." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lines [...] "He held {{it like a}} {{cigarette}} behind a squaddie's back, he held it so he hid its length and so he hid its lack" [...] in [...] "Jacques Derrida" [...] have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the song, but refer to Gartside's remembrances of observing old men urinating in the toilets of the folk clubs he used to frequent as a young man: [...] "They {{had a way of}} holding their cocks while they were pissing. I found that fascinating." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Mark 14:51-52, a {{young man}} in a linen cloth is seized during Jesus' arrest, but he escapes at the cost of his clothing. This passage seems to have little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the narrative, and it has given cause to various interpretations. Often it is {{suggested}} that the young man is Mark himself. Some commentators believe that the boy was a stranger, who lived near the garden and, after being awakened, ran out, half-dressed, to see what all the noise was about (vv. 46-49). W. L. Lane thinks that Mark mentioned this episode in order to make it clear that [...] "all (not only the disciples) fled, leaving Jesus alone in the custody of the police." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} of William Inge's {{play of the}} same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's {{character}} Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope {{tell you what to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of your life." [...] She [...] "gets even" [...] with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, [...] "I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early archaeologists exhumed around 20 mostly {{complete}} skeletons (though {{many were}} missing their skulls) and fragments of perhaps another 30 individuals.

5000|$|In 1974, the {{producers}} of a theater-in-the-round version of Peter Pan offered Rigby the title role. Rigby commented that she was [...] "scared to death" [...] during rehearsals; only 20 and just a year into [...] "retirement," [...] {{she had no idea}} what she would be <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of her life when the role came along. To her surprise, she discovered that she enjoyed playing Peter Pan.|$|R
2500|$|Johnson {{became a}} Christian {{following}} a divorce, {{and later became}} an elder in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Johnson recounts that on sabbatical in England he sought, through prayer, inspiration for what he should <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life, and then received an epiphany after he read Richard Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker (1986) and Michael Denton's [...] (1985). Johnson later said, [...] "Something about the Darwinists' rhetorical style made me think they had something to hide." [...] Despite having no formal background in biology, he felt that could add insight into the premises and arguments. [...] Johnson stated that he approaches the creation evolution dispute not as a scientist but as an academic lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments. He noted that what people think about evolutionism depends very heavily {{on the kind of}} logic they employ and the kind of assumptions they make. Further, he pointed out that four of the eleven members of the special committee appointed by the National Academy of Sciences to prepare its official booklet titled Science and Creationism were lawyers. Since the publication of the first edition of Darwin on Trial in 1991, he has become a prominent critic of evolutionary theory.|$|E

60|$|Feodora's {{business}} was to beg on the highway.

Feodora's mendicity would have provided an ample fund for their support, but unhappily that ingrate would hardly ever fetch home {{more than two or three}} shillings at a time.

A majority of Britons aged 24 and over said they did not like Blair supporting Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal.|$|R

With a feeling that was creditable to his own heart, he uttered her name, and the sum of £2000. The clause was written, accordingly, read and approved.|$|E

50|$|An oddity of {{this vote}} {{is that the}} Government of Alberta did not print an {{official}} document detailing the election results or expenses of operating the election {{for the general public}} as it <b>did</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> general election that year. This was because the executive council order made by the Social Credit government did not require it. Full printing of the official results did appear in both the Calgary Herald and the Calgary Albertan as they were announced by the Chief Electoral Officer at a press conference held in Edmonton on February 5, 1945. The Herald was the only newspaper to break down the results by counting station.|$|R
60|$|SELF is that {{conscious}} thinking thing,--whatever substance made up of, (whether spiritual or material, simple or compounded, {{it matters}} not)--which is sensible or conscious {{of pleasure and}} pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, {{as far as that}} consciousness extends. Thus every one finds that, whilst comprehended under that consciousness, the little finger {{is as much a part}} of himself as what is most so. Upon separation of this little finger, should this consciousness go along with the little finger, and leave the rest of the body, it is evident the little finger would be the person, the same person; and self then would have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the body. As in this case it is the consciousness that goes along with the substance, when one part is separate from another, which makes the same person, and constitutes this inseparable self: so it is in reference to substances remote in time. That with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing CAN join itself, makes the same person, and is one self with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to itself, and owns all the actions of that thing, as its own, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no further; as every one who reflects will perceive.|$|E
60|$|De Feria, in {{the summer}} of 1559, was succeeded as {{ambassador}} by de Quadra, bishop of Aquila. Dudley and his sister, Lady Sidney (mother of Sir Philip Sidney), now seemed to favour Spanish projects, but (November 13) de Quadra writes: 'I heard from a certain person who is accustomed to give veracious news that Lord Robert has sent to poison his wife. Certainly all the Queen has done with us and with the Swede, and will <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> in the matter of her marriage, is only keeping Lord Robert's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated.' The enemies of Dudley included the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the nation. There was talk of a plot to destroy both Dudley and the Queen. 'The Duke {{and the rest of them}} cannot put up with Lord Robert's being king.'* Further, and later, on January 16, 1560 (Amy being now probably at Cumnor), de Quadra writes to de Feria that Baron Preyner, a German diplomatist, will tell him what he knows of the poison for the wife of Milort Robert (Dudley), 'an important story and necessary to be known.'** Thus between November 1559 and January 1560, the talk is that Amy shall be poisoned, and this tale runs round the Courts of Europe.|$|E

Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to inquire {{concerning}} Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem. And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.

Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and levites, singers, porters, nethinims, or ministers of this House of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment' (Ezra 7:11-26).|$|E
