5|$|Bulleid {{employed}} the same <b>idiosyncratic</b> numbering scheme {{that he had}} used for the Merchant Navy class, beginning at No. 21C101 and reaching No. 21C170 {{at the time of}} nationalisation. His scheme was abolished by British Railways, which renumbered existing these 34001-34070 and new locomotives 34071-34110.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Gustavus Hinrichs, a Danish born {{academic}} chemist {{based in}} America, published a spiral periodic {{system based on}} atomic spectra and weights, and chemical similarities. His work was regarded as <b>idiosyncratic,</b> ostentatious and labyrinthine and this may have militated against its recognition and acceptance.|$|E
5|$|Qumran Hebrew, attested in the Dead Sea Scrolls from ca. 200BCE to 70 CE, is a {{continuation}} of Late Biblical Hebrew. Qumran Hebrew may be considered an intermediate stage between Biblical Hebrew and Mishnaic Hebrew, though Qumran Hebrew shows its own <b>idiosyncratic</b> dialectal features.|$|E
5|$|Trautmann's <b>idiosyncratic</b> {{style of}} play also had an {{influence}} on budding young goalkeepers {{at the height of}} his career. The former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson names Trautmann as his boyhood hero, and Gordon Banks cited him as an influence on his playing style.|$|E
5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or <b>idiosyncratic</b> speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Sorabji was largely self-taught, and he {{distanced himself from}} the main currents of contemporary musical life early in his career. He developed a highly <b>idiosyncratic</b> musical language, with roots in composers as diverse as Busoni, Debussy and Szymanowski, and he dismissed large portions of the established and contemporary repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Orm was {{concerned}} with priests' ability to speak the vernacular, and developed an <b>idiosyncratic</b> spelling system to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. He used a strict poetic metre to ensure that readers know which syllables are to be stressed. Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orm spoke it (Burchfield 1987, p.280).|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews at launch. Reviewers {{noted the}} precision and craft of its game design. Reviewers compared Videoball to other games including the South Asian board game Carrom, and {{a cross between}} Asteroids (1979) and Rocket League (2015). GameSpot reviewer wrote that Videoball was the 2016 equivalent of Rocket League, in that both had <b>idiosyncratic</b> concepts and little prior anticipation, but simple and fun gameplay.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing <b>idiosyncratic</b> departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an <b>idiosyncratic,</b> personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|As {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} National Mall in the mid 1980s, its {{permanent}} collection consisted of more than 6,000 art objects (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. The collection is <b>idiosyncratic,</b> reflecting the relative lack of colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory spoon and an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.|$|E
5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly <b>idiosyncratic</b> conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an <b>idiosyncratic</b> sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an <b>idiosyncratic</b> typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an <b>idiosyncratic</b> reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|Hebden Sports Day is held {{annually}} on August Bank Holiday. Dating {{back to the}} nineteenth century, Hebden Sports provides a variety of running races, novelty races, and entertainments for all age groups. It has hosted the professional Hebden Fell Race since at least 1922, which was a regular feature on the British Open Fell Runners Association calendar until 2013. The village cricket team, the Hebden Hedgehogs plays in the Underdales League, a league with {{its own set of}} <b>idiosyncratic</b> rules. Rugby union, football, and crown green bowling facilities are available at Grassington and Threshfield.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{married his}} last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A {{reformer}} at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an <b>idiosyncratic</b> mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following {{the fall of}} Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In 1543, an Act of Parliament put {{them back in the}} line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown <b>idiosyncratic</b> aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, America {{produced}} diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an <b>idiosyncratic,</b> intentionally American style {{and was the}} first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the idea of an American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his <b>idiosyncratic</b> concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|The Penguin Jazz Guide {{commented that}} Hope's {{compositions}} were strongly melodic, with some containing concepts of fugue and canon taken from classical music, but retaining foundations in the blues. Atkins stated that Hope wrote highly structured, complex compositions that {{he played with}} improvisational flexibility. Mathieson pointed out that, despite the originality of Hope's compositions, they have been taken up by other musicians only rarely, as they are tied to Hope's <b>idiosyncratic</b> form of expression and remain difficult to play.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Tolkien's books {{has had a}} small but lasting effect {{on the use of}} language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's <b>idiosyncratic</b> spellings dwarves and dwarvish (alongside dwarfs and dwarfish), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been dwarrows or dwerrows.) He also coined the term eucatastrophe, though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.|$|E
5|$|As a {{successful}} artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies {{with the doctor}} Marcantonio della Torre. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's <b>idiosyncratic</b> writing. The project was left incomplete {{at the time of}} Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's Treatise on painting, published in France in 1632. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.|$|E
5|$|Barthel {{referred}} {{to each of}} 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts {{have been added to}} the corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (recto) or v (verso) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line being discussed is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A (Tahua), side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer uses an <b>idiosyncratic</b> numbering system.|$|E
5|$|Bush has {{received}} widespread critical acclaim for her eclectic, experimental and <b>idiosyncratic</b> music {{as well as}} her theatrical performances. Despite being nominated 13 times for British Phonographic Industry accolades, she has won only once, which was the Brit Award for Best British Female Artist in 1987. She has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards during the course of her career. In 2002, she was recognised with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Bush was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music. A diverse range of artists have claimed Bush as an influence on their work.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his <b>idiosyncratic</b> style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This <b>idiosyncratic</b> tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|Jahanpanah was {{the fourth}} medieval city of Delhi {{established}} in 13261327 by Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1321–51), of the Delhi Sultanate. To address the constant threat of the Mongols, Tughlaq built the fortified city of Jahanpanah (meaning in Persian: “Refuge of the World”) subsuming the Adilabad fort that had {{been built in the}} 14th century and also all the establishments lying between Qila Rai Pithora and Siri Fort. Neither the city nor the fort has survived. Many reasons have been offered for such a situation. One of which is stated as the <b>idiosyncratic</b> rule of Mohammed bin Tughlaq when inexplicably he shifted the capital to Daulatabad in the Deccan and came back to Delhi soon after.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: <b>idiosyncratic</b> differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E
5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly tricky to write for, as the character had an <b>idiosyncratic</b> view of the world which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E
5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot {{for the show}} that would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a special about where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the project {{was to become a}} pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and <b>idiosyncratic,</b> conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most <b>idiosyncratic</b> 18th century gardens {{surviving}} in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute {{the plans for the}} park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye {{in the form of a}} swan. The lake originally had a snow (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his <b>idiosyncratic</b> cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E
5|$|The temple pattern could vary considerably, {{apart from}} the {{distorting}} effect of additional construction. Many temples, known as hypogea, were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at Wadi es-Sebua. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at Deir el-Bahari, the processional path ran {{up a series of}} terraces rather than sitting on a single level. The Ptolemaic Temple of Kom Ombo was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run the length of the building. The most <b>idiosyncratic</b> temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at el-Amarna, in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and <b>idiosyncratic,</b> and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an <b>idiosyncratic</b> mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
