50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a hood may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden hood opening on the road. The hood release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior hood latch handle, hood release cable and hood latch assembly. The hood latch handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a hood latch handle the <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. A hood may sometimes contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. Hoods are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Car- Pedestrian {{accidents}} cause a loss {{of thousands}} of lives annually in addition to injuries. Therefore, pedestrian protection is one of the important issue in the design of friendly cars. This study shows the performance of finite element head model (FEM) to study and foretelling the extent of injury that occurs at pedestrian accidents and tests the design of the front of vehicle according to European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC WG 17) regulations of bonnet test. The FE models are powerful tools and effective method to understand how to reduce the sever ity of the fatalities of injuries in road pedestrian collision incidents. In this study, the finite element head model impactor has been built by using Soldworks program and simulated the impact process in LS-DYNA program to examine the four engine-hoods have been designed. All of the hood plates and inner <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> were considered. Head Injury Criterion (HIC), internal energy time history generated in the head and hood, displacement occurred in the hood inner panel and weights of the complete hood are investigated. The results of the study concluded that modification of headform design of the car hood contributes in achieving low HIC and lead to a pedestrian friendly car.

Besides functioning as an engine compartment cover, the hood of modern compact SUV can also help to manage the impact energy of a pedestrian’s head in a vehicle-pedestrian impact. This paper presents outer hood design of Esemka R 2 that has a potential to improve hood’s ability and also to absorb the impact energy of a pedestrian’s head. The developed method {{for the design of}} an outer hood configuration aims to provide a robust design and homogeneous of Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for impact position at WAD 1000 and three different thicknesses (1. 25 mm, 1. 35 mm & 1. 50 mm) of outer <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> of Esemka R 2 compact SUV, taking into consideration the limited space available for deformation.

The minimum of deformation space meet the requirement for HIC value which required obtaining robust and homogeneous head impact performance.

40|$|This article {{presents}} research {{motivated by the}} prospect of imminent implementation of the new regulatory requirement for pedestrian protection GTR- 9 (Global Technical Regulation- 9). A new methodology has been developed for optimisation of the <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> of passenger cars to ensure that the pedestrian Head Injury Criterion (HIC) falls below the threshold values specified by both the GTR- 9 and the consumer metric, the Australian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). To meet the performance criteria for pedestrian protection head impact, it is vital to incorporate the associated design parameters into the hood design process at an early stage. These parameters are architectural in nature whereby changing them later in the vehicle design process would be very expensive and difficult to implement. The developed methodology for the design of a hood configuration aims to provide a robust and homogeneous HIC for different impact positions in the central area of the hood of a large sedan, taking into consideration the limited space available for deformation. The non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software LS-DYNA was used in this research to simulate the GTR- 9 /ANCAP pedestrian head impact testing procedures. The efficiency of a hood design was calculated as the ratio of the theoretical optimal deformation of hood assemblyfor a given value of HIC to the actual deformation calculated for the same HIC value of the corresponding numerical test. The efficiency and HIC value were derived for each configuration and compared to obtain the optimal solution for homogeneous performance and minimal deformation of outer and inner hood panels. The Kriging response surface and the Monte Carlo method were used in the design of numerical experiments. The outcomes of this study provide a clear indication that an optimum configuration of the <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> of a passenger car can be developed to minimize the hood deformation while meeting the requirement for HIC value...|$|E

40|$|WP. 29) is {{developing}} a draft global technical regulation (GTR) for pedestrian safety. In order to evaluate the potential effects of the draft GTR on the U. S. fleet, NHTSA’s Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) conducted 88 pedestrian head impact tests on 11 vehicles selected to represent the U. S. fleet, {{with a focus on}} larger passenger vehicles. The goal was to generate an overall picture of current U. S. vehicle performance with respect to specific structures and test zones in order to better understand the potential challenges and benefits of meeting the regulation. The peripheral areas of the head impact test zone defined in the draft GTR produced the most severe impacts, with the most challenging areas being {{in the rear of the}} test zone (in the area of the hinges, cowl, and wiper spindles) and the lateral edges of the test zone adjacent to the fenders. A smaller number of vehicles produced high-severity impacts at the front edge of the test zone. The challenging areas at the periphery of the test zone did not exceed the GTR requirements in every vehicle. Deformable hood hinges with adequate crushable space between the <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> and fender, coverage of the cowl by the back edge of the hood, and flanges under the fender edge all resulted in significant HIC reductions from those areas in vehicles without these countermeasures. The range of performance in the vehicles tested indicates that while there is room for improvement in current head impact protection in US vehicles, countermeasures exist to improve the worst areas of the test zone.

The numerical simulation results performed for the purpose of finding a way to prevent the contaminants outflow from the hood in the presence of external influence are given. Three variants of the hood side panels lengthening are considered: on either side; on the side of the fresh air supply; on the side opposite to the location of air distributors. Comparison of the effects of using these variants of hood design allowed determining that the <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> located on the side of the coming air flow gives the greatest leakage reduction. It is found out that lengthening of the hood side panels does not ensure full localization of the contaminated convective stream. Several variants of using the screen located on the side of the lateral air flow were investigated in the course of work. Best result is observed under conditions of application of the screen symmetrically located relative to spacing between the hood and the plate. The analysis of local values of temperature and velocity fields in this case shows that losses of heated contaminated air to the workshop space are practically absent. It is found out that the convective stream can be most efficiently localized under the condition of hood-symmetric distribution of supply air. Influence of the open gate on convective stream formation in the workshop space with heat emission is considered. The shift of upward flow to the opposite side relative to the gate is observed. The radiant heat release from the board is of great importance in the temperature field formation of closely located areas of floor and walls surface...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{designs and}} {{developments}} must meet safety legislations along with market demands. Safety regulations are mainly {{concerned with how}} a vehicle body performs in crashes, during which pedestrian collision is {{the one of the}} most important issues. When a vehicle strikes a pedestrian, its engine hood will most likely hit the head of the pedestrian, causing serious injuries. To reduce the severity of the injuries, along with market demands to improve vehicle fuel economy and performance, engineers have considered the design solution of reduction of the vehicle hood thickness (and hence its weight) and the use of advanced light materials. As a result, the engine <b>hood</b> <b>panel</b> becomes much more susceptible to excessive vibrations. The sources of these vibrations are road irregularities which provide base excitations and aerodynamic fluid-structure interactions. Engine hood vibrations due to aeroelasticity, called flutter, have been investigated extensively in the past using CAE, wind tunnel experiments, and modeling and simulations by computational fluids dynamics (CFD) techniques. This work studies engine hood vibrations due to excitations from road surface irregularities and explores a passive technique to suppress the levels of vibrations. Due to the unpredictable nature of surface irregularities, this problem is approached by random vibrations analysis. Validated CAE model, with experimental modal analysis, and random vibration analysis are employed to determine the system response under road excitations. The power spectral densities (PSD) of road irregularities are obtained by experiments and used as inputs to the vibratory system. Finally the effects of stiffening elastic bumpers on the engine hood are examined a possible passive technique to suppress vibrations. It is shown that stiffening of the elastic bumpers decreases the vibration levels for the first mode slightly but drastically in other modes. It is also observed that there is less than 2. 5 % shift in the frequency while increasing the stiffness of the elastic bumpers. Finally, although a suppression of less than 5 % in the response amplitude of the first mode of the engine hood system might not seem significant, the proposed approach represents a plausible design solution as it is relatively simple cost-effective, and without much changes to the resonant frequencies...|$|E

Previously transite was made of cement, with varying amounts (12-50%) {{of asbestos}} fiber to provide tensile strength (similar to the steel in reinforced concrete), and other materials. It was frequently used for such purposes as furnace flues, roof shingles, siding, soffit and fascia panels, and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important. It was also used in walk-in coolers made in large supermarkets in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Other uses included roof drain piping, water piping, sanitary sewer drain piping, laboratory fume <b>hood</b> <b>panels,</b> ceiling tiles, landscape edging, and HVAC ducts. Because cutting, breaking, and machining asbestos-containing transite releases carcinogenic asbestos fibers into the air, its use has fallen out of favor.

Demolition of older buildings containing transite materials, particularly siding made from transite requires special precautions and disposal techniques to protect workers and the public. Finding and safely handling asbestos-containing transite is dangerous and difficult and should only be done by an asbestos abatement professional.|$|R

To meet the performance criteria for pedestrian protection head impact, it is vital to incorporate the required design parameters into the hood design process at an early stage. These main design parameters are architectural and changing them late in the vehicle design process is very expensive and difficult to implement. The main design parameters are the inner and outer hood thickness, inner and outer hood material, inner hood structure and the available deformation space to hard components such as the engine. The main objective of this work is to develop a methodology for optimising <b>hood</b> <b>panels</b> of passenger cars to ensure that the pedestrian Head Injury Criterion (HIC) falls below the threshold values specified by both the GTR– 9 and the consumer metric, the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). This study investigated the development of a hood configuration that provides robust and homogeneous HIC for different impact positions in the central area of the hood of a large sedan, taking into consideration of the limited space available for deformation. An extensive series of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) simulations has been carried out to collect the acceleration data and vertical intrusion data required to validate the proposed methodology and the optimal hood configuration. These impact simulations include a stationary vehicle set up and a moving head impactor as per GTR– 9. The Design of Experiments (DOE) has been set up with the control factors as inputs to the Kriging response surface and Monte Carlo methods to output the responses. The variables considered for the control factors are the inner hood structure, inner hood thickness and material, outer hood thickness and material, and the impact positions. The results from the numerical tests have been utilised to map the response surfaces in order to identify the important variables and to visualise the relationships between the inputs and the outputs. The proposed optimisation methodology is described in detail and the outcomes provide clear recommendation of the optimal configuration of passenger car <b>hood</b> <b>panels.</b> In conclusion, if the vehicle design team’s main objective were to reduce the deformation space, the preferred choice for hood material would be steel rather than aluminium. The benefits of minimising the deformation space are significant. They include the freedom of styling, improved aerodynamics, and hence improvements in vehicle stability and fuel economy. The trade–off will be a higher mass than the equivalent aluminium system. On the other hand, if the vehicle design and program team’s main objective was to reduce the system mass, then the preferred choice for hood material would be aluminium. The trade–off would be a higher deformation space than that is required for the steel system...|$|R
