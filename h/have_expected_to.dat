5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She does not appear to <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.|$|E

5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when {{the bodies of the}} Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
25|$|Clayton's {{arrival at}} Somerset was itself controversial. Harold Stephenson had been first-choice wicketkeeper since 1949 and captain since 1960, {{and though he}} was injured {{for much of the}} 1964 season he appears to <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} in both roles. But Somerset's committee offered the captaincy to Colin Atkinson and recruited Clayton as wicketkeeper.|$|E
60|$|He <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> hear {{not only}} those words, but also the {{grounding}} of arms and the brief command <b>to</b> halt.

60|$|Washington reconnoitred the British posts {{from various}} points of view. Everything about them was in admirable order. The works {{appeared}} to be constructed with military science, the troops {{to be in a}} high state of discipline. The American camp, on the contrary, disappointed him. He <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> find eighteen or twenty thousand men under arms; there were not much more than fourteen thousand. He <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> find some degree of system and discipline; whereas all were raw militia. He <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> find works scientifically constructed, and proofs of knowledge and skill in engineering; whereas, what he saw of the latter was very imperfect, and confined to the mere manual exercise of cannon.|$|R

25|$|When World War I {{ended in}} November 1918, {{very few of}} the two Wessex Divisions' {{original}} units remained in India; CCXVIII Brigade represented the largest remaining group of Wessex field gun batteries. The TF units could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be demobilised and returned home, but instead several of them were retained for service in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> return {{to both the}} {{captaincy}} and the wicketkeeping role, but {{he was unable to}} do so in the 1964 season. At the end of the season Somerset appointed Colin Atkinson, the Millfield schoolmaster (and a fellow Teessider) as captain for the 1965 season and recruited Geoff Clayton, the Lancashire wicketkeeper, as first-choice. Stephenson retired from first-class cricket, apparently with some reluctance.|$|E
25|$|Bar-Yosef et al. (1992) {{suggested}} that the cranium was deliberately removed sometime after the ligaments that attached it to the spine had decomposed. Indeed, the skull and teeth of most Neanderthal specimens are better preserved than the post-cranial body, especially its fragile bones such as the hyoid and the cervical vertebrae. Having found most of the post-cranial body, one would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> find the skull and teeth.|$|E

25|$|The lawsuit {{resulted}} in a settlement in 1919 whereby LC Page bought out all of Montgomery's rights to all of her novels published by them. The settlement excluded any reversionary rights that might become due {{for the benefit of}} either her or her heirs if such rights were to become enacted. The settlement paid Montgomery a flat sum of $18,000; at the time an amount she would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> see earned from her works during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In December 1924, {{several days}} after the last ship left the port, Welch treated a few {{children}} for what he first diagnosed as sore throats or tonsillitis, initially dismissing diphtheria since it is extremely contagious and he would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> see the same symptoms in their family members or other cases around town. In the next few weeks, {{as the number of}} tonsillitis cases grew and four children died whom he {{had not been able to}} autopsy, Welch became increasingly concerned about diphtheria.|$|E
25|$|Although the Britons {{gathered}} in considerable force, they {{are said to}} have been poorly equipped, as the Iceni had been disarmed before the rebellion. They placed their wagon train in a crescent at their end of the field, from which point their families could watch what they may <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be an overwhelming victory. Two Germanic leaders, Boiorix of the Cimbri and Ariovistus of the Suebi, are reported to {{have done the same thing}} in their battles against Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar respectively.|$|E

25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
25|$|The lockout had a {{substantial}} effect on international tournaments {{run by the}} International Ice Hockey Federation. The most notable effect was observed in the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and Thief River Falls, Minnesota. With the NHL inactive, the top eligible U-20 players were not playing in that league and thus were available to their countries for the tournament. The country that benefitted most as a result was Canada. The Canadians not only ended a seven-year gold medal drought at this competition, they outscored their opponents 41–7 and defeated Russia 6–1 in the final game. Many analysts believe that the Canadian team was the most dominating ever in this tournament, aided {{in no small part}} by players such as Patrice Bergeron who could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have commitments in the NHL.|$|E
25|$|The first Tour de France {{was staged}} in 1903. The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, {{starting}} in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and Nantes {{before returning to}} Paris. Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Stages would go {{through the night and}} finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again. But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most and only 15 competitors had entered. Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea. Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least 20km/h on all the stages, equivalent to what a rider would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> earn each day had he worked in a factory. He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day's winner at 3,000 francs. The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year. That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants– the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out– among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, some simply adventurous.|$|E

500|$|The name le poer, or pauperus, means [...] "pauper" [...] and was {{not given}} to Roger until after his and his father's fall from power in 1139. It is {{possible}} the new name was bestowed because he could <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> receive a bishopric after his time as chancellor, which did not happen because of his family's disgrace. Another possible reason for the name was to contrast with his father's wealth. It is unlikely {{that he was actually}} poor, as his family was wealthy and powerful. The historian Francis West described the base of the family's power as [...] "control of the important offices of royal government".|$|E
500|$|... "Mother's Day" [...] {{has been}} the subject of several {{retrospective}} reviews of the series.

Moviepilot's Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as [...] "ew would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies". In their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim, authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could [...] "hit you like a truck if you let it".|$|E
