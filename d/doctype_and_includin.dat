Historical fishery-catch records go back more than 100 years, but the reliability with which they discrimi-nate between sea-age classes is uncertain. Research data from some 188 000 scale-aged Scottish salmon that included size (length, weight) and seasonal date of capture on return to the coast were investigated to devise a means of assigning sea age to individual fish objectively. Two simple bivariate probability distributions are described that discriminate between 1 SW and 2 SW fish with 97 % reliability, and between 2 SW and 3 SW fish with 70 % confidence. The same two probability distributions achieve this accuracy across five major east coast Scottish rivers and five decades. They also achieve the same exactitude for a smaller recent dataset from the Scottish west coast, from the River Tweed a century ago (1894 / 1895), and for salmon caught by rod near the estuary. More surprisingly, they also achieve the same success for rod-caught salmon taken at beats remote from the estuary <b>and</b> <b>includin...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—MPI and Charm++ embody two {{distinct}} per-spectives for writing parallel programs. While MPI provides a processor-centric, user-driven model for developing paral-lel codes, Charm++ supports work-centric, overdecomposition-based, system-driven parallel programming. One {{or the other}} can be the best or most natural fit for distinct modules that constitute a parallel application. In this paper, we present a framework that enables hybrid parallel programming with MPI and Charm++, and allows programmers to develop different modules of a parallel application in these two languages while facilitating smooth interoperation. We describe the challenges in enabling interoperation between MPI and Charm++, and present techniques for managing the control flow and resource sharing in such scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of interoperation between MPI and Charm++ through several case studies that use production applications <b>and</b> libraries, <b>includin...</b>|$|R
