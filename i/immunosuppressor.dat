5000|$|The medical {{importance}} of Tolypocladium niveum as an <b>immunosuppressor</b> {{can hardly be}} exaggerated.

5000|$|... 7,12-Dimethylbenzaanthracene (DMBA) is an <b>immunosuppressor</b> and a {{powerful}} organ-specific laboratory carcinogen. DMBA is widely used in many research laboratories studying cancer. DMBA serves as a tumor initiator. Tumor promotion can be induced with treatments of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in some models of two-stage carcinogenesis. This allows for a greatly accelerated rate of tumor growth, making many cancer studies possible.|$|E
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{system is}} described {{which allows the}} study of the effect of <b>immunosuppressors</b> upon the priming and generation of memory to an antigen from Escherichia coli. A single dose of bacterial beta-D-galactosidase without adjuvant injected into C 57 B 1 / 6 J mice primes and elicits memory but not antibodies. Thus by administering <b>immunosuppressors</b> near the priming injection, one can examine whether primary antibody formation is enhanced and whether priming generation of memory is enhanced or inhibited. We found that X-rays, cyclophosphamide and oxisuran (2 -[(methylsulfinyl) acetyl]pyridine) either enhance or inhibit the elicitation of memory, depending on dosage, although they do not alter primary antibody unresponsiveness. The data show two main features: (a) <b>immunosuppressors</b> can enhance immunization; and (b) generation of memory can be improved without increasing antibody levels. The former finding draws attention to the role that <b>immunosuppressors</b> might play in the breaching of tolerance to self-antigens which share determinants with microbes, while the latter observation shows that antibody synthesis and elicitation of memory can follow independent pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>immunosuppressors</b> {{in the treatment}} of systemic sclerosis-interstitial lung disease is still matter of controversy. In this review we will analyse the evidence that <b>immunosuppressors,</b> despite not being able to reverse fibrotic changes, may help in slowing disease progression. Induction treatment with cyclophosphamide should be started as soon as possible in patients at risk for progression. Mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab have to be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate cyclophosphamide. After remission, maintenance treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine should be started in order to preserve the benefits achieved during the induction treatment...|$|R

50|$|It {{is a very}} potent {{inhibitor}} of {{the protein}} phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. Tautomycin demonstrates a slight preference for PP1 inhibition relative to PP2A inhibition. Tautomycin {{is closely related to}} another anhydride containing polyketide PP inhibitor called Tautomycetin which, in addition to being useful as a lead for cancer drug discovery, also is a very potent <b>immunosuppressor.</b> The mechanism of immunosuppression by Tautomycetin differs from that of more classical immunosuppressors such as rapamycin and tacrolimus.|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} the {{relaunch}} {{of the use of}} ciclosporin as an <b>immunosuppressor</b> to facilitate organ transplant. The drug's therapeutic properties were initially demonstrated, but it was almost never used after it was found to cause nephrotoxicity in a number of patients. However, it was then realized {{that it was possible to}} individualize a patient's dose of ciclosporin by analysing the patients plasmatic concentrations (pharmacokinetic monitoring). This practice has allowed this drug to be used again and has facilitated a great number of organ transplants.|$|E
5000|$|Immunosupressors (cyclophosphamide): only {{indicated}} in recurring nephrotic syndrome in corticosteroid dependent or intolerant patients. In {{the first two}} cases the proteinuria has to be negated before treatment with the <b>immunosuppressor</b> can begin, which involves a prolonged treatment with prednisone. The negation of the proteinuria indicates the exact moment when treatment with cyclophosphamide can begin. The treatment is continued for 8 weeks at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, the immunosuppression is halted after this period. In {{order to be able}} to start this treatment the patient should not be suffering from neutropenia nor anaemia, which would cause further complications. A possible side effect of the cyclophosphamide is alopecia. Complete blood count tests are carried out during the treatment in order to give advance warning of a possible infection.|$|E
30|$|The immuostimulatory {{effects of}} type I IFNs are {{critically}} {{dependent upon the}} timing and dosage of mucosal administration (Beilharz et al., 2010). For instance, IFNs given prior to immunogen suppressed immunoglobulin production and class switching of B cells. Additionally, the high dose of type I IFNs was immunosuppressive. Meanwhile type I IFNs are regarded as <b>immunosuppressors</b> under the circumstances of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Some reports showed the administration of type I IFNs was detrimental to pathogen clearance (Wijesundara et al., 2014). Thus to illustrate the enigmatic roles of type I IFNs as immunomodulators or <b>immunosuppressors</b> requires further work on, but not limited, delivery sites, regulating mechanism, optimal dosages and schedules of type I IFNs, and disease indications and circumstances.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of topical <b>immunosuppressors</b> {{in the treatment}} of atopic dermatitis is undebatable. These agents induce immunosuppression by inhibiting T cell activation and cytokine production. An intermittent treatment, with two applications per day, and photoprotection is recommended in adults and children aged more than two years. The precise position of the topical <b>immunosuppressors</b> in the treatment strategy of atopic dermatitis remains to be defined. Main side effects are irritative or allergic cutaneous reactions and cutaneous infections, no systemic side effects have been recorded. The consequence of long-terme topical immunosuppression and specially the possible development of skin cancers in UV exposed skin, is not well known and necessitates careful monitoring of patients. These treatments are contra-indicated during pregnancy, breast feeding, in erythrodermic states and with any alterations of the cutaneous barrier. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tautomycetin (TMC) was {{identified}} as an <b>immunosuppressor</b> of activated T cells. Inhibition of T cell proliferation with TMC was observed at concentrations 100 -fold lower than those needed to achieve maximal inhibition with cyclosporin A (CsA). TMC specifically blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular signal mediators downstream of Src tyrosine kinases in a T cell-specific manner, leading to apoptosis due to cleavage of Bcl- 2, caspase- 9, caspase- 3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, but not caspase- 1. In TMC-treated rats that received a heterotopic cardiac allograft, the graft survived more than 160 days, comparable to graft survival in allografted rats treated with CsA. Thus, TMC, whose mechanism of action {{is different from that}} of CsA or FK 506, {{can be used as a}} potent T cell-specific <b>immunosuppressor...</b>|$|E

40|$|Immunosuppressive {{treatment}} {{is a prerequisite}} for both organ transplantation and tolerance of the allograft. However, long-term immunosuppression has been associated with a higher incidence of malignancies and infections. <b>Immunosuppressors</b> mainly target circulating immune cells and little is known of their “off-target” effects, such as their impact on endothelial cells (ECs). In chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), the allograft endothelium is a target of damage, histologically detected as transplant glomerulopathy, and which correlates with poor graft survival. Under inflammatory conditions, EC expression of HLA class II antigens can lead to CD 4 +-T lymphocyte alloactivation and selective expansion of pro-inflammatory Th 17 and pro-tolerance Treg subsets. This response can be modified and preactivation of the EC by HLA-DR antibody binding promoted a proinflammatory Th 17 response. However, whether or not <b>immunosuppressors</b> alter EC immunogenicity has not been examined. In alloimmunized patients with AMR, cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) are often combined with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs). This study reports changes in the microvascular EC phenotype and function after treatment with CsA, MPA, or IVIg. Both CsA and MPA decreased HLA-DR and increased CD 54 expression, whereas IVIg increased HLA-DR expression. Interleukin 6 secretion was reduced by all three immunomodulators. Preincubation of ECs with CsA or MPA limited, while IVIg amplified, Treg expansion. Because CsA, MPA, and IVIg are known for their ability to act upon leukocytes, we confirmed that ECs maintained their immunoregulatory role when allogeneic leukocytes were pretreated with CsA, MPA, or IVIg. The results reveal that individual <b>immunosuppressors,</b> used in the induction and maintenance of renal allograft tolerance, had direct and distinct effects on ECs. Results of experiments associating IVIg with either CsA or MPA underlined the differences observed using individual <b>immunosuppressors.</b> Paradoxically, CsA or MPA may increase EC mediated inflammatory responses and long-term exposure may contribute to limitation of allograft tolerance. In contrast, IVIg interaction with the endothelium may mediate some of its immunosuppressive effects through promotion of Treg expansion, contributing to the maintenance of allograft tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Cyclosporin-A and FK 506 {{block the}} calcineurin {{activity}} preventing the transcription of genes sharing NFAT-like binding sequences in their promoter region. We presently show that activation of murine T-cells in {{presence of these}} <b>immunosuppressors</b> results in the up-regulation of the synaptotagmin-like 2 gene. However, of the four known isoforms, only mRNAs encoding the a and b isoforms accumulate. Two previously undected isoforms, each characterized by the retention of an intron, were found. The first, Slp 2 -e, includes exon 8, intron 8 and exon 9. The second, Slp 2 -f, is composed of exon 7, intron 7 and exon 8. Slp 2 -f has an open reading frame coding for a putative protein of 1229 amino acids sharing 47 % identities with the human breast-associated antigen, SGA- 72 M.

In previous studies, Portugal was reported as having a milder clinical behavior. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply the Montreal Classification in a large group of UC Portuguese patients in order to describe their clinical characteristics and evaluate variables potentially useful for outcome prediction. METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on data collected from a nationwide online registry was undertaken. RESULTS: In all, 2863 patients with UC were included. Twenty-one percent had ulcerative proctitis, 52 % left-sided colitis, and 28 % extensive colitis. Sixty percent of patients had taken steroids, 14 % <b>immunosuppressors,</b> 1 % biologicals, and 4. 5 % were submitted to surgery. Patients with extensive colitis had more severe activity, needing more steroids, <b>immunosuppressors,</b> and surgery. At the time of diagnosis 61 % were less than 40 years old and 5 % less than 16. Younger patients also had a more aggressive initial course. Thirty-eight percent of patients had only taken salicylates during the disease course and were characterized by a lower incidence of systemic symptoms at presentation (3. 8 % versus 8. 8 %, P < 0. 001), fewer extraintestinal manifestations (7. 7 % versus 24. 0 %, P < 0. 001), and a higher prevalence of proctitis (32. 1 % versus 10. 0 %).

40|$|There is a {{controversy}} {{on the effects}} of physiological levels of glucocorticoids on natural killer (NK) cytotoxity. Therefore, the effects of exogenously administered dexamethasone on NK cytotoxity in 8 -week-old male, Fischer 344 rats were studied. We suppose that the reason for the controversy is insufficient sensitivity of the ordinal radioactive chromium-release assay for normal healthy subjects or animals. Therefore, we developed a new index, a resistance to artificial <b>immunosuppressor,</b> cyclosporine A (CsA) using rat NK activity as an indicator, and named this index, increased resistance to <b>immunosuppressor</b> (IRIS). After some basic, characterizing studies, authors confirmed the fact that continuous doses of dexamethasone (DEX) attenuated NK suppression of CsA. In protocol 4, 18 rats were randomly divided into three groups: the first (DEX + CsA) was injected for 5 days with 0. 1 mg DEX/kg/day and a single dose of CsA on the final day, intraperitoneally; the second (SAL + CsA) was treated with an equal volume of saline and CsA; the third (DEX + SAL) was treated with DEX but not CsA. The IRIS in NK activity was increased significantly (P < 0. 01) with 5 days injection of DEX. These results demonstrated that physiological, and continuous dosage of glucocorticoids stimulated IRIS in NK activity in rats, and this suggests that appropriate stimuli through the hypothalamic-adrenal axis might be acting, at least, as a defence against immune collapses or dysfunctions...|$|E
40|$|Objective. SLE has a relapsing-remitting {{course with}} disease {{activity}} flares over time. This study aims to identify clinical predictors of SLE flares. Methods. This prospective cohort study over 24 months included all SLE patients on follow-up at one academic lupus clinic. Flare {{was defined as}} an increase in SLEDAI- 2 K score ≥ 4 points. Baseline clinical and demographic parameters were compared using survival analysis for time-to-flare outcome with univariate log-rank tests. Variables with significant differences were further evaluated as predictors with multivariate Cox regression models adjusting for potential confounding or contributing factors and hazard ratio (HR) calculation. Results. A total of 202 SLE patients were included. Over the follow-up period, 1083 visits were documented and 16. 8 % of patients presented with flares. In multivariate analysis, the following parameters emerged as flare predictors: SLE diagnosis up to 25 years of age (HR = 2. 14, P = 0. 03), lupus nephritis previous to baseline visit (HR = 4. 78, P < 0. 0001) and <b>immunosuppressor</b> treatment for severe SLE (HR = 3. 22, P < 0. 001).

30|$|Contrary to {{upregulation}} of IL- 12, IL- 10 was downregulated in RBcs-exposed DCs. As an <b>immunosuppressor,</b> IL- 10 inhibits {{the expression}} of MHC class molecules and co-stimulatory molecules, and prevents the production of Th 1 cytokines IL- 2 and IFN-γ by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Therefore, IL- 10 favors tumor evasion from immune surveillance via suppressing antigen presentation and T cell activation (Lippitz, 2013). IL- 10 is overexpressed {{in a series of}} human cancers, which is associated with advanced stage and bad prognosis (Lippitz, 2013).
