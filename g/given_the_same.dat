5|$|The A Station's {{control room}} was given many Art Deco {{fittings}} by architect Halliday. Italian marble {{was used in}} the turbine hall, and polished parquet floors and wrought-iron staircases were used throughout. Owing to a lack of available money following the Second World War, the interior of the B Station was not <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> treatment, and instead the fittings were made from stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, but {{while some of}} his edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, they were not harsher than those of his predecessors. It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. On the other hand, Jewish clergy were <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E

Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E

5|$|Kapur {{rated the}} main event an 8 out of 10, while he gave the Gauntlet match a 7 out of 10. The Iron Man match {{received}} a perfect 10 out of 10 from Kapur, his highest rating of the review.

The NWA World Tag Team Championship match and Jushin Liger versus Samoa Joe were both given a 7 out of 10.

5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the same class was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E

5|$|While {{officers}} were typically {{allowed to leave}} their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral crewmen were not <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opportunity.

5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{compared}} with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) {{would prove to}} be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
50|$|For many {{purposes}} reproducibility is important.

Reproducible temperature measurement means that comparisons are valid in scientific experiments and industrial processes are consistent.

5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the humiliation of the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Michigan Department of Transportation {{consulted}} with its counterparts in Wisconsin (WisDOT), Minnesota (Mn/DOT) and Ontario (Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, MTO) about {{the formation of}} a circle tour around Lake Superior. The Lake Michigan Circle Tour was signed on maps by 1988. In May 2001, the section of US12 through Saline was designated a Michigan Historic Heritage Route. The segment through Clinton was <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> status in October 2002. On June 9, 2004, the full length of US12 was dedicated as the US12 Heritage Trail. In December 2014, this became a Pure Michigan Byway when Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation renaming the Michigan Heritage Route System to the Pure Michigan Byway System.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
5|$|Option C is {{a concept}} in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the {{championship}} {{in exchange for a}} World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. It began in June 2012 when then-champion Austin Aries said that he was not satisfied with being just the X Division Champion, which led to then-General Manager Hulk Hogan offering him a match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but only if he first vacated the X Division Championship. Aries agreed to Hogan's terms, on the condition that the X Division Champion be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opportunity in future years. Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E
5|$|Symes {{returned}} to Shrewsbury and started pre-season training {{ahead of the}} 2008–09 season, having been told by Simpson {{that he would be}} <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> chance as any other player at Shrewsbury to impress, and also personally vowing to force his way into the manager's first-team plans. However, Simpson signed new strikers during the summer including Grant Holt, who cost a club record £170,000, and Symes spent {{the start of the season}} out of the team. After scoring six goals in two consecutive reserve games, Symes earned his first game for the first team, when he came off the bench to score a late equaliser and earn Shrewsbury a 2–2 draw with Notts County on 30 August. After starting in a 2–1 Football League Trophy victory against Exeter City, he was again sidelined when he picked up a knee injury. He {{returned to}} action in mid-October, when he came on as substitute to give Shrewsbury a late equaliser against Port Vale, only for Vale to score another goal to give them victory.|$|E
