30|$|The red palette {{appears to}} have been the most {{traditional}} with vermilion, hematite and <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> widespread and present in most works examined from all periods and locations. These materials were frequently mixed with each other or other colors to adjust the tone. Organic reds were probably present in many works but can normally only be inferred from the lack of detectable elements such as lead, iron or mercury by XRF analysis and from careful visual and, sometimes, ultraviolet examination. Visually, organic reds tended to be added on top of other colors and they appear more transparent and glassier. <b>Higher</b> <b>percentages</b> of <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> give a more orange color, vermilion and organic reds give a darker or pinker red, and hematite gives a browner tint. Other pigments such as lead white, orpiment or pararealgar were mixed in with the reds to give a range of orange or pink hues, particularly in the 15 th and 16 th centuries, (for example Table  1, # 17 and # 26).|$|R

5000|$|Two color {{variations}} {{are referred}} to as [...] "red or rufous morphs" [...] and [...] "gray morphs" [...] by bird watchers and ornithologists. Rusty birds are more common in the southern parts of the range; pairings of the two color variants do occur. While the gray morph provides remarkably effective camouflage amongst the bark of hardwood trees, red morphs may find security in certain pine trees and the colorful leaves of changing deciduous trees. The <b>highest</b> <b>percentage</b> of <b>red</b> morph are known from Tennessee (79% of population) and Illinois (78% of population). A rarer [...] "brown morph" [...] is known, recorded exclusively in the south (i.e. Florida), which may be the occasional product of hybridation between the morphs. In the state of Florida, brown morphs are typically reported in the more humid portions of the state, whereas they appear to be generally absent in the northern and northwestern parts of the state. A paler gray variation (sometimes bordering on a washed-out, whitish look) also exists in western Canada and the north-central United States.|$|R
40|$|Discharging of {{huge amount}} of {{wastewater}} from textiles industry has caused harm to the environmental. The wastewater treatment {{has become one of}} the biggest difficulties confronted by the textiles industry. Nowadays, the capability of agricultural waste as adsorbent to remove dye from the industrial wastewater has been proved by many researcher. Agricultural waste can help to treat the wastewater as well as to reduce environmental problem cause by waste at the plantation. This study represents the potential of banana pseudostem fibers waste as adsorbent for dye removal. The methyl red dye solution was used in this study because methyl red dye that often used in textiles industry can give negative impact to environment and human health. Two type of adsorbent were used in this study which is raw materials and activated carbon from the banana pseudostem fibers. Four parameters of optimization were studied which is contact time, adsorbent dosage, concentration and pH. The experimental result showed, for raw materials from banana pseudostem fibers, the <b>highest</b> <b>percentage</b> of methyl <b>red</b> dye removal was 98. 20 % and the optimum condition 120 minutes contact time, 0. 2 g adsorbent dosage, 20 mg/L concentration and pH 3. For the activated carbon, the <b>highest</b> <b>percentage</b> of methyl <b>red</b> dye removal was 99. 01 % and the optimum condition 30 minutes of contact time, 0. 1 g of adsorbent dosage, 20 mg/L of concentration and pH 3. This study can conclude that the activated carbon from banana pseudostem fibers have the highest potential to be used as adsorbent to remove dye from the wastewater compared to the raw material from banana pseudostem fibers...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{attempts}} to immunize domestic fowls against mosquito-borne infections of Plasmodium gallinaceum {{by means of}} (a) vaccination with inactivated homologous sporozoites; (b) injections of sera, both normal sheep serum, and serum from fowls chronically infected with the homologous Plasmodium, (c) combinations of both sporozoite vaccine and serum. It was possible to reduce the normal malaria death rate (55. 4 per cent) in these fowls by each of the above methods but most markedly by the combined prophylactic treatment. Mortality rates were 21. 1 per cent in vaccinated fowls, 16. 7 per cent in serum-treated fowls, and 7. 3 in those having the combined treatment. Intensity of infection was measured by counting the <b>percentage</b> of <b>red</b> cells infected each day. It was found that in each group of fowls having prophylactic treatment the average of <b>highest</b> <b>percentages</b> of <b>red</b> cells infected was less than in untreated malarious fowls (30. 1 per cent).

Second, techniques {{to increase the}} accuracy and to optimize CT-perfusion (CTP) - and CT-angiography (CTA) -imaging were explored. In part 1 we investigated {{the relation between the}} cause of stroke, the success of intravenous thrombolysis and the pathologic components of thrombi with the attenuation of thrombi on Non-Contrast CT (NCCT). First, we looked at the relation between thrombus attenuation and different stroke subtypes on 1 -mm NCCT. We found that cardioembolic thrombi showed least dense vessel signs and lowest attenuation, followed by thrombi due to large artery atherosclerosis and dissection thrombi. Second, we performed a histopathologic analysis exploring the relation of thrombus components with the different stroke subtypes and thrombus attenuation. In a histopathologic analysis on 22 cerebral thrombi the majority of cerebral thrombi was fresh and thrombi originating from large artery atherosclerosis had a <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> of <b>red</b> blood cells (RBCs) than cardioembolisms and large artery atherosclerosis was the only stroke subtype with red (RBC-rich) thrombi.

Further, we have successfully cultured parasite isolates directly from cattle that failed to grow in traditional serum-containing medium. Variation of atmospheric gas composition and culture volumes to determine optimal growth conditions revealed that a 600 -microl culture in an atmosphere comprising 5 % O(2), 5 % CO(2), and 90 % N(2) achieved a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> of parasitized <b>red</b> blood cells than any other combination tested.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: The 7 -ketocholesterol (7 KC) -induced {{cell death}} has some {{characteristics}} of apoptosis and {{is associated with}} polar lipid accumulation. So, we investigated {{the effects of the}} broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and of the caspase- 2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk on lipid profile evaluated by staining with Nile Red (NR). METHODS:: The 7 KC-treated human monocytic U 937 cells were cultured in the absence or {{in the presence of the}} caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk. When staining with NR is performed, neutral and polar lipids have yellow and orange/red emission, respectively, and fluorescence was then analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) combined with subsequent image processing. The 3 D-image sequences were obtained by means of CLSM using spectral analysis, and were analyzed by the factor analysis of medical image sequences algorithm to differentiate spectra inside mixed fluorescence emission and get corresponding specific images. RESULTS:: By FCM, comparatively to untreated cells, <b>higher</b> <b>percentages</b> of <b>red</b> fluorescent cells were identified in 7 KC-treated cells. Factor curves and images reveal orange and red fluorescence emissions in 7 KC-treated cells and show yellow, orange, and red fluorescence emissions in 7 KC-treated cells cultured in the presence of z-VAD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk. CONCLUSIONS:: Our data support that investigation by FCM and by spectral analysis in CLSM associated with subsequent image processing provides useful tools to determine the effect of caspase inhibitors on lipid content evaluated with NR. They also favor the hypothesis of relationships between caspase activity and polar lipid accumulation. (c) 2007 International Society for Analytical Cytology...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{bacteria}} in the occasional emergence of red water, which has been documented worldwide, {{has yet to be}} determined. To better understand the mechanisms that drive occurrences of red water, the bacterial community composition and the relative abundance of several functional bacterial groups in a water distribution system of Beijing during a large-scale red water event were determined using several molecular methods. Individual clone libraries of the 16 S rRNA gene were constructed for three red water samples and one sample of normal water. Beta-, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria comprised the major bacterial communities in both red water and normal water samples, in agreement with previous reports. A <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> of <b>red</b> water clones (25. 2 to 57. 1 %) were affiliated with or closely related to a diverse array of iron-oxidizing bacteria, including the neutrophilic microaerobic genera Gallionella and Sideroxydans, the acidophilic species Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, and the anaerobic denitrifying Thermomonas bacteria. The genus Gallionella comprised 18. 7 to 28. 6 % of all clones in the three red water libraries. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the 16 S rRNA gene copy concentration of Gallionella spp. was between (4. 1 +/- 0. 9) x 10 (7) (mean +/- standard deviation) and (1. 6 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (8) per liter in red water, accounting for 13. 1 % +/- 2. 9 % to 17. 2 % +/- 3. 6 % of the total Bacteria spp. in these samples. By comparison, the percentages of Gallionella spp. in the normal water samples were 0. 1 % or lower (below the limit of detection), suggesting an important role of Gallionella spp. in the formation of red water...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred seventy-three Jonathan {{seedlings}} {{produced by}} 11 crosses {{form the basis}} of the records in this bulletin. These studies show clearly that the progenies produced by the different crosses of Jonathan differ or vary in many important characteristics. These variations are attributed to differences in the genetic constitution of the several varieties which were used in combination with Jonathan, and indicate the relative value of these varieties as parents when crossed with Jonathan. The range of variation in the seedlings of these progenies is generally quite wide both as to tree and fruit. Differences in the horticultural characteristics such as occur in size, form, color, flavor, quality and season of the seedling fruits suggest that multiple factors are concerned, which produce the many variations observed. Jonathan appears to carry as partially dominant factors for medium and below medium size of fruit, but it evidently carries factors also for large and for small size. Factors for roundish, conic, oblate and oblong fruit forms are present. Jonathan appears to be homozygous for red skin color but is heterozygous for pattern and carries factors for both fine and coarse grained flesh, for juiciness, for both acid and sweet flavor and for very good as well as for poor quality. The factors which control the season of the fruit are evidently complex. Jonathan appears to carry factors for season varying from late summer to late winter but probably carries as dominant the factors for mid-winter season. It is of importance to observe that the color, size and flavor of Jonathan were recovered occasionally and that these characteristics were combined with the characteristics of the other parent variety. Colorado Orange produced a <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> of fruits of good commercial size than did Salome, Anisim or Roman Stem when crossed with Jonathan. When crossed with Jonathan, Salome produced the <b>highest</b> <b>percentage</b> of fruit rating good and very good, followed in order by Colorado Orange, Anisim and Roman Stem. Late season appeared most often in the seedlings of Colorado Orange and Salome, while Anisim and Roman Stem produced no late season apples.

40|$|Bone marrow aspirates from {{patients}} with cerebral malaria were studied {{with the light}} and electron microscopes. Various abnormalities were found including: (1) an increase in plasma cells and macrophages, sometimes to a marked degree; (2) phagocytosis of parasitized red cells by macrophages and of merozoites by neutrophil metamyelocytes, neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages; (3) {{an increase in the}} proportion of eosinophil granulocytes and their precursors; (4) the presence of giant metamyelocytes; and (5) morphological abnormalities of erythroblasts, particularly irregularly-shaped nuclei and karyorrhexis. A <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> of the <b>red</b> cells within marrow sinusoids were parasitized and the parasitized cells were attached to the endothelium. Some marrow sinusoids were packed with and completely obstructed by parasitized cells. Strands of electron-dense material were sometimes found connecting the knobs of parasitized red cells to endothelial cells or to the knobs of adjacent parasitized red cells. A striking finding was a complex interdigitation between cytoplasmic processes developed by some of the parasitized red cells and those developed by the endothelial cells to which they were attached. Occasionally, cytoplasmic processes arising from marginated parasitized red cells completely penetrated the endothelial cell and emerged extravascularly. Several parasitized red cells were also found extravascularly between haemopoietic cells. Sequestration of parasitized red cells within small blood vessels may play a part in the pathogenesis not only of the encephalopathy of cerebral malaria but also of the bone marrow dysfunction in severe malaria...|$|R
