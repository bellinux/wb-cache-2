25|$|In sailing, a full-rigged brig is {{a vessel}} with two square rigged masts (fore and main). The main mast of a brig is the aft one. To improve maneuverability, the {{mainmast}} carries a small (gaff rigged) <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the fore}} and main masts of a [...] "ship" [...] are exactly {{similar to those}} of a barque, which have been already described, we shall content ourself with {{remarking}} that the mizzen-mast is similar in nearly all respects to the other two, except that it is smaller. The sails upon it are--the spanker (a <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> projecting over the quarter-deck), the mizzen-top-sail and mizzen-top-gallant-sail, both of which are square sails. Above all these a [...] "ship" [...] sometimes puts up small square-sails called the royals; and, above these, sky-sails.|$|E
50|$|To a mast - <b>Fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> {{directly}} {{attached to}} the mast at the luff include gaff-rigged quadrilateral and Bermuda triangular sails.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A four-masted barque, square-rigged on {{the first}} three masts. One or more <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> on the aftmost mast help a ship steer and turn.|$|R
50|$|All {{the ships}} {{of the class}} were {{provided}} with a barque rig, that is, square-rigged foremast and mainmast, and <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> only on the mizzen mast.|$|R
60|$|The sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} fastened,--namely, the main-sail; above that the main-top-sail; above that the main-top-gallant-sail; and {{sometimes}} a very small sail, named the royal, is spread above all. Behind the main-sail there is a small <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> similar to the main-sail of a schooner, which is called the boom-main-sail. On the fore-mast is a similar sail, which is called the try-sail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships there are smaller poles or arms, which can be pushed out at pleasure, and the yard lengthened, in order to receive an additional little sailor wing on each side. These wings are called studding-sails or stun-sails, and are used only when the wind is fair and light. They are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened; thus there are the main-stun-sails, the main-top-stun-sails, and the main-top-gallant-stun-sails, etcetera. The fore-mast of a brig is smaller than the main-mast. It carries a fore-sail, fore-top-sail, fore-top-gallant-sail, and fore-royal. Between it and the bowsprit are the fore-stay-sail, jib, and flying-jib. The three last sails are nearly similar in all vessels. All the yards, etcetera, are hoisted and shifted, and held in their position, by a complicated arrangement of cordage, which in the mass is called the running-rigging, in contradistinction to the standing-rigging, which, as we have said, is fixed, and keeps the masts, etcetera, immovably in position. Yet every rope, in what seems to a landsman's eye a bewildering mass of confusion, has its distinctive name and specific purpose.|$|E
50|$|The large <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> on the {{mainmast}} is the mainsail, {{while the}} sail on the mizzen mast is the mizzen. These sails may be {{any type of}} <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail,</b> in any combination. Most modern ketches are Bermuda rigged, but other possible rigs on a ketch include gunter rigs and gaff rigs. The Scots Zulu, for example, had a dipping lug main with a standing lug mizzen.|$|E
50|$|A {{triangular}} <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> {{called a}} jib-headed topsail may be carried between the gaff and the mast.|$|E
50|$|The {{ships were}} {{provided}} with a three-masted barquentine rig, that is, with square sails on the foremast and <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> on the main and mizzen masts.|$|R
60|$|The largest {{class of}} vessel that floats upon the sea is the full-rigged ship, the {{distinctive}} peculiarity of which is, that its three masts are all square-rigged together, {{with the addition of}} one or two <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, barquentines {{are popular}} with modern tall ship and sail {{training}} operators as their suite of mainly <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> can be operated with ease and efficiency, but the single mast of square sails offers long distance speed and dramatic appearance in port.|$|R
5000|$|In the Royal Navy in {{the late}} nineteenth century, the term [...] "trysail" [...] came to denote the main <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> on any mast. This {{included}} the mainsail of the [...] "great brig" [...] HMS Temeraire, the largest <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> ever used by a warship. Naval trysails were usually gaff-rigged and [...] "loose-footed", with a spar along the head but no boom, and small auxiliary trysails continued in intermittent use into the 1920s for seakeeping and stationkeeping.|$|E
50|$|In sailing, a full-rigged brig is {{a vessel}} with two square rigged masts (fore and main). The main mast of a brig is the aft one. To improve maneuverability, the {{mainmast}} carries a small (gaff rigged) <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
50|$|Luff - The forward (leading) {{edge of a}} <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> {{is called}} the luff, which, in a mainsail, is {{parallel}} to the mast. In a symmetrical sail that leech, which is the leading edge into the wind, may be called the luff.|$|E
5000|$|A {{schooner}} [...] {{is a type}} of <b>sailing</b> vessel with <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> on two or more masts, the foremast being {{shorter than}} the main and no taller than the mizzen if there is one. While the schooner was originally gaff-rigged, modern schooners typically carry a Bermuda rig.|$|R
50|$|The STS Kaisei (海星), meaning “Sea Star” in the Japanese language, is a steel-hulled {{brigantine}} {{designed by}} designed by Polish naval architect Zygmunt Choreń. It {{was built in}} Gdańsk, Poland in 1987. It is a two-masted vessel, square rigged on the foremast, with <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> on the mainmast.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas most cruisers of the 1890s {{adopted a}} three-masted barque or barquentine rig {{combining}} {{a strong emphasis}} on <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> with a partial square rig, the Bramble class differed by being designed as two-masted ships, and in 1911, the authoritative partnership of Sir Philip Watts and John Harper Narbeth noted that they only used a [...] "reduced" [...] fore-and-aft sailplan. Thus rigged, they somewhat resembled the much larger contemporary Royal Navy protected cruisers such as the Astrea class and Eclipse class, which had two [...] "military masts", principally used for signal halyards, lookout positions and fighting tops, but designed to set auxiliary <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> in an emergency. On the other hand, HMS Thistle used some square sails, and {{there appears to be no}} clear evidence what their designed sailplan was (an original brig or brigantine sailplan like the earlier HMS Temeraire cannot be ruled out).|$|R
50|$|Leech - The aft (back) {{edge of a}} <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> {{is called}} the leech (also spelled leach), which is {{opposite}} the luff, and on a triangular sail forms the hypotenuse of the triangle The leech is either side edge of a symmetrical sail.|$|E
50|$|The tack of a square-rigged sail {{is a line}} {{attached}} to its lower corner. This {{is in contrast to}} the more common <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail,</b> whose tack {{is a part of the}} sail itself, the corner which is (possibly semi-permanently) secured to the vessel.|$|E
50|$|Tack - The {{corner on}} a <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> where the luff and foot connect {{is called the}} tack and, on a mainsail, is located where the boom and mast connect. On a square sail underway, the tack is the {{windward}} clew and also the line holding down that corner.|$|E
50|$|Although the Spanish word goleta {{is usually}} {{translated}} as schooner, the rigging of the Mexicana was changed {{a number of}} times, from a topsail schooner to a modified brig and other variations. In addition {{to a set of}} <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> the Mexicana carried main-mast and fore-mast courses, topsails, and staysails. The vessel also carried spanker, jib, and flying jib sails.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> {{often have}} bolt ropes {{on the leading}} edge (luff) where they attach to the mast and the bottom edge (foot) where they attach to the boom, which provide the terms, [...] "luff bolt rope" [...] and [...] "foot bolt rope". They also occur on the edges of sails {{suspended}} from a spar, such as for gaff, square and lateen rigs.|$|R
25|$|Ships of {{the class}} were armed with two 7-inch (90 cwt) muzzle-loading rifled guns on {{pivoting}} mounts, and four 64-pounder muzzle-loading rifled guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). Four machine guns and one light gun completed the weaponry. All the ships {{of the class}} were provided with a barque rig, that is, square-rigged foremast and mainmast, and <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> only on the mizzen mast.|$|R
50|$|The {{corner where}} the leech and foot connect {{is called the}} clew on a <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail.</b> On a jib, the sheet is {{connected}} to the clew; on a mainsail, the sheet {{is connected to the}} boom (if present) near the clew. Clews are the lower two corners of a square sail. Square sails have sheets attached to their clews like triangular sails, but the sheets are used to pull the sail down to the yard below rather than to adjust the angle it makes with the wind. The corner where the leech and the foot connect is called the clew. The corner on a <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> where the luff and foot connect is called the tack and, on a mainsail, is located where the boom and mast connect.|$|E
5000|$|Fore-and-aft rigs {{comprise}} {{the vast majority}} of sailing vessels in use today, including effectively all dinghies and yachts. The sheet on a <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> controls the angle of the sail to the wind, and should be adjusted to keep the sail just filled. Most smaller boats use the Bermuda rig, which has two or three sets of sheets: ...|$|E
5000|$|A brig has two masts, both square-rigged. In {{addition}} to jibs and staysails (stays'ls) before the foremast and staysails between the masts, {{there is a}} gaff-rigged <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail,</b> called a [...] "spanker" [...] or a [...] "kicker" [...] or sometimes a [...] "mizzen". This sail occupies the lower [...] to [...] of the main or aftermost mast, with sqares'ls above.|$|E
5000|$|Edges - The {{top of all}} sails {{is called}} the head, the leading edge is called the luff on <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> and on {{windward}} leech symmetrical sails, the trailing edge is the leech, and the bottom edge is the foot. The head is attached at the throat and peak to a gaff, yard, or sprit. For a triangular sail the head refers to the topmost corner.|$|R
50|$|Triangular fore-and-aft rigs {{were invented}} in the Mediterranean as single-yarded lateen sails and {{independently}} in the Pacific {{as the more}} efficient bi-sparred crab claw sail, {{and continue to be}} used throughout the world. During the 16th-19th centuries other <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> were developed in Europe, such as the spritsail, gaff rig, jib, genoa, staysail, and Bermuda rig mainsail, improving the upwind sailing ability of European vessels.|$|R
5000|$|The vessel, {{described}} as a two masted brigantine square rigged on the foremast, with <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> on the mainmast, was originally commissioned as a 14-gun cutter named West Florida after being built by the British in New England, and later was an armed brig-sloop and the only armed British vessel patrolling the lakes and Mississippi Sound. She had taken several American rebel smugglers as prizes under Lieutenant John Payne, RN.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{design is}} {{believed}} to be due to Christian Bergh. She had a hermaphrodite rig, i.e., she combined the rigs of a schooner and a brigantine. [...] "She carried four sails on the foremast, one square sail on the main, and a large <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> with gaff abaft the fore, with large staysails over and three jibs. Her spanker boom projected far beyond the stern." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{spritsail}} is a four-sided, <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail</b> that {{is supported}} {{at its highest}} points by the mast and a diagonally running spar known as the sprit. The foot of the sail can be stretched by a boom or held loose-footed just by its sheets. A spritsail has four corners: the throat, peak, clew, and tack. TheSpritsail {{can also be used}} to describe a rig that uses a spritsail.|$|E
50|$|Some {{dictionaries}} {{suggest that}} {{the origin of the}} word could be traced to the first boat to commonly fly a spinnaker, a yacht called Sphinx, mispronounced as Spinx. Sphinx first set her spinnaker in the Solent in 1865, and the first recorded use of the word was in 1866 in the August edition of Yachting Calendar and Review (p. 84). In addition, the term may have been influenced by the spanker, originally a gaff rigged <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{the term}} barque (sometimes, {{particularly}} in the USA, spelled bark) came to refer to any vessel with a particular type of sail-plan. This comprises three (or more) masts, <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>sails</b> on the aftermost mast and square sails on all other masts. Barques were the workhorse of the Golden Age of Sail in the mid-19th century as they attained passages that nearly matched full rigged ships but could operate with smaller crews.|$|R
