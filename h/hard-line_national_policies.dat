50|$|In 2004, Fattahi and his {{followers}} began to gain attention in the mainstream media, with an incendiary editorial in a <b>hard-line</b> <b>national</b> newspaper portraying Fattahi as a miscreant. Several more articles were published in hard-line newspapers since then (Resalat, Kayhan, Jam e jam, Jomhouri Eslami), with the charges leveled at Fattahi and his group taking on a more serious air. These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.|$|R

The ISAS director of external affairs, Yasunori Matogawa, said, [...] "It seems the <b>hard-line</b> <b>national</b> security proponents in parliament are increasing their influence, and they aren't getting much criticism…I think we’re moving into a very dangerous period.

The study examined six major issues: (1) fundamental political ideas and commitments underpinning national policies; (2) priorities for <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> and motives for their setting; (3) -procedures used {{in the development of}} <b>national</b> policies; (4) <b>policy</b> implementation; (5) changes in national higher education systems {{as a result of the}} internaEionalization process; and (6) assessment of how <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> affects or is affected by international/multilateral initiatives.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the implementation of <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> there is an assumption that these get implemented uniformly within one country. Here, with a focus on the implementation of <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> on shifting from administrative to hydrological/ hydrographic principles of water management in the Zerafshan Valley and the Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan, this assumption is questioned. The case study demonstrates that <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> are resisted by lower-level bureaucrats, leading to diverse, even contradictory, outcomes of the same policy. The vested interests of a multiplicity of bureaucracies, the power of individual bureaucrats, and the discretional power given to bureaucracies in interpreting <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> are responsible for the different outcomes. The article calls for more comparative assessments across different regions for a better understanding of policy implementation...|$|R

40|$|The EU {{legal system}} offers a {{powerful}} means for domestic actors to influence <b>national</b> <b>policy.</b> Because the EU legal tool is so powerful, many have hypothesized that groups will use EU litigation strategies whenever {{there is a}} potential benefit. In practice, however, EU law litigation strategies are seldom used. This paper develops a framework for understanding variation {{in the use of the}} EU legal system to influence <b>national</b> <b>policy.</b> It identifies four different steps in using the EU legal system to influence <b>national</b> <b>policy.</b> Drawing on recent research on the European Union’s legal system and interest group mobilization, the paper develops a series of hypotheses about the factors affecting each step of the litigation process, in identifying sources of cross-national and cross issue variation in the influence of EU law on <b>national</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R
