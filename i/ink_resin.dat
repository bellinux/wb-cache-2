50|$|Most toner goes to printed pages, a large {{fraction}} {{of which are}} ultimately recycled in paper recovery and recycling operations. Removal of toner from the pulp is not easy, and toner formulations to ease this step have been reported. Hydrolyzable, water-soluble, and caustic-soluble toner resins have been reported, but {{do not appear to}} enjoy widespread application. Most paper recycling facilities mix toner with other waste material, such as <b>inks</b> and <b>resins,</b> into a sludge with no commercial use.|$|R
40|$|Versatility of {{alkyd resins}} {{is due to}} its {{application}} in many different areas such as decorative paints, stoving paints (industrial paints), water dispersible alkyd paints and printing <b>inks.</b> Alkyd <b>resins</b> are also used to make anticorrosive primers for metals such as steel, iron or zinc. Furthermore, versatility of alkyds are due to their remarkable properties such as high pigment wetting properties resulting from oily nature, formation of coherent film by drying owing to unsaturated fatty acid moieties, gloss retention, flexibility, solvent resistance and durability of dried films...|$|R
30|$|Colored {{aluminum}} pigments having colorful pigment adhered closely, uniformly {{and firmly}} {{on its surface}} are suitably used in paints, automotive metallic finish, printing <b>inks,</b> molded <b>resins</b> and in decoration finish of plastics [1, 2, 3]. The application of aluminum pigment has expanded into security services, including the military, due to its high emissive properties {{and the ability to}} reflect IR rays in the solar spectrum [4, 5, 6, 7]. Recently, colored aluminum pigments have been used in plastic components of objects, such as boats or buoys, to make them visible to RADAR detection due to their ability to reflect in the electromagnetic radiation [5, 8]. These and many other functional properties of aluminum pigments have rekindled research interest lately.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Volatile organic {{compound}} (VOC) contents of news, sheetfed, and heatset inks {{were evaluated by}} using differ-ent methods, and comparison of data with significant differ-ences is reported. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 24, EPA Method 24 A, and Bay Area Method 30 were the methods used. Ingredients of news inks were tested with Method 24, and experimental and calculated percentage VOC values of formulated inks were compared. Along with United States Department of Agriculture’s 100 % vegetable oil-based inks, commercial vegetable oil-based, and petroleum-based inks were used for comparison. Significant differences between methods, colors, and sources are discussed. Paper no. J 9671 in JAOCS 78, 419 – 422 (April 2001).

50|$|Commercially {{significant}} resins {{are produced}} from treatment of acetophenone with formaldehyde and a base. The resulting copolymers are conventionally described with the formula (C6H5COCH)x(CH2)xn, resulting from aldol condensation. These substances are components of coatings and <b>inks.</b> Modified acetophenone-formaldehyde <b>resins</b> {{are produced by}} the hydrogenation of the aforementioned ketone-containing resins. The resulting polyol can be further crosslinked with diisocyanates. These modified resins are again found in coatings, inks, as well as adhesives.|$|R
40|$|Adipocyte {{dysfunction}} may be {{a critical}} link between obesity and insulin resistance {{as a result of}} abnormal fat storage and mobilization. Adipocytes uniquely secrete adipokines and cytokines, such as leptin and TNFα, wich promote insulin sensitivity. Previously we reported insulin-signaling related altered gene expression in animals exposed to 2 -Aminoanthracene (2 AA). 2 AA is an aminosubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used in manufacturing dyes, chemicals, <b>inks,</b> <b>resins,</b> and polyurethanes. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the inflammation related effects of 2 AA exposure from gestation to postnatal period on dams that ingested 2 AA. To examine 2 AA effects, pregnant dams were assigned into dose regimens of 2 AA. Dams were fed 2 AA contaminated diet during the period of gestation and postpartum. The expression of key gene transcripts reported to be important in mediating inflammatory processes was examined via quantitative RT-PCR. Histologic examination of adipose tissue (AT) was also carried out to understand the anatomy of AT due to 2 AA exposure during gestation and two weeks postpartum. Examination of the adipose tissue for microscopic changes revealed no alterations between control and low-dose animals. However, AT of the high-dose animals was infiltrated by increased numbers of CD 68 +mononuclear cells (macrophages) and small numbers of eosinophils and mast cells, consistent with inflammation. In addition, analysis of the mRNA expression of cytokines and adipokines demonstrated the importance of inflammation in AT dysfunction. For instance, TNFα, LEPTIN and IL- 6 transcripts were relatively more expressed in the low dose animals than in the high dose and control rats. At the protein level, however, high amounts of cytokines were noted. The effects of 2 AA on pregnant dams appear to be more pronounced in the high dose group than in the low dose group, possibly indicating increased susceptibility of rat offspring within this group to elicit a diabetic-type response...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{notions of}} chance and chaos in arts practice, {{aligning}} the author’s artistic {{practice with the}} Deleuzian concept of rendering ‘unseen forces visible’. The visual artist, through studio process, can reveal unseen forces {{similar to those that}} exist in the biological world. This research references the fields of art and science, comparing the art studio to that of the science laboratory, where an artist approaches materials as an industrial chemist might, combining matter in disequilibrium. Forms representative of diatoms, pollen and radiolaria manifest in this process, appearing as encapsulated experiments. By capturing, suspending, or pausing these material interactions, one can visualise these structures. The paintings referenced here seek to unconceal through an active disequilibrium, where pigments separate, resin seals and tension reveals.

UV {{spectrophotometer}} {{was used}} to measure UV transmittance spectrum of pigment and photo-initiators to identify the light transmitting window of a pigment and photo-initiators’ absorption peak, then later the types of photo-initiators was determined. In order to determine the optimal assignment of monomers, dispersing agent, defoaming agent and dispersing resin, the uniform design method was supplied to achieve the smallest particle diameter within the range of D 95. After the excellent configuration of based ink, the orthogonal design method {{was used to}} determine the proportion of based <b>ink,</b> photo-initiators, film-forming <b>resin,</b> additives by regarding viscosity, surface tension, curing speed, and color fastness as indicators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{printing}} technology advances, environmentally friendly consumable printing materials have been explored. Water-based ink {{has become a}} new research hotspot due to its printability and environmental friendliness. Resin {{is an important part}} of water-based ink which functions as the carrier of the pigments. Its performance directly affects the printability of the ink. In order to obtain optimal <b>ink</b> formulation, different <b>resins</b> were applied and tested. This paper emphatically analyzes and discusses: (a) different resins and its performance in water-based covering ink; (b) cultivate an evaluation and rating system of resins applied. The water-based ink does not contain volatile organic compounds (VOC), which makes it to the benefit of environment protection and sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Palm oil is the world's {{second most}} {{important}} vegetable oil after soybean oil. Around 80 % of the production is destined for human consumption, for example as margarine, edible or industrial frying oil, and shortening used in the baking industry. The by-products are used for animal feed and as raw material for numerous industrial products including cosmetics, <b>inks,</b> and epoxy <b>resins.</b> This shows the economic importance of oil palm. A new manual in The Tropical Agriculturalist series describes important varieties of oil palm; all aspects of cultivation from seed selection to harvesting, including fertiliser, equipment, and labour requirements; the different processing methods; and uses of palm and palm kernel oils and their by-products.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our research}} is the biosynthesis of very long-chain fatty alcohols (VLCFAlcs) and wax esters (WEs) in S. cerevisiae. VLCFAlcs and WEs have a broad application range {{and can be used}} for many commercial purposes. The applications of WEs include personal care products, lubricants, varnishes, <b>inks,</b> detergents, <b>resins</b> & plastics. WEs can also be used for coatings (for fruits & pills) and as an oil phase in formulas containing active compounds to enhance the efficiency of topical drugs. VLCFAlcs, like docosanol, are used as an emollient, emulsifier and thickener in cosmetics as well as a nutritional supplement. Unfortunately, at present most of the possible applications are limited to cosmetic and medical products due to the high price for WE isolation from their natural host, the plant Simmondsia chinensis. Because of this fact, a renewable approach for low-cost production of VLCFAlcs and WEs in a well-studied organism like S. cerevisiae is desirable. The in vitro and in vivo synthesis of different WEs up to C 36 has already been shown in S. cerevisiae, but these WEs do not show the mentioned desired properties for commercial use. The in vivo synthesis of WE up to C 44 in S. cerevisiae has so far only been achieved after substrate feeding. In our approach we demonstrate that the heterologous expression of specific fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs), enzymes required for alcohol synthesis, and wax synthases (WSs), enzymes responsible for WE synthesis, allow the in vivo synthesis of VLCFAlcs up to C 22 and VLCWEs up to C 42...|$|R
