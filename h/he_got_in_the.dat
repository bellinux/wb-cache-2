25|$|Stengel {{kept his}} word and named Paige to the 1953 All-Star team despite Paige {{not having a}} very good year. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game in the eighth inning. First, Paige got Gil Hodges to line out, then after Roy Campanella singled up the middle, Eddie Mathews popped out. He then walked Duke Snider, and Enos Slaughter lined a hit to center to score Campanella. National League pitcher Murry Dickson drove in Snider, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Paige ended the year with a disappointing 3–9 record, but a respectable 3.53 ERA. Paige was {{released}} after the season when Veeck once again had to sell the team.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as he walked out of the arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E

500|$|Michigan fullback Bo Molenda {{was also}} {{credited}} with stopping Grange. [...] Grange played at {{quarterback for the}} first time in his career and was held to 56 net rushing yards on 25 carries. [...] The AP wrote of Molenda's efforts: [...] "Molenda was the principal reason why the Illini's aerial attack was unsuccessful. [...] Time after time <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way to make the pass incomplete or to gather it in his arms." [...] Molenda intercepted a pass thrown by Grange on the opening drive of the game and made a second interception of a pass thrown by Earl Britton later in the first quarter. [...] He had two more interceptions in the fourth quarter, both on passes thrown by Daugherty. Multiple sources indicate that Molenda intercepted a total of five passes in the game.|$|E

It includes commentaries from former Michigan coaches Steve Fisher, Brian Dutcher, and Perry Watson, and rap icons Ice Cube and Chuck D. It also extends to details such as: [...] "Howard discussing his grandmother's death the day he signed his letter of intent, to Ray Jackson talking about being 'the fifth wheel' and considering a transfer, to Jimmy King's brutal honesty about his disdain for Christian Laettner -- in somewhat unpalatable verbiage, to Rose talking about the loitering ticket <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Detroit 'crack house.'" [...] The film also presented numerous other highlights of the era {{as well as some}} from the high school days of the featured players. Webber was considered notable for his non-involvement in the production, {{while the rest of the}} Fab Five were credited as executive producers. Rose approached ESPN Films about the project and brought the other players into the fold. His production role came through his own company, Three Tier Entertainment. The film was directed by Jason Hehir and narrated by Taye Diggs.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} turned personal {{during the}} second of two debates between the two candidates when McConnell charged that the Iroquois Hunt Club, to which Beshear belonged, had no African-American members and was racially discriminatory. Beshear denied that the club was discriminatory and fired back that a prominent McConnell supporter from Louisville was [...] "virulently anti-women." [...] McConnell countered that Beshear had taken money from a labor union group that was under investigation for links to organized crime. After the debate, {{it was revealed that}} the Pendennis Club, of which McConnell had been a member, was under investigation for discriminatory membership practices; McConnell claimed he had resigned his membership in the club after perceiving that it practiced discrimination, but did not express his reasons for resigning to the club's membership or leadership. Ultimately, none of Beshear's arguments gained much traction, and he lost the race by a 724,794 votes (55.5%) to 560,012 (42.9%). At the time, it was the largest victory margin of McConnell's career. In a 2009 biography of McConnell, author John David Dyche wrote that Beshear [...] "had no illusions about his chance of success , but {{for the sake of his}} party, and hoping to ride the coattails of President Clinton's likely re-election, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race." [...] After the book's release, Beshear said through a spokesman that Dyche's assessment [...] "sounds accurate." ...|$|E
