5|$|In 1922, Holden {{designed}} the War Memorial Gateway for Clifton College, Bristol, {{using a combination}} of limestone and gritstone to match the Gothic style of the school's buildings. For the British War Memorials Committee, he produced a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Hall of Remembrance (1918) that {{would have been in the}} form of an art gallery, and for New College, Oxford, he created a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tiny memorial chapel (1919). Neither was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Sir Alexander Binnie, the {{resident}} engineer of the London County Council (LCC), submitted a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> steel bridge, which proved unpopular. At {{the request of}} the LCC, Binnie submitted a new <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bridge of five spans, to be built in concrete and faced with granite.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This {{was built in}} a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E

5|$|As part of WS-202A, a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{high-speed}} (Mach 3+) {{aerial target}} {{for use in}} testing the F-108's weapons system was proposed. The Wright Air Development Center requested the designation XQ-11 for the target design; the request was denied due to the early stage of development, and the F-108 program was cancelled before further work was undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Design and {{operation}} of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method or the Fenske equation {{can be used to}} assist in the <b>design.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> multi-component feed, computerized simulation models are used both for design and subsequently in operation of the column as well. Modeling is also used to optimize already erected columns for the distillation of mixtures other than those the distillation equipment was originally designed for.|$|E
5|$|Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower {{design or}} the Saarinen tower are terms used to {{describe}} the unnamed and unbuilt <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> modernist skyscraper, created by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen and submitted in 1922 for the Chicago Tribunes architectural competition for a new headquarters. The winning entry, the neo-Gothic Tribune Tower, was built in 1925. Saarinen's entry came in second place yet became influential in the design of a number of future buildings.|$|E

5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E

5|$|When the {{reactivation}} {{of the s}} {{was under}} consideration, a radical <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> battleship-carrier hybrid emerged that would have replaced the ship's rear turret with a flight deck, complete with a hangar and two ski jumps, for operating several Harriers. However, the USMC considered the need for naval gunfire support to be a greater priority than additional platforms for carrier operations, while the cost and delay associated with such elaborate conversions was significant, and the concept was dropped.|$|E

5|$|A {{public meeting}} in February 1919 {{established}} a consensus {{to create a}} monument and a fund {{for the families of}} wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. His <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bridge over the River Roch was abandoned after a local dignitary purchased a plot of land adjacent to Rochdale Town Hall and donated it for the site of the memorial. Lutyens revised his design and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I listed structure, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.|$|E
5|$|Images of {{the black}} swan played only a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so {{they were the same}} as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E
