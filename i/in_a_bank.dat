5|$|Scripps began {{trafficking}} in drugs, and carried heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered {{his name in}} 1987, {{when he was arrested}} at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For this and another drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on home leave but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another six years to the original sentence, which would have kept him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.|$|E

After that it was held in storage at Western Australia's state mortuary. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups. In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan's head would be reburied in November, and a Yagan Memorial Park created as a projected cost of A$996,000; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems. In March 2009, it was announced that the Department of Indigenous Affairs had given the City of Swan more than A$500,000 to develop the park.|$|E

40|$|A social constructionistic {{case study}} to {{determine}} <b>in</b> what way <b>a</b> diagnostic control system is being received in banking organizations. This paper explores how an organization receive a diagnostic control system from a social constructionistic perspective. More specifically the study focuses on the way a diagnostic control system is being received <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> organization. The results from the case study <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> organization suggests that using an individual diagnostic control system is not very effective because it’s also necessary to use other aspects of a management control system. For example, it’s possible that people don’t want to change. In that case, using a diagnostic control system will not be very effective. Finally, I conclude that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> organization are different social constructions with their own significance based on social interaction. This knowledge {{is important to understand}} how a diagnostic control system will be received <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organization. This conclusion matches with the results <b>in</b> <b>an</b> comparable empirical case study from Van Baarle (2009) in another sector (Royal Dutch Marechaussee) ...|$|R
5|$|Gandhi was cremated per the Hindu tradition. Gandhi's ashes were {{poured into}} urns which were sent across India for {{memorial}} services. Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed {{the contents of}} one urn, found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at {{the source of the}} Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The club held an {{architecture}} competition, and received six bids.

The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he {{wanted to build a}} larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added tax refund, NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK30 to 40 million <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E
5|$|Warlugulong {{was first}} {{exhibited}} at {{a show in}} Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in Melbourne then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> training centre cafeteria on the Mornington Peninsula. The bank sold it by auction in 1996. The auction house trading the work expected it to fetch around $5,000 and {{did not make a}} feature of it in the catalogue, but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by Sotheby's on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when Emily Kngwarreye's Earth's Creation was bought in May of the same year for just over $1million. Warlugulongs buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be possibly the most important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery.|$|E
