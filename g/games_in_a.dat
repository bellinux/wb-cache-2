The Superbas sold his rights to the Binghamton Bingoes of the New York State League, and he pitched for the team.

5|$|Carlsen won the Vugar Gashimov Memorial in Şəmkir, Azerbaijan, played from 20–30 April. He {{played in}} the A group along with Caruana, Nakamura, Karjakin, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Radjabov. Carlsen started the tournament with 2/2, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura. He then drew against Karjakin, only to lose two <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row {{for the first time}} in four years, losing to Caruana with black and then with white to Radjabov. In the second half of the tournament, Carlsen scored 4/5, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura again, and {{securing}} the tournament victory by beating Caruana in the final round, finishing with +5−2=3.|$|E
5|$|Chance {{began his}} career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger {{injuries}} suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs' first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games {{won in a}} season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, {{or in any other}} sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season.|$|E

5|$|Dodd also {{understood}} the deep-seated rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row over the Bulldogs from 1946–1954 outscoring the Bulldogs 176–39 during the winning streak. This 8–game winning streak against Georgia remains the longest winning streak by either {{team in the}} series. Dodd would finish his career with a 12–9 record against the Bulldogs.|$|E

Between 23 April 1984 and 2 September 1986 Everton scored {{consecutively}} in 47 games., registering 36 wins and 7 draws and scoring 123 goals in the process while conceding 38.

5|$|France were {{ejected from}} the Five Nations in 1932 after being accused of professionalism in the French leagues {{at a time when}} rugby union was {{strictly}} amateur. Forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning streak; winning ten <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row during the years from 1931 to 1936. France was invited to rejoin the Five Nations in 1939 but did not compete until 1947 as international rugby was suspended during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Friday's fine form {{continued}} into the 1975–76 season; after their 4–2 victory over Hartlepool United on 23 September 1975, Reading were top of the Fourth Division having just won four <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row. Friday, meanwhile, was the club's top scorer. The next game was against Bournemouth on the 27th, and although Reading won 2–1 Friday was sent off after 79 minutes. By this time the forward was overwhelmingly popular among Reading's fans, to whom he endeared himself by performing a lap of honour after each goal he scored. A month later, after two wins, two defeats and a draw during October, the team was fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|Hershey was {{eliminated}} from the playoffs by the Providence Bruins despite winning the first two <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> best-of-five series, marking only the tenth time this had occurred in league history.

The 2012–13 season drew a club-record home attendance average of 10,046, only the fifth time a club's average had surpassed 10,000 in recorded league history.|$|E

5|$|Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy, {{where he}} went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball. Vocational had an {{unheated}} gym and no locker rooms, which required that the team dress for <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> history classroom. Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald's All American honors. He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational's homecoming king. During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois' Lou Henson, DePaul's Joey Meyer and Michigan's Steve Fisher, Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Richardson set a {{new career}} high with his 203 rushing yards and tied Mark Ingram Jr. for the most 100-yard rushing <b>games</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season with nine.
