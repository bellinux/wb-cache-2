40|$|Bag stacks are a {{familiar}} feature of grain storage systems in developing countries. The conventional means of preserving grain in such bag stacks involves <b>fumigation</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> gas-tight sheet, with the gases methyl bromide or phosphine, and surface spraying with insecticides. However, if grain {{is to be}} stored for longer periods, then a new technique is available that offers considerable improvements in quality preservation. This is achieved by sealing bag stacks into air-tight plastic envelopes. Good quality preservation is ensured by introducing carbon dioxide or phosphine into the envelopes {{at the time of}} sealing. As long as the envelopes remain sealed {{there is no need to}} add further gas and quality preservation is superior to the conventional system using <b>fumigation</b> <b>under</b> gas-tight sheets. Grain can be stored in sealed stacks for periods of at least two years. As a training aid for pest control personnel their managers, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) has produced a 20 -minute video on sealed stack storage. In addition, a poster has been prepared as an aide-memoire. The focus for these training materials is large-stack storage systems, where stocks of grain run into many hundreds of tonnes. Special attention is given to important management considerations for the planning and maintenance of sealed stack programmes and their cost-effectiveness compared with conventional techniques. Copies of the video and poster are available from NRI free-of charge to countries who are recipients of British aid; otherwise a charge of £ 20 is made for the video. R. J.
