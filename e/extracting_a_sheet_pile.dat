40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made {{of steel}} <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls for soil and/or water retaining constructions. High demands are made {{with respect to the}} deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall composed of so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of that, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called oblique bending, and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. Oblique bending goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall relative to the soil body. Oblique bending might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces oblique bending. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model {{is made of}} <b>a</b> cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with <b>a</b> dry excavation in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{stochastic}} analysis of the stability of <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> soil structure. Most areas in the Netherlands have layered soil conditions. The decisive parameter in the nonlinear FE analysis is the behaviour of the soil. For layered soil conditions, the correct modelling of the non-linear behaviour of the soil is decisive for the result. Laboratory or in situ tests on the soil give a wide distribution of the material parameters. As a result, a deterministic input for soil material behaviour in an FE analysis is not straightforward. The normal solution is to use partial safety factors. A stochastic analysis is however more in place to analyse soil structures. Recently plane strain 2 D FE models are becoming common practice to describe the behaviour of the soil, especially for layered soil conditions. The behaviour of the soil is described with a Mohr-Coulomb model; {{the interaction of the}} soil with the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> is modelled with interface elements which behaviour is described with the Coulomb friction model. The full paper describes the FE analysis of the excavation of soil during construction, inclusive the installation of <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and <b>an</b> anchor.

The analysis is carried out using a 2 D plane-strain-model and a full- 3 D model. A stochastic module is added to a common FE code [1] in order to analyse stochastic structural behaviour. Consequently the excavation is analysed including the stochastic behaviour of the soil. The stochastic analysis results in a probability of failure and in safety factors.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of <b>a</b> century steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section {{which can lead to}} a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to <b>a</b> continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in <b>a</b> steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with <b>a</b> fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with <b>a</b> capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of <b>a</b> cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
