There {{may have been some}} delay due to difficulty in obtaining the bricks. In addition to the commemorative function, the tower was also intended to serve as an eye-catching focus for those touring the parkland of the Stourhead Estate.

500|$|Writing in the Saturday Review of Literature, Oswald Garrison Villard criticized America's 60 Families, {{describing}} it as [...] "bitter muckracking", lamenting that it merely revisited old themes, and ultimately dismissing {{it with the}} caution that as [...] "a guidebook to American folly and scandal it has a place. How I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not find its way to Hitler and Mussolini! It would be held by them to be proof positive that our democracy is beyond hope". Several years later, Nazi politician Robert Ley, head of the German Labor Front, published a pamphlet in Germany titled Roosevelt Betrays America! in which he cited Lundberg's book as proof that [...] "nowhere are as many scoundrels running around loose as in the United States".|$|E

Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he is not coming back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be after his medical and that is the end of it."

500|$|On December 2, 2010, Hayes {{apologized for}} the pain and {{suffering}} he had caused the Petit family and added that: [...] "Death for me will be a welcome relief and I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> bring some peace and comfort to those who I have hurt so much." [...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E
500|$|The British used {{smallpox}} as {{a biological}} warfare agent at the Siege of Fort Pitt during the French and Indian Wars (1754–1763) against France and its Native American allies. The actual use of smallpox had official sanction. British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted {{the use of}} smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by historians, [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy", and [...] "it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox". [...] On June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, [...] "Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> have the desired effect." [...] The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown. There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the series' end in August 2010, The Bill was the United Kingdom's longest-running police drama and was among the longest-running of any British {{television}} series. The series finale, entitled [...] "Respect", was aired in two parts and was dedicated to [...] "the {{men and women of the}} Metropolitan Police Service past and present". The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith after being stabbed. Jasmine is then gang raped because she talked to the police and when Callum Stone found the person responsible he was held at gunpoint. Of the title for the finale, Executive Producer Johnathan Young said [...] "It's called [...] "Respect" [...] and we <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> respect the heritage of the show". [...] The finale episodes featured all the cast and the final scene was specially written so all cast members would be featured. Following the final episode, ITV aired a documentary entitled Farewell The Bill which featured interviews from past and present cast and crew members. The finale was watched by 4.4million viewers, with Farewell The Bill averaging 1.661million viewers.|$|E

500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers {{did not want to}} build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E
500|$|On 12 June 2012 {{at a press}} conference, Boyle {{had promised}} a huge set of rural Britain, which was to include a village cricket team, farm animals, a model of Glastonbury Tor, {{as well as a}} maypole and a rain-producing cloud. His {{intention}} was to represent the rural and urban landscape of Britain. The design was to include a mosh pit {{at each end of the}} set, one with people celebrating a rock festival and the other the Last Night of the Proms. Boyle promised a ceremony with which everyone would feel involved; he said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us". Some of the set was designed with real grass turf and soil. The use of animals (40 sheep, 12 horses, 3 cows, 2 goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, 9 geese and 3 sheep dogs, looked after by 34 animal handlers) drew some criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Boyle, who was being advised by the RSPCA, assured PETA that the animals would be well cared for. After the press conference, much commentary in the UK Press was negative and attracted [...] "hundreds of comments online completely supporting...the view that the opening ceremony would be a disaster." ...|$|E
