5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired {{her for the first}} time with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E

50|$|The {{birthrate}} {{for adolescents}} (aged 15-19) in Ghana is 60 per 1000 women. The rates between {{rural and urban}} areas of the country, however, vary greatly (89 and 33 per 1000 women, respectively). For urban women, 2.3% of women <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> before age 15 and 16.7% of women <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> before age 18. For rural women, 4% <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> before age 15 and 25% <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> before age 18. Throughout time there has been organizations that have helped with such issues, such as the United Nations, and the Accelerated Child Survival Development Programme, both fought against abortions, and reduced about 50 percent {{of the child and}} maternal mortality rates.|$|R

The album was mixed by Kasper at Studio X.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once the idea of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E

40|$|It seems {{natural to}} choose whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> by {{reflecting}} {{on what it}} would be like to actually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> I argue that this natural approach fails. If you choose to become a parent, and your choice is based on projections about what you think it would be like for you to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. If you choose to remain childless, and your choice is based upon projections about what you think it would be like for you to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. This suggests we should reject our ordinary conception of how to make this life-changing decision, and raises general questions about how to rationally approach important life choices...|$|R
