Review of local commissions - understanding strategic support <b>for</b> <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Life, and recommending monitoring and evaluation systems. 3.

5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred <b>foods.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundFood insecurity, {{uncertainty}} about the ability to acquire adequate food, is associated with cardiometabolic disease in pregnant women. Whether food insecurity interventions improve cardiometabolic health is unknown. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of women who visited the obstetrics clinic in a community health center from 2013 through 2015. Patients could be referred to the <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families (<b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families) program, which connects food insecure women to food resources. We hypothesized that participation in <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families {{would be associated with}} better blood pressure and blood glucose trends during pregnancy. We used a propensity score 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cmatched design to reduce bias from differential entry into <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families. ResultsEleven percent of women who visited the obstetrics clinic were referred to <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families. In propensity score 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cmatched analyses, we found no difference in baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between those who were referred and enrolled in <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families (113. 5 mm Hg), those who were referred and did not enroll in <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families (113. 9 mm Hg), and those who were not referred to <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families (114 mm Hg) (P =. 79). However, during pregnancy, women who were referred to and enrolled in <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families had a better SBP trend (0. 2015 mm Hg/wk lower, P =. 006). SBP trends did not differ between women who were referred and did not enroll in <b>Food</b> <b>for</b> Families and those who were not referred. We observed no differences in blood glucose trends between groups (P =. 40). ConclusionsFood for Families participation was associated with better blood pressure trends in pregnant women but no differences in blood glucose trends. Food insecurity reduction programs may improve cardiovascular health for vulnerable pregnant women, and this topic deserves further study incorporating randomized program entry. 27809418 PMC 509485...|$|R
