500|$|Knowing {{that they}} could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead {{designed}} to imitate the look of stop motion. Cory Edwards cited Rankin-Bass as an inspiration and explained, [...] "If we approach our look like that – photographed miniatures in stop-motion – and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every <b>freckle</b> and hair on photoreal creatures." [...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E
50|$|The central {{character}} of Stratton-Porter's previous novel, <b>Freckles,</b> {{is a man}} {{whose job it is}} to patrol and guard valuable timber trees in the Limberlost Swamp. <b>Freckles</b> appears in Girl of the Limberlost as a friend of Elnora.

40|$|<b>Freckles</b> are {{numerous}} pigmented macules {{on the face}} commonly occurring in the Caucasian and Chinese population. As <b>freckling</b> is {{considered as an independent}} trait, no gene or locus for it has been identified to date. Here we performed genome-wide scan for linkage analysis in a multigeneration Chinese family with <b>freckles.</b> A maximum LOD score of 4. 26 at a recombination fraction of 0 has been obtained with marker D 4 S 1566. Haplotype analysis localized the <b>freckles</b> locus to a 16 Mbp region flanked by D 4 S 2952 and D 4 S 1607. We have thus mapped the gene for <b>freckles</b> to chromosome 4 q 32 –q 34. This will aid future identification of the responsible gene, which will be very useful for the understanding of the molecular mechanism of <b>freckles...</b>|$|R

When we talked of writing this story Jill said I wasn't to say that Aunt Tommy had <b>freckles</b> because it wouldn't sound romantic. But I don't care. She has <b>freckles</b> and I think they are all right.|$|R
500|$|The generic and English name thrips is {{a direct}} {{transliteration}} of the ancient Greek θρίψ, thrips, meaning [...] "woodworm". Like some other animal names such as sheep, deer, and moose, the word thrips is both the singular and plural forms, so there may be many thrips or a single thrips. Other common names for thrips include thunderflies, thunderbugs, storm flies, thunderblights, storm bugs, corn fleas, corn flies, corn lice, <b>freckle</b> bugs, harvest bugs, and physopods. The older group name [...] "physopoda" [...] is {{with reference to the}} bladder like tips to the tarsi of the legs. The name of the order Thysanoptera is constructed from the ancient Greek words θύσανος, thysanos, [...] "tassel or fringe", and πτερόν, pteron, [...] "wing", for the insects' fringed wings.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} showed the couple meeting at a funeral, marrying, {{and going through}} the honeymoon phase. The last section of the episode {{features}} a confrontation between Becky and Mark, in which the former admits that she is an adulteress before realising that all of her friends were hiding around her living room {{in preparation for a}} surprise party for her. The story continues directly into episode two, when Robert and Tracy return to the flat to check on Mark after his wife's departure. The three recall the circumstances in which they had first met. After their first date, the couple go back to Becky's flat. While she is in the bathroom, he strips down to his boxer shorts and handcuffs himself to the bedpost. Unable to free himself, Robert and Tracy walk in on him. Moffat used a similar scenario for the Coupling episode [...] "The <b>Freckle,</b> the Key, and the Couple who Weren't" [...] and reveals in its audio commentary that it is based on a situation with one of his ex-girlfriends.|$|E
500|$|After portraying {{a series}} of intense roles, Chastain {{actively}} looked for a light-hearted part. She {{found it in the}} fantasy film [...] (2016), co-starring Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt. The film served as both a sequel and a prequel to the 2012 film Snow White and the Huntsman. She was drawn to the idea of playing a female warrior whose abilities were on par with those of the lead male character, but the film generated negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Also that year, Chastain launched a production company named <b>Freckle</b> Films, headed by a team of female executives. She then starred as the title character, a lobbyist, in the gun control thriller Miss Sloane, which reunited her with John Madden. Chastain read the novel Capitol Punishment by Jack Abramoff to research the practice of lobbying in America, and met with female lobbyists to study their mannerisms and sense of style. Hailing her {{as one of the best}} actresses on the planet, Peter Travers commended Chastain for successfully drawing the audience into Sloane's life. She received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.|$|E

50|$|Lentigines are {{distinguished}} from <b>freckles</b> (ephelis) {{based on the}} proliferation of melanocytes. <b>Freckles</b> have a relatively normal number of melanocytes but an increased amount of melanin. A lentigo has an increased number of melanocytes. <b>Freckles</b> will increase in number and darkness with sunlight exposure, whereas lentigines will stay stable in their color regardless of sunlight exposure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freckles,</b> {{sometimes}} called ephelides (singular ephelis), are clusters of concentrated melaninized cells which are most easily visible on {{people with a}} fair complexion. <b>Freckles</b> {{do not have an}} increased number of the melanin-producing cells, or melanocytes, but instead have melanocytes that overproduce melanin granules (melanosomes) changing the coloration of the outer skin cells (keratinocytes). As such, <b>freckles</b> are different from lentigines and moles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{presence}} of <b>freckles</b> {{is related to}} rare alleles of the MC1R gene, though it does not differentiate whether an individual will have <b>freckles</b> if they have one or even two copies of this gene. Also, individuals with no copies of the MC1R do sometimes display <b>freckles.</b> Even so, individuals with {{a high number of}} <b>freckling</b> sites have one or more of variants of the MC1R gene. Of the variants of the MC1R gene Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, and Asp294His are the most common in the <b>freckled</b> subjects. [...] The MC1R gene is also associated with red hair more strongly than with <b>freckles.</b> Most red-haired individuals have two variants of the MC1R gene and almost all have one. [...] The variants that cause red hair are the same that cause <b>freckling.</b> [...] <b>Freckling</b> can also be found in areas, such as Japan, where red hair is not seen. These individuals have the variant Val92Met which is also found in Caucasians, although it has minimal effects on their pigmentation. The R162Q allele has a disputed involvement in <b>freckling.</b> The variants of the MC1R gene that are linked with <b>freckles</b> started to emerge in the human genotype when humans started to leave Africa. The variant Val92Met arose somewhere between 250,000 - 100,000 years ago, long enough for this gene to be carried by humans into central Asia. Arg160Trp is estimated to have arisen around 80,000 years ago while Arg151Cys and Asp294His have been estimated to arise around 30,000 years ago. The wide variation of the MC1R gene exists in people of European descent {{because of the lack of}} strong environmental pressures on the gene. [...] The original allele of MC1R coded for dark skin with a high melanin content in the cells. The high melanin content is protective in areas of high UV light exposure. [...] The need was less as humans moved into higher latitudes where incoming sunlight has lower UV light content. The adaptation of lighter skin is needed so that individuals in higher latitudes can still absorb enough UV for the production of vitamin D. [...] <b>Freckled</b> individuals tend to tan less and have very light skin, which would have helped the individuals that expressed these genes absorb vitamin D.|$|R
50|$|While {{there has}} been little {{research}} into the bathing behaviour of the <b>freckled</b> duck, it is known that a body of water (e.g. a swamp or dam) is essential for many natural behaviours such as feeding, mating and bathing. <b>Freckled</b> ducks have been observes preening both within water and after emerging from water while in a roosting position.
