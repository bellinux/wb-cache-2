50|$|Brenna Bry {{and colleagues}} (1982) {{addressed}} {{the question of}} what causes drug use in adolescents. Previous research had made use of multiple regression; with this method, it is natural to look for the best predictor, the one with the highest beta weight. Bry and colleagues noted that one previous study <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> early use of alcohol was the best predictor. Another study <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> alienation from parents was the best predictor. Still another study <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> low grades in school were the best predictor. The failure to replicate was clearly a problem, a problem that could be caused by bouncing betas.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some researchers <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 {{that they could not}} replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{that have}} focused on {{inheritance}} patterns rather than on specific genes <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight. Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers {{are two of}} Antarctica's five largest ice streams. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{the flow}} of these ice streams has {{accelerated}} in recent years, and suggested {{that if they were}} to melt, global sea levels would rise by , destabilising the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet and perhaps sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.|$|E
5|$|After Whitley's initial description, C. tilstoni was {{generally}} regarded as synonymous with C. limbatus, the common blacktip shark. In the 1980s, additional morphological and life history data again favored the recognition of C. tilstoni as a separate species, which was eventually confirmed by allozyme studies performed by Shane Lavery and James Shaklee. Several molecular phylogenetic studies based on allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the Australian and common blacktip sharks form a closely related clade with the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the smoothtooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon). The interrelationships between them have not been fully resolved, but available data suggest that C. tilstoni and C. limbatus are not the most closely related species within the clade despite their similarity.|$|E

5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of {{the energy}} in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} I <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person {{the nature of his}} tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
