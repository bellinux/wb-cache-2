50|$|From {{the early}} 1850s, {{most of the}} area around the Eumundi {{district}} was part of three cattle runs: Canando, Yandina and North Kenilworth. In 1867, after the discovery of gold at Gympie, the first road was marked and cleared. By 1879, George Gridley became the <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> to reside permanently in the Eumundi district. This started a wave of new selectors and by 1885, 47 selections were taken up. Some of the pioneers settlers included Fullager, Cowell, Burrel, Ball and Arrundell.|$|E

50|$|Closer {{settlement}} of Deception Bay commenced {{with the opening}} of the Redcliffe Agricultural Reserve for selection in March 1861. Prior to this, the area had formed part of pastoral runs. Selection of allotments at Deception Bay was slow. Access to the area was difficult because the roads were very poor and the bay was too shallow for navigation by large vessels. Moreover, much of the land was sandy and unsuitable for agriculture. Many of the <b>first</b> <b>selectors</b> soon abandoned their land. Joseph Bancroft was one of the early landholders who retained ownership and gradually expanded his holdings at Deception Bay.|$|R
50|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>selectors</b> in the {{district}} was William Cross of Ipswich, who took up Portion 106V in February 1897. In 1898 some of {{his family moved to}} the new property, which they named Crossdale. Son Tom was 15 at the time. When his older brother Ben came to live on the family property in 1906, Tom decided to relocate to Ipswich to pursue his artistic interests, taking a job in a photographic studio and producing artworks in his spare time. He later moved to Sydney to study art, while continuing to work in photography.|$|R

50|$|The {{area around}} Carbrook was {{originally}} called the Logan District after Captain Patrick Logan {{who discovered the}} Logan River in 1826. The area was logged by timber getters before selectors began arriving in the 1860s. The <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> in the area was Herman Meissner who took up his selection in April 1868. The mainly German immigrants who settled in the Carbrook area named the settlement Gramzow after the town Gramzow in Germany, and followed agricultural pursuits including the growing and milling of sugar cane and arrowroot. Later, the area supported dairying which gave way to bananas {{and a variety of}} small crops.|$|E
5000|$|Later Strowger (SXS) exchanges {{often use}} a {{subscriber}} uniselector {{as part of}} the line equipment individual to each line, which searches [...] "forward" [...] for a <b>first</b> <b>selector.</b> This is more economical for higher calling-rate domestic or business customers, and has the advantage that access to additional switches can readily be added if the traffic increases (the number of linefinders serving a group is limited by the wiring multiple installed). Hence exchanges with subscriber uniselectors were usually used at British exchanges with a high proportion of business customers, e.g. director exchanges, or in New Zealand where the provision of local free calling meant that residential customers had a relatively high calling rate.|$|E
50|$|When the Maryborough Agricultural Reserve {{was thrown}} open for {{selection}} in March 1862, {{one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>selectors</b> was W C Giles, acting as agent for Robert Tooth of Widgee Widgee Station, who bought Lots 3 & 4 fronting the Mary River immediately below Graham's Creek. Tooth sold Widgee Widgee to JC White, who was his manager at Jondaryan. White set up a steam-powered abattoir and boiling-down works on the Yengarie land in 1863 but was financially ruined when pleuropneumonia killed most of his cattle the following year. Tooth foreclosed on both the station and land. Robert Cran then took on the mortgage of Widgee Widgee and Giles leased the Yengarie land for agistment, though he also became insolvent in 1865.|$|R

[...] Squatters soon followed and the town site {{was part of the}} [...] "Lexington Run". In 1866, the Frenchman Peter DeMay was the <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> in the area, developing an orchard and small vineyard. The fruit industry developed from the 1890s, reaching a peak around 1913. From 1920, tobacco growing started in the area. The Black Friday bushfires of 1939 destroyed many of the orchards and tobacco properties. [...] Today, while there is one remaining commercial orchard, Pomonal is mainly a grazing district.|$|E
50|$|Cattlemen and timbergetters came to {{the area}} from the 1860s, but land was not made {{available}} for agricultural selection until the 1880s. The <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> was James Steele in 1887. In 1891, {{the section of the}} North Coast railway line from Landsborough to Yandina was opened. It brought closer settlement to the whole district, and facilitated the transport of passengers, timber, fruit and produce. Eudlo Post Office opened on 1 March 1891. A sawmill was built at Eudlo and large quantities of timber from the Blackall Range, and surrounding forests, were either treated at the mill or railed to other centres. The timber industry was the means of livelihood for the early settlers. Eudlo State School was opened in on 6 September 1897.|$|E

Thomas, James and John were interested in procuring cedar and in 1881 their youngest brother William located a vast stand at a place he named Cedar Creek, now Ravenshoe. The Mazlin brothers were also heavily involved in mining. William Mazlin married Isabella Pasley and in March 1883 became the <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> on the Evelyn Tableland, not far from Herberton. His house, Orange Grove, still stands, and Ernest William was the eldest of eleven children born at Evelyn. Ernest was born on 9 September 1884, and known as Will, was educated at Evelyn and Herberton State Schools and later gained a Diploma in Engineering as an external student of the University of Queensland. He became a builder, cabinet maker and contractor, but was best known as the proprietor of a large sawmill in Ravenshoe. He also played a prominent role in the civic affairs of Ravenshoe and the surrounding district. Ernest married Ann White in 1912, and they had no children.|$|E
50|$|Following {{investigation}} of the timber resources of the Mooloolah - Maroochy region by Tom Petrie , timber-getters commenced work in the area. James Low and William Grigor are recorded as having moved to the Mooloolah area in 1863 where, in partnership with William Pettigrew, they sent timber from the Mooloolah area to Pettigrew's sawmill in Brisbane. In 1867 James and his family moved north to a site on the Maroochy River opposite Dunethin Rock, where he established a depot located on the then route to the Gympie gold diggings; gold having been discovered at Gympie in 1867. James is recorded {{as one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>selectors</b> of land in the district under the Crown Lands Act of 1868. A post office, with James as Post Master, opened in July 1868 and took its name from the Yandina run on which it was situated.|$|R
50|$|Local call {{metering}} {{must be done}} at the originating exchange, {{and when}} local calls were charged by distance it was preferable for the <b>first</b> code <b>selector</b> levels to determine the number of unit fees required.

5000|$|When New South Wales {{passed the}} Agricultural Reserves Act 1861 {{and a new}} wave of {{settlers}} moved into the area, Fernie Lawn was divided into smaller selections, with land for sale at £1 per acre and cultivation and fencing to be carried out by the purchaser. These <b>first</b> <b>selectors</b> were predominantly Scots and English, followed {{by the end of the}} 1860s by increasing numbers of German settlers. [...] Descendants of many of these early settlers remain in the area today. Farmers engaged in mixed cropping and dairying, and cotton was widely grown in the area in response to the world shortage caused by the American Civil War. Cotton ginneries were established by Carl Sahl at Fernie Lawn and by Cribb & Foote at Stinking Gully. [...] Fernvale at the time consisted of two areas - Harrisborough, named after Harris Brothers cotton stores, and Stinking Gully named after the water course which separated the two areas. The name Stinking Gully was officially changed to Ferny Gully in 1930.|$|R
5000|$|The Blue Sisters involve {{themselves}} with causes and justice. For this reason, {{they are considered}} the most [...] "worldly" [...] Aes Sedai and are the most successful at interacting with common folk outside of the White Tower. At times, the causes they support seem to conflict with the established order or traditions of the Aes Sedai which often earn them reproach from the other Ajahs, notably the Red. Similarly, many Blue Sisters find {{a number of the}} rules and traditions of the Aes Sedai constraining and will spend extended periods of time outside the White Tower on various missions. Through their efforts, individual Blues often find contacts, friends, and allies among the peoples of the world and across all walks of life. Although the Blue Ajah is the second smallest, it has the most extensive eyes-and-ears network. Furthermore, despite its size, a disproportionately high number of Amyrlins have been raised from the Blue as compared to the other Ajahs. The head of the Blue Ajah is called the <b>First</b> <b>Selector.</b> Moiraine Damodred, a Blue Sister, is the first Aes Sedai character introduced in the series.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{methods for}} exploiting nondeterminism inherent within the Tile Assembly Model {{in order to}} generate uniform random numbers. Namely, given an integer range { 0, [...] ., n − 1 }, we exhibit methods for randomly selecting a number within that range. We present three constructions exhibiting a trade-off between space requirements and closeness to uniformity. The <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> selects a random number with probability Θ (1 n) using O(log 2 n) tiles. The second selector takes a user-specified parameter that guarantees the probabilities are arbitrarily close to uniform, {{at the cost of}} additional space. The third selector selects a random number with probability exactly 1 n, and uses no more space than the <b>first</b> <b>selector</b> with high probability, but uses potentially unbounded space...|$|E

50|$|The <b>first</b> code <b>selectors</b> had {{levels for}} local {{exchange}} calls and {{calls to the}} local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} <b>first</b> code <b>selectors</b> and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{area had}} been long {{recognized}} for its fertile soil, but had been locked up in pastoral leases prior to the 1868 Crown Lands Act, which opened the land to closer settlement. The <b>first</b> <b>selectors</b> {{had arrived in the}} Boonah region in the 1870s and by the late 1880s Maroon had emerged as an agricultural community. Cook moved his wife, Elizabeth, and their three children from Brisbane to Maroon in June 1888. According to family descendants Cook built a slab hut close to the present location of the stone ruins to house the family while the stone and slab cottage was under construction, which also was commenced in 1888.Named Cotswold Cottage after Cook's home district in England, the walls of the residence were constructed from iron bark slabs and stone obtained from the property. To bind the stones, he used a mortar mix of clay and cow manure. Three open fireplaces were built into the stone walls. The cottage was constructed {{over a number of years}} beginning with the southern end of the house, now completely destroyed. A Bailiff of Crown Lands report dated 20 October 1893 notes that the house comprised four rooms. Further additions were built after this date, including a semi-detached living room.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a neural network-based decision table algorithm. We {{focus on the}} implementation details of the decision table algorithm when it is constructed using the neural network. Decision tables are simple supervised classifiers which, Kohavi demonstrated, can outperform state-of-the-art classifiers such as C 4. 5. We couple this power with the efficiency and flexibility of a binary associative-memory neural network. Initially, we demonstrate how the binary associative-memory neural network can form the decision table index to map between attribute values and data records and subsequently we show how two attribute selection algorithms {{can be used to}} pre-select attributes for this decision table. The attribute selection algorithms are easily implemented within the same binary associative-memory framework producing a tightly coupled, two-tier system allowing attribute selection and decision table indexing. The <b>first</b> attribute <b>selector</b> uses mutual information between attributes and classes to select the attributes that classify best. The second attribute selector uses a probabilistic approach to evaluate randomly selected attribute subsets. ...|$|R
