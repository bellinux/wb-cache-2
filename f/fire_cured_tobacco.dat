Between 1980 and 2000, there is a general increase in tobacco output, followed by a sharp decline from 2001 up to 2008 and then output starts to increase again. Flue <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> output as measured by the quantity that is delivered to the auction floors is used to estimate supply elasticity. The objective is to determine if flue-cured tobacco supply is price elastic and whether price incentives alone will boost supply in the short -run. Time series data on flue <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> output, prices, production costs, prices of major competing crops, the exchange rates and inflation are analysed to model the price elasticity of flue <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> between 1980 and 2010. The Augmented Dickey –Fuller unit root test is performed to test the variables for stationarity. The data generating processes show these data series to be non-stationary and therefore OLS estimations would be biased. The data series are differenced and the Engel-Granger procedure is performed to test for cointegration.

40|$|What are Molds? Molds are fungi (plural of the Latin word fungus), {{and are a}} large {{class of}} living organisms, one of the “kingdoms ” into which {{biologists}} categorize life. They are not plants, animals, or bacteria[1]. Molds are found nearly everywhere, even in tobacco stripping rooms, and their spores are in the air or carried by airborne dusts. Weather conditions this year have been favorable {{to the growth of}} blue mold on tobacco. This has raised a concern about inhaling mold during the stripping process, but blue mold itself requires living tissue for sporulation (giving off spores) and would not be active on <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Conditions have also been favorable for other molds, however, and the molds we’ll see most commonly on <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> would be species of Penicillium and Aspergillus, as well as some Mucor and Rhizopus. Some mold is likely present on <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> every year, however this year the weather conditions during curing have been particularly favorable for molds. When the <b>cured</b> <b>tobacco</b> is taken down and stripped, the shaking and movement of the leaves can release large amounts of dust and mold spores.

40|$|Energy {{production}} from biomass can reduce „greenhouse effect” {{and contribute to}} solving energy security especially in the agricultural households which rely on energy from fossil fuels. In Croatia fuel-cured tobacco is produced on about 5000 ha. Gross income for the whole production is about 180 000 000 kn/year. Flue-cured tobacco is a high energy consuming crop. There are two parts of energy consumption, for mechanization used for the field production (11 %) and, energy for bulk-curing (89 %). In each case, presently used fuels of fossil origin need to be substituted by an alternative energy source of organic origin. Hereafter {{attention is paid to}} finding a more economic and ecologically acceptable fuel for <b>curing</b> <b>tobacco.</b> <b>Curing</b> flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> is done by heated air in curing burns. Various sources of heat have been used; wood, coal, oil and gas. In each case different burning facilities of different efficiency have been used. This has had an impact on curing costs and ecology. Recently, mostly used fuel has been natural gas. However, gas is getting expensive. Consequently, an alternative fuel for <b>curing</b> <b>tobacco</b> is sought for. According to literature, agricultural crops suitable for the latter purpose could be wheat, barley, maize, sorghum, sugar beet and some other annual and perennial plant species. Wooden pellets (by-products) are suitable for combustion too. Ligno-cellulose fuels have been used for heating since long time. However, not sufficient research has been done from an applied point of view (Venturi and Venturi, 2003). Fuel combustion is getting more efficient with developing technological innovations. The curing barn manufacturers are offering technology for combusting wooden pellets (by-products) for <b>curing</b> <b>tobacco.</b> The pellets are available on domestic market. The same technology can be used for combustion of maize grain. Within “Hrvatski duhani” research on suitability of using wooden pellets and maize grain and whole plants for <b>curing</b> <b>tobacco</b> has been undertaken.

Moreover, some of these metals could appear in the tobacco cigarette smoke. This fact may cause negative consequences for cigarette consumers. Examinations were carried out in five various production areas, for each tobacco type, during two years, 1998 and 1999; those were extreme years for production. Considering the results, it can be concluded: The most important factor for heavy metal content in tobacco leaves are weather conditions especially the amount of rainfall, since there is a direct correlation between the rainfall and size of roots, a dominant vegetation organ. It is inevitable that the metals content in flue cured and air <b>cured</b> <b>tobaccos</b> grown at different experimental lots, is still below the legally prescribed values. Tobacco leaves from Šabac production area have a little higher metal content than tobacco grown in other production areas, because a larger amount of copper was found. The metal content in plants can increase because of its absorption from soil, atmosphere, or mineral fertilizers and pesticides, and, what is very important, the content of metals can be high due to the vicinity of large industrial centers...|$|R
