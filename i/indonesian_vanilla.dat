50|$|The {{market price}} of vanilla rose {{dramatically}} in the late 1970s after a tropical cyclone ravaged key croplands. Prices remained high through the early 1980s despite the introduction of <b>Indonesian</b> <b>vanilla.</b> In the mid-1980s, the cartel that had controlled vanilla prices and distribution since its creation in 1930 disbanded. Prices dropped 70% {{over the next few}} years, to nearly US$20 per kilogram; prices rose sharply again after tropical cyclone Hudah struck Madagascar in April 2000. The cyclone, political instability, and poor weather in the third year drove vanilla prices to an astonishing US$500/kg in 2004, bringing new countries into the vanilla industry. A good crop, coupled with decreased demand caused by the production of imitation vanilla, pushed the market price down to the $40/kg range in the middle of 2005. By 2010, prices were down to $20/kg.|$|E
40|$|The {{curing process}} of vanilla beans from dried vanilla to vanilla extract would give added value to vanilla products. Aroma and taste in vanilla extract depend on variety of plants, {{cultivation}} methods, and curing process. <b>Indonesian</b> <b>vanilla</b> extract tend to give woody and phenolic aroma {{because it was}} harvested too early {{and it did not}} cure perfectly. This study was to identify the physicochemical and aroma characteristics of vanilla extracts from importer, exporter, and vanilla extracts from the newest experiment from our laboratory. There were seven samples, three from importers (Tahiti grade I, Tahiti grade II, Virginia Dare), two from <b>Indonesian</b> <b>Vanilla</b> exporters (Djasula Wangi, Cobra), and two from our laboratory (G 11, 57). The physicochemical characteristics which were analyzed were vanillin content, ash, soluble ash, alkalinity of soluble ash, alkalinity of total ash, total acidity, and lead number, all compared with the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) standard. Sensory analysis used aroma description test consist of qualitative descriptive test (in-depth interview and focus group methods) and quantitative descriptive analysis. The result showed that the laboratory's sample from modified curing process (G 11) followed the FDA standard in physicochemical characters, but the aroma description was not as strong as the aroma of vanilla extract from exporters, namely Cobra with creamy, sweet, and vanilla aroma; and vanilla extract from importer, namely Virginia with smoky and spicy arom...|$|E
40|$|Vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Andrews) {{is one of}} the {{important}} exported commodities in Indonesia. Indonesia is one of top five major vanilla exporters in the world, that produce the high quality of <b>Indonesian</b> <b>vanilla</b> with high vanillin content (2. 75 %). The aims of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} dose binukleat Rhizoctonia (BNR) and phosphorus as well as the interaction of the nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and chlorophyll of the vanilla seedling (Vanilla planifolia Andrew). Method in this research used completely randomized factorial design, by involving two factors (dose of BNR inoculation and Phosphor). The first factor is without inoculation and inoculation BNR (M 0, M 1, M 2, M 3) wich consists of (0, 5, 10, 15) g/polybag, the second factor is the dose of phosphorus fertilizer (P 0, P 1, P 2, P 3) which consists of (0, 3, 6, 9) g/polibag. The results showed that the inoculation dose of BNR and doses of phosphorus not significant and lower levels of NRA and chlorophyll while the interaction dose of BNR and phosphorus significantly and increase levels of NRA and chlorophyll of vanilla seedling. Nitrate Reductase Activity and chlorophyll has important role in metabolism process as a plant growth indicator. How to Cite Haryuni, H., & Dewi, T. S. K. (2016).

50|$|Vanilla extract is {{the most}} common form of vanilla used today. Mexican, Tahitian, <b>Indonesian</b> and Bourbon <b>vanilla</b> are the main varieties. Bourbon vanilla is named for the period when the island of RÃ©union was ruled by the Bourbon kings of France; it does not contain Bourbon whiskey.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Indonesian</b> natural <b>vanilla</b> is {{know for}} having a unigue woody, smooky, and {{phenolic}} flavor. Development of the aroma and flavor vanilla was formed {{by the action of}} a hydrolytic enzyme B-glucosidase on glucovanillin. The objective of this research was to characterize vanilla B-glucosidase. The vanilla B-glucosidase activity was increased by detergent. The enzyme was found as heat labile. Scalding should be conducted at 400 C for 2 - 3 minutes. The result from B-glucosidase activity in each part of vanilla and microscopic analisis of vanilla bean slice showed that the highest B-glucosidase activity and vanillin concentrations were found in the seed funicles and placental tissue the of vanilla bean. The activity of vanilla B-glucosidase was optimum at pH 6, 0, and temperature of 400 C, found as and activation energy was 5, 78 kcal/mole. After 44 minutes incubation time at 400 C. The activity was reduced down to 10 %. The apparent of moleculer weight was 100 - 400 kDa according to gel setration (Sephacryl S- 300) analysis...|$|R
40|$|Vanilla is tropic {{plant that}} has high {{economic}} value. <b>Indonesian</b> <b>vanilla</b> {{is the most}} popular because of vanillin content. Vanillin is the major of flavor compound in vanilla. Vanillin is formed during processing fresh to dry vanilla benas. Decreasing vanillin content and moisture content of dry vanilla beans during storage cause degradation of quality. The objective of this research was determined permeability of plastic packaging, the kinetic of quality degradation of dry vanilla beans were packaged all types of plastic during the storage, and predicted dry vanilla shelf-life. In this research classified for 3 steps, determined water vapour permeability of plastic, the kinetic of quality degradation of dry vanilla beans during the storage, and determined dry vanilla shelf-life. Result value was analyzed descriptively. The result of research showed that permeability of polipropilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 4 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polipropilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 675 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. But permeability of polietilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 46 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polietilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 795 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. In the other, permeability of zaack plastic was 8, 14 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. Polipropilen was the most because vanilin content changes was longest time among polietilen and zaack plastic packages, for this reason the stability of vanilla beans quality could be controlled. Polipropilen plastic has Ea = 8 Kal/mol K with A value = 16085, 93; polietilen plastic has Ea = 7, 89 Kal/mol K with A value = 14433, 30; and bagor plastic has Ea = 7, 64 Kal/mol K with A value = 10544, 9. The shelf life of vanilla beans that packaged with Polipropilen was 47 days, polietilen for 44 days, and zaack plastic for 43 days. The most proper packages for dry vanilla beans was Polipropilen.
