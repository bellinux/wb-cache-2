5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to fit chancelloriids into classifications of sponges or more complex animals. An analysis in 1996 concluded that they were closely related to sponges {{on the grounds that}} the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites ("armor plates") is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in [...] modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as Darwinella. However another analysis in 2002 concluded that chancelloriids are not sponges and may be intermediate between sponges and more complex animals, among other reasons because their skins were thicker and more tightly connected than those of sponges. In 2008 a detailed analysis of chancelloriids' sclerites concluded that they were very similar to those of halkieriids, mobile bilaterian animals that looked like slugs in chain mail and whose fossils are found in rocks from the very Early Cambrian to the Mid Cambrian. If this is correct, it would create a dilemma, as it is extremely unlikely that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they could be closely related.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{experience}} {{seems to}} be the basis of our knowledge and conception of mind-independent things. The puzzle is to understand how that can be: even if the things we experience (apples, tables, trees etc), are mind-independent how does our sensory experience of them enable us to conceive of them as mind-independent? George Berkeley thought that sensory experience can only provide us with the conception of mind-dependent things, things which cannot exist when they aren't being perceived. It's easy to dismiss Berkeley's conclusion but <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> avoid it. In this book, John Campbell and Quassim Cassam propose very different solutions to Berkeley's Puzzle. For Campbell, sensory experience can be the basis of our knowledge of mind-independent things because it is a relation, more primitive than thought, between the perceiver and high-level objects and properties in the mind-independent world. Cassam opposes this 'relationalist' solution to the Puzzle and defends a 'representationalist' solution: sensory experience can give us the conception of mind-independent things because it represents its objects as mind-independent, but does so without presupposing concepts of mind-independent things. This book is written {{in the form of a}} debate between two rival approaches to understanding the relationship between concepts and sensory experience. Although Berkeley's Puzzle frames the debate, the questions addressed by Campbell and Cassam aren't just of historical interest. They are among the most fundamental questions in philosophy...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary phenomenal externalists are {{motivated}} {{to a large extent}} by the transparency of experience and by the related doctrine of representationalism. On their own, however, transparency and representationalism do not suffice to establish externalism. Hence we should hesitate to dismiss phenomenal internalism, a view shared by many generations of competent philosophers. Rather, we should keep both our options open, internalism and externalism. It is <b>hard,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> keep open the internalist option, for although transparency and representationalism have not yet definitively established externalism, they have indeed made it quite intuitive. Internalism, by comparison, comes across at first sight as antiquated and ridden with difficulties. This is why I propose the Stained Glass model of consciousness. I do so with the following two aims: first, to make internalism intuitive in the age of transparency, and second, to show how to resist the many recent anti-internalist arguments. In particular, I argue that phenomenal internalism need not be epistemically worrisome, that it is compatible at once with transparency, representationalism, and content externalism, and that although it requires an error theory, this error theory is a harmless one...|$|R

5000|$|The couplet of Sonnet 116 Shakespeare {{went about}} {{explaining}} in the inverse. He says {{the opposite of}} what it would be natural to say about love. For instance, instead of writing something to the effect of 'I have written and men have loved', according to Nelson, Shakespeare chose to write, [...] "I never writ, nor no man ever loved." [...] Nelson argues that [...] "The existence of the poem itself gives good evidence that the poet has written. It is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> however, <b>how</b> the mere existence of the poem could show that men have loved. In part, whether men have loved depends upon just what love is…Since the poem is concerned with the nature of love, there is a sense in which what the poem says about love, if true, in part determines whether or not men have loved." [...] Nelson quotes Ingram and Redpath who are in agreement with his statement when they paraphrase the couplet in an extended form: [...] "If this is a judgment (or a heresy), and this can be proved against me, and by citing my own case in evidence, then I've never written anything, and no man's love has ever been real love."" [...] Vendler states [...] "Therefore, if he himself is in error on the subject of what true love is, then no man has ever loved; certainly the young man (it is implied) has not loved, if he has not loved after the steady fashion urged by the speaker, without alteration, removals, or impediments". Each of these authorities agree in the essence of the Sonnet and its portrayal of what love really is and what it can withstand, for example, the test of time and the fading of physical attraction of the object of our love. The couplet is, therefore, that men have indeed loved both in true and honest affection (this being {{the most important part of}} the argument) as well as falsely in the illusions of beauty before just as Shakespeare has written before this sonnet.|$|R
50|$|A very {{interesting}} connection exists between ogham and Cornwall in two literary references which tie ogham into the Cornish legend of Tristan and Iseult. The {{first of these}} is in a lay written by Marie of France which speaks of Tristan cutting and squaring off a branch of hazel on which he writes his name to alert Iseult to his presence. The second reference {{is found in the}} version of the Tristan legend by the Englishman Thomas of Ercildoune (ibid, p108) which describes how Tristan engraved his name in strange runes on small bits of wood, putting them in a stream so that they would flow down to where Iseult could see them. While it is true that neither version directly refers to ogham there are good grounds for believing that ogham was the 'strange runes' used by Tristan. First of all, the cutting, squaring off, and writing of names on bits of wood sounds compatible with how ogham was probably used. Second, ogham fits better into the cultural milieu of the story than the runes. Iseult is from Ireland, and Tristan first meets Iseult when spending some time there, so it is quite plausible that they would use ogham for writing to each other. The story also reflects the reality of links between Ireland and Cornwall, visible today in the surviving ogham inscriptions. It is not <b>hard</b> from this <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the Cornish could include a reference to the strange Irish writing in one of their stories. The story may ultimately be of Irish origin anyway, transmitted through those same links.|$|R

40|$|Seventy years ago, {{night soil}} from Göteborg, Sweden, was transported on barges {{up along the}} Göta River. Farmers in the {{surroundings}} of present Ale kommun used the night soil as a fertilizer. Now recirculation of plant nutrients from urban to rural areas is discussed again. This time the discussion is limited to recirculation of source separated human urine as a valuable fertilizer. Source separated human urine is an alternative to sewage treatment in sewage plants. In Sweden, a couple of pilot projects with human urine have already started, where house owners collect their urine, which is then used as a fertilizer by a farmer in the neighbourhood. Many local authorities are getting interested in this way of treating sewage. This study was made in Ale kommun, close to Göteborg, Sweden. Farmers, property managers and tenants were interviewed about their view of source separated human urine. The three groups interviewed were chosen because they represent the categories primarily involved in a future sewage system change. A qualitative method was used and the interviews were more like a conversation than strictly formal. Fourteen farmers, five property managers and ten tenants were interviewed. The farmers in Ale kommun in general have a positive attitude to using human urine in their production. They think that night soil from the urban areas must {{be returned to the}} fields in one way or another. They themselves would feel more satisfied by using human mine as a fertilizer than using the common manufactured fertilizers. The farmers have the knowledge about circulation of plant nutrients. But they are afraid of what unsuitable substances are poured into the toilets. An understanding between them and the tenants is required for a system with source separated human urine. The farmers' working situation, especially during spring, makes it <b>hard</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much of the manufactured fertilizers {{they would be able to}} replace by human urine. If it was made possible for them to hire labour, his would not be a problem. Nobody wants to drive into town and collect urine with their present equipment. Government regulations seem to be necessary. The fanners still believe that it would be easy to organize some separation of human urine, with one group responsible. Among the property managers there were both those who knew about the plant nutrition content in human urine and those who did not know about its worth at all. The most sceptical ones belonged to the smaller companies. The building sector seem to have gotten concerned about environmental questions only this year. A grass root-perspective is obvious, since they hardly want to act without interested tenants. The tenants think that source separated human urine would be more natural than the "rubbish" spread out on the fields today. They believe in recirculation. The usefulness of source separated human urine is not that obvious, though. It is not apparent for everyone why one talks about separating urine. There is a big need for knowledge about recirculation of plant nutrition...|$|R
