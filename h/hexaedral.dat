40|$|This paper {{considers}} grid-adaptation {{techniques for}} the boundary-layer region of hybrid meshes, where the mesh is of regular structure consisting of prismatic resp. <b>hexaedral</b> elements. The method helps to improve convergence, {{accuracy and reliability}} of aerodynamic simulations for the two possible types of wall-boundary conditions for viscous flows, i. e., integrating the flow equations down to the wall (no-slip) or using wall-functions. The underlying algorithms and their parallelization are described and the method is applied to 3 D aerodynamic configurations. Moreover, accuracy and performance gain using wall-functions with grid-adaptation are discussed for transonic airfoil flows...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of most surgical models has not allowed interactive simulations on standard computers. We propose a new framework to finely control {{the resolution of}} the models. This allows us to dynamically concentrate the computational force where it is most needed. Given the geometrical model of an object to simulate, we first compute a bounding box and then recursively subdivide it where needed. The cells of this octree structure are labelled with mechanical properties based on material parameters and fill rate. An efficient physical simulation is then performed using hierarchical <b>hexaedral</b> finite elements. The object surface is used for rendering and to apply boundary conditions. Compared with traditional finite element approaches, our method dramatically simplifies the task of volume meshing and increases the propagation of the deformations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{capabilities}} of an open-source CFD code (OpenFOAM) in the simulation of the Benjamin bubble are benchmarked against the available experimental data, theoretical analysis and numerical results of simulations carried out with a commercial code. The simulations are carried out for a large range of Reynolds numbers, obtained by using both water and high-viscosity oils. The volume of ﬂuid (VOF) multiphase model {{is used in the}} simulation. The dynamics of the Benjamin bubble is investigated in terms of bubble drift velocity and shape. The sensitivity of the results {{to the size of the}} time step, to the numerical discretization schemes and to grid reﬁnement and topology is investigated by using water as working liquid. It is found that the most critical parameters are grid topology and resolution. The results obtained on a structured <b>hexaedral</b> grid of adequate resolution show good agreement with experimental data both in terms of bubble shape and drift velocity. In particular, the bubble shape obtained with OpenFOAM is closer to the experimental one than that found in analogous simulations carried out with a commercial code...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{numerical}} computation of complex eigenmodes of cavity resonators filled with magnetically biased gyrotropic material is demonstrated. For this purpose, a dedicated solver {{based on the}} Finite Integration Technique (FIT) has been developed, efficiently implemented as well as successfully verified. Gyrotropic field problems arise, for instance, for the calculation of the resonance frequencies of ferrite-loaded resonators like the GSI SIS 18 cavity. Ferrites exhibit gyromagnetic properties with an anisotropic permeability, which furthermore depends both on frequency and bias field. Similarly, gyroelectric material such as magnetized plasmas can be described by a frequency- and bias field dependent permittivity tensor. Since these material tensors affect the system matrix of the eigenvalue problem, a dedicated solver is required. In this thesis, the FIT with a <b>hexaedral</b> staircase filling is employed for discretization. In the standard formulation, it is, however, limited to diagonally anisotropic materials. Hence, {{as one of the}} goals of this thesis, the FIT has been extended to gyromagnetic as well as gyroelectric materials in frequency domain. The derived expressions for the non-diagonal material matrices are fully consistent with the standard FIT when applied to non-gyrotropic materials. Moreover, their structure is manifestly Hermitian in the lossless case, even for non-equidistant grids. Due to the above-mentioned material requirements, the newly developed solver consists of two components: The first one is a magnetostatic solver based on the H_i-algorithm supporting nonlinear material to calculate the magnetic field excited by the bias current. Having obtained the field distribution, the material properties are evaluated locally in each mesh cell at the specified working point. The second component is a Jacobi-Davidson type eigenvalue solver for the iterative solution of the nonlinear eigenproblem. To be capable of handling material losses, the eigensolver also supports non-Hermitian eigenproblems. What is more, efficient parallel computing on machines with distributed memory is possible. To this end, an ordering of the FIT-DOFs different from the standard scheme is implemented, which results in an increased computation to communication ratio. Furthermore, all DOFs that vanish a priori due to several reasons are completely removed from the vectors and matrices. All in all, gyrotropic eigenproblems discretized with several millions of mesh cells can be solved in a reasonable time by the developed solver. The validity of {{the numerical}}ly obtained results is confirmed by thorough comparisons with (semi-) analytical calculations. As an application example, an eigenmode analysis of the GSI SIS 18 cavity is carried out. Since the required material data are not available in the data sheet of the manufacturer, designated measurements of the magnetic characteristics of the Ferroxcube 8 C 12 m ferrite ring cores, which are installed inside the GSI SIS 18 cavities, were performed. Among these characteristics are the complex permeability as a function of frequency and bias magnetic field strength at low radio-frequency power levels as well as the B-H curve. The measurement methods together with the detailed data analysis including the presentation of evaluated data are supplemented to this thesis. The scalar, isotropic permeability retrieved this way is used for the cavity simulations. The obtained values for the resonance frequency and quality factor for the fundamental mode are in accordance with available measurement data. To demonstrate the further potential of the solver, also higher-order modes are investigated and an outlook on possibly advantageous 2 -directional bias schemes is given...|$|E
