5|$|A {{state of}} {{calamity}} was declared in nine provinces. In response, the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), {{in conjunction with}} local governments, provided ₱15.5million ($333,000 USD) toward relief funds. Various agencies, including the NDRM and the Philippine Red Cross, distributed water, meals, medicine, and blankets to affected families. The provincial government of Ilocos Norte provided seeds to farmers whose crops were damaged during the storm. The Government Service <b>Insurance</b> <b>System</b> provided ₱197million (US$4million) to pension fund holders in Abra province.|$|E
5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E

In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the unicameral Batasang Pambansa, held {{office at the}} new Batasang Pambansa Complex. When a new constitution restored the bicameral Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service <b>Insurance</b> <b>System</b> at reclaimed land at Pasay.

5|$|During the {{dictatorship}} of Ferdinand Marcos, {{in accordance with}} Presidential Decree no. 645, the old Manila Hotel Company was liquidated and the government took over its ownership. The Government Service <b>Insurance</b> <b>System</b> (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, and expand the Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out and the air was sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards. It was the place to go and be seen during the martial law years.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> {{devised by}} McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service <b>Insurance</b> <b>System</b> (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won by matching Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed a check for ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. One of the first things Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui expert, and replace them with five.|$|E

40|$|Online {{healthcare}} {{service has}} gradually become {{a significant part}} of healthcare services, especially in emerging economy with shortage in medical resources and wide coverage in the Internet usage. This paper studies how health insurance policies affect the demand for online healthcare consultation by using longitudinal online healthcare and offline medical services datasets of a major city in China. The two policies we study are the integration of health <b>insurance</b> <b>systems</b> in urban and rural regions and the integration of health <b>insurance</b> <b>systems</b> between pairwise-cities. The empirical results show that both policies significantly affected the demand for online consultation. Our study is among the pioneering efforts examining the impact of health insurance policy on the demand for online healthcare services, in particular, the relocation of demand for medical services resulted from the integration of health <b>insurance</b> <b>systems</b> between rural and urban areas and across cities. It also provides an innovative angle to gauge the macro-level impact of medical insurance policy on the change and shift of medical service demand across channels and regions. This impact is difficult to detect in the past due to the disconnected hospital information systems and inconsistent medical <b>insurance</b> <b>systems</b> across hospitals and regions...|$|R
