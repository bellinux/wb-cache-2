40|$|The {{study to}} be {{reported}} here extends the current understanding of epistemological beliefs by taking into account another set of beliefs related to learning that have often been overlooked. This study, basing on empirical data collected via semi-structured interviews from 29 student teachers in Australia, examines how core <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> knowing are related to peripheral <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> learning. A theoretical framework is developed for considering these <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> knowing in relation to <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> learning as an overall set of epistemological beliefs - such links between the developmental epistemological beliefs and student learning research have not {{been made in the}} literature to date. As a group, it is found, students’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> knowing ranged from a focus on knowledge as absolute and received to a view that knowledge was constructed and reasoned. The categories related to learning reflected a range of beliefs from reproductive through to more transformative <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> learning. A relationship was noted between the more sophisticated <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> knowing and transformative <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> learning. Implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{development}} of a self-report measure to assess metacognitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia in non-patients. We aimed to test the specific hypotheses that positive <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia would predict frequency of paranoia, and that negative <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia would predict distress associated with delusional ideation. Three-hundred and seventeen non-patient participants were asked to complete questionnaires assessing <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia, paranoia, dimensions of delusional ideation and trait anxiety. The results showed that four empirically distinct subscales were measured by the <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia scale (negative <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia, <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia as a survival strategy, general positive beliefs and normalising beliefs). The scales possessed acceptable internal consistency and were associated with the measures of paranoia, delusional ideation and anxiety. Consistent with predictions, it was found that <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> paranoia as a survival strategy were associated with frequency of paranoia, and negative beliefs were associated with distress associated with delusional ideation. These findings suggest that a metacognitive approach to the conceptualization of paranoia as a strategy for managing interpersonal threat may have some utility. The clinical implications of the findings are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} that <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> language learning are significant for the learning and teaching process, and that learners may differ in their beliefs towards learning a new language.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional and {{experimental}} {{research has demonstrated}} an association between emotional suppression and IBS. However, the relationship is not well understood. AIM: To examine the relationships between emotional suppression, we compare the measures of <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions {{and quality of life}} in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with healthy controls. METHOD: Online questionnaires measured <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions, emotional suppression and IBS-related quality of life in participants with (n[*]=[*] 87) and without (n[*]=[*] 37) IBS. Mediation analyses and group comparisons were used to explore the role of emotional suppression and <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions in this sample. RESULTS: IBS participants held significantly more <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the unacceptability of emotions compared to healthy controls despite no differences in emotional suppression. The relationship between <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions and quality of life was not mediated by emotional suppression. However, the relationship between emotional suppression and quality of life was mediated by <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a role of <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions and emotional suppression in IBS, where emotional suppression may relate to changes in <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> emotions and consequently quality of life. This is discussed in relation to the cognitive-behavioural model of medically unexplained symptoms...|$|R

Further, the study aimed to assess whether they are open to change and whether changing <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> cause resulted in a subsequent shift in <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> solutions. Design: Experimental factorial 3 (problem) × 2 (manipulated cause) design using vignettes. Methods: Two hundred seventy-nine participants rated their <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the cause and solution of one of three problems (depression, obesity and sleep problems) following a vignette which described the causes as either psychological or biomedical. Results: <b>Beliefs</b> <b>about</b> causes and solutions varied according to type of problem indicating that beliefs are illness specific. The results also showed that people hold <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> causes and solutions which are consistent with each other as an endorsement of a psychological cause was consistently reflected in a belief that a psychological solution was most appropriate and effective. A similar pattern was seen for <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> biomedical causes and solutions. Finally, the results showed that beliefs were open to manipulation and that a shift in <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> causes resulted in a parallel shift in <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> solutions. Conclusions: People hold <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> causes and solution which vary according to type of problem.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the influence of genetic and environmental factors on tobacco use among African Americans and to identify factors that are independently associated with these beliefs. Design and Setting: Participants were 94 adult African American men and women who were enrolled in a study on race, genetics, and smoking. Main Outcome Measures: <b>Beliefs</b> <b>about</b> factors involved in smoking initiation and cessation were evaluated by self-report during a structured telephone survey. Results: Smoking status was not associated significantly with <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the influence of genetic or environmental factors; however, gender and education level were associated significantly with <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the influence of environmental factors. Men (ß 521. 71, P 5. 01) reported significantly greater <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the influence of environmental factors on tobacco use compared to women. Higher education was also associated with greater <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> the influence of environmental factors (ß 51. 81, P 5. 01).

40|$|Background: In {{people who}} {{experience}} auditory verbal hallucinations, beliefs the person holds about their voices {{appear to be}} clinically important as mediators of associated distress and disability. Whilst such beliefs {{are thought to be}} influenced by broader schematic representations the person holds about themselves and other people, there has been little empirical examination of this, in particular in relation to <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voice intent and the personal meaning of the voice experience. Method: thirty-four voice hearers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales and measures of <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices (Revised <b>Beliefs</b> <b>About</b> Voices Questionnaire, Interpretation of Voices Inventory) and schemas (Brief Core Schema Scales). Results: <b>Beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices were correlated with both negative voice content and schemas. After controlling for negative voice content, schemas were estimated to predict between 9 % and 35 % of variance in the six <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices that were measured. Negative-self schemas were the strongest predictors, and positive-self and negative-other schemas also showed potential relationships with <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices.

40|$|Objective: There is {{evidence}} that perceptions of treatment may be more predictive than illness perceptions, e. g. medication adherence is often better predicted by <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> medication than by <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> illness. The present study aims to assess the generality of this finding, by comparing {{the extent to which}} self-care behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes are predicted by patients' <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> those behaviours, compared with their illness perceptions. Methods: This study is a one year prospective cohort analysis of 453 patients recruited to a randomised trial of blood glucose self-monitoring. Behaviour was assessed by the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) and Diabetes Self-Care Activities (DSCA) scales; illness perceptions by IPQ-R; study-specific scales of <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> diet and physical activity were constructed by factor analysing items based on beliefs elicited in an earlier interview study involving patients with type 2 diabetes. Results: Past behaviour, trial group allocation, and clinical and demographic factors predicted between 16 % and 35 % variance in medication adherence, exercise, and diet scales. Illness perceptions added between 0. 9 % and 4. 5 % additional variance; <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> behaviour added a further 1. 1 % to 6. 4 % additional variance. Beliefs regarding, respectively, the importance of exercise in controlling diabetes, the need to east less, and enjoyment from eating sweet or fatty food, added unique variance. Conclusion: <b>Beliefs</b> <b>about</b> behaviour are at least as important as <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> illness in predicting several health-related behaviours. This suggests the possibility that behaviour change interventions with patient groups would be more effective by targeting <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> behaviour, rather than <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> illness. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

Results: Correlation analyses indicated that alcohol expectancies and metacognitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> alcohol use were positively correlated with drinking behaviour. Structural regression modelling revealed that three of the four facets of metacognitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> alcohol use were independent contributors to drinking behaviour, and that, when controlling for such beliefs, only negative social performance alcohol expectancies explained additional variance in drinking behaviour.

The aim was to assess anticipated barriers to healthcare seeking and <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> cancer {{in a sample of}} the Danish population and to assess the association with socio-economic position. MethodsA population-based telephone interview with 3000 randomly sampled persons aged 30 years or older was performed using the Awareness and <b>Beliefs</b> <b>about</b> Cancer measure from 31 May to 4 July 2011. The Awareness and <b>Beliefs</b> <b>about</b> Cancer measure includes statements about four anticipated barriers to healthcare seeking and three positively and three negatively framed <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> cancer. For all persons, register-based information on socio-economic position was obtained through Statistics Denmark. ResultsTwo anticipated barriers, worry about what the doctor might find and worry about wasting the doctor's time, were present among 27 % and 15 % of the respondents, respectively. Overall, a high proportion of respondents concurred with positive <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> cancer; fewer concurred with negative beliefs.

What is less clear is what factors govern such beliefs. This study aimed to explore the way in which traumatic life events contribute towards <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices and any associated distress. Method The difference in the nature and prevalence of traumatic life events and associated psychological sequelae was compared in two groups of voice hearers: psychiatric voice hearers with predominantly negative <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices (PVH) and non-psychiatric voice hearers with predominantly positive <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices (NPVH). The data from the two groups were then combined in order to examine which factors could significantly account for the variance in <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices and therefore levels of distress. Results Both groups reported a high prevalence of traumatic life events although significantly more PVH reported trauma symptoms sufficient for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, significantly more PVH reported experiencing childhood sexual abuse. Current trauma symptoms (re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal) were found to be a significant predictor of <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> voices. Trauma variables accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in anxiety and depression.
