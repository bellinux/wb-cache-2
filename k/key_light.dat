5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate <b>key</b> <b>light</b> and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The <b>key</b> <b>light</b> was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
5|$|Occurring a {{year after}} Hurricane Donna, {{officials}} in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero <b>Key</b> <b>Light.</b> Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls. On the morning of September7, a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas, and eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600UTC on September9. An estimated 500,000people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities. Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall.|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky {{planned to}} have a strong {{presentation}} of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose not to be so extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of <b>key</b> <b>light.</b> In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially dim and gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently awash with light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, [...] "We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets {{closer and closer to the}} truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm's end, the U.S. Army Quartermaster permitted homeless citizens {{to rest in}} its local barracks. Food, water, and supplies were lacking, with most having been washed away, rendered unusable, or become inedible due to the storm's salty storm surge. The Morriss captain obtained supplies from a damaged vessel, sending them to a local Methodist minister. Efforts to reconstruct and recover from the disaster were not immediate {{due to the lack}} of available resources. With the loss of area lighthouses, local waters were difficult to navigate, with one shipwreck occurring as a result west of Key West; in response, a [...] staff was placed at the former location of the now-destroyed Key West lighthouse. Many vessels were also lost near Sand <b>Key</b> <b>Light,</b> and decades later, the tower, poorly maintained due to a lack of government funding, continued to deteriorate.|$|E
500|$|The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One {{camera shot}} begins inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and pulls {{back to reveal}} the captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot {{continues}} to pull back and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene {{was inspired by a}} New York City production of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens {{to make it easier for}} the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the <b>key</b> <b>light</b> to increase in intensity up to 1000footcandles so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The [...] dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish. The entire set for the scene was [...] wide and [...] high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget.|$|E
50|$|Chained was {{the first}} of eight films Crawford would make with cinematographer George J. Folsey. Folsey {{discovered}} a lighting scheme which emphasized her best features. As the crew prepared for a shipboard-in-the-moonlight scene, a single small spotlight shone down on Crawford from high above the stage. Folsey noticed how the soft light highlighted her eyes and cheekbones, and designed her <b>key</b> <b>lighting</b> around that. Crawford was thrilled with how she looked, and demanded the same kind of lighting {{for the rest of her}} career.|$|R
50|$|The {{best time}} to take window light {{portrait}} {{is considered to be}} early hours of the day and late hours of afternoon when light is more intense on the window. Curtains, reflectors, and intensity reducing shields are used to give soft light. While mirrors and glasses can be used for high <b>key</b> <b>lighting.</b> At times colored glasses, filters and reflecting objects can be used to give the portrait desired color effects. The composition of shadows and soft light gives window light portraits a distinct effect different from portraits made from artificial lights.|$|R

500|$|The {{impacts of}} the {{hurricane}} were extreme throughout the state of Florida, especially in the Florida Keys. High winds washed away two lighthouses near Key West, resulting {{in the deaths of}} all 16people at Sand <b>Key</b> <b>Light</b> and 14individuals at the Key West lighthouse; although keeper Barbara Mabrity survived, seven of her children died while taking refuge there during the hurricane. The -storm surge in Key West proper swept through downtown and forced many to abandon their homes; many attempted to flee to higher ground ("the highest piece of land [...] seventeen feet high, with waves threatening to push them off") but were still killed or injured. All wharves and warehouses in the town suffered some degree of damage, and of the approximately six hundred residences on the key, only six endured the storm's fury successfully, with the others unroofed or flattened by intense winds. Fort Zachary Taylor, partially obliterated by the hurricane, endured over $200,000 in damage, while the nearby customs-house was also harmed. Uprooted trees and debris from destroyed houses rendered roads impassable. The storm also changed the landscape within the vicinity, washing away Sand Key entirety. However, the island quickly resurfaced by that December, albeit [...] west of its original position. Every vessel at local harbor sustained serious damage; in addition, some 20vessels were unaccounted for, and at least 40deaths were documented, though another source suggested 50lives were lost out at sea. An additional twelve died inland as a result death by being impaled, crushed, or drowned.|$|E
50|$|A <b>key</b> <b>light</b> {{positioned}} low {{appears to}} distort the actor's features, since most natural or ambient light is normally overhead.

50|$|The <b>key</b> <b>light</b> is {{the first}} and usually most {{important}} light that a photographer, cinematographer, lighting cameraman, or other scene composer will use in a lighting setup.

50|$|Sven Nykvist, the {{longtime}} collaborator of Ingmar Bergman, also informed {{much of his}} photography with chiaroscuro realism, as did Gregg Toland, who influenced such cinematographers as László Kovács, Vilmos Zsigmond, and Vittorio Storaro with his use of deep and selective focus augmented with strong horizon-level <b>key</b> <b>lighting</b> penetrating through windows and doorways. Much of the celebrated film noir tradition relies on techniques Toland perfected in the early thirties {{that are related to}} chiaroscuro (though high-key lighting, stage lighting, frontal lighting, and other effects are interspersed in ways that diminish the chiaroscuro claim).|$|R
40|$|Fifteen pigeons {{were exposed}} to either response-independent or response-dependent {{schedules}} of water reinforcement, whereby water was injected directly into the unrestrained pigeons' mandibles. Key-contact responses were released by a <b>lighted</b> <b>key</b> correlated with water, but not by a <b>lighted</b> <b>key</b> uncorrelated with water. A negative response-reinforcer contingency suppressed autoshaped key-contact responses, resulting in responding directed away from the <b>lighted</b> <b>key.</b> In all pigeons, water injected directly into the mandibles elicited a consummatory fixed-action pattern of “mumbling” and swallowing. The <b>lighted</b> <b>key</b> correlated with water released a broader set of both appetitive and consummatory responses: approach to the <b>lighted</b> <b>key,</b> “bowing”, “rooting”, “mumbling”, and swallowing. Key-contact responses were “rooting” and “mumbling” motions of the beak {{on the surface of}} the key. Views of autoshaping based on stimulus substitution or stimulus surrogation do not fully explain the origin of autoshaped responses not previously elicited by the reinforcer. The present findings are consonant with views of conditioning that emphasize the large degree of biological pre-organization in conditioned response patterns, and the importance of associative factors in the control of such patterns...|$|R
