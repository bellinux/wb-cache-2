The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 {{made it more difficult}} to raise <b>development</b> <b>capital.</b> In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.|$|E

40|$|Challenging {{the prior}} {{research}} viewing employees as passive beings who respond to work-family conflict, this dissertation studies employees as active agents who shape {{their experience of}} work-family conflict and enrichment through developing resources based on their attentional efforts. Specifically, drawing on Conservation of Resources Theory, this dissertation proposes and tests a resource-based process model that explain the indirect effect of key resources (conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness) on work-family conflict and work-family enrichment through differential resource <b>development</b> processes (human <b>capital</b> <b>development,</b> social <b>capital</b> <b>development,</b> and altruistic development). The results show support that agreeableness is associated with work-family conflict and enrichment through its unique effect on altruistic <b>capital</b> <b>development.</b> The indirect effect of conscientiousness on work-family conflict and enrichment operates through human <b>capital</b> <b>development</b> and altruistic <b>capital</b> <b>development.</b> Extraversion is associated with work-family conflict and enrichment through all three types of resource development. Moreover, the supplementary analysis using a longitudinal mediation design reveals a pattern of reverse causality?the positive relationship between conscientiousness and human <b>capital</b> <b>development</b> is attributable to the indirect effect through work-family enrichment...|$|R

The study applies Two Stage Least Squares (2 SLS) approach along with the simultaneous equation model.
