40|$|Hereditary {{haemochromatosis}} is {{a primary}} inherited disorder of iron metabolism leading to progressive iron loading of parenchymal cells of the liver and other organs with diverse clinical manifestations, including cirrhosis, diabetes and skin pigmentation. This chapter will focus on HFE-associated hereditary haemochromatosis, which accounts for approximately 90 % of cases in Caucasian populations. Penetrance is incomplete, with variable clinical expression. The majority of cases demonstrate biochemical expression, but a much lower proportion develop advanced disease. Clinical disease—especially hepatic fibrosis—is related {{to the level of}} body iron stores, which is reflected primarily in the liver. The available evidence indicates that adequate screening and diagnostic strategies ensure that early case detection and treatment occur prior to the development of irreversible end-organ damage. The most cost-effective methods of early case detection are <b>family</b> (<b>cascade)</b> <b>screening</b> and evaluation of potential cases by primary care physicians with a high index of clinical suspicion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recognising {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) can increase {{life expectancy of}} these patients and their close relatives. To improve identification of this under-diagnosed disease, experts suggested raising the age limit for CRC tumour genetic testing from 50 to 70 years. The present study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this strategy. METHODS: Probabilistic efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out comparing tumour genetic testing of CRC diagnosed at age 70 or below (experimental strategy) versus CRC diagnosed at age 50 or below (current practice). The proportions of LS patients identified and cost-effectiveness including cascade screening of relatives, were calculated by decision analytic models based on real-life data. RESULTS: Using the experimental strategy, four times more LS patients can be identified among CRC patients when compared with current practice. Both the costs to detect one LS patient (euro 9437 /carrier versus euro 4837 /carrier), and the number needed to test for detecting one LS patient (42 versus 19) doubled. When <b>family</b> <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> was included, the experimental strategy {{was found to be}} highly cost-effective according to Dutch standards, resulting in an overall ratio of euro 2703 per extra life-year gained in additionally tested patients. CONCLUSION: Testing all CRC tumours diagnosed at or below age 70 for LS is cost-effective. Implementation is important as relatives from the large number of LS patients that are missed by current practice, can benefit from life-saving surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD) in people {{before the age}} of 35 years is a devastating event for any family. The causes of SCD in the young can be broadly divided into two groups: {{heritable}} cardiac disorders that affect the heart structure (cardiomyopathies) and primary electrical disorders (cardiac ion channelopathies). Genetic testing is vital as those suffering from cardiac ion channelopathies have structurally normal hearts, and those with cardiomyopathies may only show subtle abnormalities in the heart and these signs may not be detected during an autopsy. Post-mortem genetic testing of SCD victims is important to identify the underlying genetic cause. This is important as <b>family</b> <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> may be undertaken to identify those who may be at risk and provide vital information about risk stratification and clinical management. The development of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has made it possible for the simultaneous screening of multiple patients for hundreds of genes. In light of this, we opted to develop an MPS approach for SCD analysis that would allow us to screen for mutations in genes implicated in cardiomyopathies and cardiac ion channelopathies. The rationale behind this panel was to limit it to genes carrying the greatest mutation load. If no likely pathogenic gene variant were found then testing could cascade to whole exome/genome sequencing as a gene-discovery exercise. The overarching aim was to design and validate a custom-cardiac panel that satisfies the diagnostic requirements of LabPLUS (Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, NZ) and the guidelines provided by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Association for Clinical Genetic Science...|$|E

40|$|This {{review article}} assesses the {{clinical}} features, diagnosis {{and management of}} familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is mostly an autosomally dominantly inherited with an incidence of 1 in 250. Tendon xanthomata are pathognomonic. Untreated FH is associated with 100 - 200 fold increase in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). FH is diagnosed by screening for elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and confirmed by DNA techniques. Once index cases have been identified <b>cascade</b> <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> should occur. FH is primarily treated with high dose statin therapy. This reduces progression of surrogate markers of coronary arterial disease and registry studies show a 70 % long-term decrease in CVD mortality. The justification for other lipidlowering therapies e. g. ezetimibe relies on the high population attributable risk of LDL-C in FH. Novel therapies with greater LDL-C reducing actions such as proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin- 9 inhibitors show promise in FH Children with FH should be identified through <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> but drug treatment is dependent on LDL-C and family history. They should be managed in specialist paediatric units or in family clinics. Cases of homozygous FH are rare.

40|$|Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{mainly caused by}} mutations in the LDLR gene, resulting in elevated serum cholesterol levels and elevated risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD).

40|$|Objectives: {{to compare}} the effectiveness, {{estimate}} the associated costs, and summarise available evidence about the feasibility and acceptability of different screening strategies in England and Wales. Also to establish a model for estimating effectiveness and costs of these different strategies. Data sources: literature searches were restricted to MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as citations in included papers. A broad search strategy was used involving all aspects of fragile X syndrome (FXS) and covered all relevant literature published between 1991 and 2001. Review methods: an assessment was conducted of published literature and efforts focused {{on the development of}} a model {{that could be used to}} synthesise data from various sources, estimate cost-effectiveness of different strategies, and conduct sensitivity analyses according to different assumptions. Results: the identified screening programmes were effective in detecting carriers, but a comparison of different strategies was not possible. Simulation results by the FXS Model showed that, over the first 10 years, 4 % of premutation (PM) females and 70 % of full mutation (FM) females could be detected by active cascade screening; it is 10 % and 58 %, respectively, by prenatal screening. The maximal detection rate for FM carriers by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is higher than that by prenatal screening (91 % versus 71 %). However, the maximal rate of detection of female PM carriers by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> (6 %) is much lower than that by prenatal screening (60 %). During the first 10 years of simulation, the estimated direct cost per year to the NHS in England and Wales is 0. 7 - 0. 2 million pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 14. 5 - 9. 1 million pounds sterling by a programme of prenatal screening. The incremental cost per extra carrier detected (using current practice as the reference standard) is on average only 165 pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 7543 pounds sterling by prenatal screening. The incremental cost per FXS birth avoided is on average 8494 pounds sterling by active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and 284, 779 pounds sterling by prenatal screening. Conclusions: the empirical evidence suggests that both prenatal <b>screening</b> and <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> are feasible and acceptable. Population-based prenatal screening is more efficacious, but it will cost more than active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> The active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> of affected <b>families</b> is more efficient, cheaper, but less effective than a population-based prenatal screening.

40|$|<b>Cascade</b> testing or <b>screening</b> {{provides}} an important mechanism for identifying {{people at risk}} of a genetic condition. For some autosomal dominant conditions, such as Familial Hpercholesterolaemia (FH), identifying relatives allows for significant health-affecting interventions to be administered, which can extend a person’s life expectancy significantly. However, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is not without ethical implications. In this paper, we examine one ethically contentious aspect of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programmes, namely the alternative methods by which relatives of a proband can be contacted. Should the proband be responsible for contacting {{his or her family}} members, or should the screening programme contact family members directly? We argue that direct contact is an ethically justifiable method of contact tracing in <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for FH. Not only has this method of contact already been utilised without adverse effects, an examination of the ethical arguments against it shows these are unsubstantiated.

40|$|Screening {{for genetic}} {{variants}} that predispose individuals or their offspring to disease may be {{performed at the}} general population level or may instead be targeted at the relatives of previously identified carriers. The latter strategy {{has come to be}} known as “cascade genetic screening. ” Since the carrier risk of close relatives of known carriers is generally higher than the population risk, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> is more efficient than population screening, in the sense that fewer individuals have to be genotyped per detected carrier. The efficacy of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> as measured by the overall proportion of carriers detected in a given population, is, however, lower than that of population-wide screening, and the respective inclusion rates vary according to the population frequency and mode of inheritance of the predisposing variants. For dominant mutations, we have developed equations that allow the inclusion rates of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> to be calculated in an iterative fashion, depending upon screening depth and penetrance. For recessive mutations, we derived only equations for the screening of siblings and the children of patients. Owing to their mathematical complexity, it was necessary to study more extended screening strategies by simulation. <b>Cascade</b> <b>screening</b> turned out to result in low inclusion rates (< 1 %) when aimed at the identification of heterozygous carriers of rare recessive variants. Considerably higher rates are achievable, however, when screening is performed to detect covert homozygotes for frequent recessive mutations with reduced penetrance. This situation is exemplified by hereditary hemochromatosis, for which up to 40 % of at-risk individuals may be identifiable through screening of first- to third-degree relatives of overt carriers (i. e., patients); the efficiency of this screening strategy was found to be ∼ 50 times higher than that of population-wide screening. For dominant mutations, inclusion rates of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> were estimated to be higher than for recessive variants. Thus, some 80 % of all carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation would be detected if screening were to be targeted specifically at first- to third-degree relatives of patients with venous thrombosis. The relative cost efficiency of cascade as compared with population-wide screening (i. e., the overall savings in the extra managerial cost of the condition) is also likely to be higher for dominant than for recessive mutations. This notwithstanding, once screening has become cost-effective at the population level, it can be expected that <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> would only transiently represent an economically viable option...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundFamilial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary {{disorder of}} lipid metabolism that causes lifelong exposure to increased LDL levels resulting in premature {{coronary heart disease}} and, if untreated, death. Recent studies have shown its prevalence {{to be higher than}} previously considered, which has important implications for the mortality and morbidity of associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several clinical tools are used worldwide to help physicians diagnose FH, but nevertheless most patients remain undetected. This systematic review of guidelines aims to assess the role of genetic testing in the screening, diagnosis, and management of patients affected by heterozygous or homozygous FH and to identify related health-care pathways. MethodsWe performed a systematic review of the literature; inclusion criteria were English or Italian guidelines focusing on genetic testing. The guidelines were included and evaluated for their content and development process using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument. ResultsTen guidelines were considered eligible, and all were judged to be of good quality, with slight differences among them. The most common indications for performing genetic tests were high levels of cholesterol, or physical findings consistent with lipid disorder, in the subject or in the family history. Subsequent screening of family members was indicated when a mutation had been identified in the index patient. Regarding patient management, the various guidelines agreed that intensive treatment with lipid-lowering medications should begin as quickly as possible and that lifestyle modifications should {{be an integral part of}} the therapy. ConclusionSince the early detection of affected patients is beneficial for effective prevention of CVD, genetic testing is particularly useful for identifying <b>family</b> members via <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and for distinguishing between heterozygous and homozygous individuals, the latter of which require more extreme therapeutic intervention...|$|R

40|$|This {{overview}} {{gives an}} update on the molecular mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and therapy of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). ACM is mostly hereditary and associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins of the intercalated disc. Three subtypes have been proposed: the classical right-dominant subtype generally referred to as ARVC/D, biventricular forms with early biventricular involvement and left-dominant subtypes with predominant LV involvement. Typical symptoms include palpitations, arrhythmic (pre) syncope and sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias, which typically occur in athletes. At later stages, heart failure may occur. Diagnosis is established with the 2010 Task Force Criteria (TFC). Modern imaging tools are crucial for ACM diagnosis, including both echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for detecting functional and structural alternations. Of note, structural findings often become visible after electrical alterations, such as premature ventricular beats, ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). 12 -lead ECG is important to assess for depolarisation and repolarisation abnormalities, including T-wave inversions as the most common ECG abnormality. Family history and the detection of causative mutations, mostly affecting the desmosome, have been incorporated in the TFC, and stress the importance of <b>cascade</b> <b>family</b> <b>screening.</b> Differential diagnoses include idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) VT, sarcoidosis, congenital heart disease, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, athlete's heart, Brugada syndrome and RV infarction.

40|$|Familial DNA <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> for {{familial}} hypercholesterolemia (FH) {{has recently been}} introduced in Scotland. This study investigated index patients' experiences of DNA testing and mediating <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> Thirty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of definite or possible FH who had undergone DNA testing in the lipid clinic took part in semi-structured qualitative interviews. All patients were positive about DNA screening being undertaken by familiar and trusted clinicians within the lipid clinic. Most patients had already cascaded close relatives for serum cholesterol testing following their attendance at the lipid clinic. Identified mutation carriers who had attended the genetics clinic (n[*]=[*] 15) for a cascading appointment described finding this consultation helpful because it identified other at-risk family members and provided them with tailored information for their relatives. Participants who expressed a preference said they favoured indirect (patient-mediated) methods of cascading as they considered indirect approaches to be less threatening to family members than direct clinical contact. We conclude that DNA screening and indirect familial cascading is perceived as highly acceptable to index patients with FH. However, while indirect cascading methods may be more acceptable to patients, they do not yield the same numbers as more direct methods. There is, therefore, a need for further systematic research to investigate patients', family members' and staff views of the acceptability of direct versus indirect methods of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost cardiomyopathies are {{familial}} diseases. <b>Cascade</b> <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> identifies asymptomatic {{patients and}} family members with early traits of disease. The inheritance is autosomal dominant in a majority of cases, and recessive, X-linked, or matrilinear in the remaining. For the last 50 years, cardiomyopathy classifications {{have been based on}} the morphofunctional phenotypes, allowing cardiologists to conveniently group them in broad descriptive categories. However, the phenotype may not always conform to the genetic characteristics, may not allow risk stratification, and may not provide pre-clinical diagnoses in the family members. Because genetic testing is now increasingly becoming a part of clinical work-up, and based on the genetic heterogeneity, numerous new names are being coined for the description of cardiomyopathies associated with mutations in different genes; a comprehensive nosology is needed that could inform the clinical phenotype and involvement of organs other than the heart, as well as the genotype and the mode of inheritance. The recently proposed MOGE(S) nosology system embodies all of these characteristics, and describes the morphofunctional phenotype (M), organ(s) involvement (O), genetic inheritance pattern (G), etiological annotation (E) including genetic defect or underlying disease/substrate, and the functional status (S) of the disease using both the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage and New York Heart Association functional class. The proposed nomenclature is supported by a web-assisted application and assists in the description of cardiomyopathy in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients {{and family members}} in the context of genetic testing. It is expected that such a nomenclature would help group cardiomyopathies on their etiological basis, describe complex genetics, and create collaborative registries...|$|R

Results We retrieved 207 questionnaires of patients aged 10. 9 +/- 4. 2 years (mean +/- SD) at diagnosis; 48 % were boys, and the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at diagnosis was 167 +/- 51 mg/dL. Of these patients, 164 (79 %) consulted a physician: a general practitioner (35 %), lipid-clinic specialist (27 %), pediatrician (21 %), internist (11 %), or another physician (6 %). LDL-C level at diagnosis and a positive family history for cardiovascular disease were independent predictors for physician consultation.

40|$|Background: Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) is {{a serious}} genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in every 300 to 500 individuals and is characterised by excessively high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, substantially increased risk of early-onset coronary heart disease (CHD) and premature mortality. If FH is untreated, it leads to a greater than 50 % risk of CHD in men {{by the age of}} 50 and at least 30 % in women by the age of 60. FH can be diagnosed through genetic screening and effectively managed through pharmacological treatment and lifestyle changes. Purpose: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic health condition that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although FH can be effectively managed with appropriate pharmacological and dietary interventions, FH detection rate through genetic screening remains low. The present study explored perceptions and experiences of FH patients (N = 18) involved in a genetic <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programme. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess patients’ knowledge and understanding of FH, explore factors linked to adherence to health-protective behaviours and examine perceptions of genetic screening. Results: Thematic analysis of interviews revealed four themes: disease knowledge, severity of FH, lifestyle behavioural change and barriers to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> and treatment. Participants recognised FH as a permanent, genetic condition that increased their risk of CHD and premature mortality. Many participants dismissed the seriousness of FH and the importance of lifestyle changes because they perceived it to be effectively managed through medication. Despite positive attitudes toward screening, many participants reported that relatives were reluctant to attend screening due to their relatives’ ‘fatalistic’ outlook or low motivation. Participants believed that they had insufficient authority or control to persuade family members to attend screening and welcomed greater hospital assistance for contact with relatives. Conclusions: Findings support the adoption of direct methods of recruitment to <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> led by medical professionals, who were perceived as having greater authority. Other implications included the need for clinicians to provide clear information, particularly to those who are asymptomatic, related to the seriousness of FH and the necessity for adherence to medication and lifestyle changes.

DNA was analyzed initially from the deceased girl using next-generation sequencing including 50 genes involved in cardiomyopathy. A <b>cascade</b> <b>family</b> <b>screening</b> was performed in the family after identification of the TNNT 2 and the BAG 3 variants in the proband. The first-degree relatives underwent clinical examination including biochemistry panel, cardiac ultrasound, Holter ECG, exercise stress test, and targeted genetic testing. The index patient presented with advanced DCM. After a severe clinical course, the baby had external left ventricular assist as a bridge to heart transplantation. 1. 5 months after transplantation, the baby suffered sudden cardiac death (SCD) despite maximal treatment in the pediatric intensive care unit. The patient was shown to carry two heterozygous genetic variants in the TNNT 2 gene [TNNT 2 c. 518 G amp;gt; A(p. Arg 173 Gln) ] and BAG 3 [BAG 3 c. 785 C amp;gt; T(p. Ala 262 Val) ]. Two of the screened individuals (two females) appeared to carry both the familial variants. All the individuals carrying the TNNT 2 variant presented with DCM, the two adult patients had mild or moderate symptoms of heart failure and reported palpitations but no syncope or presyncopal attacks prior to the genetic diagnosis. The female carriers of TNNT 2 and BAG 3 variants had more advanced DCM. In the family history, there were three additional cases of SCD due to DCM, diagnosed by autopsy, but no genetic analysis was possible in these cases. Our findings suggest that the variants in TNNT 2 and BAG 3 are associated with a high propensity to life-threatening cardiomyopathy presenting from childhood and young adulthood.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Untreated {{individuals}} with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are {{at increased risk}} of developing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a normal life expectancy. A recent survey commissioned by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reported a lack of awareness of FH in the general population. We conducted a survey to assess knowledge among healthcare professionals involved in the assessment and management of cardiovascular risk and disease in the United Kingdom. Methods A survey designed to assess knowledge of diagnostic criteria, risk assessment, the role of <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> and management options for patients with FH was distributed to 1000 healthcare professionals (response rate 44. 3 %). The same survey was redistributed following attendance at an educational session on FH. Results 151 respondents (40. 5 %) reported having patients under their care who would meet the diagnostic criteria for FH, but just 61. 4 % recognized that cardiovascular risk estimation tools cannot be applied in FH, and only 22. 3 % understood the relative risk of premature CVD compared to the general population. Similarly, just 65. 9 % were aware of recommendations regarding <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> Conclusions The prevalence and associated risk of FH continue to be underestimated, and knowledge of diagnostic criteria and treatment options is suboptimal. These results support the recent Consensus Statement of the EAS and production of quality standards by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Further work is required to formulate interventions to improve FH awareness and knowledge, and to determine the effect these interventions have on patient outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Hypercholesterolemia is an {{important}} cardiovascular risk (CV) factor that can be due to environmental or genetic causes. Identification of a young population with high CV risk allows early intervention and prevention, delaying or abolishing occurrence of CHD in adult life. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with major risk of CV events and usually results from mutations in three different genes involved in lipid metabolism such as LDLR, APOB and PCSK 9 genes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is little}} {{information}} about familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) epidemiology and care in Ibero-American countries. The Ibero-American FH network aims at reducing the gap on {{diagnosis and treatment}} of this disease in the region. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical, molecular, and organizational characteristics of FH diagnosis in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, and Uruguay. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of country data related to FH <b>cascade</b> <b>screening,</b> molecular diagnosis, clinical practice guidelines, and patient organization presence in Ibero-America. RESULTS: From a conservative estimation of an FH prevalence of 1 of 500 individuals, there should be 1. 2 million heterozygous FH individuals in Ibero-America and roughly 27, 400 were diagnosed so far. Only Spain, Brazil, Portugal, and Uruguay have active <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programs. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease ranged from 10 % to 42 % in member countries, and the highest molecular identification rates are seen in Spain, 8. 3 %, followed by Portugal, 3. 8 %, and Uruguay with 2. 5 %. In the 3 countries with more FH patients identified (Spain, Portugal, and Brazil) between 10 and 15 mutations are responsible for 30 % to 47 % of all FH cases. Spain and Portugal share 5 of the 10 most common mutations (4 in low density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR] and the APOB 3527). Spain and Spanishspeaking Latin American countries share 6 of the most common LDLR mutations and the APOB 3527. LDL apheresis is available only in Spain and Portugal and not all countries have specific FH diagnostic and treatment guidelines as well as patient organizations. CONCLUSIONS: Ibero-American countries share similar mutations and gaps in FH care. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Autosomal {{dominant}} hypercholesterolemia (ADH) {{is characterized}} by an isolated elevation of plasmatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which predisposes to premature coronary artery disease (CAD) and early death. ADH {{is largely due to}} mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR), the apolipoprotein B- 100 gene (APOB), or the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9). Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment can modify the dis-ease progression and its outcomes. Therefore, <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> protocol with a combination of plasmatic lipid measure-ments and DNA testing is used to identify relatives of index cases with a clinical diagnosis of ADH. In Tunisia, an attenu-ated phenotypic expression of ADH was previously reported, indicating that the establishment of a special screening pro-tocol is necessary for this population...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the follow-up and treatment of the mutation-carrying relatives of a proband with an inherited arrhythmia syndrome. BACKGROUND: The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals. After establishing the disease-causing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutation in probands, we actively conducted <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> to identify, most often asymptomatic, relatives who are also at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from our cardiogenetics database and patient records and analyzed whether the identified carriers received prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2008, 130 probands with a disease-causing mutation in one of the involved genes were identified, and 509 relatives tested positive for the disease-causing familial mutation. These subjects subsequently underwent cardiologic investigation (electrocardiography, exercise testing, Holter monitoring, ajmaline testing, echocardiography, where appropriate). After a mean follow-up of 69 +/- 31 months (LQTS), 60 +/- 19 months (CPVT), and 56 +/- 21 months (BrS), treatment was initiated and ongoing in 65 % (199 of 308), 71 % (85 of 120), and 6 % (5 of 81) of the relatives in the LQTS, CPVT, and BrS families, respectively. Eight carriers were lost to follow-up. Treatment included drug treatment (n = 249) or implantation of pacemakers (n = 26) or cardioverter-defibrillators (n = 14). All mutation carriers received lifestyle instructions and a list of drugs to be avoided. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cascade</b> <b>screening</b> in <b>families</b> with LQTS, BrS, or CPVT, which was based on DNA mutation carrying and subsequent cardiologic investigation, resulted in immediate prophylactic treatment in a substantial proportion of carriers, although these proportions varied significantly between the different disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} what proportion {{of cases of}} heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia would be identified by <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> conducted by a specialist hospital clinic, and by how much this would increase the prevalence of diagnosed cases. SETTING: Hospital clinic serving a population of 605, 900 in Oxfordshire, UK. METHODS: A specialist nurse obtained details of living first-degree relatives from 227 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia currently or previously attending Oxford lipid clinic after excluding 79 adults without relatives living in Oxfordshire and 48 children. Index cases were asked to invite relatives resident in Oxfordshire for testing. RESULTS: A total of 227 index cases had 1075 first-degree relatives, including 442 adults and 117 children aged < 18 years resident in Oxfordshire. We excluded 171 previously screened adults and 46 for other reasons. Among 225 eligible adult relatives, 28 responders (12 %) planned to consult their general practitioner and 52 (23 %) attended the clinic for testing. Parents of 113 children (97 %) wanted them tested. The positive diagnostic rate was 29 % (15 / 52) in adults and 32 % (36 / 113) in children. Screening increased prevalence by 14. 4 %, from 0. 58 / 1000 (95 % confidence intervals [CI] 0. 52 - 0. 65) to 0. 67 / 1000 (95 % CI 0. 60 - 0. 73), representing 33. 5 % of predicted cases. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cascade</b> <b>screening</b> conducted by a specialist hospital clinic within its population catchment area did not substantially increase the prevalence of diagnosed familial hypercholesterolaemia. To maximize response rates, clinic staff need to approach relatives directly. Validated age, sex and country-specific diagnostic criteria should be defined, possibly with access to DNA-based tests, to help resolve diagnostic uncertainty...|$|R
