We propose that these multiple modernities enroll at the principle of <b>emergency</b> <b>marked</b> by several crises and possibilities of alternatives. One such crisis pointed out here has a representational order in which the idea of 'science' undergoes a fundamental criticism, both in their epistemological, methodological practices and in their production. The paradigm of complexity goes across different fields of human production and social interaction in natural systems, where conflicts emerge at the level of production of knowledge itself (scientific and unscientific, in a situation of potential dialogue), the global culture but also located and of alternate forms of appropriation of territories and spaces of political management of the commons...|$|R

30|$|The {{outbreak}} {{continued to}} intensify, {{and the crisis}} evolved into a complex humanitarian <b>emergency,</b> <b>marked</b> by the complete breakdown of services and significant loss of human life. The response required coordinated international support beyond the capabilities of any single agency or ongoing United Nations (UN) country program and actors to address both disease transmission and the humanitarian impacts across the region (USAID 2016; Dahl et al. 2016 b). Isolation and treatment capacity was overwhelmed and routine health services ceased to function, as health care workers contracted Ebola and human and financial resources were redirected to support the response. Businesses and schools closed; airlines ceased flights into Ebola-affected countries, resulting in loss in gross domestic product of $ 2.2 billion according to the World Bank (World Bank Group 2015). Isolation of suspected case-patients impacted agricultural production; restrictions on the movement of people and goods resulted in limited labor supply, which led to worsening food insecurity (United National Development Group 2015). Significant humanitarian protection needs were identified, including {{a rise in the}} number of vulnerable children who had lost one or both parents, and stigmatization of survivors with increased reports of violence both towards survivors and humanitarian responders. Voluntary repatriation of thousands of Ivorian refugees who had fled to Liberia during civil unrest in 2010 was suspended due to the closed borders and fears of spreading Ebola (Protection and Security, Ebola in West Africa, ACAPS Briefing Note 2014).|$|R

5|$|Although the {{original}} {{purpose of the}} bombing campaign in Malaya was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving {{them out of their}} bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops. Operation Kingly Pile, which involved two sorties by No.1 Squadron and one by English Electric Canberra jet bombers of No.12 Squadron RAF on 21February 1956, was considered the most successful of the more than 4,000 missions conducted by the Lincolns, killing at least 14 communist troops. By the time it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, the squadron had dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. Its service was recognised with the presentation of a Squadron Standard by the Commander-in-Chief Far East Air Force, Air Marshal The Earl of Brandon. Until 2014, the Malayan <b>Emergency</b> had <b>marked</b> the last occasion that the unit took part in combat operations.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{does not}} have {{emergency}} exits. In case of accidents and/or fire, many safety precautions have been made. There are <b>emergency</b> phones <b>marked</b> [...] "SOS" [...] every 250 m which can contact the police, fire departments, and hospitals. Fire extinguishers have been placed every 125 m. Whenever an emergency phone in the tunnel is used or a fire extinguisher is lifted, stop lights and electronic signs reading: snu og køyr ut (turn and exit) are displayed throughout the tunnel and 2 other electronic signs {{on both sides of}} the entrance reading: tunnelen stengt (English: Tunnel closed). There are 15 turning areas which were constructed for buses and semi-trailers. In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every 500 m. There are photo inspections and counting of all vehicles that enter and exit the tunnel at security centres in Lærdal and Bergen. There is also special wiring in the tunnel for the use of radio and mobile phones. Speed cameras have been installed because of serious speeding (there are very few other completely straight roads in the region).|$|R

40|$|Catatonia in {{the setting}} of a mood disorder, an organic process, or a {{psychotic}} disorder presents significant risk to the patient’s well-being, as well as an additional barrier to treating the underlying disorder. The signs and symptoms of catatonia interfere severely with essential activities of daily living; they also at times compromise the ability of caregivers to evaluate and treat the patient’s primary disorder driving the catatonia. This interference often leads to medical <b>emergencies,</b> such as <b>marked</b> dehydration and pressure ulcers. Another life-threatening complication of the immobility commonly seen in catatonic patients is the development of deep vein thromboses (DVT) and pulmonary emboli. As with all patients, it is critical to provide preventative measures where possible to minimize risk of complications. Routine anticoagulation perhaps deserves more consideration in the case of catatonia, such as the one presented in this case report...|$|R
