During the 1972 and 1973 model years, these pickups were gradually phased out and replaced with new humbucker, twelve pole dual winding pickups.

Many owners preferred the sound of the original pickups as providing a warmer tone when compared to the tonal characteristics of the humbuckers.|$|E

Hot spots between two close silver nanoparticles {{distributed in the}} skeleton of a three-dimensional porous membrane, especially in the pores, were formed. The <b>dual</b> <b>poles</b> of micropores in the membrane were discussed. The pores could protect the silver nanoparticles in the pores from being oxidized, which makes the membrane effective {{for a longer period}} of time.

40|$|How is motion {{information}} {{that has been}} obtained through multiple viewing apertures integrated to form a global motion percept? We investigated the mechanisms of motion integration across apertures in two hemifields by presenting gratings through two rectangles (that form the <b>dual</b> barber <b>poles)</b> and recording the perceived direction of motion by human observers. To this end, we presented <b>dual</b> barber <b>poles</b> in conditions with various inter-component distances between the apertures and evaluated {{the degree to which}} the hemifield information was integrated by measuring the magnitude of the perceived barber pole illusion. Surprisingly, when the inter-component distance between the two apertures was short, the perceived direction of motion of the <b>dual</b> barber <b>poles</b> was similar to that of a single barber pole formed by the concatenation of the two component barber poles, indicating motion integration is achieved through a simple concatenation mechanism. We then presented <b>dual</b> barber <b>poles</b> in which the motion and contour properties of the two component barber poles differed to characterize the constraints underlying cross-hemifield integration. We found that integration is achieved only when phase, speed, wavelength, temporal frequency, and duty cycle are identical in the two barber poles, but can remain robust when the contrast of the two component barber poles differs substantially. We concluded that a motion stimulus presented in bilateral hemifields tends to be integrated to yield a global percept with a substantial tolerance for spatial distance and contras...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{consensus}} models of self forwarded and upheld {{in the fields of}} discourse most concerned with its description, indicate a process of ventriloquism where agency slips between <b>dual</b> <b>poles</b> of body and mind and cannot be tracked to a hiding place. Just as with ventriloquism, in these models of self it is unclear who is doing the 'talking', and the skill of performance would seem to make the distinction almost redundant. The self seems a complicity of often conflicting agents when analysed as its constituent parts, and not there at all when viewed as a whole. This thesis takes as its starting point the confusion of Edgar Bergen when struggling to justify his philosophical conversations with his dummy: who is at work here, and where would agency reside in such a dialogue? That it serves us to assume the 'theory of mind' explanation for the behaviours of others, and by extension place ourselves within a scaffold of causal motives, says more for the use value of such a theory than for the presence of 'mind'. Why this 'theory of mind' rather than any other? Because that is how mind and motive are presented to us during our acquisition of a spoken language. Mediation, transformation and referral: this thesis {{argues that the}}se are qualities which characterize ventriloquism, and also the human means of perception and self-perception. There are a number of unfulfilled potentialities that reach their heaven in the unified self. The 'drive' to unity culls these lost futures and condemns us to another fulfilment, that of'oneness'. Most of these resolutions regarding self are predicated on what is 'in' and what is 'out'; how does the discriminatory self establish grounds for inclusivity or exclusivity? This thesis means to provide a lexicon of other possibilities regarding the conceptualization of self. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} organizational identity construction with a dualities perspective. By taking a dualities perspective the focus shifts from assuming that organizational identity actually {{is in place}} towards organizational identity construction where identities are socially constructed. A dualities perspective is very suitable for studying family business where family and business are seen as interdependent and interconnected forming a duality. Family business is an identity statement. Family business identities are constructed by stakeholders by managing a set of dualities. Dualities cause tensions because of the <b>dual</b> <b>poles.</b> These tensions need to be balanced in order to draw on both poles and maintain the family business identities. In an empirical study of two media organizations dualities of informality/formality, independence-dependence, historic paths-new paths, and commercial-journalistic are used to understand how stakeholders balance the tensions in these dualities and thereby construct organizational identities. The study reveals {{the central role of}} owning family members in organizational identity construction. It is important to balance interests between owning family members and generations. Otherwise it is possible that tensions develop between owners which can endanger the organization. The dualities perspective broadens studies on organizational identity construction as it accounts for the peculiarities of family businesses. I argue that these dualities are basis for constructing organizational identities that require stakeholders to work with managing the inherent tensions in the dualities. This means that owning family members and organizational members are continuously involved in constructing organizational identities when managing the dualities. For the organizational identity literature, the study offers a focus on the processes of organizational identity construction in the most common business organization, i. e. family businesses. Owning families play an eminent role in processes of organizational identity construction which future research should consider. Owning family members can initiate or trigger organizational identity construction processes because they are considered as role models by other stakeholders. Based on my findings I recommend owning families to consider that being a family business is an identity statement implying that other stakeholders will consider them as role model whether they like it or not. Therefore owning family members should devote attention to manage dualities and balance inherent tensions. Then being a family business can be advantageous because they can draw on both family and business dimensions...|$|R

5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a <b>dual</b> invasion—by the <b>Poles</b> along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|R
40|$|We compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) of {{the metric}} and gauge field {{perturbations}} about black branes electrically and magnetically {{charged in the}} Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. By the gauge/gravity correspondence, this theory is dual to a particular class of field theories with a chiral anomaly, in a thermal charged plasma state subjected to a constant external magnetic field, $B$. The QNMs are <b>dual</b> to the <b>poles</b> of the two-point functions of the energy-momentum and axial current operators, and they encode information about the dissipation and transport of charges in the plasma. Complementary to the gravity calculation, we work out the hydrodynamic description of the dual field theory {{in the presence of}} a chiral anomaly, and a constant external $B$. We find good agreement with the weak field hydrodynamics, which can extend beyond the weak $B$ regime into intermediate regimes. Furthermore, we provide results that can be tested against thermodynamics and hydrodynamics in the strong $B$ regime. We find QNMs exhibiting Landau level behavior, which become long-lived at large $B$ if the anomaly coefficient exceeds a critical magnitude. Chiral transport is analyzed beyond the hydrodynamic approximation for the five (formerly) hydrodynamic modes, including a chiral magnetic wave.

40|$|Axial flux {{machines}} {{may give}} higher power-to weight ratios than conventional radial flux machines. As the axial flux machine {{can easily be}} constructed with a multi-rotor configuration, it is well suited for ironless stator design, which has gained interest in the latest years due {{to the development of}} high remanent flux density permanent magnets. In addition to the reduced eddy current losses and weight of the stator itself, an ironless design eliminates the magnetic forces acting on the stator, so that the necessity of a heavy stator frame is reduced. Several winding topologies exist for ironless stators, and it can be interesting to compare these with each other. For this purpose, an ironless axial flux 110 <b>pole</b> <b>dual</b> rotor permanent magnet machine with easily exchangeable stator has been made. This machine allows preliminary tests on different stator designs before more expensive prototypes are built. As all active parts of the machine are visible, it may also serve as a demonstration model for electro-mechanical energy conversion. Simulations done on a single-layer 3 -level-endturn winding with q= 6 / 5 shows an induced voltage of 40. 22 V at 50 Hz. This corresponds well with measurements done on a stator segment covering 2 / 11 of the machine. The measured DC resistance of this segment is equivalent of 2. 51 &# 937; for a complete stator, which even though somewhat less than calculated, is rather large due to long endturns compared to the radial length of the conductors. The measured inductance of the segment equals self and mutual inductances of about 0. 55 &# 956;H and 0. 275 &# 956;H for a complete stator, which is significantly less than calculated. </p...|$|R
