Due to its state-dependent feature, the coupling influence of <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> normal stress and density of soil sample on the strain localization are studied. The numerical predictions show that the orientation of shear band is strongly related to <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> normal stress and material density.

40|$|An energy-injecting virtual-mass (EIVM) {{resonant}} column {{system was}} employed to investigate the small strain behavior of dry sand; {{and the effects of}} <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> normal stress, density of soil samples, amplitude of shear strain, as well as number of loading cycles on shear modulus and damping ratio are studied. The test results show that the shear modulus increases with <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> normal stress and soil density, while the damping ratio exhibits the opposite response. Moreover, the effects of <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> normal stress on the small strain behavior of dry sand are more than those of soil density. As the shear strain increases, the shear modulus become smaller; but the damping ratio become larger.

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{system matrix}} {{is required for}} quantitative proton CT (pCT) image reconstruction with iterative projection algorithms. The system matrix is composed of chord lengths of individual proton path intersections with reconstruction pixels. In previous work, reconstructions were performed assuming constant intersection chord lengths, which led to systematic errors of the reconstructed proton stopping powers. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to introduce a computationally efficient variable intersection chord length in order to improve the accuracy of the system matrix. An analytical expression that takes into account the discrete stepping nature of the pCT most likely path (MLP) reconstruction procedure was created to describe an angle-dependent <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> chord length function. A pCT dataset was simulated with GEANT 4 using a parallel beam of 200 MeV protons intersecting a computerized head phantom consisting of tissue-equivalent materials with known relative stopping power. The phantom stopping powers were reconstructed with the constant chord length, exact chord length, and <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> chord length approaches, in combination with the algebraic reconstruction technique. Relative stopping power errors were calculated for each anatomical phantom region and compared for the various methods. It was found that the error of approximately 10 % in the mean reconstructed stopping power value for a given anatomical region, resulting from a system matrix with a constant chord length, could be reduced to less than 0. 5 % with either the <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> chord length or exact chord length approaches. Reconstructions with the <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> chord length were found to be approximately 20 % faster than reconstructions with an exact chord length. The <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> chord length method provides the possibility for more accurate, computationally efficient quantitative pCT reconstructions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} he {{influence of}} stress on permeability anisotropy during mechanical compaction, {{a series of}} triaxial compression experiments with a new loading configuration called hybrid compression were conducted on three porous sandstones. The <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> and differential stresses in hybrid compression tests were identical to those in conventional triaxial extension tests. Permeability was measured along the axial direction in both hybrid compression and conventional extension tests, which corresponds to flow along the maximum principal stress direction in the former case and the minimum principal stress direction in the latter case. Since their loading paths coincide, the comparison of permeability values from {{the two types of}} tests provides quantitative estimates of the development of permeability anisotropy as a function of <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> and differential stresses. Our data show that the permeability evolution is primarily controlled by stress. Before the onset of shear-enhanced compaction C*, permeability and porosity reduction are solely controlled by the <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> stress, with negligible stress-induced anisotropy. With the onset of shear-enhanced compaction and initiation of cataclastic flow, the deviatoric stress induces enhanced permeability and porosity reduction.

40|$|Heat flux {{inhibition}} by electromagnetic instabilities {{in a hot}} magnetized plasma is investigated. Low-frequency {{electromagnetic waves}} become unstable due to anisotropy of the electron distribution function. The chaotic magnetic field thus generated scatters the electrons with a specific <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> free path. Saturation of the instability due to wave-wave interaction, nonlinear scattering, wave propagation, and collisional damping is considered. The <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> free path is found self-consistently, using a simple model to estimate saturation level and scattering, and is shown to decrease with the temperature gradient length. The results, limited to the assumptions of the model, are applied to astrophysical systems. For some interstellar clouds the instability {{is found to be}} important. Collisional damping stabilizes the plasma, and the heat conduction can be dominated by superthermal electrons...|$|R

5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air.

5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E

For {{each of the}} three soils, the results indicated a highly significant linear increase in S and a consequency exponential decrease in r, , and D with increase of R. The effects of Jalma on these parameters were more marked on the loamy sand than on the other two soil samples. 	Addition of 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 6 % Jalma to the loamy sand sample significantly reduced by about 19, 55, 83, and 98 %, respectively, and D by about 38, 76, 96, and 100 %, respectively. The highest rate almost compelety sealed the soil independent of its texture and reduced D to almost zero. We concluded that 0. 4 % Jalma is the optimum rate for soil water conservation. We argue that Jalma addition causes swelling of the soil matrix, reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> pore radius, and consequently reduces and D. The <b>effective</b> <b>mean</b> pore radius proved to be a reliable predictor of D and  of the soil samples studied independent of their texture:  = 2. 548 r (r = 0. 960), and D = 3. 303 r (r = 0. 958) ...|$|R
