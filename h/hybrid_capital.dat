40|$|Abstract. There {{is a large}} {{class of}} {{infinite}} horizon financial in-struments which incorporates elements of both debt and equity, collectively denoted ”hybrid capital”. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has devised the fundamental requirements for how <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> may qualify {{as a part of}} core (”Tier 1 ”) regu-latory capital for banks. We present valuation models for <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> in the set-up of Black and Cox (1976) and Leland (1994) and derive new valuation formulas incorporating these special fea-tures. In particular, we take into account the issuer’s right to omit hybrid coupon payments and to call the <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> at par value starting from a given date. In doing so, we build on formulas de-veloped in Mjøs and Persson (2005). We show that <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> actually carry risk and clarify interesting links between their valu-ation and overall corporate capital structure as guidance both for market participants and regulators alike. 1...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} within the European regulatory environment, namely the Solvency II regime, causes complex challenges the European insurance industry has to cope with. One of those affects capital structure decisions as sufficient regulatory capital {{has to be}} provided to meet the stringent capital requirements. Hence, insurance companies aim for an efficient as well as, from a regulatory point of view, complying capital structure. In this context, <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> is an increasingly embraced funding source offering attractive features and opportunities. The field of <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> is not sufficiently researched yet, in particular not {{with regards to the}} insurance industry. For this reason, the goal {{of this study is to}} fill an existing research gap that concerns the impact of <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> on performance. Empirical evidence from the European insurance market is the basis for answering the research question which asks for whether the degree of <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> endowment has an impact on insurance companies’ performance. For this purpose, the investigation builds upon a six-year time frame (2009 - 2014) and a population that comprises 39 listed European insurance companies. Several criteria are defined in order to establish a population that allows the authors to conduct this study properly. In addition, two sub-populations are derived in order to extend the investigations. While the first sub-population consists of 22 insurance companies that are headquartered in one of the three largest European (re-) insurance markets, the second one involves 18 insurance companies that are headquartered in a European non-EURO country. In order to examine the correlation between the degree of <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> endowment and performance, different performance indicators are considered and statistically analysed through panel data regression models, namely the fixed effects, random effects and ordinary least square model. Additionally, likelihood ratio tests are performed to reinforce the results. The majority of the outcomes do not reveal the existence of any correlation. However, a negative correlation is observable with regards to the return on assets. This applies for main as well as the two sub-populations. Ultimately, the authors are able to answer the research question in the affirmative and demonstrate that the traditional theories of capital structure are poorly applicable to <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Banks {{and other}} {{financial}} institutions issue <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> {{as part of their}} risk capital. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> has no maturity, but, similarly to most corporate debt, includes an embedded issuer's call option. To obtain acceptance as risk capital, the first possible exercise date of the embedded call is contractually deferred by several years, generating a protection period. We value the call feature as a European option on perpetual defaultable debt. We do this by first modifying the underlying asset process to incorporate a time-dependent bankruptcy level before the expiration of the embedded option. We identify a call option on debt as a fixed number of put options on a modified asset, which is lognormally distributed, as opposed to the market value of debt. To include the possibility of default before the expiration of the option we apply barrier options results.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a model is {{developed}} for valuing risky perpetual debt with an embedded American call option {{that can be}} exercised after a protection period. These features are relevant for a <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> instrument typically issued by banks and other financial institutions, partly as an outcome of regulatory requirements. There exist a large market for this instrument, the outstanding amount of <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> securities was $ 376 billion in 2005 (Mjøs and Persson, 2007).

Market practice indicates that this <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> instrument is issued with an American option and a step-up coupon rate, in this sense the model developed in this thesis is more realistic than Mjøs and Persson’s model because it incorporates these characteristics.

First, we assume that risk changes depend on the ex ante regulatory capital position of banks (highly capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, moderately undercapitalized, and strongly undercapitalized). Second, we consider the impact {{of an increase in}} each component of regulatory capital (equity, subordinated debt, <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital)</b> on banks ’ risk changes. We find that, for highly and adequately capitalized banks as well as for strongly undercapitalized banks, an increase in equity or in subordinated debt is associated with an increase in risk. Moderately undercapitalized banks tend to invest in less risky assets when they improve their capital standards by issuing equity. Conversely, an increase in subordinated debt or <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> is associated with an increase in risk. Our findings also highlight that strongly undercapitalized banks increase their risk whatever the type of capital they use to improve their standards suggesting that such banks might be “gambling for resurrection”. On the whole, our conclusions support the policy recommendations for a narrow definition of regulatory capital with a closer focus on core capital than on other hybrid instruments.

Banks closer to the regulatory limit {{are less likely to}} finance their growth based only on debt issuances compared with banks with a capital buffer over the minimum because this financing would deteriorate their capital ratio even more. In this case, we expect that the coefficient of this variable will be negative for the issuances of debt and/or positive for the issuances of instruments considered regulatory capital. If the pecking order holds, we should observe a positive and statistically significant sign only in hybrid issuances, whereas the statistical significance of both <b>hybrid</b> and <b>capital</b> instruments would support the trade-off theory.|$|R
30|$|From Table  3, the {{coefficients}} for the variables Loans/Deposits and Assets growth rate show that banks with liquidity needs {{are more likely to}} issue debt to finance their growth, but they do not directly affect the issuance of <b>hybrid</b> or <b>capital</b> instruments. This means that the exponential growth in banks’ balance sheets observed in Fig.  1 is largely financed with issuances of debt, which would be consistent with the pecking order theory. As for ROA, high profits negatively affect the issuance of hybrid instruments but not debt or capital. While this is consistent with lower liquidity needs, this result could also be explained by a lower need to issue capital instruments to comply with the Basel ratio because the retained earnings compute as Tier I capital.|$|R
30|$|Related to {{the access}} to {{financial}} markets, we find a positive and significant coefficient on the variable ln Assets for debt and hybrid instruments. We also find that banks with a past issuance of an instrument that is now maturing at time t, Maturity Past Issuances, {{are more likely to}} issue debt to rollover. The fact of having previously issued in financial markets, Issuer in the Past, does not seem to positively affect the probability of issuing any type of financial instrument. Finally, we also find that, ceteris paribus, cajas are more likely to issue debt, which is consistent with Almazán et al. (2015). The effect of being a caja does not affect the probability of issuing either <b>hybrid</b> or <b>capital</b> instruments.|$|R
40|$|Contingent {{convertible}} capital instruments (CoCos) are <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> securities that absorb losses {{when the}} capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level. In this article, we go over the structure of CoCos, trace the evolution of their issuance, and examine their pricing in primary and secondary markets. CoCo issuance is primarily driven by their potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. The bulk of the demand for CoCos has come from small investors, while institutional investors have been relatively restrained so far. The spreads of CoCos over other subordinated debt greatly depend on their two main design characteristics – the trigger level and the loss absorption mechanism. CoCo spreads are more correlated with the spreads of other subordinated debt than with CDS spreads and equity prices. JEL classification: G 12, G 21, G 28. Private investors are usually reluctant to provide additional external capital to banks in times of financial distress. In extremis, the government can end up injecting capital to prevent the disruptive insolvency of a large financial institution because nobody else is willing to do so. Such public sector support costs taxpayers and distorts the incentives of bankers. Contingent convertible capital instruments (CoCos) offer a way to address this problem. CoCos are <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> securities that absorb losses in accordance with their contractual terms when {{the capital of}} the issuing bank falls below a certain level. 2 Then debt is reduced and bank capitalisation gets a boost.

30|$|We {{find that}} {{information}} asymmetries {{can explain the}} choice of debt/hybrid instruments by banks. That is, banks decide to issue the market instrument that more resembles debt {{in order to minimize}} the adverse selection discount. This decision can explain why banks finance growth with debt and raise <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> instead of common equity if they are close to the regulatory minimum or have low levels of provisions or earnings that compute as eligible capital. We find little support for the trade-off theory because banks do not seem to target an optimal level of capital structure during the sample period because liquidity and capital needs are covered with debt and hybrid instruments. Additional evidence in support of the asymmetric information theory is that only banks better known by investors can issue common equity without suffering a discount due to informational asymmetries.|$|E

It therefore involves choices between the different sources of capital such as debt, equity and <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital.</b> The different sources of finance available to companies are also influenced by the quality and maturity of the financial system and the overall risk of operating in that environment.

We consider the ratio of the nonperforming loans as a proxy for the risk in the bank’s assets. Thus, we expect that banks will be more (less) likely to issue <b>hybrid</b> and/or common <b>capital</b> (debt) issuances as the ratio increases.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the effect}} on the pure {{decision}} of issuing versus not issuing, we analyze which instruments banks choose to respond to liquidity needs. If the decision on the instrument follows the pecking order, banks would only issue debt instruments to minimize the cost of asymmetric information and, therefore, the liquidity and growth variables would only be significant for debt issuances. If the decision on the instruments follows the trade-off theory, we should observe significant coefficients in all financial instruments because the banks have to combine the issuances of all types of financial instruments to maintain the same proportion of each component. This result could be consistent with the fulfillment of capital regulation, if banks issue both <b>hybrid</b> and <b>capital</b> instruments to keep their regulatory capital levels constant. Nonetheless, if the issuances of eligible capital instruments are meant to fulfill capital regulation at the lowest possible cost, we could observe issuances of debt and hybrid instruments only, but not capital instruments.|$|R

The explanatory variables are the same as in the multinomial logit that were explained in Sect.  3.2. For columns (1), (2), and (3), the dependent variable is the log of the amount issued in the form of debt, <b>hybrid,</b> or <b>capital</b> instruments, respectively. For Column (4), the dependent variable is the log of the total amount of funds issued under any form of financial instrument.|$|R
30|$|The {{coefficients}} for Loan Loss Reserves/Loans show that loan loss reserves {{act as a}} substitute for capital issuances: banks with higher LLR are less likely to issue <b>hybrid</b> <b>capital</b> and core capital, whereas it does not affect the probability of issuing debt. Furthermore, the NPL ratio shows that banks with higher risk tend to issue less debt and more capital, but it does not affect the issuance of hybrid instruments. These results indicate that banks with higher risks are more likely to issue capital instruments to absorb losses, although this effect is mitigated if they have accumulated sufficient LLR to absorb such losses. Thus, we find partial evidence that banks can respond with high-quality capital issuances to compensate for the risk embedded in their loan portfolios. However, given the evidence presented in Fig.  3, this is not enough to compensate for the deterioration in regulatory capital.|$|E
