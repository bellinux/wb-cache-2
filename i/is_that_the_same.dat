5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E

The Zachman Framework provides the thirty-six necessary categories for completely describing anything; especially complex things like manufactured goods (e.g., appliances), constructed structures (e.g., buildings), and enterprises (e.g., the organization {{and all of its}} goals, people, and technologies). The framework provides six different transformations of an abstract idea (not increasing in detail, but transforming) from six different perspectives.|$|E

For learning to recognize images, it is greatly beneficial to factor out these variations. It results in much simpler classification problem and, consequently, in great reduction of sample complexity of the model.|$|E
25|$|The bailout valve (BOV) is an {{open circuit}} demand valve built into a rebreather {{mouthpiece}} or {{other part of the}} breathing loop. It can be isolated while the diver is using the rebreather to recycle breathing gas and opened {{while at the same time}} isolating the breathing loop when a problem causes the diver to bail out onto open circuit. The main distinguishing feature of the BOV <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mouthpiece is used for open and closed-circuit, and the diver does not have to shut the Dive/Surface valve, remove it from their mouth, and find and insert the bailout demand valve in order to bail out onto open circuit. Although costly, this reduction in critical steps makes the integrated BOV a significant safety advantage.|$|E

2500|$|In {{respect of}} {{constant}} resistance filters, the term half section has {{a somewhat different}} meaning to other kinds of image filter. [...] Generally, a half section is formed by cutting through {{the midpoint of the}} series impedance and shunt admittance of a full section of a ladder network. [...] It is literally half a section. [...] Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. [...] A half section is either the series impedance (series half-section) or shunt admittance (shunt half-section) that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. [...] The purpose of using half sections <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count.|$|E

Also of possible relevance <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> William Danby would have been responsible for authorizing exactly what was to happen to Penry's corpse. Those who reject the theory claim that there would have been far too many obvious signs that the corpse had been hanged for it to have been used in this way, although Marlovians say that Danby, being solely in charge, would have been able quite easily to ensure that such evidence remained hidden from the jury.|$|E

[...] By early 1831 the Leon Academy was {{under the control of the}} Tallahassee City Council. [...] The Leon Academy was incorporated by an act of the Territorial Legislative Council on February 12, 1831 under the control of seven trustees. [...] The Leon Academy suffered from lack of financial resources as well as high administrative turnover and in September 1836 was operated by John M. Brook of Virginia as a [...] "private Seminary for boys", while the trustees continued to control and manage the property. [...] By 1840 the Leon Academy ceased operations as a public school. [...] The trustees, however, turned to the Territorial Legislature once again, who passed an [...] "Act in Relation to the Trustees of Leon Academy" [...] in 1840 wherein the Treasurer of the Territory was directed to pay funds to the trustees to [...] "assist said Trustees in building an Academy". [...] On March 9, 1840 the Leon Academy had been refreshed with some Territory support. [...] The trustees solicited Territory support on the basis the Leon Academy would serve both male and female students. [...] There is disagreement among scholars if the male-only Leon Academy is the forerunner of the West Florida Seminary.
