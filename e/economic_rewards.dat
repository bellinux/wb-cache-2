2500|$|On taking office, Roosevelt {{reassured}} many conservatives, stating, [...] "the {{mechanism of}} modern business is so delicate that extreme {{care must be}} taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance." [...] The following year, Roosevelt asserted the president's independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the Northern Securities Company, and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker J.P. Morgan. In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite its close ties to the Republican Party. Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century laissez-faire economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, <b>economic</b> <b>rewards.</b> Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution. His Square Deal domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection. The Square Deal evolved into his program of [...] "New Nationalism", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} to self-generate mental content that is {{unrelated to the}} current environment is a fundamental characteristic of the mind, and the current experiment explored how this experience {{is related to the}} decisions that people make in daily life. We examined how task-unrelated thought (TUT) varies with the length of time participants are willing to wait for an <b>economic</b> <b>reward,</b> as measured using an inter-temporal discounting task. When participants performed a task requiring minimal attention, the greater {{the amount of time spent}} engaged in TUT the longer the individual was prepared to wait for an <b>economic</b> <b>reward.</b> These data indicate that self-generated thought engages processes associated with the successful management of long-term goals.

40|$|Very recently, we are {{witnessing}} {{the emergence of a}} number of start-ups that enables individuals to sell their private data directly to brokers and businesses. While this new paradigm may shift the balance of power between individuals and companies that harvest data, it raises some practical, fundamental questions for users of these services: how they should decide which data must be vended and which data protected, and what a good deal is. In this work, we investigate a mechanism that aims at helping users address these questions. The investigated mechanism relies on a hard-privacy model and allows users to share partial or complete profile data with broker companies in exchange for an <b>economic</b> <b>reward.</b> The theoretical analysis of the trade-off between privacy and money posed by such mechanism is the object of this work. We adopt a generic measure of privacy although part of our analysis focuses on some important examples of Bregman divergences. We find a parametric {{solution to the problem of}} optimal exchange of privacy for money, and obtain a closed-form expression and characterize the trade-off between profile-disclosure risk and <b>economic</b> <b>reward</b> for several interesting cases.

40|$|Biased {{information}} processing has been highlighted {{as a possible}} vulnerability factor for sleep problems. A theory states that perceived sleeplessness triggers a strong approach motivation (or craving) for sleep, and then activates persistent preoccupation with sleep. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence that perceived sleeplessness is associated with such a motivation toward sleep-related information. Thus, we examined the untested idea that people with subjective sleep disturbances would prefer sleep-related topics, using {{a modified version of the}} pay-per-view task. In this task, 58 participants were offered two question-type options: the “sleep” option, where participants were asked to answer a question about their sleep, and the “eat” option, where participants needed to answer a question about their eating habits and beliefs. Each option is associated with a variable amount of <b>economic</b> <b>reward</b> and therefore participants sometimes face a conflict between the <b>economic</b> <b>reward</b> and their intrinsic preference for a specific question type. Results showed that people with higher levels of subjective sleep disturbances forgo greater amounts of reward to have an opportunity to answer sleep-related (as opposed to than eating-related) questions. These findings suggest that people who perceive themselves as lacking sleep are highly motivated to engage in sleep-related {{information processing}}. status: publishe...|$|R
