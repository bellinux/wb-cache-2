5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk.</b> In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E
25|$|In July 1991, {{following}} a scandal involving secret government funding to the Inkatha Freedom Party and other {{opponents of the}} African National Congress, President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> removed Malan from his influential post of defence minister and appointed him minister for water affairs and forestry.|$|E
50|$|He entered {{politics}} in 1987 as an MP, serving as Minister of Local Government in President <b>F</b> <b>W</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerks</b> government.|$|R
25|$|Botha {{remained}} largely {{out of sight}} of the media and it was widely believed that he remained opposed to many of <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> reforms.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Mandela {{divorced}} {{his estranged}} wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Thabo Mbeki became the sole deputy president of South Africa in June {{as a result}} of <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> resignation from joint office.|$|R

From 1910 to 1984 Rhodes' house in Cape Town, Groote Schuur, was the official Cape residence of the Prime Ministers of South Africa and continued as a presidential residence of P. W. Botha and <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>De</b> <b>Klerk.</b>|$|E
25|$|After Nelson Mandela {{was freed}} {{from prison in}} 1990 and {{negotiated}} the dissolution of apartheid with President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk,</b> Tutu became {{a supporter of the}} new government. Mandela selected Tutu to chair the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned on other social justice issues; combating poverty, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis, as well as opposition to forms of prejudice like racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.|$|E
25|$|In late 2011 the ANC {{was heavily}} criticised over {{the passage of}} the Protection of State Information Bill, which opponents claimed would {{improperly}} restrict the freedom of the press. Opposition to the bill included otherwise ANC-aligned groups such as COSATU. Notably, Nelson Mandela and other Nobel laureates Nadine Gordimer, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> have expressed disappointment with the bill for not meeting standards of constitutionality and aspirations for freedom of information and expression.|$|E
50|$|Louis Pienaar (26 June 1926 - 5 November 2012) was a South African {{lawyer and}} diplomat. He {{was the last}} white {{administrator}} of South-West Africa, from 1985 through Namibian independence in 1990. Pienaar later served as a minister in <b>F</b> <b>W</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> government until 1993.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, on {{his return}} to South Africa, Louis Pienaar was {{nominated}} to be Minister of Education in President <b>F</b> <b>W</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> government where {{he was responsible for}} the dismantling of the structures of apartheid.

25|$|Political leaders {{soon began}} to use the annual meeting as a neutral platform. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn {{back from the brink}} of war. In 1992, South African President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint {{appearance}} outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat reached a draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho.|$|E
25|$|Others, such as Hillary and Stephen Rose in Nature (2002), {{make the}} {{comparison}} and argue for an academic boycott of Israel {{based on a}} belief that the academic boycott of South Africa was effective in ending apartheid. George Fink responds (Nature 2002) that asserting that the boycott of South Africa by the world's academic communities 'was instrumental in ending apartheid in South Africa' is a deception and was actually terminated by two pivotal and interrelated political events: strict economic sanctions on South Africa imposed by the United States Congress in 1986 and measures by South Africa president <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> in 1989 and 1990.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 1989, Botha (then aged 73) {{suffered}} a mild stroke which {{prevented him from}} attending a meeting with Namibian political leaders on 20 January 1989. Botha's place was taken by acting president, J. Christiaan Heunis. On 2 February 1989, Botha resigned {{as leader of the}} National Party (NP) anticipating his nominee – finance minister Barend du Plessis – would succeed him. Instead, the NP's parliamentary caucus selected as leader education minister <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk,</b> who moved quickly to consolidate his position within the party. In March 1989, the NP elected De Klerk as state president but Botha refused to resign, saying in a television address that the constitution entitled him to remain in office until March 1990 and that he was even considering running for another five-year term. Following a series of acrimonious meetings in Cape Town, and five days after UNSCR 435 was implemented in Namibia on 1 April 1989, Botha and De Klerk reached a compromise: Botha would retire after the parliamentary elections in September, allowing de Klerk to take over as president.|$|E

50|$|The {{day after}} <b>F</b> <b>W</b> <b>De</b> <b>Klerk's</b> {{landmark}} announcement that the African National Congress (ANC) {{and other political}} organisations would be unbanned and Nelson Mandela would be released from prison, {{a small group of}} Capetonians took to the streets in an act of guerrilla street theatre. The Rainbow Nation Peace Ritual as it eventually came to be known, was actually planned some ten days before the announcement by the Rainbow People's Party and the ritual, march, celebration or carnival, call it what you will, involved children as well as innocent bystanders who were taken by surprise.|$|R
50|$|The 22nd Parliament of the Republic of South Africa {{was elected}} in the {{elections}} of 27 April 1994; {{it was the first}} parliament in South Africa's history to be elected by voters of all races. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress formed a government of national unity with <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> National Party and Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. The three racially based houses from previous parliaments were replaced with the re-introduced Senate and National Assembly. In 1997, on the introduction of the final Constitution, the Senate was replaced by the National Council of Provinces, which continues to serve as the upper house of South Africa's Parliament.|$|R
25|$|Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress, {{its primary}} mission was give voting rights to black and mixed race Africans and, from the 1940s, to end Apartheid. The ANC {{originally}} attempted to use nonviolent protests to end apartheid, however, the Sharpeville massacre {{resulted in the}} deaths of 69 black Africans and contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government. On 8 April 1960, the administration of Charles Robberts Swart, banned the ANC and forced the party to leave South Africa. After the ban, the ANC formed the Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilizing guerrilla warfare and sabotage. On 3 February 1990, State President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela on 11 February 1990. On 17 March 1992, the apartheid referendum was passed by the voters removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election. Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 60% in all general elections, including the most recent 2014 election.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> {{began the}} {{negotiation}} process {{that was to}} lead to the end of apartheid in 1994. At the time, South Africa was plagued by regular massacres as members of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) fought for dominance. The police and security forces often reacted to demonstrations with indiscriminate force, and the ANC claimed that a hypothesised [...] "Third Force" [...] was engaged in covert destabilisation. The violence caused serious problems in building trust between the parties.|$|E

In early 1998, when Botha refused to testify at the Mandela government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he was supported by the right-wing Conservative Party, which had earlier contested his rule as the official opposition.

2500|$|Chas. W.

W. Botha's successor, <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>De</b> <b>Klerk,</b> in the direction of releasing Mandela and opening the political process to black South African participation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{proclamation}} {{of the new}} national flag by South African President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk</b> was only published on 20 April 1994, a mere seven days before the flag was to be inaugurated, sparking a frantic last-minute flurry for flag manufacturers. As stated in South Africa's post-apartheid interim constitution, the flag was to be introduced on an interim probationary period of five years, after which there would be discussion {{about whether or not}} to change the national flag in the final draft of the constitution. The Constitutional Assembly was charged with the responsibility of drafting the country’s new constitution and had called for submissions, inter alia, on the issues of its various national symbols. [...] It received 118 submissions recommending the retention of the new flag and 35 suggesting changes to it. [...] Thus on 28 September 1995 it decided that the flag should be retained unchanged and accordingly it was included as Section One of the Constitution of South Africa which came into force in February 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Schwarz {{has been}} {{credited}} as having played {{one of the}} leading roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations. The Cape Times described Schwarz as having [...] "engineered a state of US/South Africa relations better than it has ever been”. The fact that Schwarz, for decades a well known anti-apartheid figurehead, was willing to accept the position was widely acknowledged as a highly symbolic demonstration of President <b>F.</b> <b>W</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> determination to introduce a new democratic system. During Schwarz's tenure, he negotiated the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa, secured a $600 million aid package from President Bill Clinton, signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991 and hosted President Mandela's state visit to the US in October 1994.|$|R
50|$|After the 1987 elections, the new PFP leader Zach de Beer {{concluded}} {{negotiations with}} the IP and the NDM to merge into the Democratic Party in 1989, and proceeded to win 36 seats in the elections that year.

In 1991 Harry Schwarz, one of the party's founders and most prominent leaders was appointed South African Ambassador to the United States, the first opposition member to become an ambassador in South African history. In the 1994 general election, the first after apartheid was abolished, the party won only 1.7% of the vote and 10 seats in parliament.

50|$|Chris Hani {{was assassinated}} on 10 April 1993 outside {{his home in}} Dawn Park, a racially mixed suburb of Boksburg. He was accosted by a Polish far-right anti-communist {{immigrant}} named Janusz Waluś, who {{shot him in the}} head and back as he stepped out of his car. Waluś fled the scene, but was arrested soon afterwards after Hani's neighbour, a white Afrikaner woman, called the police. Clive Derby-Lewis, a senior South African Conservative Party M.P. and Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs at the time, who had lent Waluś his pistol, was also arrested for complicity in Hani's murder. The Conservative Party of South Africa (Konserwatiewe Party van Suid-Afrika) had broken away from the ruling National Party out of opposition to the reforms of P.W. Botha.

[...] "I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people." [...] A comment in the Boston Herald, typified the reaction among much of the US press: [...] "When a man who has devoted most of his life to the struggle for a new South Africa tells you that apartheid is dead and that sanctions are holding up its burial, he speaks with a moral authority that is difficult to assail." [...] The fact that Schwarz, a well known and respected anti-apartheid leader was willing to accept the post was widely acknowledged in South Africa as a further demonstration of President <b>F.</b> <b>W</b> <b>de</b> <b>Klerk's</b> determination to introduce a new democratic system.|$|R

Harry Schwarz, who served as South African Ambassador to the United States during its transition to representative democracy (1991-1994), has been credited as having played {{one of the leading}} roles in the renewal of relations between the two nations.

40|$|With President <b>F.</b> <b>W.</b> <b>De</b> <b>Klerk's</b> {{speech of}} 2 February 1990, and the {{dramatic}} changes subsequently evident in South African politics, many scholars have aptly turned {{their eyes on}} the state. If a transition towards some form of majority rule is at hand, as most observers believe, the questions are: what is the condition of the state to be inherited by the new governors, and how did it acquire this condition? We know, for example, that the state has almost 1. 7 million employees, more than 1 million of whom are black (SAIRR, 1989 : 395 - 7), and who work in sectors known as the central, provincial, local and homeland authorities and the semi-state. Also known are some of the process affecting these employees, ranging from regulations governing service (dating back to the Staatsdiens en Pensioenwet of 1912) to the enduring imperial tendencies of the central authorities and, more recently, policies of privatisation. But perhaps the best-known process is the afrikanerisation of the state, occurring through most of the twentieth century and especially after the (Purified) National Party Victory of 1948. The discussion, first, identifies beliefs and habits members of the bureaucratic elite acquired during their ascent through Afrikanerdom and, second, analyses the attempt to institutionalise these beliefs and habits within the state. This article is thus about the actions of an Afrikaner bureaucratic elite, ensconced in leading positions in all sectors of the state over at least the last forty years...|$|R
