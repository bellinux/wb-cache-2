40|$|Traditional <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> systems {{always have}} a {{conflict}} with natural ones, i. e., rivers in cities are usually straight and smooth, whereas natural ones are according to ecological mechanisms. Social and economic developments {{in the modern world}} require a new system combining ecological needs and traditional <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> system. Ecological <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> systems were put forward and defined as <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> systems with full consideration of ecological demands for sustainable development. In such systems, four aspects are promoted: connectivity of water system, landscapes of river and lakes, mobility of water bodies, and safety of <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> In Phoenix Island, Huzhou, needs for ecological <b>flood</b> <b>controls</b> were analyzed from the four aspects above. The Water system layout was adjusted with the water surface ratio, which is the ratio of water surface area (including rivers, lakes, and other water bodies) to the total drainage area, and connectivity as controlling indicators. The designed water levels provided references for landscape plant selection. Mobility of the adjusted water system was analyzed, including flow direction and residence time. On the bases mentioned above, ecological <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> projects were planned with comprehensive consideration of the ecological requirements. The case study indicates that ecological needs can be integrated with <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> to develop ecological <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> systems that do not only prevent floods but also retain the ecological functions of water bodies...|$|R

In recent years, the flood-related damages have been increasing in the United States regardless of several investments in the <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> measures. Floodplain <b>mapping</b> is an important tool for management that aids in the planning of infrastructures within the floodplain zone. With the magnifying {{effects of climate change}} on the hydrological cycle the study of floodplain is becoming a key tool in the water management. Federal Emergency Management Agency has recently updated their floodplain standard as per the presidential executive order 2015 on the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. This study incorporates the newly updated floodplain mapping standard in the flood risk assessment of approximately 11. 2 km stretch of the Patapsco River near Ellicott City. Hydrologic Engineering Center 2 ̆ 7 s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) with the conjunction of geographical information systems were used in the floodplain analysis.

These flows were routed through the selected reach of Patapsco River and the vulnerability assessment of the nearby existing infrastructures was conducted.

40|$|Abstract: Anticipated future {{temperature}} {{changes in}} the mountainous U. S. Pacific Northwest will cause reduced spring snow pack, earlier melt, earlier spring peak flow and lower summer flow in transient rain-snow and snowmelt dominant river basins. In the context of managed <b>flood</b> <b>control,</b> these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/ simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20 th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> to those produced by current <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20 th century flow the same objective function is used to develop <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2 °C increase in air temperature. Robust decreases in system storage deficits are simulated for the climate change scenario when optimized flood rule curves replace the current <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> curves, without increasing monthly flood risks...|$|R
