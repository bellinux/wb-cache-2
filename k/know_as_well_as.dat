5|$|Although today our {{opponents are}} at the Rhine and at the Oder, I do not believe yet {{that there will be}} a coup brought about by the German people. Without {{assistance}} from outside, such a coup is not even to be considered. Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E
