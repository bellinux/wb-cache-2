5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of <b>homophony.</b> The {{most common type of}} <b>homophony</b> is melody-dominated <b>homophony,</b> in which one voice, often the highest, plays a distinct melody, and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, <b>homophony</b> {{indicated}} {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices. <b>Homophony</b> as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.|$|E
5|$|Monody {{is similar}} to melody-dominated <b>homophony</b> in that one voice becomes the melody, while another voice assumes the {{underlying}} harmony. Monody, however, {{is characterized by a}} single voice with instrumental accompaniment, whereas melody-dominated <b>homophony</b> refers to a broader category of homophonic music, which includes works for multiple voices, not just works for solo voice, as was the tradition with early 17th-century Italian monody.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homophony</b> first {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the predominant textures in Western classical music during the Baroque period in the early 17th century, when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind, the homophonic basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style. The choral arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since become common in Western classical music. <b>Homophony</b> began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} standard forms today.|$|E
5|$|In melody-dominated <b>homophony,</b> {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated <b>homophony,</b> voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{and other}} forms of modern popular music {{generally}} feature homophonic influences, following chord progressions over which musicians play a melody or improvise (see melody-dominated <b>homophony).</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of Bach's style is his {{extensive use of}} counterpoint, {{as opposed to the}} <b>homophony</b> used, for instance, in his four-part Chorale settings. Bach's Canons, and especially his Fugues, are most {{characteristic of}} this style, which Bach did not invent, but his contribution to it was so fundamental that he defined it to a large extent. Fugues are as characteristic to Bach's style, as, for instance, the Sonata form is characteristic to the composers of the Classical period.|$|E
25|$|While famous {{during his}} time, Jhan's work has largely faded into obscurity. He wrote {{in most of}} the genres current in the early 16th century, including, in sacred vocal music, masses (all but one of which are lost), motets, and lamentations. In style the sacred music is similar to the work of Josquin des Prez (died 1521), using {{imitative}} passages alternating with <b>homophony.</b> Jhan wrote his one surviving setting of the mass for the accession to the dukedom of Ercole II d'Este (1534); it uses cantus-firmus technique.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} his sacred music varies from simple <b>homophony,</b> {{designed}} for absolute clarity of textual expression in conformance with {{the dictates of}} the Council of Trent (as Mantua was a center of the Counter-Reformation, {{this was to be}} expected), to motet settings similar in expressive intensity to his madrigals including passages of surprising chromaticism not unlike that of Gesualdo. This is particularly true in the 1581 collections: Ascendente Jesu, for example, contains colorful examples of text-painting such as he used in the works he was composing for the Ferrarese court at the time.|$|E
25|$|Some {{pairs of}} Traditional and Simplified are also {{considered}} to be semantic variants. According to Unicode's definitions, {{it makes sense that}} all simplifications (that do not result in wholly different characters being merged for their <b>homophony)</b> will be a form of semantic variant. Unicode classifies 丟 and 丢 as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other's semantic variants. However, while Unicode classifies 億 (U+5104)and 亿 (U+4EBF) as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider 億 and 亿 to be semantic variants of each other.|$|E
25|$|Sonic texture {{relates to}} the number of sound sources and the {{interaction}} between them. The word 'texture', in this context, {{relates to the}} cognitive separation of auditory objects. In music, texture {{is often referred to as}} the difference between unison, polyphony and <b>homophony,</b> but it can also relate (for example) to a busy cafe; a sound which might be referred to as 'cacophony'. However texture refers to more than this. The texture of an orchestral piece is very different to the texture of a brass quintet because of the different numbers of players. The texture of a market place is very different to a school hall because of the differences in the various sound sources.|$|E
25|$|Wert's style at mid-career {{began to}} change away from the Rore manner towards one more closely aligned with the Venetians, such as Andrea Gabrieli. Pure <b>homophony</b> became more common in his works, {{and he began to}} exploit registral and textural {{contrasts}} rather than switch from polyphony to homophony; in addition, his lines became more lyrical. His preferred poets changed as well: while early in his career he had used Bembo and Petrarch, and later Ariosto, he shifted to Guarini and Torquato Tasso. In his sixth book of madrigals for five voices (1577), he included three madrigal cycles, an innovation which was to become a prominent musical subgenre {{near the end of the}} century. The cycles include two canzoni by Petrarch and a capitolo by Ariosto; they are set in a declamatory manner, thereby including a treatment of vocal lines which foreshadowed monody, and Wert's own later works.|$|E
25|$|All three Mass cycles employ {{other early}} Tudor features, notably the mosaic of semichoir {{sections}} alternating with full sections in the four-part and five-part Masses, {{the use of}} a semichoir section to open the Gloria, Credo, and Agnus Dei, and the head-motif which links the openings of all the movements of a cycle. However, all three cycles also include Kyries, a rare feature in Sarum Rite mass settings, which usually omitted it because of the use of tropes on festal occasions in the Sarum Rite. The Kyrie of the three-part Mass is set in a simple litany-like style, but the other Kyrie settings employ dense imitative polyphony. A special feature of the four-part and five-part Masses is Byrd's treatment of the Agnus Dei, which employ the technique which Byrd had previously applied to the petitionary clauses from the motets of the 1589 and 1591 Cantiones sacrae. The final words dona nobis pacem ("grant us peace"), which are set to chains of anguished suspensions in the Four-Part Mass and expressive block <b>homophony</b> in the five-part setting, almost certainly reflect the aspirations of the troubled Catholic community of the 1590s.|$|E
500|$|<b>Homophony</b> has {{appeared}} in several non-Western cultures, perhaps particularly in regions where communal vocal music has been cultivated. When explorer Vasco da Gama landed in West Africa in 1497, {{he referred to the}} music he heard there as being in [...] "sweet harmony". While the concept of harmony in that time was not necessarily the same as the concept of <b>homophony</b> as understood by modern scholars, it is generally accepted that homophonic voice harmonies were commonplace in African music for centuries before contact with Europeans and is common in African music today. Singers normally harmonize voices in homophonic parallelism moving in parallel thirds or fourths. This type of harmonic model is also, implemented in instrumental music where voices are stacked in thirds or fourths. Homophonic Parallelism is not restricted to thirds and fourths, however all harmonic material adheres to the scalar system the particular tune or song is based on. The use of harmony in sixths is common in areas where a hexatonic scale system is used [...] For instance, the Fang people of Gabon use <b>homophony</b> in their music.|$|E
500|$|In music, <b>homophony</b> ( [...] ; [...] ὁμόφωνος, homóphōnos, from ὁμός, homós, [...] "same" [...] and φωνή, phōnē, [...] "sound, tone") is a texture {{in which}} a primary part is {{supported}} {{by one or more}} additional strands that flesh out the harmony and often provide rhythmic contrast. This differentiation of roles contrasts with equal-voice polyphony (in which similar lines move with rhythmic and melodic independence to form an even texture) and monophony ({{in which a}}ll parts move in unison or octaves). Historically, <b>homophony</b> and its differentiated roles for parts emerged in tandem with tonality, which gave distinct harmonic functions to the soprano, bass and inner voices.|$|E
500|$|The closing chorale, [...] "" [...] (Although {{it appears}} that He does not will it), is set for four parts. While Bach's closing chorales are often in simple <b>homophony,</b> the lower voices are set here in unusual polyphony.|$|E
500|$|The violins {{in unison}} {{accompany}} the duet of tenor and bass, [...] "" [...] (Indeed, the stains of sin cling to us). The voices sing sometimes in imitation, sometimes in <b>homophony,</b> {{in the style}} of duets Bach wrote at Köthen earlier in his career.|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus on {{the first}} verse of the psalm, [...] "" [...] (Praise the Lord, my soul.), is quite short, using {{imitative}} fanfare figures without much harmonic development. It employs a ritornello theme on the tonic and dominant chords, incorporating a descending-third sequence. The voices sing mostly in <b>homophony.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} movement, the two verses of the doxology are {{set on the}} psalm tone for four parts, with all {{instruments}} playing colla parte. Wind instruments and violinI join the soprano part. The setting is mostly in <b>homophony,</b> but turns to polyphony for the final [...] "von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit" [...] (for ever and ever).|$|E
500|$|After four {{measures}} of piano interlude, the bass soloist begins softly the text [...] "And peace on earth", joined {{later by the}} other soloists. Finally the four parts of the chorus all repeat {{one after the other}} gently [...] "adoramus te" [...] (we pray to you) and conclude the section singing in <b>homophony</b> [...] "glorificamus te" [...] (we glorify you), marked again sotto voce.|$|E
500|$|The {{concluding}} {{movement is}} a motet on a quotation from Revelation, [...] "" [...] (The Lamb, that was slain). Three trumpets and timpani appear {{only in this}} triumphant movements of praise. It begins in <b>homophony</b> and expresses the text [...] "" [...] (Glory and honour and praise and power) in another permutation fugue with a climax in the subject played by the first trumpet.|$|E
500|$|Another psalm verse {{is again}} set as a chorus, [...] (You {{would not give}} the soul of Your turtledove to the enemy). The voices are set in <b>homophony</b> on a cello in ondulating motion. Gardiner notes {{that it is very}} {{personal}} setting, [...] "is a movement of extraordinary reticence, delicacy and the utmost tonal subtlety". He notes an upward semitone as a feature to express both yearningand the sound of the turtledove. The instruments are grouped to achieve in subtle colour: recorders and cello, reeds, and strings.|$|E
500|$|The key of F-sharp {{minor and}} a triple meter are {{introduced}} by the orchestra. The divided female voices express in <b>homophony</b> and [...] "dolcissimo": [...] "" [...] (Go enter his gates), with the measure most often divided in a halfnote and a quarter. The male voices answer [...] "" [...] (Go), then the female voices repeat their line in a new version. The play is repeated, now the male voices beginning. The following text appears in growing density and intensity, modulating constantly, ending in C major.|$|E
500|$|The first choral {{movement}} 5,"" [...] (If {{it is my}} God's will), {{is marked}} aria by Franck. Bach set it for four parts, using song-like <b>homophony.</b> Wolff compares the style to Thuringian motets of around 1700. The first part is not repeated da capo, {{in keeping with the}} last words [...] "" [...] (May this be my last word). While a textual da capo is impossible, Bach composed a musical da capo, giving the movement a structure of ABB'A'. Dürr notes that [...] "Arnold Schering has drawn attention to the increasing rapture".|$|E
500|$|The motet {{is marked}} Allegro moderato and begins calmly in <b>homophony.</b> Max Auer {{notes that the}} {{beautiful}} work has touches with Mozart's Ave verum. A. Crawford Howie notes further that the work [...] "begins with Mozartian phrases, but soon introduces characteristic Brucknerian progressions". The repeat of the first line, beginning one step higher, is marked mf, confirming [...] "" [...] higher and stronger, then repeating it softly. The bass begins each [...] "". Musicologist Anthony Carver notes here as in many of Bruckner's motets the [...] "isolation of the bass part at structurally important points". The bass also begins the second line with a new rising motif, marked f; the upper voices follow in <b>homophony.</b> The line is repeated as a sequence a step higher, marked ff. After a pause of half a bar, the tenor alone begins in sudden pp the middle section on a repeated note, imitated by soprano and alto. Throughout the section, only the upper voices, without a bass foundation, sing in chromaticism, beginning in undefined tonality. In a gradual crescendo, the intensity is heightened, but only to mf. Iso Camartin notes in an article dedicated to {{the work in the}} Neue Zürcher Zeitung: das unanfechtbare Geheimnis (the irreproachable mystery) appears as unfassbar (incomprehensible) and beunruhigend (disturbing), described by Ryan Turner as [...] "transparently chromatic".|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Why do {{you wish}} to trouble yourself), is a chorale fantasia, with the vocal part {{embedded}} in an independent concerto of the instruments. The cantus firmus on the melody of [...] "" [...] is in long notes, partly embellished, in the soprano and horn; the lower voices are mostly set in <b>homophony.</b> The lines of the chorale are not rendered separately, but accenting the bar form (Stollen–Stollen–Abgesang) of the text, 1 and 2 are combined, 3 and 4 are combined, 5 is single and 6 to 8 are combined. The scoring is relatively rich in woodwinds.|$|E
500|$|Similar to Mozart's Requiem, {{the work}} begins slowly in D minor. After {{one measure of}} just D in the instruments, the choir enters [...] in six parts on the D minor chord and stays on it in <b>homophony</b> for the entire text [...] "" [...] (eternal rest). In gradual {{progression}} of harmony and a sudden , a first climax is reached on [...] "" [...] (and lasting light), diminishing on a repeated [...] "" [...] (may shine for them). The tenors repeat the prayer alone for eternal rest on a simple melody. The sopranos continue similarly that praise is due in Jerusalem, then all voices exclaim [...] "" [...] (hear).|$|E
500|$|A duet {{for bass}} and soprano, [...] "" [...] (God, ah God, abandon Your own ones never again!), expresses {{a prayer for}} protection. The voices are in <b>homophony,</b> {{beginning}} without the instruments, while a [...] "sharply contoured violin theme" [...] appears first alone, then together with the voices. All violins play it in unison. The motif was attributed by the Bach scholar Albert Schweitzer to tumult, representing the [...] "raging of enemies" [...] mentioned in the text. Gardiner hears in the [...] "innocent" [...] setting of the voices [...] "a pre-echo … of Papageno and Papagena, a Mozartian impression, reinforced by the hint of [...] in the violin ritornelli".|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus in F major is {{a setting}} of the short text [...] "." [...] (For this the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy {{the works of the}} Devil.) Klaus Hofmann notes: [...] "This work of {{destruction}} is portrayed in the chorus by repeated percussive notes and extended coloratura, but all these illustrative elements are subordinated to a festive Christmas spirit". The horns open the ritornello with a short signal-like motif that is picked up by the oboes and the strings. The movement resembles a prelude and fugue, because the text is first presented in <b>homophony</b> to a repeat of the beginning of the ritornello, then repeated as a fugue, and finally repeated in madrigal style similar to the first section.|$|E
500|$|In this movement, [...] "despair, like chains, fetters one misfortune to the next" [...] is contrasted to [...] "shall my Saviour free me {{suddenly}} from it all", {{presented as}} akin to morning following night. Bach expresses despair by a descending sequential ritornello {{based on the}} circle of fifths through the minor keys (D, G, C, F), finally reaching B-flat major), whereas the [...] "dawning of faith" [...] is illustrated with an upward motion. Mincham characterizes the ritornello as [...] "comfortably conventional", {{in contrast with the}} [...] "convoluted" [...] theme. Hofmann notes the [...] "operatic quality" [...] of the movement, when for example on the words [...] "" [...] (so that everything suddenly releases me), the polyphony suddenly resolves to <b>homophony.</b>|$|E
500|$|The soprano and alto {{enter in}} unison [...] (My soul doth magnify [...] ). The vocal motif of [...] leaps up a major sixth and rises even higher. It is {{repeated}} {{several times in}} different combinations of voices, always in <b>homophony.</b> The second verse, [...] (And my spirit hath rejoiced), is sung first by soprano and alto in third parallels. The men repeat it similarly and continuo [...] (in God), [...] accented by the characteristic figure of a lower mordent, which is repeated throughout the whole work, often when God is mentioned. The conclusion of the idea, [...] (in God my saviour), is expressed by a descending line, alternating the rhythm, one measure in 3/4, one 6/8, and alternating the women's voices in sequences. A short recapitulation of [...] {{marks the end of}} the second verse.|$|E
500|$|... timentibus eum (His mercy is {{for those}} who fear Him from {{generation}} to generation) begins in great contrast softly with undulating movement in 12/8 time, played by the violins. It is a duet of alto and tenor, beginning in parallels of sixths and staying in <b>homophony</b> {{for most of the}} movement. The theme resembles the sarabande of Bach's first French Suite in D minor, BWV 812. Hogwood compares the music to the pastoral sinfonia beginning Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, [...] "creating a romantic, soft-edged, almost comforting sound". Jones remarks that [...] " [...] (who fear him) is [...] "full of pathos and built over a partly chromatic, quasi-ostinato bass", while the [...] "divine quality of mercy is expressed in beatific parallel thirds of the violins in the ritornello".|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Ah, how fleeting, ah how insignificant), is a chorale fantasia. The {{instruments}} play concertante music, {{to which}} the soprano sings the cantus firmus line by line. The lower voices act as a [...] "self-contained group", mostly in <b>homophony,</b> and [...] "declaim the individual lines of text in unison {{at the end of}} each choral passage, using a melodic formula derived from the beginning of the hymn." [...] Bach illustrates the imagery of the text, [...] "fleetingness and insubstantiality" [...] in motifs such as [...] "abrupt chords separated by pauses and... hurrying scale figures". Gardiner comments: [...] The Musicologist Julian Mincham compares the instrumental music to [...] "mist and fog, images which imply movements of wind and air" [...] and hears the lower voices as [...] "evincing a feeling of primeval power and solidarity".|$|E
500|$|The soprano {{sings the}} [...] in long notes. Hofmann {{notes that the}} Dorian mode within the {{instrumental}} concerto in E minor adds a [...] "slightly archaic flavour". The lower voices participate in the instrumental motifs for lines 1, 2, 3 and 5, but lines 4 and 6 are treated differently. In accordance to the text, [...] "sanft und stille" [...] (calm and quiet) and [...] "der Tod ist mein Schlaf worden" [...] (death has become my sleep), they are performed softly (piano), in <b>homophony,</b> chromatic, and modulating to distant keys. Dürr notes the movement's [...] "extremely dense, highly expressive texture" [...] with motifs independent from the hymn tune but derived from its beginning. The Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones observes that the movement foreshadows , the opening chorus of Bach's St Matthew Passion, in key, 12/8 metre and [...] "much else".|$|E
500|$|The {{thought is}} {{continued}} in [...] "" [...] (to the Father, almighty), in a four-part choral movement with trumpets. The movement probably shares its original source {{with the opening}} chorus of [...] (God, as Your name is, so is also Your praise), which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation. The voices sing a fugue to a concerto of the orchestra. The bass introduces the theme, without an instrumental opening, while the other voices repeat simultaneously in <b>homophony</b> [...] "" [...] as a firm statement. The theme contains all eight notes of the scale, as a symbol completeness. Bach noted {{at the end of}} the movement that it contains 84 measures, the multiplication of 7 and 12, a hint at the symbolic meaning of numbers. The word [...] "" [...] appears 49 times (7*7), the words [...] "" [...] 84 times.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} chorale fantasia, [...] "" [...] (Ah, dear Christians, be comforted), Bach expresses two {{thoughts}} of the text, comfort and fear, by contrasting themes that appear simultaneously in the instruments: an assertive theme {{is derived from the}} melody and played by the two oboes and first violins, an [...] "anxious" [...] one in the second violins and the continuo. The soprano sings the melody as a cantus firmus, doubled by the horn, while the lower voices are set partly in expressive imitation, partly in <b>homophony.</b> They are treated differently to reflect the meaning of the text. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the movement to the opening of the cantata Jesu, der du meine Seele, BWV 78, written three weeks earlier: both [...] "a sort of chaconne" [...] in G minor, with a [...] "French style" [...] bass as [...] "the expression of mourning and lamentation".|$|E
