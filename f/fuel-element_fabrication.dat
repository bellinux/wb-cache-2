40|$|Preface: The Fuel Elements Conference held in Paris, France, November 18 to 23, 1957, {{under the}} joint {{sponsorship}} of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission and the French Commissarat Ã  l'Energie Atomique (CEA), provided an intensive review of <b>fuel-element</b> <b>fabrication</b> practices and behavior of fuel elements under in-pile irradiation and when subjected to corrosive media...|$|E
40|$|Estimates {{indicate}} that, {{within the}} D/sub 2 /O-moderated natural-uranium- fuel reactor category, the lowest cost reactor will be cooled by boiling D/sub 2 / O. The margin over nonboiling is small, especially for reactors in the 100 Mw(e) size and smaller. A major {{area in which}} research must be advanced before any of the reactor concepts can be successful is <b>fuel-element</b> <b>fabrication</b> and irradiation behavior. Both oxide and metallic elements have their own advantages, and each type should be developed. Other areas in which additional work must be done are the reactivities of various fuel lattices. fuel element burnout (especially for the boiling regime), zirconium pressure tubes and their connections to steel, and methods of reducing and detecting D/sub 2 /O leakage.
