It joins a group of sandwiches from other vendors that are designed as counters to the more well-known McDonald's sandwich.

5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E
5|$|Sejmiks {{had become}} an {{important}} part of the Commonwealth's parliamentary life, complementing the role of general sejm.

5|$|After this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was forced to negotiate <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. This {{appears to have been a}} trap; he was attacked and captured by the NDH on his way to the meeting. Events after his capture are unclear, but Đurišić, Vasić, Ostojić, and Baćović were subsequently killed along with othersincluding some Serbian Orthodox priests. According to Pajović, the Ustaše executed Đurišić in late April 1945 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site says Đurišić was killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. The location of Đurišić's grave, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|As of 30 September 2017, a {{total of}} 7,771 Airbus A320-family {{aircraft}} have been delivered, of which 7,434 are in service. In addition, another 5,520 airliners are on firm order. It ranked as the world's fastest-selling jet airliner family according to records from 2005 to 2007, and as the best-selling single-generation aircraft programme. The A320 family has proved popular with airlines including low-cost carriers such as EasyJet, which purchased A319s and A320s to replace its 737 fleet. As of 30 September 2017, American Airlines was the largest operator of the Airbus A320 family aircraft, operating 394 aircraft. The aircraft family competes <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 737 and has competed with the 717, 757, and the MD-80/MD-90.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the early}} 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily {{populated}} by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya {{and was an}} important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At {{the same time the}} Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.|$|E
5|$|Food {{security}} and food power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

5|$|Having {{stepped down}} from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the {{remainder}} of the war. There he continued his literary production; however, the books Norway Neutral and Invaded (1941) and The Voice of Norway (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of war in Norway, and was released in Swedish in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, the {{university}} {{announced that it}} had purchased or leased twelve buildings in downtown Syracuse. Five Design Programs; Communication, Advertising, Environmental and Interior Design, Industrial and Interactive Design, and Fashion; reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called The Warehouse, which was renovated by Gluckman Mayner Architects. Both programs were chosen to {{be located in the}} downtown area because of their history of working on projects <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> community. The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits, and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{was annoyed}} {{at the way}} that Royle, a Royal Navy officer, communicated <b>directly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty; he was also aware that Royle had been {{critical}} of SWPA's command arrangements, and {{of some of his}} decisions. MacArthur proposed that an Australian officer, Captain John Collins, replace Royle as CNS, an appointment that Carpender also supported. Over the Admiralty's objections, Curtin appointed Collins to replace Crutchley as Commander, Task Force 44, in June 1944, at the rank of commodore, with the intention that Collins would replace Royle when his term expired. This did not occur, because Collins was seriously wounded in Leyte Gulf on 21 October 1944.|$|E
