5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest {{capital gains tax cut}} in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 <b>for</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples,</b> $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and <b>for</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> with incomes above $1 million. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made <b>for</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples)</b> which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction <b>for</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples.</b> Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{payroll tax}} (FICA) {{partially}} funds Social Security and Medicare. For the Social Security portion, {{employers and employees}} each pay 6.2% of the workers gross pay, a total of 12.4%. The Social Security portion is capped at $118,500 for 2015, meaning income above this amount {{is not subject to}} the tax. It is a flat tax up to the cap, but regressive overall as it is not applied to higher incomes. The Medicare portion is also paid by employer and employee each at 1.45% and is not capped. Starting in 2013, an additional 0.9 percent more in Medicare taxes was applied to income of more than $200,000 ($250,000 <b>for</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> filing jointly), making it a progressive tax overall.|$|E

With the Bush tax cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the Republican Congress, as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it.

25|$|Part A's {{inpatient}} admitted {{hospital and}} skilled nursing coverage is largely funded by revenue from a 2.9% payroll tax levied on employers and workers (each pay 1.45%).

Beginning January 1, 1994, the compensation limit was removed. Self-employed individuals must pay the entire 2.9% tax on self-employed net earnings (because they are both employee and employer), but may deduct half of the tax from the income in calculating income tax. Beginning in 2013, the rate of Part A tax on earned income exceeding US$200,000 for individuals (US$250,000 <b>for</b> <b>married</b> <b>couples</b> filing jointly) rose to 3.8%, in order to pay part of the cost of the subsidies mandated by the PPACA.|$|E
