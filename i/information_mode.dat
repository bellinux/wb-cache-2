5000|$|As {{well as new}} {{mechanical}} and electronic systems, the Discovery 3 introduced a new design to the interior and exterior of the vehicle. The Discovery 3 was {{able to have a}} fresh, minimalist style. The interior featured a flexible seven-seat layout. Passengers in the rearmost row now entered through the rear side doors, instead of the tailgate as in previous versions. The driver benefited from a DVD navigation system, including some optional features like Bluetooth telephony in later models. Like the Range Rover, this audio, information & entertainment ("infotainment") system in the Discovery 3 adopted an electronics architecture whereby the system's distributed control units pass information and audio amongst one another and throughout the vehicle via optical links based on the MOST (or, Media Oriented Systems Transport) fibre-optic automotive networking standard (informally called the [...] "MOST-bus"). The system's navigation functions were unique to Land Rover because, in addition to the typical road map navigation, benefits included an off-road navigation and four-wheel drive <b>information</b> <b>mode.</b> When in four-wheel drive <b>information</b> <b>mode,</b> the screen showed a schematic of the vehicle, displaying the amount of suspension movement, angle the front wheels were steering, the status of the locking differentials and icons showing which mode the Terrain Response was in, and what gear was selected on automatic versions.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the type}} of interrogation, the {{transponder}} sends back a transponder code (or [...] "squawk code", Mode A) or altitude <b>information</b> (<b>Mode</b> C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation between planes. Another mode called Mode S (Mode Select) is designed to help avoiding over-interrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are backward compatible with Modes A and C. Mode S is mandatory in controlled airspace in many countries. Some countries have also required, or are moving towards requiring, that all aircraft be equipped with Mode S, even in uncontrolled airspace. However, in the field of general aviation there have been objections to these moves, because of the cost, size, limited benefit to the users in uncontrolled airspace, and, in the case of balloons and gliders, the power requirements during long flights.|$|E
50|$|Because {{primary radar}} {{generally}} gives bearing and range position information, but lacks altitude <b>information,</b> <b>mode</b> C and mode S transponders also report pressure altitude. Some lower-end altimeters do not normally have a built in encoder {{and so a}} modified Gray code, called a Gillham code, is used to pass altitude information to the transponder. Around busy airspace {{there is often a}} regulatory requirement that all aircraft be equipped with altitude-reporting mode C or mode S transponders. In the United States, this is known as a Mode C veil. Mode S transponders are compatible with transmitting the mode C signal, and have the capability to report in 25 foot increments. Without the pressure altitude reporting, the air traffic controller has no display of accurate altitude information, and must rely on the altitude reported by the pilot via radio. Similarly, the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) installed on some aircraft needs the altitude information supplied by transponder signals.|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{consistently}} acquire {{information on}} product attributes available to them. In considering the many and varied effects of advertising a very central {{issue is how}} these attribute information in an ad is processed, that is, how consumers were able to comprehend and remember what an ad claimed. Researchers also {{seem to believe that}} the use of persuasive ads increases recall of attribute information, enhances attitude toward the ad, brand, and positively affects intent to purchase. Such information in marketing communications is often presented either in a vivid or non-vivid form and they are conveyed in either numbers or adjectives. The complexity of numerical information {{and the fact that they}} are being used on a frequent basis to make many important decisions makes numerical cognition a challenging and important domain for this research. In this research we draw the reviews and advances in consumer research on comparisons between two types of information in an advertising setting and combining it along with two types of presentation forms. Yet a few empirical investigations of presentation forms, typically vividness and its interaction effects with <b>information</b> <b>mode,</b> have been conducted in a consumer-behavior context. Further to add to this research is the inclusion of consumer knowledge moderates the way such information is processed. Although the effects of vividness in terms of its ability to impart a persuasive communication have yielded mixed results, we extend the scope of vividness research and attempt to examine vividness effects and its interaction with <b>information</b> <b>mode</b> in print ads. Since different consumers use different skills and strategies to evaluate information, it is suggested that individual differences in product knowledge may be an important moderating factor in information processing and final response to product ads. In order to address the research issues, a conceptual framework based on the availability valence hypothesis (availability theory) was created. Sixty individual hypotheses were the resulting derivatives from the framework. To test the hypotheses and the conceptual model, a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was employed and examined responses from 160 students from both arts and computing science program of a major university. Experiments examined the persuasive impact of a new brand containing two forms of presentation and <b>information</b> <b>mode.</b> The conclusions from the study reveal that vividness has an impact on recall and attitudes. The impact on recall and judgment was more pronounced for novices in comparison to experts. The interactions between presentation form and <b>information</b> <b>mode</b> also revealed that the consumer knowledge moderates the way information is processed for recall and subsequent judgment. Experts were able to able to recall attribute information more accurately than novices irrespective of the presentation form and the judgment imparted was based on the information available. All functional properties of the variables in the proposed model had an impact on the effects of advertising during memory and judgment tasks. We also provided a theoretical rationale based on extant literature on the availability model as to which presentation form and <b>information</b> <b>mode</b> may influence the recall and judgment resulting in intent to purchase. The presentation form and <b>information</b> <b>mode</b> highlights the similarities in the benefits offered by an existing base brand. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed as well as the limitations and future directions of this study. QC 2010081...|$|E

40|$|Accompanying {{infrastructure}} {{improvements and}} networking technology innovation, {{the development of}} digital home service industry has gotten more and more attention. However, the digital home service levels have not sufficiently met rising demand from users. Therefore, it is urgent to propose and develop new service modes for the digital home. Geographic information services can provide various spatial information services such as map search, spatial information query. It has become an inevitable trend to implement geographic information services in the digital home.

40|$|In the {{upcoming}} video coding standard, MPEG- 4 AVC/JVT/H. 264, motion estimation (ME) {{is allowed to}} use seven kinds of block sizes to improve the rate-distortion performance. This new feature has achieved significant coding gain compared to coding a macroblock (MB) using fixed block size. However, ME is computational intensive with complexity increasing linearly {{to the number of}} allowed block sizes. In this paper, a combined fast motion estimation algorithm with Predict Hexagon Search (PHS) and Edge <b>Information</b> <b>Mode</b> Decision (EIMD) is proposed. EIMD uses the edge information to predict the best matching block size. It can determine the best MB type quickly. The PHS can search the candidate MV efficiently. The analysis results show that the speed improvement of our proposed algorithm over some popular fast motion estimation algorithm is about 2 ~ 15 times. Compared with JM 10. 2, the speed-up is marvelously enhanced as 20 ~ 40 times and can still keep good quality as JM 10. 2.
