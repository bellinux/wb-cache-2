5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar <b>granule</b> neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} <b>granule</b> layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum <b>granule</b> cells (also called cerebellar <b>granule</b> neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal <b>granule</b> layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E
5|$|<b>Granule</b> cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the <b>granule</b> cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because <b>granule</b> cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each <b>granule</b> cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a <b>granule</b> cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the <b>granule</b> cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and <b>granule</b> cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 <b>granule</b> cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the <b>granule</b> cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 <b>granule</b> cells.|$|E

40|$|Methanogenic <b>granules</b> from an {{anaerobic}} bioreactor that treated wastewater of a beer brewery {{consisted of}} different morphological types of <b>granules.</b> In this study, the microbial compositions {{of the different}} <b>granules</b> were analyzed by molecular microbiological techniques: cloning, {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We propose here that the different types of <b>granules</b> reflect the different stages in the life cycle of <b>granules.</b> Young <b>granules</b> were small, black, and compact and harbored active cells. Gray <b>granules</b> were the most abundant <b>granules.</b> These <b>granules</b> have a multilayer structure with channels and void areas. The core was composed of dead or starving cells with low activity. The brown <b>granules,</b> which were the largest <b>granules,</b> showed a loose and amorphous structure with big channels that resulted in fractured zones and corresponded to the older <b>granules.</b> Firmicutes (as determined by FISH) and Nitrospira and Deferribacteres (as determined by cloning and sequencing) were the predominant Bacteria. Remarkably, Firmicutes could not be detected in the brown <b>granules.</b> The methanogenic Archaea identified were Methanosaeta concilii (70 to 90 % by FISH and cloning), Methanosarcina mazei, and Methanospirillum spp. The phenotypic appearance of the <b>granules</b> reflected the physiological condition of the <b>granules.</b> This may be valuable to easily select appropriate seed sludges to start up other reactors...|$|R
5|$|Cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar <b>granule</b> cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A <b>granule</b> cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E

Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy fibers and climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of <b>granule</b> cells). There are two main pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.|$|E
30|$|The starch <b>granules</b> of M. stipoides were {{polygonal}} with sharply defined edges (Fig.  4 d). Reichert (1913) {{reasoned that}} polygonal <b>granules</b> with sharply defined edges {{were caused by}} the pressure of numerous starch <b>granules</b> present in the endosperm cells. Earp et al. (2004) suggested tight packing of starch <b>granules</b> in Sorghum bicolor resulted in more sharply edged <b>granules</b> compared with <b>granules</b> that are loosely attached to each other.|$|R
50|$|Four {{kinds of}} <b>granules</b> exist in {{neutrophils}} that display differences in content and regulation.

30|$|O. meyeriana (Fig.  4 b) {{was unique}} in that it showed spherical starch <b>granules</b> {{throughout}} the endosperm. In the compound <b>granules,</b> the individual starch <b>granules</b> were found loosely attached to its neighbouring <b>granules</b> {{and most of the}} compound <b>granules</b> were also loosely attached to its neighbouring compound <b>granules.</b> This loose attachment may explain why they retained their spherical shape. Some soft wheat varieties have loosely packed starch <b>granules</b> in their endosperm and lower gelatinization temperature than those of hard varieties (Gaines et al. 2000; Zeng et al. 1997).|$|R
5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} <b>granule</b> contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the <b>granule</b> (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → <b>granule</b> cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion <b>granule</b> cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because {{of the way}} that they are lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with <b>granule</b> cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E
5|$|The {{protease}} {{targets of}} intracellular inhibitory serpins {{have been difficult}} to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic <b>granule</b> protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have <b>granule</b> cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
40|$|Summary FMRP is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{protein that}} is highly expressed in neurons and its deficiency causes fragile X mental retardation syndrome. FMRP controls the translation of target mRNAs in part by promoting their dynamic transport in neuronal RNA <b>granules.</b> We have previously shown that high expression of mammalian FMRP induces formation of <b>granules</b> termed FMRP <b>granules.</b> These RNA <b>granules</b> are reminiscent of neuronal <b>granules,</b> of stress <b>granules,</b> {{as well as of}} the recently described in vitro-assembled <b>granules.</b> In contrast with mammalian FMRP, which has two paralog proteins, Drosophila FMRP (dFMRP) is encoded by a single gene that has no paralog. Using this genetically simple organism, we investigated formation and dynamics of FMRP <b>granules.</b> We found that increased expression of dFMRP in Drosophila cells induces the formation of dynamic dFMRP RNA <b>granules.</b> Mutagenesis studies identified the N-terminal protein–protein domain of dFMRP as a key determinant for FMRP <b>granules</b> formation. The RGG RNA binding motif of dFMRP is dispensable for dFMRP <b>granules</b> formation since its deletion does not prevent formation of those <b>granules.</b> Deletion of the RGG motif reduced, however, dFMRP trafficking between FMRP <b>granules</b> and the cytosol. Similarly, deletion of a large part of the KH RNA binding motif of dFMRP had no effect on formation of dFMRP-granules, but diminished the shuttling activity of dFMRP. Our results thus suggest that the mechanisms controlling formation of RNA <b>granules</b> and those promoting their dynamics are uncoupled. This study opens new avenues to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling FMRP trafficking with its associated mRNAs in and out of RNA <b>granules...</b>|$|R

5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and <b>granule</b> cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} three layers. At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed with <b>granule</b> cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate <b>granule</b> cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} from light {{microscope}} studies of potato starch that the <b>granules</b> formed in a constant environment (of light and temperature) have a ring formation indistinguishable fi'om that of <b>granules</b> formed under field conditions. Electron microscope studies have confirmed that normal potato starch <b>granules</b> have a fine shell structure not usually resolved by the light microscope, and also that shells do not develop in barley <b>granules</b> grown in a constant environment. The paper presented here reports a further study of the dependence of shell formation on environment. Potatoes were grown in a constant environment and starch <b>granules</b> from the newly formed tubers were examined in the light microscope, and in the electron microscope after corrosion by acid. No difference between these <b>granules</b> and normal <b>granules</b> was observed; both wide (light microscope) rings and fine lamellae developed in both <b>granules.</b> Parallel studies were made on wheat starch <b>granules.</b> In this case, shells were not differentiated in <b>granules</b> that developed in a constant environment, but they could be produced at will by imposing a dark period.

The mobility of these two groups of <b>granules</b> is also differentially affected by disruption of F-actin, suggesting different mechanisms are involved in the motion of the two groups of <b>granules.</b> Our results demonstrate that combined deconvolution and single-particle tracking may find its application in three-dimensional tracking of long-term motion of <b>granules</b> and elucidating the underlying mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the <b>granule</b> cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing <b>granule</b> cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E

We show that perinuclear P <b>granules</b> differ from cytoplasmic P <b>granules</b> in many respects, including structure, stability and response to metabolic changes. Our results suggest that nuclear-associated P <b>granules</b> provide a perinuclear compartment where newly exported mRNAs are collected prior to their release to the general cytoplasm. First, we show that mRNA export factors are highly enriched at the NPCs associated with P <b>granules.</b> Second, we discovered that the expression of high-copy transgenes could be induced in a subset of germ cells, and used this system to demonstrate that nascent mRNA traffics directly to P <b>granules.</b> P <b>granules</b> appear to sequester large amounts of mRNA in quiescent germ cells, presumably preventing translation of that mRNA. However, we did not find evidence that P <b>granules</b> normally sequester aberrant mRNAs, or mRNAs targeted for destruction by the RNAi pathway...|$|R
