The optimized results were verified by experiments and mass production. It analyzes {{the effect of the}} punch shape of gear container to metal flowing. The plastic flow could be controlled by the selection of the punch shape of gear container which reduced the resistance to deformation, and the gear profile was full without folding defects...|$|E
25|$|Development of {{a version}} for motor torpedo boats began in 1932 as the GM-34, {{but it did}} not pass its state tests until December 1934, {{although}} it was put into production that same year. It was given a reversing <b>gear,</b> a free-wheel <b>sleeve,</b> and its cooling and exhaust systems were modified. Production continued through 1943 with the GM-34s adapting features from the aviation models. With the exception of the GAM-34BP and the original GM-34, all maritime engines used a benzene-alcohol fuel mixture.|$|R
