5000|$|Most {{explanations}} of balanced lines assume symmetric (antiphase) signals {{but this is}} an unfortunate confusion—signal symmetry and balanced lines are quite independent of each other. Essential in a balanced line is matched impedances in the driver, line and receiver. These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the <b>differential</b> <b>line</b> equally and thus appears as a common mode signal that is removed by the receiver. There are balanced drive circuits that have excellent common-mode impedance matching between [...] "legs" [...] but do not provide symmetric signals. [...] Symmetric differential signals exist to prevent interference to other circuits - the electromagnetic fields are canceled out by the equal and opposite currents.

40|$|Differential {{interconnects}} are extensively used in high-speed {{digital circuits}} at fast data rates and in environments of high noise like backplanes. For such applications they are preferred over single-ended lines owing {{to their ability}} to reject common-mode noise. Differential schemes like Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) are used for wireless base stations and ATM switches in telecommunication applications, flat panel displays and servers and for system-level clock distribution. LVDS applications use data rates from 100 Mbps to about 1. 5 Gbps and are expected to be highly immune to noise. However, noise will also be injected into differential signals at these high data rates, if there are irregularities in the interconnect setup. These anomalies may be via transitions from <b>differential</b> <b>lines</b> through power planes in power distribution systems, via stubs, asymmetric lengths of <b>differential</b> <b>lines,</b> different transition points for each of the differential vias etc. The differential setup is expected to be immune to such imbalances; however, investigation of these discontinuities indicate that sufficient signal energy can be leaked to power distribution networks (PDN) of packages and boards. The effect of this energy loss was examined in time-domain and was found to cause signal integrity effects like jitter. Irregular differential structures were compared with the equivalent single-ended configuration and symmetrical perfect <b>differential</b> <b>lines.</b> This thesis work quantifies signal to power coupling caused by irregular differential structures in the presence of PDN planes in frequency domain. Presence of noise in differential signaling is verified through a set of test vehicles. The jitter induced as a result of signal to power coupling from <b>differential</b> <b>lines</b> was also investigated. M. S.

However, measured performance based on fabricated circuits is {{much worse than}} simulated performance based on the layout. It is suspected that the via resistance variation is the cause.

In addition, a new buffer insertion technique is proposed to synchronize the transmitted signals, thus further improving {{the effectiveness of the}} twisted <b>differential</b> <b>line.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that the new approaches are highly effective.

40|$|CIMITECA {{technique}} for {{the suppression of}} the common mode in differential (balanced) microstrip lines, based on electromagnetic band-gaps (EBGs), is presented in this letter. It is demonstrated that by periodically modulating the common-mode characteristic impedance of the line and simultaneously forcing the differential-mode impedance to be uniform (and equal to the reference impedance of the differential ports), the common mode can be efficiently suppressed over a certain frequency band, while the line is transparent for the differential-mode. The main advantage of EBGs, as compared to other approaches for common-mode suppression in differential microstrip lines, {{is the fact that the}} ground plane is kept unaltered. Moreover, the design of the <b>differential</b> <b>line</b> is straightforward since the required level of common-mode suppression and bandwidth are given by simple approximate analytical expressions.
