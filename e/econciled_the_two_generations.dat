40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine how <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations,</b> who {{are living in the}} area Sølund on Nørrebro in Copenhagen, relates to one another and which issues occurs in the attempt to create an intergenerational {{community}} in the area. The project choose to use theory about territorial communities, what communities are based on and social capital. These theories are used to understand how <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> relate to each other now, and what benefits they will experience if they engage in an intergenerational community. The project also use theory about groups and how they communicate, stereotypes and intergenerational interaction patterns. These theories are used to understand what makes <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> relate <b>the</b> way they do, and what issues they are facing if they want to engage in an intergenerational community. To answer these questions the project employ qualitative focus group interviews. The project choose to make two interviews. One with the elderly and one with <b>the</b> youngsters. These <b>two</b> interviews are analyzed separately first and in the end compared. The analysis shows that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> consider Sølund as a divided area between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations,</b> that they don’t meet each other in the area and that they don’t share the same sense of place. Besides that the analysis also shows that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> want to engage in an intergenerational community, but none of them are able to make it happen. Based on the results from the analysis the project discuss what an intergenerational community can be based on on Sølund and why <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> don’t manage to create an intergenerational community. The project concludes that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> hardly interact but that they accept each others presence in the area. To make an intergenerational community at Sølund the generations need to interact to break down some of the stereotypes they have created about each other. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> willingness to engage are probably based on their dream of an ideal community...|$|R

40|$|Jhumpa Lahiri’s novel The Namesake (2003) shifts its {{focal point}} {{from the first}} {{generation}} of immigrants to the second, in the process establishing interconnectedness of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations.</b> While opportunity, movement, displacement and stabilisation form the sequence that defines the lives of the first generation immigrants, the lives of their children, the second generation, revolves around the issues of belonging – whether they belong to the country of their origin or to the country of their birth and whether to adhere to the culture and tradition of their parents {{or to subscribe to the}} standards of their immediate world outside home. The article analyses the movement of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> of Ganguli family in the United States and the various ways in which they are divided and united in the novel.

40|$|At present, {{more and}} more {{researches}} deals with the characteristic features of generation Y and generation Z. As {{it is about the}} present and future generations, corporate success and the competitive operation are determined by the behav our of these generations in the long-run. Researches justifies that there are significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> despite <b>the</b> similarities. These differences appear rather emphasized in the corporate environment when several questions arise at workplaces in the process of cooperation – especially in the field of knowledge-sharing and knowledge transfer-regarding the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations.</b> Last year, <b>the</b> authors carried out a quantitative research by questionnaires in order to reveal what the managing of these <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> mean for <b>the</b> managers and also what difficulties occur when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> cooperate {{with each other and with}} elder generations as well. The main question of the research was how to approach the new generations from the view of HR? Although the research cannot be considered representative (410 respondents participated in the survey), it can give a picture about the examined issues. The hypothesis phrased by the authors was justified according to which of the HR activities have to adapt to the requirements of the new generations upon their appearance...|$|R

A specially designed questionnaire was used to survey the study sample that represented this society, and a comparative analysis was performed. During <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>generations,</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of first-cousin marriage types was found to be decreasing but still was most predominant among the various {{consanguineous marriage}} types.
