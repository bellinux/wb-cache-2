5|$|In November 2016, Kevin Smith {{said that}} he was open to having the Superman Lives script be adapted as an {{animated}} film, with Nicholas Cage voicing Superman and Michael Rooker voicing Lex Luthor. In October 2017, Batman vs. Two-Face writer Michael Jelenic stated that he originally pitched an animated film based on Smith's Superman Lives script, saying that Warner Bros seriously considered it for a long time. According to Jelenic, Cage would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> voice Superman in the film, but the idea never materialized and Jelenic's pitch was eventually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August 1993 Davis turned 80, {{and still}} held a ranking of 259. Even then {{he stated that}} he would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} playing, but was prevented from doing so by the severe arthritis in his left knee which made it painful to walk. Indeed, it was Davis' attempt to redistribute his stance which contributed to such heavy defeats in his final snooker matches.|$|E

He {{went on to say}} that if he had been successful in the beautiful game, he would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> play for FC Basel.|$|E
500|$|Cohan viewed Bela as [...] "a {{young woman}} {{trying to make}} a living and find some kind of reason in her world" [...] who was [...] "a little damaged." [...] The actress shared Gamble's opinion of Bela's {{behavior}} being a façade, and incorporated into her performance the idea of Bela hiding her true self, with Cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from [...] "real strong connections". This defensiveness prevented her from opening up to the Winchesters, with whom Cohan believed Bela [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> be able to have a normal relationship". Contrary to Kripke and Gamble's assessment of Bela as amoral and uncaring, Cohan envisioned the character as having [...] "fits of conscience" [...] offscreen throughout the third season. In the actress's opinion, Bela [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> go around fighting evil with those boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's darkness, Nolan {{wanted to}} make the film appeal to a wide age range. [...] "Not the {{youngest}} kids obviously, I think what we've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have seen a movie like this." [...] Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.|$|E

500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E

In de Moor's words, [...] "Personally I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> finish Alph-Art. It {{would have been a}} tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the use of}} MotionScan was {{critically}} acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces, it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements. Many players considered that characters are [...] "dead from the neck down". Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players' expectations of realism; [...] "people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of}} the body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games," [...] he said. [...] "We would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have spent more time on fine-tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved," [...] said Bao.|$|E

The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{birth of}} the Federation was first hinted at during part two of [...] "Shockwave", which opened the second season. When Manny Coto was made show runner for the fourth season, he decided that {{the focus of the}} series should be to link to that event. With this in mind, his {{intention}} was for this season to move towards that goal. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were hired as writers on Enterprise because they wrote the non-canon novel Federation and after it was suggested by producer Mike Sussman. The episodes for the fourth season were intended to lay the framework for the later creation of the Federation. This was something that the cast said that they would have liked to see more of, with Scott Bakula later saying [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have been able to explore that journey to the Federation and their creation of it... to a greater extent. And I think that would have been, um, just more fun for the audience... just better, longer storytelling." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{spoke in}} a level voice, with a ring of {{hardness}} in it, for which I was to learn the true reason later. At the time {{it seemed to me}} due to resentment at having to speak of the man she <b>had</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> me, whom she disliked, and my bitterness increased.|$|R

500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have been a genuine eccentric".|$|E
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it was something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented that she would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she {{would return to the}} show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show." [...] Though she does not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning praised 30 Rock {{for putting}} {{it all together}} [...] "so seamlessly" [...] and [...] "so brilliantly balanced" [...] in [...] "Señor Macho Solo". Canning enjoyed Tracy's story, observing {{that it was a}} [...] "fantastic Tracy Jordan moment." [...] He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back [...] "into the mix". He also liked that this episode [...] "delivered some great work" [...] from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was [...] "the first really work-centric one in a while." [...] He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of AOL's TV Squad said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd [...] "fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them." [...] Gallagher noted that Dinklage was [...] "pretty awesome" [...] as Tina Fey's love interest, [...] "and I would <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> see more of them together. I really think they could have done more with this storyline." [...] According to Gallagher, the only part of [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] that she was not [...] "crazy about" [...] was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.|$|E
