40|$|Motivated by an {{industrial}} problem affecting a water utility, we develop {{a model for}} a load sharing system where an operator dispatches work load to components in a manner that manages their degradation. We assume degradation is the dominant failure type, and that the system will not be subject to sudden failure due to a shock. By deriving the time to <b>degradation</b> <b>failure</b> of the system, estimates of system probability of failure are generated, and optimal designs can be obtained to minimize the long run average cost of a future system. The model can be used to support asset maintenance and design decisions. Our model is developed under a common set of core assumptions. That is, the operator allocates work to balance the level of the degradation condition of all components to achieve system performance. A system is assumed to be replaced when the cumulative work load reaches some random threshold. We adopt cumulative work load as the measure of total usage because it represents the primary cause of component degradation. We model the cumulative work load of the system as a monotone increasing and stationary stochastic process. The cumulative work load to <b>degradation</b> <b>failure</b> of a component is assumed to be inverse Gaussian distributed. An example, informed by an industry problem, is presented to illustrate the application of the model under different operating scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Predicting system {{lifetime}} {{is important}} to ensure {{safe and reliable operation}} of products, which requires integrated modeling based on multi-level, multi-sensor information. However, lifetime characteristics of equipment in a system are different and failure mechanisms are inter-coupled, which leads to complex logical correlations and the lack of a uniform lifetime measure.

In the first step, an estimation of the Li ions ’ transport rate in both positive and negative electrodes is obtained from an electrochemical model of the battery through a particle filtering approach.

Situational awareness is required {{to find out when}} parts of the grid need maintenance and which parts should be prioritized. The paper proposes a conceptual value model which relates sensor data from the condition of the asset to the potential value of information (i. e. interpreted data) for the distribution system operators. Distribution density functions account for uncertainties in model parameter values. They can be narrowed down by monitoring relevant degradation mechanisms. To this end, degradation processes are simulated in laboratory scale setups, emulating low voltage cables in moist and submerged environments.

In nano scale, the <b>degradation</b> <b>failure</b> {{mechanism}} for CMOS device such as hot-carrier injection, breakdown of thin oxides, electro-migration and NBTI (Negative Bias Temperature Instability) induced damage {{become a major}} reliability concern. Physics-of-Failure method is used in lifetime prediction of nano scale CMOS, which integrates loading condition, package, geometry and material with time-to-failure. Common lifetime models for these mechanisms are described and a method to estimate lifetime of nano-scale CMOS device, with simulation based on Physics-of-Failure. Through Failure Mode, Mechanism and Effect Analysis, failure mechanism and lifetime models are clarified and selected, as well as structure, material, processing parameters and environment conditions. Stress analysis, which includes electrical stress by EDA and thermal analysis by FEA (Finite Element Analysis) are carried out to acquire parameters in lifetime model. Damage accumulation algorism and competing theory are utilized to predict lifetime of the device. This method will help CMOS device design engineers better understand the failure mechanisms in nano-scale and take design-for-reliability measures...|$|E
