40|$|Qualitative <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> an {{integral}} part of business valuation practice. These <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> often viewed with suspicion as being "subjective" and more prone to bias than quantitative procedures. These <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not subjective and not necessarily biased. However, qualitative <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> often a source of bias and their abuse can and often does lead to wildly inconsistent results in actual practice. The solution to this problem is not the elimination of qualitative <b>judgments.</b> This <b>is</b> neither desirable nor possible. Two approaches to the treatment of qualitative judgments may reduce their misuse: first, judicious limiting of acceptable choices in making particular judgments and second, the breaking down of large qualitative judgments into smaller components by wider use of ordinal scale. ...|$|R

50|$|The seven Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> {{similar in}} nature to the Trumpet judgments, {{but far more}} serious for {{there will be no}} warning when they come. In addition, there are three key {{differences}} between the Trumpet judgments and the Vial/Bowl judgments: firstly, the Trumpet <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> plagues that bring partial devastation and plagues upon 1/3 of nature and people, while the Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> more severe direct assaults against humanity and nature, thus bringing more chaos on the earth than the Trumpet judgments. Lastly, the Trumpet judgments offer a possibility of redemption and repentance, while the Vial judgments do not; the Vial <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> a literal assault on those who have taken the mark of the Beast, and to those who are considered incorrigibles and arrogantly unrepentant, thus making them impossible to save. The Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> listed below.|$|R
5|$|Singapore's Prime Minister is the Head of the Government of Singapore. The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in his <b>judgment,</b> <b>is</b> {{likely to}} command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. This is a power that the President exercises in his personal discretion. The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament. These Ministers, together with the Prime Minister, form the Cabinet. The Cabinet has the general direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) is {{the chief}} mate aboard the colony ship Covenant and the husband of Kariine Oram. With Branson's death {{as a result of}} the {{neutrino}} flair from the nearby star, Christopher becomes the captain of Covenant, though he perceives his command as being questioned by Daniels and the other crew members. When Shaw's transmission is received from the habitable Engineer home world, Christopher orders Covenant to divert to the planet, though his <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> met with protests from Daniels. After leading a ground expedition to the crashed Engineer ship, Christopher returns to the lander to see it explode. Christopher accepts David's aid on behalf of the survivors and accompanies David back to his base. He searches for Rosenthal, who he finds decapitated, along with David communicating with the Neomorph that killed her. Christopher kills the Neomorph and holds David at gunpoint, demanding an explanation for his activities. David leads him to his makeshift laboratory, as well as a hatchery, where he keeps a number of Alien eggs. David goads Christopher into approaching an egg, which results in a Facehugger attacking and impregnating him. Christopher is awoken a short time later by David, only to have the first Alien chestburster erupt from his chest, killing him.|$|E

25|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer, a <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> a {{combination}} or separation {{of two or}} more concepts. If a <b>judgment</b> <b>is</b> to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground). Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or formal. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has transcendental truth.|$|E

40|$|Accounts of {{arguments}} from expert opinion {{take it for}} granted that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> reliable, and so an argument that proceeds from premises about what an expert judges to a conclusion that the expert is probably right is a strong argument. In my (2013), I considered a potential justification for this assumption, namely, that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be true than novice judgments, and discussed empirical evidence suggesting that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not more reliable than novice judgments or even chance. In this paper, I consider another potential justification for this assumption, namely, that expert <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> not influenced by the kinds of cognitive biases novice <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> influenced by, and discuss empirical evidence suggesting that experts are vulnerable to pretty much the same kinds of cognitive biases as novices. If this is correct, then the basic assumption at the core of accounts {{of arguments}} from expert opinion remains unjustified...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} tested a model {{proposed}} by Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel, & Rupp (2001), which suggests {{two types of}} justice judgments: event based and social entity. Event based judgments encompass an individual’s feelings about the fairness of a single event, for example, a pay raise decision. Social entity judgments evaluate the general fairness of a social entity and transcend any particular event. These two types of <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> examined via 1) a quantitative field study with 331 undergraduate students and 2) qualitative interviews with 25 undergraduate students. As predicted, both qualitative and quantitative findings indicate that {{the two types of}} <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> distinct yet related constructs. First, event based and social entity <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> significantly positively correlated with one another. Second, event based and social entity judgments emerged as separate factors in a factor analysis. Third, there was evidence that both types of <b>judgments</b> <b>are</b> made using different information. Fourth, in some cases, the two types of <b>judgments</b> <b>were</b> differentially related to outcomes. Fifth, results indicated that event based <b>judgments</b> may <b>be</b> used to form social entity ones through cognitive averaging.
