5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it {{is found in the}} eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> pores. The stem has coarse, <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} days, the line's colours were: funnels– <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> with black top and thin black band; hulls– black with white boot topping. During the Second World War, ships were painted in battleship grey {{and the names}} were deleted for security, except when in friendly ports. From the 1960s onwards, some ships' hulls were painted light grey and others red.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E

Three rows of whorled <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> bracts surround the flowerheads.|$|E
5|$|The President of Lithuania {{was officially}} given a {{standard}} by the Seimas in 1993. The standard is the State Emblem of Lithuania {{charged in the}} center on a single-color background.

5|$|The dense, bow-like {{lamellae}} are pale-orange to pale-ochre {{and on the}} stipe basifixed {{or slightly}} decurrent. They are brittle and intermixed with shorter lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) as well as partly forking near the stem. In old age or in cases of injury they receive initially <b>dark</b> <b>red,</b> later grey green spots. The spore print is pale ochre.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E

5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, <b>dark</b> <b>red.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, {{including}} tracks 1 and 2 {{and the two}} original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire safety system, improved emergency exits and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in <b>dark</b> <b>red.</b> Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches and new tracks.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large <b>dark</b> <b>red</b> area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly {{a higher proportion of}} crystalline ice.
