500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then you will have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} distributed under the title Cop Killer, named for {{the song of the}} same name, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song [...] "KKK Bitch" [...] to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count, but did not remove the song. In an article for the Washington Post, Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like [...] "Cop Killer," [...] writing that [...] "Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right." [...] The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written {{from the point of view}} of a fictional character, and told reporters that [...] "I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But I never did it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," [...] in reference to Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".|$|E

2500|$|Korine's {{next project}} was the crime drama Spring Breakers, which was {{produced}} in 2012 in Florida, and starred James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Korine's wife, Rachel Korine. In looking at early scenes being filmed and in speaking toward the plot, cast, and earlier works of the filmmaker, Indiewire wrote [...] "this might be the weirdest movie the director has ever made simply by nature of being totally unlike his previous work." [...] "That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways {{may seem like a}} cop-out, but only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold."

Spring Breakers received its world premiere at the 2012 Venice International Film Festival, and later was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival before being released to the general public in March 2013.|$|E
2500|$|From late 1941 the Japanese {{began to}} profess {{increasing}} {{support for the}} Indian Independence movement. Exiles like Rash Behari Bose had already voiced their demands to the Japanese authorities that support and pursuit of Indian Independence be an aim of the Japanese campaign, but neither the government nor the Imperial Japanese army were able to commit to these earlier. Militarily, India was important as the origin (from Assam) of the Ledo road which supplied Nationalist Chinese and American forces, {{as well as the}} supplies airlifted over the hump. Also, the idea that the western boundary of Japan's empire would be controlled by a more friendly government was attractive. It would also have been consistent with the idea that Japanese expansion into Asia was {{part of an effort to}} support Asian government of Asia and against western colonialism. Nonetheless the task of [...] establishing a stable orderly state if the independence movement succeeded would be enormous. The army would be occupied in China and the Manchuria-Russia border and in the newly occupied territories. It was widely accepted that the Congress was anti-Japanese. Gandhi, even during the intense Quit India Movement, had categorically warned the Japanese [...] "Make no mistake. You will be sadly disillusioned <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you will receive a willing welcome from India" [...] However, in April 1941, the Consul General to Calcutta had noted activities of the Forward Bloc. From Berlin, ambassador Oshima Hiroshi had reported on Subhas Bose's organisation of the Free India Legion.|$|E

2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] That was why he was destroyed."' [...] Now, this woman is still by your side. [...] I believe it is that Your Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this is wrong, {{you are the one}} who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it." [...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E
