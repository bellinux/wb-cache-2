5000|$|Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) {{defined a}} harmonically {{consonant}} interval {{as one in}} which the two pitches have an upper partial (an overtone) in common This essentially defines all seconds and sevenths as dissonant, and the above thirds, fourths, <b>fifths,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sixths</b> as consonant.|$|R
50|$|As {{compared}} with 31-et, 34-et reduces the combined mistuning from the theoretically ideal just thirds, <b>fifths</b> <b>and</b> <b>sixths</b> from 11.9 to 7.9 cents. Its <b>fifths</b> <b>and</b> <b>sixths</b> are markedly better, and its thirds only slightly {{further from the}} theoretical ideal of the 5:4 ratio. Viewed in light of Western diatonic theory, the three extra steps (of 34-et compared to 31-et) in effect widen the intervals between C and D, F and G, and A and B, thus making a distinction between major tones, ratio 9:8 and minor tones, ratio 10:9. This can be regarded either as a resource or as a problem, making modulation in the contemporary Western sense more complex. As the number of divisions of the octave is even, the exact halving of the octave (600 cents) appears, as in 12-et. Unlike 31-et, 34 does not give an approximation to the harmonic seventh, ratio 7:4.|$|R
