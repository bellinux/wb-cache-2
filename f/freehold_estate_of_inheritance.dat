50|$|In law, a {{base fee}} is a <b>freehold</b> <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> which is limited or {{qualified}} by {{the existence of}} certain conditions. In modern property law the commonest example of a base fee is an estate created by a tenant in tail, not in possession, who bars the entail {{without the consent of}} the protector of the settlement. Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future tenants in tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the base fee) thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail. The base fee can be defined as rights that would last {{for as long as the}} fee tail would have lasted, but which will end when the line of descent stipulated in the fee tail ran out.|$|E

In 1889 Fassifern was included among the Wienholt family's pastoral properties floated as The Wienholt <b>Estates</b> Company <b>of</b> Australia Limited with a company capital of £500,000.

60|$|To {{begin with}} the first great {{instrument}} of national happiness and strength, its industry: I must observe, that, although these penal laws do, indeed, inflict many hardships on those who are obnoxious to them, yet their chief, their most extensive, and most certain operation is upon property. Those civil constitutions which promote industry are such as facilitate the acquisition, secure the holding, enable the fixing, and suffer the alienation of property. Every law which obstructs it {{in any part of}} this distribution is, in proportion to the force and extent of the obstruction, a discouragement to industry. For a law against property is a law against industry,--the latter having always the former, and nothing else, for its object. Now as to the acquisition of landed property, which is the foundation and support of all the other kinds, the laws have disabled three fourths of the inhabitants of Ireland from acquiring any <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for life or years, or any charge whatsoever on which two thirds of the improved yearly value is not reserved for thirty years.|$|R
50|$|From 1290 to {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, there is no statute of the first {{importance}} dealing with real <b>estate.</b> The reign <b>of</b> Henry VIII, like that of Edward I, is signalized by three acts, the effects of which continue to this day. The one which has had the most lasting influence in law is the Statute of Uses, intended to provide against secrecy of sales of land. As a necessary sequel, the Statute of Enrollments required all bargains and sales of land be duly enrolled. Bargain and sale {{was a form of}} equitable transfer which had for some purposes superseded the common law feoffment. It applied only to <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and not to terms of years. The unforeseen effect of the act of 1535, Enrolment of Bargains of Lands, etc. was to establish as the ordinary form of conveyance until 1841 the conveyance by lease and release. Uses having become legal estate by the Statute of Uses, and therefore no longer devisable, the Statute of Wills (explained by the Wills Act of 1542) was passed to remedy this inconvenience. At least as late as 1911, it remained law as to wills made before 1838.|$|R

The success with which the Dean set at defiance all complaints of his conduct, and his brother’s position at Court, caused then a general expectation at Durham and Lichfield {{that he would be}} promoted to the next vacant bishopric.And that was realised in the following year, for when Sir Henry Wood concluded with Lord Treasurer Clifford the treaty for the marriage of his only surviving child Mary to the King’s eldest son by the Duchess of Cleveland, {{it was part of the}} bargain that the vacant bishopric of Lichfield should be given to his brother. Accordingly, the Dean was elected Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry on 9 June 1671, and was consecrated at Lambeth on 2 July by the Archbishop of Canterbury.At the same time and place, Dr. Nathaniel Crew (afterwards Lord Crew and Bishop of Durham) was consecrated Bishop of Oxford. He was a prelate of the same type as Bishop Wood, and resembled him in many circumstances of his career. They were both cadets of influential families, and owed their advancement to family interest at Court without any pretension to professional merit. Both eventually succeeded to great <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> and died without issue.
