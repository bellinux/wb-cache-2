Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E

5|$|Both <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> and {{genetics}} {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. <b>Environmental</b> <b>factors</b> include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance.

The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various <b>environmental</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{elevated}} {{level of}} erythrocyte sodium-lithium (Na-Li) countertransport {{has been suggested}} {{as a predictor of}} predisposition to essential hypertension. In order to evaluate whether a single genetic or <b>environmental</b> <b>factor</b> with large effects explains the mixture of distributions in Na-Li countertransport in the general population, complex segregation analyses were conducted by using 1, 273 individuals more than age 20 years from 276 pedigrees selected without respect to disease risk factors or health status. Either a single genetic locus or a single <b>environmental</b> <b>factor</b> with large gender-specific effects explained the mixture of distributions for Na-Li countertransport in this sample equally well. In the subsample of pedigrees supporting a single-locus etiology, the single genetic locus explained 29. 0 % of the variability in adjusted Na-Li countertransport in males and 16. 6 % of that in females. In a subsample of pedigrees supporting an <b>environmental</b> <b>factor</b> etiology, the <b>environmental</b> <b>factor</b> explained 35. 2 % of the adjusted Na-Li countertransport in males and 20. 5 % of that in females. These results suggest that {{there are at least two}} different explanations for the mixture of distributions in Na-Li countertransport in the general population. Attempts to relate genetic variation in Na-Li countertransport to risk of essential hypertension must consider that the factor with large phenotypic effects on this trait is gender specific and may not be a single major locus in all pedigrees...|$|R
