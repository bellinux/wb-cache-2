5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> an average {{separation}} {{that is of}} the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his MLB debut, the league {{investigated}} Nova and fellow Yankees pitching prospect Wilkins de la Rosa for injecting <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> Vitamin B12. Overall, Nova made seven starts for the Yankees in 2010, pitching to a 1–2 record and a 4.50 ERA. Nova reached the sixth inning only once, however, as he allowed a higher opponents' batting average and ERA in the fifth inning than in the first four. The Yankees did not include Nova on their postseason roster.|$|E

5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a challenge, as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>with</b> Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>with</b> theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.|$|E

5|$|In 1160, Máel Coluim mac Eanric (Malcolm IV), {{king of the}} Scots, forced Fergus into {{retirement}} and brought Galloway under his overlordship.
