5|$|In these {{compliance}} models {{the possibility}} of entities breaking a law has both a likelihood of occurrence and a consequence of occurrence, known as a 'risk event'. Considering entities' likelihood of not complying {{and the consequences of}} their not complying usually provides a 'power distribution' of a <b>few</b> <b>large</b> consequence or higher likelihood clients and many more lower consequence/likelihood ones.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) have only a <b>few</b> <b>large</b> cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} <b>few</b> <b>large</b> islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy {{a wide range of}} {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Dorset {{is largely}} rural with many small villages, <b>few</b> <b>large</b> towns and no cities. The only major urban {{area is the}} South East Dorset conurbation, which is {{situated}} at the south-eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole. It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth, the historic port and borough of Poole, the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages. Bournemouth, the most populous town in the conurbation, {{was established in the}} Georgian era when sea bathing became popular. Poole, the second largest settlement (once the largest town in the county), adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has some of the highest land values by area in the world.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue {{from the}} South African tour {{affected}} Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs {{at an average}} of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played <b>few</b> <b>large</b> innings, but was very effective in high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>large</b> {{cities of}} Nebraska not located along either the Platte River or the Missouri River. The city was {{originally}} laid out near Salt Creek and among the nearly flat saline wetlands of northern Lancaster County. The city's growth over the years has led to development of the surrounding land, much of which is composed of gently rolling hills. In recent years, Lincoln's northward growth has encroached on the habitat of the endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle.|$|E
5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, {{or more than}} one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A <b>few</b> <b>large</b> nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{badly damaged}} the {{remaining}} duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and {{leaving only a}} <b>few</b> <b>large</b> farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although {{there is only one}} surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.|$|E
50|$|The codings {{generated}} by algorithms implementing a linear generative {{model can be}} classified into codings with soft sparseness and those with hard sparseness. These refer to the distribution of basis vector coefficients for typical inputs. A coding with soft sparseness has a smooth Gaussian-like distribution, but peakier than Gaussian, with many zero values, some small absolute values, <b>fewer</b> <b>larger</b> absolute values, and very <b>few</b> very <b>large</b> absolute values. Thus, many of the basis vectors are active. Hard sparseness, on the other hand, indicates {{that there are many}} zero values, no or hardly any small absolute values, <b>fewer</b> <b>larger</b> absolute values, and very <b>few</b> very <b>large</b> absolute values, and thus few of the basis vectors are active. This is appealing from a metabolic perspective: less energy is used when fewer neurons are firing.|$|R

The Humber Estuary and North Sea mark its southern and eastern limits. Archaeological investigations have revealed artefacts and structures from all historical periods since the last ice age. There are <b>few</b> <b>large</b> settlements and no industrial centres. The area is administered from the ancient market and ecclesiastical town of Beverley. Christianity is the religion with the largest following {{in the area and}} there is a higher than average percentage of retired people in residence.|$|E
5|$|The largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, {{which has}} an average {{diameter}} of 203±3.6km. There are <b>few</b> <b>large</b> Jupiter trojans {{in comparison to the}} overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans are the products of collisions by larger Jupiter trojans.|$|E
5|$|A <b>few</b> <b>large</b> {{deposits}} produce or {{produced a}} significant amount of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare-earth element oxides, the largest known deposit. The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare-earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.|$|E

5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a <b>few</b> <b>large</b> species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a <b>few</b> <b>large</b> (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, <b>few</b> <b>large</b> mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American redstart, and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} <b>few</b> <b>large</b> holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|At , Rwanda's {{population}} density is amongst {{the highest in}} Africa. Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the {{population density}}. The population is predominantly rural, with a <b>few</b> <b>large</b> towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country. The only sparsely populated {{area of the country}} is the savanna land in the former province of Umutara and Akagera National Park in the east. Kigali is the largest city, with a population of around one million. Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development. According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is Gisenyi, which lies adjacent to Lake Kivu and the Congolese city of Goma, and has a population of 126,000. Other major towns include Ruhengeri, Butare, and Gitarama, all with populations below 100,000. The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990, to 16.6% in 2006; by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A <b>few</b> <b>large</b> species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly {{around the edge}} of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
