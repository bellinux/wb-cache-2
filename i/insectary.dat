25|$|Alfalfa is {{considered}} an <b>insectary,</b> a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the alfalfa harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop. Harvesting the alfalfa by mowing the entire crop area destroys the insect population, but this can be avoided by mowing in strips so {{that part of the}} growth remains.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "friendly insects" [...] include ladybeetles, bees, ground beetles, hoverflies, and {{parasitic}} wasps. Other {{animals that}} are frequently considered beneficial include lizards, spiders, toads, and humming birds. Beneficial insects are as much as ten times more abundant in the <b>insectary</b> plantings area. Mortality of scale insects (caused by natural enemies) can be double with <b>insectary</b> plantings. In addition, a diversity of <b>insectary</b> plants can increase the population of beneficial insects such that these levels can be sustained even when the <b>insectary</b> plants are removed or die off.|$|E

40|$|Damselflies are {{suitable}} subjects for examination {{of a variety}} of biological questions, but most research has been carried out in the field. Several questions are hard to test because of the uncontrolled conditions inherent in field studies. This can be circumvented by studying populations in semi-natural outdoor <b>insectaries.</b> We assessed the suitability of such <b>insectaries</b> by comparing the survival and adult behaviour of Ischnura elegans (Vander Linden) in <b>insectaries</b> and in the field. Our results showed that damselflies behaved differently under experimental conditions. Nevertheless, outdoor <b>insectaries</b> can be regarded as a valuable tool to elucidate questions concerning life history traits since they offer the possibility to eleminate predation, emi- and immigration and hidden life. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In these studies, we {{determined}} {{the quality of}} Trichogramma parasitoids reared in several Mexican <b>insectaries,</b> evaluated the clonal variability found in Trichogramma pretiosum populations where the infection has gone to fixation, and determined the potential for genetic changes taking place during mass rearing of Trichogramma spp. The results showed that there is substantial potential for adaptation to mass rearing conditions when mass reared populations are initiated with genetically variable populations. In addition, {{we determined}} that inbreeding depression is possible even in species such as Trichogramma pretiosum where their sex determination and normal sibmating mating system would predict a minimal effect of inbreeding. With respect {{to the quality of}} mass reared Trichogramma, we found discrepancy between the reported and the reared specie, presence of unnoticed species replacement, and we found that the reared species barely met the minimum standards suggested by the international organization for biological control/ European community. From the PI-Wolbachia infected population, we found a surprisingly large amount of variability among the different clonal lines when life history measurements were made. In this dissertation, we also outlined several guidelines for <b>insectaries</b> regarding how to maintain high "field quality" of the natural enemies they produce. Finally, our findings of the high diversity of clones in entirely asexual populations may result in a more rational future use of asexual wasps in biological control...|$|R

5000|$|Pediobius foveolatus was {{discovered}} in India, and is native to most of southern Asia and Japan.

In the United States, however, Pediobius foveolatus cannot survive cold winter months because all North American hosts (Mexican bean beetle and Squash beetle, Epilachna borealis) overwinter as adults, not larvae. Therefore, Pediobius foveolatus wasps die off each winter, and must be released annually in order to provide ongoing control of Mexican bean beetle or Squash beetle in the United States.

30|$|Use of {{chemical}} pesticides is {{popular due to}} its rapid control action. However, unrestricted use of pesticides {{is the main reason}} for causing enormous damage to the environment and consumer’s health (Gupta and Dikshit 2010). An eco-friendly alternative is using natural enemies like the egg parasitoids, Trichogramma spp. The genera Trichogramma and Trichogrammatoidea have gained an attention as they are capable of reducing pest damage in corn, cole, rice, sugarcane, vegetables, fruit trees, and stored grains (Li 1994; Smith 1996; Gagnon et al. 2017). Due to their worldwide success, these minute polyphagous endo-parasitoids are being commercially produced. Therefore, the commercial <b>insectaries</b> are challenged with a synchronous production rate during the seasonal high market demands. To address this problem, developing a suitable user-friendly storage protocol becomes mandatory.|$|R
40|$|For many animal groups, {{both sexes}} have been {{reported}} to attempt to mate with members of their own sex.

We tested male mate choice between opposite- and same-sex members in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Binary choice experiments were conducted following exposure periods in <b>insectaries</b> with only males or with both sexes present. We show that switches in choice between the opposite sex and the same sex can be induced and reversed again by changing the social context. We argue that the observed reversibility in male-male- and male-female-directed mating behaviour is maladaptive and a consequence of strong selection on a male's ability to alter choice between different female colour morphs. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Many {{members of}} the Apiaceae (formerly known as Umbelliferae) family are {{excellent}} <b>insectary</b> plants. Fennel, angelica, coriander (cilantro), dill, and wild carrot all provide in great number the tiny flowers required by parasitic wasps. Various clovers, yarrow, and rue also attract parasitic and predatory insects. Low-growing plants, such as thyme, rosemary, or mint, provide shelter for ground beetles and other beneficial insects. Composite flowers (daisy and chamomile) and mints (spearmint, peppermint, or catnip) will attract predatory wasps, hoverflies, and robber flies. The wasps will catch caterpillars and grubs to feed their young, while the predatory and parasitic flies attack many kinds of insects, including leafhoppers and caterpillars.|$|E
