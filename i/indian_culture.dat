5|$|Many {{different}} legends tell of her various exploits and marriages, including {{union with}} Shiva.

She is worshipped throughout <b>Indian</b> <b>culture,</b> but mainly in Western India, where temples are devoted to her depicted as Mahalasa, the consort of Khandoba, a regional avatar of Shiva.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the <b>Indian</b> <b>culture.</b> The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E

Muthuswami Dikshitar has sung eulogies of {{the temple}} deities of the Thyagarajaswami temple. There was large influx of the acumen of South <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> to the town during the 17th century CE due to the {{political}} unrest in Thanjavur and increased patronage of the Maratha kings to Thiruvarur, resulting in developments in music and dance.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> resulted {{in the emergence of}} a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.|$|E
5|$|Goodman and Edson were {{strongly}} influenced {{by the use of}} American <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> by Ernest Thompson Seton in his Woodcraft Indians program. They decided to create an honor society of their own at camp that summer, in a manner befitting a boy's interest and understanding. Goodman utilized the appeal of Indian lore and recognition by a Scout's peers as motivational tools. He devised a program where troops chose, at the camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, in the eyes of their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenape—also known as the Delaware—who had once inhabited Treasure Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Greeley {{traveled}} {{across the}} continent to see the West for himself, {{to write about it}} for the Tribune, and to publicize the need for a transcontinental railroad. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. He went to Chicago, then to Lawrence in Kansas Territory, and was unimpressed by the local people. Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to be published in the Tribune, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans, and was sympathetic, but like many of his time, deemed <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> inferior. In California, he explored widely and gave many addresses.|$|E

5|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries, {{the first}} devotional hymns {{were created in}} the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the {{resurgence}} of Hinduism {{and the development of}} all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.|$|E
5|$|Kaling and {{executive}} producer Greg Daniels {{came up with the}} episode idea after Kaling held a Diwali party in 2005 for series staff. She undertook research about <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> and the resulting episode was substituted in place of one that would have been Halloween-themed. The episode was directed by Miguel Arteta. According to Nielsen Media Research, an estimated 8.8 million viewers tuned in; it earned a 4.2/10 rating among adults aged 18 to 49, placing first in this demographic group. Critical reception to the episode was largely positive, with many praising Kaling's writing, Carell's performance, and other comedic elements. As a result of the episode, The Office became the first American comedy series to depict the holiday, and several commentators have credited it with helping introduce Indian customs to American audiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{convenient}} {{location of}} these caves near Mumbai, the Western curiosity for the historic <b>Indian</b> <b>culture,</b> {{and the difficulty}} in reaching sites in infrastructure poor Indian subcontinent, made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope. This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} Kerala is {{composite}} and cosmopolitan {{in nature and}} it {{is an integral part of}} <b>Indian</b> <b>culture.</b> It is synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people. It has been elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures. However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions. Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar, a solar calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified <b>Indian</b> <b>culture.</b> Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept {{of what it means to}} be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, South Dakota has a total {{primary and}} {{secondary}} school enrollment of 136,872, with 120,278 of these students being educated {{in the public school}} system. There are 703 public schools in 168 school districts, giving South Dakota the highest number of schools per capita in the United States. The current high school graduation rate is 89.9%, and the average ACT score is 21.8, slightly above the national average of 21.1. 89.8% of the adult population has earned at least a high school diploma, and 25.8% has earned a bachelor's degree or higher. South Dakota's 2008 average public school teacher salary of $36,674, compared to a national average of $52,308, was the lowest in the nation. In 2007 South Dakota passed legislation modeled after Montana's Indian Education for All Act (1999), mandating education about Native American tribal history, culture, and heritage in all the schools, from pre-school through college, in an effort to increase knowledge and appreciation about <b>Indian</b> <b>culture</b> among all residents of the state, as well as to reinforce Indian students' understanding of their own cultures' contributions.|$|E
