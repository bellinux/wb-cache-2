40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of {{glyceryl trinitrate}} {{are still not}} completely understood. The substance disappears rapidly from plasma largely by extrahepatic mechanisms. It is converted in glyceryl dinitrates and glyceryl mononitrates. After transdermal application of a controlled delivery system, plasma concentrations of glyceryl trinitrate can be maintained over the time period of application but, as for other routes, there are important intra- and inter-individual variations and fluctuations. Isosorbide dinitrate disappears less rapidly from the body; it is converted to the <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrates.</b> Plasma concentations of <b>isosorbide</b> dinitrate and <b>mononitrates</b> are quite predictable in different circumstances, e. g. on application of oral sustained release formulations. Measurement of the plasma concentrations of nitrates {{has been used to}} characterize different preparations and routes of administration. However, these plasma concentrations cannot be used to predict the effect, probably because of the important counter-regulation and tolerance which develop rapidly after administration of the drugs.

40|$|Background/Objective: Chronic {{anal fissure}} is a painful {{condition}} that {{is associated with}} an increase in internal anal sphincter pressure. The main aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of topical <b>isosorbide</b> 5 <b>mononitrate</b> and topical diltiazem, when administered either as single agents or in combination, in the treatment of anal fissure. Methods: Patients with chronic anal fissure were enrolled in the study. They were randomized into three groups: Group A (0. 2 % <b>isosorbide</b> 5 <b>mononitrate</b> users), Group B (2 % diltiazem users), and Group C (2 %diltiazem +  0. 2 % <b>isosorbide</b> 5 <b>mononitrate</b> users). Pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). Level of strain during defecation was graded on a 4 -point scale. Results: A total of 55 patients were enrolled in the study. The average ages of patients in Groups A, B, and C were 37. 94  ±  16. 19, 42. 83  ±  13. 21, 40  ±  13. 58 years, respectively. After treatment, pain completely abated in 55. 6 % of patients in Group A, 27. 8 % (n =  5) in Group B, and 42. 1 % (n =  8) in Group C. The decreases in average VAS values prior to and after treatment in Groups A, B, and C were statistically significant (p values 0. 0001, 0. 001, and 0. 0001, respectively). Average strain scores prior to and after treatment were 2. 11 / 0. 72 for Group A, 2. 17 / 0. 94 for Group B, and 1. 95 / 0. 47 for Group C. Strain during defecation prior to and after treatment in Groups A, B, and C was statistically significant (p values 0. 001, 0. 001, and 0. 003, respectively). Conclusion: Topical diltiazem and a combination of nitrate and diltiazem can be used in the treatment of anal fissure. However, the agents are not significantly superior each other...|$|R
40|$|We tested {{whether the}} known {{cytochrome}} c oxidase (COX) inhibition by nitric oxide (NO) could be quantified by VO 2 kinetics during constant load supra-Anaerobic Threshold (AT) exercises in healthy trained or untrained subjects following aerobic training or nitrate administration. In cycle ergometer constant load exercises supra-AT, identified in previous incremental tests, VO 2 kinetics describe a double exponential curve, one rapid and one appreciably slower, allowing {{the area between}} them to be calculate in O 2 l. After training, with increased NO availability, this area decreases in inverse ratio to treatment efficacy. In fact, in 11 healthy subjects after aerobic training for 6 - 7 weeks, area was decreased on average by 51 %. In 11 untrained subjects, following the assumption of an NO donor, 20 mg <b>isosorbide</b> 5 <b>mononitrate,</b> area was decreased on average by 53 %.

40|$|Safety {{has been}} {{assessed}} {{in a total}} of 1680 subjects who were treated with nicorandil, with 458 patient years of exposure to treatment. Adverse events usually occurred early in the course of treatment. After 30 days of treatment, fewer than 10 % of patients reported adverse events. At the recommended doses, the main side effects were limited to headaches. Nearly all episodes of headache were experienced during the first days of nicorandil treatment and were responsible for most of the study withdrawals because of clinical non-acceptability. The incidence can be diminished by a progressive titration. In comparative trials with anti-anginal agents, such as propranolol, diltiazem, nifedipine, ISDN and <b>isosorbide</b> 5 <b>mononitrate,</b> the overall incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between nicorandil and the reference drug. Side-effect distribution was comparable between nicorandil (32 %) and diltiazem (30 %). Nicorandil can be safely combined with other anti-anginal drugs. Furthermore, due to its favourable pharmacokinetics, nicorandil is less likely to have interactions when combined with another therapeutic agent. Nearly one-third of the patients enrolled in the nicorandil clinical programme were 65 years old or older. Age-specific side-effects were not identified, and overall, the incidence of the most frequent adverse events in the elderly was similar. There is no evidence that nicorandil inducesproarrhythmia, exacerbation ofmyocardial ischaemia or abrupt withdrawal syndrome. With the progressive titration scheme, no symptomatic decrease in blood pressure was recorded when nicorandil was administered in the range of 10 - 80 mg. day' 1. Heart rate was not significantly affected in the same dose range. Long-term treatment with nicorandil did not induce oedema or weight gain.

25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our aim was {{to assess}} the effects of vaginally {{administered}} <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate</b> (a nitricoxide donor) on maternal and fetal hemodynamics in pregnant women at term. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial. Women were randomly selected to receive vaginally administered <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate,</b> 20 mg (n = 13) or 40 mg (n = 11), or to undergo a vaginal ex amination only (n = 12). Maternal pulse, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate were recorded at baseline and then every 30 minutes until 360 minutes. Umbilical artery resistance index and pulsatility index measurements were performed at 0, 180, and 330 minutes. RESULTS: Maternal pulse rate was greater after the administration of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate,</b> 20 or 40 mg, compared with the pulse rate in the vaginal examination-only group (greatest difference in means, 21 beats/min; P <. 01). Maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressures were greater in the 20 -mg and 40 -mg <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate</b> groups than in the vaginal examination-only group (greatest difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 15 and 16 mm Hg, respectively; P < : 02 and P <. 001, respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of a nitric oxide donor (<b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate)</b> and a prostaglandin E 1 analogue (misoprostol) for cervical priming before suction termination of pregnancy. METHODS: This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred twenty-six healthy women requesting termination of pregnancy between 9 and 12 weeks' gestation were recruited. Women were randomized into three groups: control, <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate,</b> and misoprostol. All women were given moistened intravaginal study drugs (placebo, 40 mg of <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate,</b> or 400 μg of misoprostol) 4 - 6 hours before suction evacuation. Side effects were assessed 3 hours after drug administration. The cervical dilatation and the cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm were measured by a cervical tonometer before suction evacuation. Operative blood loss was measured after sieving off the products of gestation. RESULTS: There were no differences in the baseline cervical dilatation, cumulative force, and operative blood loss between the <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate</b> and placebo groups. However, women in the misoprostol group had a significantly greater cervical dilatation, required less cumulative force, and had less blood loss than women in the <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate</b> or control group. The majority (more than 80 %) of women in all three groups found their cervical priming agents acceptable. CONCLUSION: Intravaginal <b>isosorbide</b> <b>mononitrate</b> was less effective than misoprostol in cervical ripening before suction termination of pregnancy. © 2003 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
