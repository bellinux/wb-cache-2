5|$|Ocular hypertelorism: Wideset eyes, {{which lead}} to a similar <b>facial</b> {{resemblance}} between patients. <b>Facial</b> abnormalities are the second highest occurring symptom after the lentigines. Abnormalities also include: broad nasal root, prognathism (protruding lower jaw), or low-set, possibly rotated, ears.|$|E
5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have <b>facial</b> color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction can be easily identified, although this is often {{not the case in}} other canid species. In 2014, a study compared the <b>facial</b> color pattern across 25 canid species. The results suggested that the <b>facial</b> color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E

5|$|Sheep can {{recognize}} individual human and ovine faces, and remember them for years. In addition to long-term <b>facial</b> recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through <b>facial</b> characteristics. If worked with patiently, sheep may learn {{their names and}} many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. Sheep have also responded well to clicker training. Sheep {{have been used as}} pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.|$|E

2500|$|Predating {{the modern}} age of pornography, <b>facials</b> were {{described}} in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing <b>facials</b> in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads [...] "... I show them my prick, {{then what do you}} suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face... That's my passion my child, I have no other... and you're about to behold it." ...|$|R

25|$|Bell's palsy occurs {{due to a}} {{malfunction}} of the <b>facial</b> nerve (VII cranial nerve), {{which controls}} {{the muscles of the}} face. <b>Facial</b> palsy is typified by inability to control movement in the muscles of <b>facial</b> expression.

25|$|Lyme {{disease may}} produce <b>facial</b> palsy. Sometimes the <b>facial</b> palsy {{occurs at the}} same time as the classic {{erythema}} migrans rash. Other times, it occurs later. In areas where Lyme disease is common, it may be the cause of <b>facial</b> palsy in half of cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Facial</b> {{fractures}} {{are distributed}} {{in a fairly}} normal curve by age, with a peak incidence occurring between ages 20 and 40, and children under 12 suffering only 5–10% of all <b>facial</b> fractures. Most <b>facial</b> trauma in children involves lacerations and soft tissue injuries. There are several reasons for the lower incidence of <b>facial</b> fractures in children: the face is smaller {{in relation to the}} rest of the head, children are less often in some situations associated with <b>facial</b> fractures such as occupational and motor vehicle hazards, there is a lower proportion of cortical bone to cancellous bone in children's faces, poorly developed sinuses make the bones stronger, and fat pads provide protection for the <b>facial</b> bones.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} {{that as a result}} of {{inflammation}} of the <b>facial</b> nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with <b>facial</b> palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the <b>facial</b> nerve. Babies can be born with <b>facial</b> palsy. In a few cases, bilateral <b>facial</b> palsy has been associated with acute HIV infection.|$|E

25|$|<b>Facial</b> {{expressions}} {{can provide}} rapid {{feedback on the}} progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may {{be able to do the}} same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of <b>facial</b> expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber <b>facial</b> coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos). The coating and servos are built on a metal skull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their <b>facial</b> expression and body language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of <b>facial</b> expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Facial</b> {{retraining}} therapy builds {{upon the}} idea that neurons are constantly in a dynamic state. In other words, there is constant growth and regression of neuronal projections dependent on the stimuli produced. To reduce synkinesis, <b>facial</b> retraining teaches the patient techniques for increasing wanted movements while focusing on restricting unwanted movement. If, for example, the mouth moves whenever the eyes blink voluntarily, <b>facial</b> retraining techniques will teach the patient to slowly close the eyes while actively focusing on keeping the mouth muscles still. <b>Facial</b> retraining has shown to be very successful with almost a 60-70% average decrease in synkinesis reported after 7 months.|$|E
25|$|The <b>facial</b> {{features}} of 1p36 deletion syndrome {{have been considered}} to be characteristic, although few patients have been diagnosed {{solely on the basis}} of <b>facial</b> appearance. These features may include microcephaly, small, possibly slanted, deep-set eyes, a flat nose and nasal bridge, anomalous, low-set and small ears, a small mouth with down-turned corners and a pointed chin. Distinguishing features in another study were a large or late-closing anterior fontanelle (up to 85% of patients) and <b>facial</b> asymmetry.|$|E
