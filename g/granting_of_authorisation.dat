40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{administrative}} procedures for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> for the siting of wind farms in Spain, currently the competency of regional authorities. The analysis reveals some commonalities and differences between the procedures across regions. Furthermore, some aspects regarding these procedures have raised the concern of different stakeholders, including the central government and wind energy investors. A conflict between the interests of the central and regional governments can be observed. Lack of coordination between the different administrative levels and the "more is better mentality" of regional authorities have led to a significant growth of wind energy requests for the (national) feed-in tariff. In turn, investors have complained about the discretionarity and non-transparency of those procedures and the lack of homogeneity across regions. This is likely to result in delays, uncertainty for investors and higher transaction costs. Although there has been a trend to a model which involves the use of multicriteria bidding procedures with more explicit, objective and precise criteria regarding project selection, the aforementioned problems suggest the need to improve coordination between the different administrative levels.

50|$|Particularly {{important}} was the archaeological research programme known in scientific literature as the “Andalusian Model of Archaeology”. It was based on considering archaeology as an instrument for researching history that was tied to the management of heritage, contributing to site preservation and facilitating yearly dissemination of the results. The model started to be implemented in 1984 {{with the creation of}} the Andalusian Commission of Archaeology, the definition of the figure of provincial archaeologists and the publication of the order to regulate the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> to carry out archaeological activities. in 1985. The originality of this commission was that, as an advisory body composed of independent archaeologists, its agreements were always taken into consideration for the <b>authorisation</b> <b>of</b> the so-called systematic archaeological actions and projects. Coordination with provincial archaeologists was furthered via a series of regular meetings for exchanging experiences, consolidating criteria for activities and receiving suggestions concerning the management model. A whole new generation of young university professors, led by Arturo Ruiz Rodríguez, carried out a process of establishing a practice of archaeological management, an example in the Spain of the autonomous regions and a subject of observation and study in other countries. The model was extremely flexible, but as it developed it exposed the real disconnect between the fields of pure research and management, between the interest in preserving heritage as a property in and of itself and the speculation of urban projects, the difficulty in assigning responsibilities and roles among the different local and regional administrations acting together in practice… The situation which would finally speed up the crisis of the model in October 1987 was the conflict that arose in La Marina Plaza in Málaga, when the city council started to tear down some spectacular walls for the construction of an underground car park. The General Direction of Cultural Properties paralysed construction work and carried out an extensive archaeological intervention that justified the need to preserve the aforementioned walls. The administrations tried to reach an agreement, but political criteria finally took precedence over technical criteria; the result was the immediate dismissal of Bartolomé Ruiz in May 1988.|$|R

40|$|Licensing {{represents}} one of the modern techniques most often used as an environmental protection means. In concrete, this technique is envisaged in the obligation of obtaining an authorization (lato sensu) in order to develop a certain activity or to use a product or service that is considered to attain an ecological risk, respectively the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> permits, licences, <b>authorisations</b> or certifications. Authorisation (licensing) is based on the Environmental Impact Assessment, which is a constitutive part of the authorization process, as the conclusions of the environmental impact assessment study are conditioning the result of the authorization process. In order to attain a panoramic and complete reflection of the authorization as an environmental protection legal instrument, we consider to be highly useful the presentation of two transversal instruments, characterised of proactive operativity, a high degree of participation {{on the part of the}} involved subjects and a high level of environmental protection that they tend to attain. Basically, these two instruments are Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment...|$|R

30|$|A European Commission Recommendation of 2003 {{sets out}} {{guidelines}} {{for the development of}} national strategies and best practices to ensure the co-existence of genetically modified organism (GMO) agriculture with conventional and organic farming [1]. The aim of the recommendation is to ensure that agricultural methods not using GMOs shall persist side by side with GMO-based methods [2]. Co-existence shall ensure that farmers, industry, commerce and consumers have a free choice between conventional, organic and GMO crops [3]. This definition of co-existence shows that the basic idea of co-existence is the economic concern, not however environmental and health risks, as being emphasised by the traditional GMO law. The latter is dealt with by Directive 2001 / 18 /EC [4] on the deliberate release of GMOs and Regulation 1829 / 03 [5] on genetically modified food and feed including seed (IT is controversial whether seed is comprised by the Regulation. However, it is common practice) [6]. Article 4 of the Directive states that the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> an <b>authorisation</b> for the deliberate release of a GMO shall only be given, if a comprehensive risk assessment shows that there are no risks to the environment or health, or that the existing risks can be managed by appropriate measures, within the framework of risk management [7]. The same is done by Art. 4 of Regulation 1829 / 03. Separated from this risk-based approach, co-existence (even though it should implicitly serve to minimise environmental or health risks, too) aims at the protection of real assets: the possibility to sell products as GMO free.|$|R

30|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{treatment}} of NSCLC has dramatically changed. Currently, the treatment’s choice {{is based on a}} careful assessment of tumor histology and, most importantly, of biological characteristics, specifically of the EGFR and ALK status. EGFR mutations identify a distinct subgroup of NSCLC which benefit from a first line treatment with first generation EGFR-TKIs, as clearly evidenced by several phase III trials. Second generation TKIs are new agents currently under investigation with the intent to improve the efficacy in the first line setting and to provide a valid treatment option in the acquired resistance setting. New inhibitors such as dacomitinib and afatinib differ from first generation EGFR-TKIs because they form irreversible link to the EGFR kinase domain and inhibit other receptors (i.e. HER 2 and HER 4). The potential superiority of dacomitinib versus erlotinib in KRAS wild-type NSCLC is currently under investigation in a large phase III trial. Afatinib demonstrated superiority versus standard chemotherapy in two phase III studies and {{based on the results of}} the LUX LUNG 3 trial, Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the drug for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbored EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L 858 R) substitution mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test, specifically the therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR Kit (QIAGEN).

40|$|Abstract. Trust Management is an {{approach}} to construct and interpret the trust relationships among public-keys {{that are used to}} mediate security-critical actions. Cryptographic credentials are used to specify delegation <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> among public keys. Existing trust management schemes are operational in nature, defining security in terms of specific controls such as delegation chains, threshold schemes, and so forth. However, they tend not to consider whether a particular authorisation policy is well designed in the sense that a principle cannot somehow bypass the intent of a complex series <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> delegations via some unexpected circuitous route. In this paper we consider the problem <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> subterfuge, whereby, in a poorly designed system, delegation chains that are used by principals to prove authorisation may not actually reflect the original intention of all {{of the participants in the}} chain. A logic is proposed that provides a systematic way of determining whether a particular delegation scheme using particular authorisation is sufficiently robust to be able to withstand attempts at subterfuge. This logic provides a new characterisation of certificate reduction that, we argue, is more appropriate to open systems. ...|$|R
