5|$|The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) {{mainframe}} computer {{was built in}} the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory between 1946 and 6 May 1949, when it ran its first program, and remained in use until 11 July 1958. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human-computer interaction, Alexander S. Douglas, a <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidate</b> in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we outline {{factors to}} {{consider}} when organizing writing groups for off-campus <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates,</b> identifying possible design options and the broader considerations that should inform which options are taken. We begin by reviewing issues typically faced by <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates</b> pursuing their degrees at a distance, such as social isolation and limited access to resources and communities of practice. We then draw on prior studies on doctoral education to discuss ways of meeting the logistical, sustainability and pedagogical demands to be considered by institutions seeking to improve the experience of their off-campus <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates.</b> We argue that writing groups conducted via CMC tools {{have the potential to}} address a number of the issues identified and conclude by outlining a framework capable of informing relevant stakeholders in designing writing groups for off-campus <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates.</b> 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In policy debates {{related to}} {{innovation}} potential, the limited mobility from academia to industry is often {{explained by the}} supposed mismatch of skills needed in these different settings. We contribute to this debate by (1) examining the attitudes of Flemish <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates</b> towards careers in industry; and (2) by analysing {{the extent to which}} <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates</b> and employers in industry in Flanders differ in their views on the skills needed to perform well in this sector. We combined survey data with qualitative research. The Survey of Junior Researchers provides information on the doctoral candidates’ perspective on these matters, whereas the Research & Development Survey of Flemish companies reflects the employers’ views. Additional data obtained through interviews with both doctorate holders and employers provide a more in depth understanding of the transition from academia to industry. A mismatch between what <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates</b> consider important skills for a job in industry, and what employers expect from researchers is observed. The importance of technical skills and more transferable competencies such as project management and business skills are underestimated by <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates.</b> The findings raise questions on the awareness among <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates</b> of the skills needed for a career outside academia. Addressing possible negative attitudes, and providing adequate training and career planning could improve their preparation for work in non-academic settings, confirming findings in other countries that institutional programmes {{have a role to play}} in bridging the gap between employers' expectations and those of <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidates...</b>|$|R

25|$|Gay actor Martin Kurath (Prochnow) who is {{in prison}} {{develops}} a friendship with Thomas Manzoni (Hannawald), the 15-year-old son of the prison warden (Lüönd). The two {{fall in love and}} they both yearn for Kurath's release. This triggers intense indignation in their surroundings. After Kurath is released a year later, Thomas accompanied by Kurath, tells his parents he is a homosexual. His father tells him to leave and never return. Kurath and Thomas move in together and Thomas enrolls in school. Thomas' father, however, then has him arrested and condemned to a brutal reformatory. Kurath obtains a fake passport and poses as a psychology <b>doctoral</b> <b>candidate</b> and helps Thomas escape with him to Germany. They are betrayed by a German homosexual friend of Kurath's who insists, in Kurath's absence, that Thomas become his lover in order to obtain a German residency permit. Thomas does so, but then refuses to sleep with the betrayer, is kicked out and prostitutes himself. Broken by these experiences, he voluntarily returns to the reformatory. When he reaches 21 and is released, he is so psychologically damaged that, despite reunion with Kurath, he attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He escapes and the film ends with a TV announcement that the police are looking for him and that the public should, if approaching him, treat him gently, as he is very depressed and confused.|$|E
