The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
2500|$|Along with {{creating}} the book, Williams crafted a hare from 18-carat (75%) gold and jewels, {{in the form}} of a large filigree pendant on a segmented chain. He sealed the hare inside a ceramic, hare-shaped casket (both to protect the prize from the soil, and to foil attempts to locate the treasure with a metal detector). The casket was inscribed with the legend [...] "I am the keeper of the jewel of Masquerade, which lies waiting safe inside me <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> eternity".|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} majority {{inhabitants of}} Taiwan were probably from Southeast Asia and are racially {{similar to the}} Malay group who inhabit Malaysia and Indonesia. Other minority groups to inhabit Taiwan during this time were the Han Chinese, Japanese traders, European explorers, missionaries, and other traders. One origin of law of Aboriginal peoples came from a concept of chongzu 崇祖, or ancestral worship. [...] Ancestral spirits were believed to exist forever and co-exist among the living. [...] It was thought that if you violate customs or taboo, this would possibly result {{in some sort of}} catastrophe and would require subsequent prayer to the ancestors to avoid such a catastrophe from happening again. [...] Breaking the law was thought to have the result of multiple levels of trouble <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> your family. [...] Criminal Law at this time took on the philosophy of “an eye for an eye”. [...] Another important aspect was the concept that traditional customs, no matter what the content, were accepted as normal.|$|E
