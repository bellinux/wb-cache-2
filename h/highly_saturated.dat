Writing was the longest aspect of production, taking up to several months for the crew to conceive the story and draft a script. Animation was comparatively quicker, with the team delivering work in only a few weeks given the digital approach; Jones felt that the animators could to play to the strengths of the fully digital animation process.|$|E

Studies {{have found that}} {{a small number of}} native Tibetan women have a genotype which codes for hemoglobin to be more <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> with oxygen. Natural selection seems to be the main force working on this gene because the mortality rate of offspring is significantly lower for women with higher hemoglobin-oxygen affinity when compared to the mortality rate of offspring from women with low hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. While the exact genotype and mechanism by which this occurs is not yet clear, selection is acting on these women's ability to bind oxygen in low partial pressures, which overall allows them to better sustain crucial metabolic processes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{properties}} of a color, {{such as its}} saturation or lightness, may {{be determined by the}} other substances that accompany pigments. Binders and fillers added to pure pigment chemicals also have their own reflection and absorption patterns, which can affect the final spectrum. Likewise, in pigment/binder mixtures, individual rays of light may not encounter pigment molecules, and may be reflected as is. These stray rays of source light contribute to a slightly less saturated color. Pure pigment allows very little white light to escape, producing a <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> color. A small quantity of pigment mixed with a lot of white binder, however, will appear desaturated and pale, due to the high quantity of escaping white light.|$|E
25|$|When GLUD1 is <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> {{with the}} active site ligands (substrates), an {{inhibitory}} abortive complex {{forms in the}} active site: NAD(P)H.Glu in the oxidative deamination reaction at high pH, and NAD(P)+.2-oxoglutarate in the reductive amination reaction at low pH. GLUD1 assumes its basal state configuration {{in the absence of}} allosteric effectors, regardless of whether the allosteric sites are functional. The allosteric regulators of GLUD1 - ADP, GTP, Leu, NAD+ and NADH - exert their effects by changing the energy required to open and close the catalytic cleft during enzymic turnover, in other words by destabilizing or stabilizing, respectively, the abortive complexes. Activators are not necessary for the catalytic function of GLUD1, as it is active in the absence of these compounds (basal state). It has been suggested that GLUD1 assumes in its basal state a configuration (open catalytic cleft) that permits catalytic activity regardless of whether the allosteric sites are functional. GLUD regulation is of particular biological importance as exemplified by observations showing that regulatory mutations of GLUD1 are associated with clinical manifestations in children.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Geophysical survey using {{electrical}} resistivity methods {{has been carried}} out within the industrial area of Willeton Perth Western Australia with the view to delineate the geoelectric characteristics of the basement complex and evaluate the groundwater potential in the area. Vertical electrical sounding with ABEM SAS 3000 Terrameter and Schlumberger electrode configuration were employed for data acquisition. Apparent resistivity values obtained from the field measurements were plotted against half current electrodes spacing on a log-log graph while a model was suggested to fit the resistivity distribution presented in the sounding. The results from the modelling were finally iterated to the lowest Root Mean Square RMS percentage error using computer software A 7 point filter derived by Guptasarma to calculate a forward model. Analysis of the results showed that the study area has fairly homogenous subsurface stratification with four distinct subsurface layers above the depth of 37 m. The four subsurface layers comprises top soil mainly of unconsolidated and sand containing organic matter unsaturated sand layer with consolidated and <b>highly</b> resistive water <b>saturated</b> sand layer with <b>highly</b> water <b>saturated</b> soil and the sub-stratum layer consisting of clay material.

Our scheme generates <b>highly</b> nonlinear, <b>saturated</b> neural networks that achieve {{state of the art}} performance on gradient based adversarial examples on MNIST, despite never being exposed to adversarially chosen examples during training. Moreover, these networks exhibit unprecedented robustness to targeted, iterative schemes for generating adversarial examples, including second-order methods. We further identify principles governing how these networks achieve their robustness, drawing on methods from information geometry. We find these networks progressively create highly flat and compressed internal representations that are sensitive to very few input dimensions, while still solving the task. Moreover, they employ highly kurtotic weight distributions, also found in the brain, and we demonstrate how such kurtosis can protect even linear classifiers from adversarial attack.

However, statisti-cal analysis of ERI data indicates that standard deviation and confidence interval of a set of resistivity data measured in the landfill body are significantly larger than those in underlying clays. Moreover, maximum changes of these parameters are found on the boundary between landfill body and underlying soil, thus reflecting natural differences in scattering of resistivity data measured in these two ob-jects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{regions where}} rivers are not {{perennial}} or have low flow conditions during most {{part of the}} year(like banks of the Yellow River), the seepage wells are placed in the riverbed to obtain uninterrupted supply of naturally filtered groundwater through <b>highly</b> permeable <b>saturated</b> riverbed aquifers. Due to the complexities of flow, no exact analytical solution exists to provide steady state discharge drawdown relationship for seepage well. To overcome this difficulty, in this study a numerical model was developed for seepage well by adapting the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and the coupled seepage-pipe flow model. The numerical model is proposed to be applied for groundwater exploitation in Zaolinping Village which locates at Shenmu County, China. By calculation, the water yield of study area is 47600 m 3 /d.

40|$|Understanding fluids {{migration}} and leakage risk along the fault zone {{is necessary to}} guarantee the safety of CO 2 geological storage. The validity of Darcy’s law gets challenged {{in dealing with the}} flow in open fractures since the occurring of turbulence flow. In this study, we develop a 2 D model with usage of T 2 Well, an integrated wellbore-reservoir simulator, to investigate the leakage problem along open fractures which are embedded in a fault zone from the deep injection reservoir to shallow aquifers. The results record a positive feedback of gas expansion and pressure response in fracture, which causes a quick downward propagation of <b>highly</b> gas <b>saturated</b> zone from the top of fracture and an easy gas breakthrough in the shallower aquifers. The decreasing of aperture size of fracture significantly enhances the leakage rates in fracture, but with less influences as aperture increases. In comparison, the Equivalent Porous Media models show a good approximation with the momentum model of large apertures but poor for the small one. Nevertheless, the differences are small in terms of final CO 2 distribution among various aquifers, suggesting that Darcy’s law may be still “effective” in solving flow problem along fractures in a constant injection system at a large time scale...|$|R
