40|$|The {{establishment}} of P. truncatus in Africa has highlighted the inherent weakness of phytosanitary measures against exotic pests. Consideration {{is given to}} the need for phytosanitary measures and how patterns of international trade affect phytosanitary control. To prevent the spread of pests such asP. truncatus, large grain shipments can be subject to stringent pest control procedures. However, a significant proportion of grain movement in Africa, both within countries and across borders, occurs informally by both illicit, commercial movement of multiple truckloads of grain and legally by individuals carrying <b>headloads</b> via bush paths or small parcels on public transport. Attempts to locate and inspect the small lots would be impractical. Some recommendations are given on how the spread of P. truncatus in large-scale international trade can be slowed but otherwise it is accepted that in the long-term the prevention of further spread of P. truncatus in Africa is wholly unrealistic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the importance of}} local knowledge to processes of rural development that involve changes to resource management regimes. The argument reveals that the cultural and economic contexts within which new policies are implemented can lead to unpredictable and unintended impacts that can contradict the objectives of environmental protection initiatives. Whilst local complexities {{make it impossible to}} predict all possible outcomes, planners and managers can nonetheless work with local knowledge in order to tailor initiatives to local contexts. The challenge is to both acquire and employ local cultural and economic feedback. These findings are conveyed through a consideration of <b>headloading</b> (the carrying and marketing of fuelwood) arid its relationship to forest management in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, South India. The data arc derived from six months of fieldwork during which six villages were studied. For the purposes of this paper, a case study of one village, Thaligadde, is employed. culture; economy; forest management; fuelwood; gender; local knowledge. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of wood for fuel and building timber was studied in a 13 000 ha area of Gazankulu, near Giyani. <b>Headloads</b> of firewood {{brought in by}} eight of the 978 families present were monitored during six periods in a year. The two most important sources of firewood are  Colophospermum mopane and  Combretum apiculatum. Firewood consumption is estimated {{at an average of}} 14, 9 kg per family per day. The annual demand for firewood in the whole study area is, therefore, approximately 5 300 tonnes. Living-huts and storage-huts {{in the process of being}} built were examined. The mean volumes of wood in living-huts and typical storage-huts are 1, 30 m 3 and 1, 09 m 3, respectively. 89 living- and 80 storage-huts were built in a year. The demand for finished timber in the study area in that year was approximately 231 tonnes. Timber use has not yet outstripped production, but it will do so soon if alternative timber sources are not provided. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: What is {{the impact}} of modern {{transportation}} technology on long-run economic change in poor countries with high trade costs? Rail construction in colonial Sub-Saharan Africa provides a natural experiment: 90 % of African railroad lines were built before independence, in a context where <b>headloading</b> was the dominant transportation technology. Using new data on railroads and cities over one century within one country, Ghana, and Africa as a whole, we find large permanent effects of transportation technology on economic development. First, colonial railroads had strong effects on commercial agriculture and urban growth before independence. We exploit various identification strategies to ensure these effects are causal. Second, using the fact that African railroads fell largely out of use post-independence, due to mismanagement and lack of maintenance, we show that colonial railroads had a persistent impact on cities. While colonial sunk investments (e. g., schools, hospitals and roads) partly contributed to urban path dependence, evidence suggests that railroad cities persisted because their early emergence served as a mechanism to coordinate contemporary investment...|$|R
40|$|In {{developed}} countries travel time savings {{can account for}} as much as 80 % of the overall benefits arising from transport infrastructure and service improvements. In developing countries they are generally ignored in transport project appraisals, notwithstanding their importance. One of the reasons for ignoring these benefits in the developing countries is that there is insufficient empirical evidence to support the conventional models for valuing travel time where work patterns, particularly of the poor, are diverse {{and it is difficult to}} distinguish between work and non-work activities. The exclusion of time saving benefits may lead to a bias against investment decisions that benefit the poor and understate the poverty reduction potential of transport investments in Least Developed Countries (LDCs). This is because the poor undertake most travel and transport by walking and <b>headloading</b> on local roads, tracks and paths and improvements of local infrastructure and services bring large time saving benefits for them through modal shifts. The paper reports on an empirical study to develop a methodology for valuing rural travel time savings in the LDCs. Apart from identifying the theoretical and empirical issues in valuing travel time savings in the LDCs, the paper presents and discusses the results of an analysis of data from Bangladesh. Some of the study findings challenge the conventional wisdom concerning the time saving values. The Bangladesh study suggests that the western concept of dividing travel time savings into working and non-working time savings is broadly valid in the developing country context. The study validates the use of preference methods in valuing non-working time saving values. However, stated preference (SP) method is more appropriate than revealed preference (RP) method...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{transporting}} {{relatively small}} loads over short distances is one faced by many rural people, {{whether it is}} taking produce to market or bringing food and water to the home. Access to motorized transport and even animal-drawn carts may be unaffordable to many households, while traditional methods of transporting loads, such as <b>headloading,</b> not only require great effort but also carry the risk of injury or more permanent disability. Throughout the developing world a range of lower-cost transport devices has been developed. These include shoulder poles and back frames wheelbarrows and handcarts, carriers and panniers for bicycles, and load-carring panniers for animals and animal-drawn sledges. There is great potential to increase {{the use of these}} technologies by making their details available to more of the people who could benefit from them. Low-cost load-carrying devices looks at these basic transport technologies assessing the cost and possible uses of the different methods. The book contains information on the design and manufacture of such devices, mainly in terms of small-scale production by artisans and small workshops. There are many illustrations of the technologies in use as well as clear drawings showing design details. The book will therefore be of benefit to planners and development agencies as well as to small-scale producers.

40|$|Transport is a {{critical}} input for agricultural production and marketing. The past three decades have been challenging {{for the development of}} efficient transport systems in developing countries. Huge funds and efforts have been devoted to the conventional transport sector but this has clearly had limited impact on accessibility or mobility. Most farmers continue to depend on walking and <b>headloading</b> to move their produce between farms and markets. This hinders the development of agriculture and efficient marketing systems. Intermediate Means of Transports (IMTs) are now seen by many development agencies as a viable option that could induce greater mobility and improve accessibility and help improve agriculture, marketing and other livelihood means in developing areas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the influence of IMTs on agricultural production and marketing in mral areas, focussing on Gomoa District in the Central Region of Ghana. The study examines the impact of a small action research project which involved introduction of selected IMTs in off-road villages. It examines the influence of IMTs over a twenty month period on farm size, location, distribution, productivity patterns, labour and gender issues, utilising a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. The study observed some IMT influence on labour productivity, labour availability and mobility, farm location and distribution, cropping pattern, marketed output and access to markets, though a relatively longer period of time is required in order to fully assess their impact than was available to this study. The impact of IMT on farming was influenced by social relationships, physical characteristics of the villages, including physical access conditions, and the economic and financial conditions of farmers. The influence of IMTs on crop marketing was larger in areas where routes to markets are poor, distance to markets are short, conventional transport service are poor and load volumes are large...|$|R
40|$|The project focusses on the {{problems}} of low productivity and associated poverty in off-road areas (ie: areas away from good paved roads). Off-road rural areas and populations are frequently markedly poorer than those in comparable roadside locations in the same region, at least in part due to problems and costs of market access. Lack of appropriate intermediate rural transport is a common cause of post-harvest loss for many poor households. Evidence of this problem was widely reported in project R 7149 (which focussed on the same districts as the current proposal). Transport availability, reliability and cost were identified as major constraints on access to markets, particularly for women who undertake most of the produce marketing in Ghana. Non-motorised transport was found to consist principally of head-loading. Bicycles were few in number and almost wholy owned by men: the few hand carts in operation were also owned by men. This pattern of poor transport availability, unreliability and high cost, with consequent low usage rates, has particularly severe implications for women. They usually have less funds than men to pay transport fares or purchase vehicles or IMT of any kind, yet they generally have a major responsibility for produce evacuation and marketing in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly West Africa. Generally, the result is overwhelming dependence on <b>headloading</b> of produce by women, from farm to village, and onward {{at least as far as}} the nearest good paved road, with direct effects on their health and time budgets, and with consequent knock-on implications for agricultural productivity. This is a widespread and under-researched development problem. For poverty-focussed development initiatives, off-road communities - and particularly women in off-road communities - will represent an important priority, given the substantial populations resident off-road and the above-average incidence of poverty in such locations. The potential for IMT to alleviate women's transport burden is often suggested, but the difficulties and implications of adoption - in technical, socio-economic and environmental terms - are largely unexplored...|$|R
40|$|Textiles in Africa {{since some}} time {{have become a}} topic of research, much of which is focused on aspects of art. The at least equally {{important}} economic aspects (production, consumption, and trade) are still rather neglected. When doing field research in West Africa {{it is impossible to}} overlook {{the fact that most of}} the textiles in use could not have been produced locally. This applies not only to the colorful printed cottons but as well to handmade textiles. In Asante (Ghana) I found woolen fabrics, which obviously were hand-woven but must have come from somewhere else as sheep and goats in the forest zone have short hair, unsuitable for spinning. I saw such woolen textiles as floor covering in stoolhouses, as material on state umbrellas, nsaa kyinie. of which the most important one is katamanso, protecting the Golden Stool (and being a memorial for the lost battle of Katamanso, 1826), as well as a lining of palanquins or covering of regalia like drums. For certain privileged persons can also be found as bed-covers such heavy blanket-like textiles. They are not only attributed protective but also healing properties. And are considered to be especially precious for this quality. To get even a tiny sample (Menzel 1973, 2 : 760) of an already completely tattered blanket covering the bed of an old lady of rank needed much convincing. The blanket I found bundled up in a stall in Kumasi market in 1973 was completely out of context there, as such textiles were never offered for sale in the open. No information was to be had from the seller; Bernhard Gardi suggested that it Blight have been brought to Ghana by Wogo from Niger, in whose area such blankets were woven (fig. l). My aged Asante informants were unanimous of the opinion that this woolen textile, which they all called nsaa, is the highest ranking of all traditional textiles in Ghana(which should read Asante, as they were giving information about Asante only). According to them, nsaa could only be acquired in esirim, the grasslands of the north (e. g. the Sahel). In Salaga they could be bartered by the representatives of the Asantehene for 40 <b>headloads</b> of each 2000 kola nutsor 5 healthy male slaves, or several ounces of gold dust (equivalent to about Ɛ 8 Sterling). This was the rate of exchange in the “olden days” (before the turn of the century). Prices for more recent acquisitions they did not know. As almost all nsaa I was permitted to see or saw during ceremonies, were more or less threadoare, although they were treated with great care, I assume that supply has ceased even before tourists and the antique market began to take their share in this traditional trade. It would be interesting to know which textile will replace nsaa in its context of Asante culture if no replacements could be made for those worn away...|$|R
