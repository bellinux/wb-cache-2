40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the networked computer use by scholars and to determine whether or not this computer use could facilitate international communication, academic collaboration and increased scholarly productivity. ^ An <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> survey was sent to 1048 biologists scattered across the globe. After adjusting for invalid <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> 731 out of the 1048 surveys were eventually delivered and a total of 333 completed questionnaires were returned yielding a response rate of 45. 6 %. ^ Although this was an extremely homogenous population, many trends emerged. Networked computer use appears to enhance perceived productivity. Collaboration via the computer is valued with respondents reporting their most frequent activities as exchanging work-related messages with colleagues from abroad, reading postings on scholarly/academic discussion groups, and exchanging work-related messages with colleagues at home institutions. Scholars reported benefiting most from exchanging messages with colleagues from abroad and from collaboration with peers. Exchanging messages and collaboration are types of informal communication which is the best means of attaining membership in an invisible college which is a group of geographically scattered academics with common research interests who determine the scholarly direction of a discipline. ^ The more frequently a user exchanged e-mail messages, the more that user perceived gaining benefit in the ability to collaborate. Similarly, those who more frequently exchanged drafts reported higher levels of perceived benefit from enhanced contact with colleagues abroad. ^ Exchanging messages with colleagues abroad associated moderately strongly with English proficiency. Those who reported higher levels of benefit from their CMC use also more strongly believed that CMC is changing the way academic researchers collaborate. ^ These findings lend indirect support to the possibility that the use of networked computers could lead to increased communication, collaboration and productivity on the global level. Results showed informal communication, collaboration and self-perceived productivity are all potentially increased by network computer use. All of these factors could ultimately lead to the opportunity to join an invisible college. ...|$|R

40|$|Lattice gauge {{calculations}} {{predict the}} existence of glueballs. In particular a scalar glueball is firmly expected at a mass of about 1730 MeV. This prediction {{has led to an}} intense study of scalar isoscalar interactions and to the discovery of new meson resonances. The number of scalar states observed seems to exceed the number of states which can be accommodated in the quark model even when two states, the a 0 (980) and f 0 (980), are interpreted as K ¯ K bound states and are removed from the list. However, none of these states has a decay pattern which is consistent with that of a pure glueball. A reasonable interpretation of the number of states and of their decay pattern is found only when mixing of scalar q¯q states with the scalar glueball is taken into account. In this paper we scrutinize the evidence for these states and their production characteristics. The f 0 (1370) - a cornerstone of all q¯q-glueball mixing scenarios- is shown to be likely of nonq¯q nature. The remaining scalar states then do fit into a nonet classification. If this interpretation should be correct there would be no room for resonant scalar gluon-gluon interactions, no room for the scalar glueball. We also discuss the status of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, of mesons which cannot possibly have q¯q structure, and argue that these are, most likely, four-quark states and not excitations of the gluon string providing the binding between quark and antiquark. <b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>address...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} 1) to establish how chiropractors currently use {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{and the extent to}} which they do so, 2) to determine the use of MRI in determining diagnosis and/or treatment of a patient, 3) to examine the role chiropractors see MRI playing within their profession in the future, and 4) to determine the importance of MRI-related material in chiropractic education. Design: Electronic questionnaire. Setting: Non- randomised, voluntary electronic mail. Subjects: Members of the Chiropractors' Association of Australia (CAA National) who have provided their association with an <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>address.</b> Intervention: None. Questions Asked: Participants were asked 13 questions relating to their use of MRI, its usefulness, their training, and their demographics. Results: Seventy six (76) usable, responses were received, with most chiropractors viewing magnetic resonance images 1 to 5 times per month, generally when the patient already has such images. MRI was reported to be useful in determining a patient's diagnosis and treatment plan. Poor availability of referring by chiropractors for MRI was the main factor felt to restrict MRI use. The majority of chiropractors feel that they were not trained adequately in interpreting images produced using MRI. Conclusions: MRI is not used to a large extent within the chiropractic profession, and most practitioners do not actively seek such images. Results amongst respondents suggesting inadequate training may indicate chiropractic education may benefit from integrating more MRI-related material, as most chiropractors believe this modality should be employed to a greater extent in the future. A main limitation of this study is that it relied on the computer literacy skills of the respondents. Having these skills may also indicate a bias towards practitioners with a greater understanding of technology who may be more inclined to utilise new technology such as MRI. 6 page(s...|$|E
