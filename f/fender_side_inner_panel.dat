40|$|Abstract. Wrinkling and {{cracking}} {{are two major}} problems of the automobile <b>inner</b> <b>panel.</b> In this study, the stamping process of an A pillar <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> is studied with the finite element (FE) method, aimed at avoiding drawbacks due to wrinkling {{and cracking}}. The established numerical model is proved accurate by comparing the numerical final configuration to the real part. Then the material flow of the blank is analyzed. It is concluded that blocking of material flow {{is the main reason}} for those two pathologies. Thus, a gap design is suggested to minimize the concerned defects. According to the numerical results, after optimizing, the <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> is free from formability problems...|$|R

50|$|The Carat was {{designed}} by Technoflug around the wings and horizontal tail of the Schempp-Hirth Discus sailplane, marrying these to a new fuselage, fin, undercarriage and engine.. Structurally the aircraft {{is a mixture of}} fibreglass and carbon fibre composites. The wings have PVC foam cores. In plan the wings have parallel chord <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> and two outer sections of increasing straight taper. Winglets are an option. Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are mounted on the upper surfaces of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels,</b> with turbulators on the underside to ensure a controlled boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent flow without separation. The wings have 3° of dihedral.|$|R
50|$|On one of {{his regular}} visits to German glider builders, Teichfuss watched the {{construction}} of high performance aircraft like Hans Jacobs' DFS Reiher. The Turbine design, begun in 1938, was a high performance machine which showed Jakob's influence but was rather simpler to construct. It was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings of strongly straight tapered, elliptically tipped plan. The <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> extended over rather more than one third span and were mounted with about 10° of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons. There were spoilers on the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> at about mid-chord.|$|R

On this basis, three kinds of lightweight materials were selected as the alternative materials for the engine hood.

The research results showed that high strength steel is the top priority material for the SUV engine hood which topology post-optimized...|$|R

30|$|The {{relative}} {{density of the}} cytoskeleton panel in the probing volume may be expressed as the ratio of At% to Ad%, represented as D. As shown in Table  1, the cancerous CaSki cells showed at least a threefold increase in elastic density (D%) of the inner panels; however, the elastic density of the cortical panel decreased by 82  % compared with its normal counterparts. These finding may be attributable to the depolymerization of F-actin at the cell cortex [33] and upregulation of the expression of microtubulin in the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> [37]. Changes in cell stiffness are important for initial adhesive interactions during cell migration in vivo. Disruption of F-actin increases cell adhesion, whereas disruption of tubulin reduces adhesive interactions in vivo [34]. Therefore, lower cortical tension and higher elastic density of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> may increase the adhesive properties of CaSki, thereby facilitating migration and transformation.|$|R
