25|$|Originally, traffic along NY201 emptied into {{a traffic}} circle located in Johnson City near the Susquehanna's north bank. This <b>hazardous</b> <b>situation</b> was {{rectified}} in 2004 when {{the size of}} the traffic circle was reduced to allow for a flyover to be built northwest of the circle. With the flyover in place, traffic on NY201 can continue on the road without entering the traffic circle. The circle is still accessible via exits from the NY201 bypass.|$|E
25|$|Virginia {{does not}} {{recognize}} the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when applied against local governments providing such services, so the civil plaintiff is required {{to prove that the}} local government is responsible for the condition that led to damage or injury. Political subdivisions may waive their sovereign immunity, and wherever and whenever a local government purchases insurance for its vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses, that local government will be ruled to have waived its sovereign immunity up to the amount of the policy. A municipality can be sued for nuisances - the negligent creation of a <b>hazardous</b> <b>situation</b> - even if the nuisance was created in the course of carrying out a governmental function.|$|E
25|$|When Jo and Louisa meet, {{there is}} instant rapport {{between the two}} girls and they become firm friends, and life changes for them both as they become {{caught up in a}} web of intrigue. Following Jo's {{unexpected}} journey through the mirror, a <b>hazardous</b> <b>situation</b> occurs during an archaeological dig in a well at Jo's school, when a container they discover in the well is damaged and two of the students working nearby are accidentally sprayed with toxic waste. The affected students become extremely ill, and, when it is discovered that the container has the date 1919 on it, Jo is worried that her friends' sickness is her fault because of going through the mirror to 1919.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe growing {{popularity}} of quad bikes in the agricultural area is unfortunately accompanied by {{an increasing number of}} accidents and particularly lateral rollovers. Then, the estimation of <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations,</b> whatever the grip conditions and pilot behavior, is a preliminary step in the design of active security devices dedicated to All-Terrain vehicles (ATVs). This paper proposes a rollover metric dedicated to the lateral <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations</b> estimation. It is based on the computation of the Lateral Load Transfer (LLT) obtained, on one hand from a roll projection of the quad bike with its pilot {{and on the other hand}} from a backstepping observer dedicated to grip conditions estimation. Capabilities of the proposed observer and metric to estimate <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations</b> on natural ground are demonstrated via both advanced simulations and full scale experiments...|$|R

2500|$|Verification of {{a voltage}} reading is {{performed}} using a low-impedance voltmeter, which usually has a shunt resistor load bridging the voltmeter terminals. [...] Since very little current can flow from a coupled surface through the small shunt or meter resistance, capacitively coupled voltages will collapse to zero, indicating a harmless [...] "false alarm". [...] By contrast, if an object being tested is in contact with a current source, or coupled by a very large capacitance (possible but unlikely in this context), the voltage will drop only slightly as dictated by Ohm's Law. In this latter case, real power is being delivered, indicating a potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E

The model has emergent properties and combines reactive with prospective behavior based on anticipated or imagined percepts obtained from a Bayesian cognitive map. It {{has the ability to}} predict agent’s behavior, to abduct <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations</b> (what could have been the initial situation), to generate anticipatory plans, and control countermeasures preventing <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations...</b>|$|R

They were at some distance above the sand-bar, however, and {{on the opposite side}} of the river, and saw, with intense anxiety, the number of savages continually augmenting, at the lower end of the channel, so that the boat would be exposed to a fearful attack before they could render it any assistance. Their anxiety increased, as they saw Mr. Hunt and his party descending the channel and dauntlessly approaching the point of danger; but it suddenly changed into surprise on beholding the boat pass close by the savage horde unmolested, and steer out safely into the broad river.|$|E
60|$|His army, {{small as}} it was, {{would soon be}} less. The term of {{enlistment}} of those under General Mercer, from the flying camp, was nearly expired; {{and it was not}} probable that, disheartened as they were by defeats and losses, exposed to inclement weather, and unaccustomed to military hardships they would longer forego the comforts of their homes, to drag out the residue of a ruinous campaign. In addition, too, to the superiority of the force that was following him, the rivers gave the enemy facilities, by means of their shipping, to throw troops in his rear. In this extremity he cast about in every direction for assistance. Colonel Reed was despatched to Burlington with a letter to Governor William Livingston, describing his <b>hazardous</b> <b>situation,</b> and entreating him to call out a portion of the New Jersey militia; and General Mifflin was sent to Philadelphia to implore immediate aid from Congress and the local authorities.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of crane {{accidents}} is human failure. Many crane accidents could be avoided by a specific safety training for crane operators that exposes the users to specific <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations.</b> Intention of the presented research project is the composition of a safety training program for crane operators as well as the development and realisation of the according Virtual Reality (VR) crane simulator. The VR simulation of a ground controlled gantry crane allows the operator to train safety behaviour schemes at wide range of different realistic <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations,</b> while neither persons nor goods nor machinery get compromised. Investigations based on this project show that the developed VR crane simulator is suitable for a behaviour training in specific <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations.</b> The acquired experiences can be transferred and applied into practice. The experiences in a virtual training environment lead to an increased awareness of hazardous factors as well as a more rule compliant behaviour. Safety training at the VR crane simulator augments the existing training program VDI 2194 for crane operation and {{turns out to be a}} surplus for job training of crane operators...|$|R
40|$|The Cryogenic Safety Manual, {{sponsored}} by the British Cryogenics Council, was published over 10 years ago. A new updated version is now available. Some general aspects of cryogenic safety are highlighted, and attention is drawn {{to some of the}} more unusual <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations.</b> An awareness of the physical properties of the cryogenic fluids being dealt with is important in directing attention to <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations</b> which may arise. Because of this, the more important properties of the cryogenic fluids are given, such as molecular weight, boiling point and freezing point. From these properties, <b>hazardous</b> <b>situations</b> can be deduced. There are hidden dangers that are not always easy to spot. Some of the unexpected hazards, most of which have led to deaths, are: asphyxiation (anoxia), frost bites and hypothermia, explosions, and combustion. The aim of this publication is to help bring about increased safety in the production and use of cryogenic products through a deeper appreciation of the scientific, technological and administrative steps which must be made if accidents, some fatal, are to be voided in the future...|$|R
