60|$|Taking {{the above}} {{in the order}} here given, we have, first, two {{peculiar}} genera of true flycatchers, a family confined to the Old World, but extending over the Pacific {{as far as the}} Marquesas Islands. Next we have two peculiar genera (with four species) of honeysuckers, a family confined to the Australian region, and also ranging over all the Pacific Islands to the Marquesas. We now come to the most important group of birds in the Sandwich Islands, comprising seven or eight peculiar genera, and twenty-two species which are believed to form a peculiar family allied to the Oriental flower-peckers (Diceidæ), and perhaps remotely to the American greenlets (Vireonidæ), or {316} tanagers (Tanagridæ). They possess singularly varied beaks, some having this organ much thickened like those of finches, to which family some of them have been supposed to belong. In any case they form a most peculiar group, and cannot be associated with any other known birds. The last species, and the only one not belonging to a peculiar genus, is the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crow,</b> belonging to the almost universally distributed genus Corvus.|$|E

Like other critically endangered species, harming the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crow</b> is illegal under U.S. federal law. By 1994, the populations dwindled to 31 individuals; 8 to 12 were wild and 19 held in captivity. The last two known wild individuals of the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crow</b> disappeared in 2002 [...] and the species is now classified as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List.

Breeding efforts have also been complicated due to extensive inbreeding during the crow's population decline.|$|E

Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises California condors, giant pandas, tigers, black rhinos, polar bears, orangutans, peninsular pronghorn, desert tortoises, African penguins, mountain yellow-legged frogs, Pacific pocket mice, Francois' langurs, giraffes, quino checkerspot butterflies, <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crows,</b> light-footed clapper rails, Gray's monitors, tree lobsters, clouded leopards, Galapagos tortoises, Tahiti lorikeets, lion-tailed macaques, mhorr gazelles, gorillas, Przewalski's horses, koalas, burrowing owls, elephants, Tasmanian devils, okapi, southwestern pond turtle, and 145 other endangered species. As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world.

5000|$|Female crows are {{considered}} sexually mature at about 2 or 3 {{years of age}} and males at 4 years. [...] The <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crow's</b> breeding season lasts from March to July; it builds a nest in March or April, lays eggs in mid-to-late April, and the eggs hatch in mid-May. Both sexes construct nests with branches from the native ohi’a tree strengthened with grasses. The crow typically lays one to five eggs (that are greenish-blue in color) per season, although at most only two will survive past the fledgling phase. Only the females incubate the 2-5 eggs for 19-22 days and brood the young, of which only 1-2 fledge about 40 days after hatching. If the first clutch is lost, the pair will re-lay, which serves to be helpful in captive breeding efforts. Juveniles rely on their parents for 8 months and will stay with the family group until the next breeding season.|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} the {{critically}} endangered `Alala (Corvus hawaiiensis), with only seven individuals remaining in the wild, is wholly dependent upon the reproductive success of its captive population. Throughout the 1999 breeding season, behavioral observations were carried out on eight pairs of captive-reared <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crows.</b> Due to the limited size of the captive population, and to avoid inbreeding, birds were paired based on their genetic profiles. As a result, there were differences in age and breeding experience within pairs. There were also differences in rearing conditions between mates. It {{has been suggested that}} social play and other affiliative behaviors may be important in young birds to form normal social bonds later in life. Affiliative behavior, such as allopreening and feeding other, was common among social-reared crows, but was virtually absent in isolate-reared individuals. Conversely, isolate-reared crows displayed various forms of aberrant behavior, including inappropriate play and self-mutilation, significantly more than the social-reared individuals. Since such behaviors occurred in the nest area throughout all phases of the breeding season, namely nest-building, egg-laying and incubation, it would appear as if early rearing condition plays a role in future reproductive success...|$|R

Ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) and koa (Acacia koa) were important tree species in its wild habitat.

40|$|A leading {{figure in}} the {{emerging}} field of extinction studies, Thom van Dooren puts philosophy into conversation with the natural sciences and his own ethnographic encounters to vivify the cultural and ethical significance of modern-day extinctions. Unlike other meditations on the subject, Flight Ways incorporates the particularities of real animals and their worlds, drawing philosophers, natural scientists, and general readers into the experience of living among and losing biodiversity. Each chapter of Flight Ways focuses on a different species or group of birds: North Pacific albatrosses, Indian vultures, an endangered colony of penguins in Australia, <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>crows,</b> and the iconic whooping cranes of North America. Written in eloquent and moving prose, the book takes stock of what is lost when a life form disappears from the world—the wide-ranging ramifications that ripple out to implicate a number of human and more-than-human others. Van Dooren intimately explores {{what life is like}} for those who must live on the edge of extinction, balanced between life and oblivion, taking care of their young and grieving their dead. He bolsters his studies with real-life accounts from scientists and local communities at the forefront of these developments. No longer abstract entities with Latin names, these species become fully realized characters enmeshed in complex and precarious ways of life, sparking our sense of curiosity, concern, and accountability toward others in a rapidly changing world...|$|R
