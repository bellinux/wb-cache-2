50|$|A black <b>hole</b> <b>formed</b> by the {{collapse}} of an individual star must have mass exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.

40|$|We provide precise {{constraints}} {{on the size of}} any black <b>holes</b> <b>forming</b> in the early Universe for a variety of formation scenarios. In particular, we prove that the size of the apparent horizon of a primordial black <b>hole</b> <b>formed</b> by causal processes in a flat Friedmann universe is considerably smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon size for an equation of state p=kρ (1 / 3 <k< 1). This also applies for a stiff equation of state (k= 1) or for a massless scalar field. The apparent horizon of a primordial black <b>hole</b> <b>formed</b> through hydrodynamical processes is also considerably smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon for 0 <k< 1. We derive an expression for the maximum size which an overdense region can have without being a separate closed universe rather than part of our own. Newtonian argument shows that a black hole smaller than the cosmological horizon can never accrete much. Comment: 15 pages, accepted for publication in Physical Review...|$|R

40|$|Static {{black holes}} in {{two-dimensional}} string theory can carry tachyon hair. Configurations which are non-singular {{at the event}} horizon have non-vanishing asymptotic energy density. Such solutions can be smoothly extended through the event horizon and have non-vanishing energy flux emerging from the past singularity. Dynamical processes will not change the amount of tachyon hair on a black hole. In particular, {{there will be no}} tachyon hair on a black <b>hole</b> <b>formed</b> in gravitational collapse if the initial geometry is the linear dilaton vacuum. There also exist static solutions with finite total energy, which have singular event horizons. Simple dynamical arguments suggest that black <b>holes</b> <b>formed</b> in gravitational collapse will not have tachyon hair of this type.

40|$|In {{the large}} {{coupling}} regime of the 5 -dimensional Einstein [...] Maxwell [...] Chern [...] Simons theory, charged and rotating cohomogeneity- 1 black <b>holes</b> <b>form</b> sequences of extremal and non-extremal radially excited configurations. These asymptotically global Anti-de Sitter (AdS_ 5) black <b>holes</b> <b>form</b> a discrete set of solutions, characterised by the vanishing {{of the total}} angular momenta, or the horizon angular velocity. However, the solutions are not static. In this paper, we study the branch structure that contains these excited states, and its relation with the static Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole. Thermodynamic properties of these solutions are considered, revealing that the branches with lower excitation number can become thermodynamically unstable beyond certain critical solutions that depend on the free parameters of the configuration.
