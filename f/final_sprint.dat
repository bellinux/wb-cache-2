5|$|Riders protested {{during the}} ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was {{nominally}} about the overall safety {{conditions of the}} stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the protest, riders declined to contest the stage except for a <b>final</b> <b>sprint</b> finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rain {{during most}} of the race made {{conditions}} difficult for the competitors. A group of five broke away during the final lap and worked together until the <b>final</b> <b>sprint,</b> where Nicole Cooke won the race.

Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy, finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke, received silver and bronze medals respectively.|$|E

5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the line behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he had used the optimal tactics in the <b>final</b> <b>sprint,</b> but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} stage with his {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the <b>final</b> <b>sprint,</b> Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of the race two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race and finish the final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E
5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy said of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a <b>final</b> <b>sprint</b> finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E

25|$|Danielson lost {{a minute}} {{in the overall}} {{classification}} in stage 18, ending at the Col du Galibier, but remained ninth overall, with time gaps above and below him making it unlikely he would gain or lose any positions as the race went forward. He lost {{more time in the}} stage 20 individual time trial, but not his overall placement. That position held on the Tour's final stage the next day. Farrar was fourth in the <b>final</b> <b>sprint,</b> behind Cavendish, Boasson Hagen, and Greipel. The squad finished as winners of the teams classification. When going up to the podium to accept the award, the eight remaining riders and Vaughters brought with them a cardboard cutout of Zabriskie, the only team member who had to leave the race. Danielson's ninth-place finish extended the team's streak of placing a rider in the top ten each year they participated in the Tour.|$|E
25|$|In February, {{the team}} {{attended}} the Tour of Qatar with another sprinter-heavy squad, featuring Cavendish, Renshaw, and Eisel. Cavendish quickly lost out at any overall contention, losing twelve {{and a half}} minutes after a crash in stage 1, but Renshaw finished near the front of the race in each of the first three road race stages and occupied second overall after stage 3. Stage 4 featured a selective <b>final</b> <b>sprint,</b> as only 11 riders finished together {{at the front of the}} race. Renshaw won this stage ahead of Daniele Bennati and Tom Boonen, and gained the overall race lead with the time bonus. Renshaw was a distant 17th in the final stage, but since second place man Heinrich Haussler failed to win any bonus time, Renshaw won the overall classification with this performance. It was the first stage race win of Renshaw's career, and he explained after the race that the squad had hoped to ride for Cavendish in the event, but that his second major crash in as many events made them change their plans. The team's successes continued at events later in February. Goss confirmed his early-season form by winning stage 2 of the Tour of Oman in a small sprint. He was one of a handful of sprinters who had stayed with the front group over a short, steep climb in the middle of the course, with Cavendish among the others left over ten minutes behind. Four days later, Cavendish picked up his first win of the year, in a more traditional field sprint. At the concurrent Volta ao Algarve, neo-pro sprinter Degenkolb won stage 2 over Tyler Farrar and Michael Matthews, who took a one-second gap over the rest of the field in their sprint. In the overall classification, Martin stayed close behind overall leader Steven Cummings, trailing by ten seconds with the individual time trial stage remaining to close out the race. Martin won the time trial, and Cummings and previously second placed man Alberto Contador finished well down, giving Martin the overall race win as well as the stage. Degenkolb added a second victory for his neo-pro season at the Three Days of West Flanders race, winning a full field sprint to finish off the first road race stage.|$|E

Cavendish indeed became the new race leader, but after an awkward <b>final</b> <b>sprint</b> it was not he but Italian Alessandro Petacchi who won the day.
