5|$|As {{with most}} large cars of its time, the Tagora was a rear-wheel drive vehicle, with a {{longitudinally}} mounted engine. There were three engine choices, mated to four- and <b>five-speed</b> manual transmissions or an optional three-speed automatic {{in the case}} of the four-cylinder engines.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{released}} the Mk II (BA II) Falcon in October 2004 to maintain sales interest until the 2005 {{introduction of the}} BF update. Modifications included some cosmetic changes and a new six-speed Tremec T56 manual transmission replacing the <b>five-speed</b> on XR6 Turbo and XR8 models.|$|E
5|$|Building on the Omega, the SV6 is {{equipped}} with the more powerful High Output variant of the Alloytec V6 engine, coupled to a six-speed manual or <b>five-speed</b> automatic transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the launch Omega, came standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black centre console and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission came as standard.|$|E
5|$|In China, the Camry was {{unveiled}} in late April 2006 and commenced production in June. The Camry {{is sold in}} two variants—the 200 and 240. The 200 variant is mated to the 2.0-litre 1AZ-FE while 240 variant gets the 2.4-litre 2AZ-FE. The range consisted of the 200E, 200GVP, 200G, 200GN, 200GGB, 240GVP, 240G, 240GN, 240GGB, 240V, 240VN and the 240VGB. Transmission choices were the four-speed automatic transmission for the 200 models and the <b>five-speed</b> automatic for the 240 models. The Camry Hybrid was introduced in April 2010.|$|E
5|$|In Indonesia, the Camry {{is offered}} with two engines, the four-cylinder mated to a <b>five-speed</b> {{automatic}} transmission. This engine is offered in G and V trims. The other engine is the V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. This engine is only {{offered in the}} top-of-the-line Q trim. The Camry has enjoyed success in Indonesia, being the best selling car in its class. The 2.4 V and 3.5 Q models have been used extensively by the Indonesian government, owning thousands of Camrys in their fleet.|$|E
5|$|Marketed largely {{towards the}} fleet industry, the {{entry-level}} Falcon XT {{sold in the}} most numbers. Featuring the base Barra 182 six-cylinder engine, air conditioning, front power windows, and <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission, with {{the choice of a}} four-speed automatic, the XT was sold in sedan and station wagon body types. The Barra 220 V8 engine was available as an option. Judges of the Australia's Best Cars awards crowned the XT Best Family Car in 2002, and again in 2004, with the Futura receiving the award in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A <b>five-speed</b> gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at a lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the <b>five-speed</b> automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} {{differentiate}} the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally aspirated version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and <b>five-speed</b> automatic transmissions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{specifications}} carried over, {{except for}} a new <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission, optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the inline-four engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by as much as 12.5 and 14percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. Provisioned with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Racing driver Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as Group One, Group Two and Group Three, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.|$|E
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and <b>five-speed</b> ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E
25|$|Isuzu and Muncie (Getrag)- <b>five-speed</b> {{transmissions}} were available, {{depending on}} model and equipment beginning in 1985 for the Isuzu <b>five-speed</b> which came on four-cylinder cars and in 1986 for the Muncie <b>five-speed</b> which came on V6 equipped cars. The Getrag 282 <b>five-speed</b> is {{sometimes referred to}} as the Muncie 282 or the Muncie Getrag 282, as the design was licensed to General Motors for manufacture by Muncie (Getrag never built the 282). This Muncie transmission is the stronger unit, designed for use with the higher output of the V6.|$|E
25|$|The pre-facelift four-cylinder models came {{standard}} with four-speed manual transmission, {{but could}} be ordered with the <b>five-speed</b> manual or four-speed automatic. After the facelift, the four-speed manual was dropped, and <b>five-speed</b> manual became standard. Five- and six-cylinder engines had <b>five-speed</b> manual as standard (except for 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel, and AMG variants), and optional four-speed automatic. Cars with V8 engines, 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel engines, all-wheel drive (from 1990) and AMG models were available only with four-speed automatic. 24-valve petrol engines (300 E-24, 300 TE-24, 300 CE-24, and later 2.8- and 3.2-litre models) could also be ordered with <b>five-speed</b> automatic.|$|E
25|$|The SLR uses AMG SPEEDSHIFT R <b>five-speed</b> {{automatic}} transmission with three manual modes. For durability Mercedes selected a <b>five-speed</b> transmission {{rather than their}} seven-speed gearbox which was more complex and used more parts.|$|E
25|$|VW {{offers a}} choice of two engine options; a 1.6 litre {{naturally}} aspirated petrol engine mated to a <b>five-speed</b> manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox and a 1.6 litre diesel engine mated only to a <b>five-speed</b> manual gearbox (TDI).|$|E
25|$|Ten {{variants}} of the EL were produced, six-cylinder variants came standard with a <b>five-speed</b> manual, with {{the option of}} a four-speed automatic transmission. With {{the exception of the}} XR8, which could be purchased with the <b>five-speed</b> manual, all V8s were fitted with the four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|The S {{specification}} was rebranded as SV6 in August 2006, and the <b>five-speed</b> auto {{from the}} sedan became available, {{with no other}} changes.|$|E
25|$|Several {{versions}} of the Bristol LH were used by London Transport. 17 narrow LHSs with <b>five-speed</b> gearboxes were delivered to in 1975 to replace Ford Transit minibuses on narrow roads. Although fitted with <b>five-speed</b> gearboxes the first gear was blocked off to make driving easier in traffic. In 1976 95 full length vehicles with automatic transmissions and narrow bodies were purchased. The 7ft 6in bodies were {{not only because of}} narrow roads on some routes, but also due to the restricted space at Kingston garage in Surrey which prevented the Leyland National being deployed there. LHSs were classified by London Transport as BS; full length LHs were classiifed BL.|$|E
25|$|Wet {{multiplate clutch}} and <b>five-speed</b> {{constant}} mesh transmission. The gearbox is {{virtually the same}} as that fitted to Suzuki's GT750 water-cooled triple. RE5 final drive is by 630 chain via a 14-tooth drive sprocket and 43-tooth unit at the rear wheel.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} drive-by-wire electronic throttle, a <b>five-speed</b> automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist {{as well as}} electronic stability and traction control systems. The fourth-generation Lexus ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.|$|E
25|$|SLX: was {{the second}} tier variant fitted with the 1.8-litre engine in coupled to either a <b>five-speed</b> manual or three-speed {{automatic}} transmission. The SLX also featured full plastic wheel trims, {{as opposed to the}} steel centre hubcap fitted to the SL.|$|E
25|$|The T-34 gearbox {{had four}} forward and one reverse gear, {{replaced}} by a <b>five-speed</b> box on {{the last of the}} Model 1943s. The earlier transmissions were troublesome, and some tanks went into battle with a spare transmission cabled onto the engine compartment deck.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} powertrain was now {{the previously}} optional <b>five-speed</b> manual, with the wide-ratio three-speed automatic still available as a popular option. The AMC 258 I6 became standard. However, Eagle sales began to drop as AMC was no longer aggressively promoting the models.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{features}} for the Audi V8 included a 32-valve, {{double overhead camshaft}} (DOHC) V8 engine and a four-speed electronically controlled ZF 4HP24A automatic transmission providing Audi's quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. A <b>five-speed</b> (later in production six-speed) manual transmission was also available.|$|E
25|$|LS/1LS: Power door locks, manual windows, AM-FM stereo with {{auxiliary}} {{audio input}} jack and four speakers, fifteen-inch black-painted steel wheels w/ plastic wheel covers, cloth seating surfaces, OnStar, air conditioning, a 1.8L I4 engine with <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission, and rear split-folding seat.|$|E
25|$|SL: {{entry-level}} variant, {{available only}} as five-door hatchback, featuring the <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission and 1.6-litre engine combination. The brake setup for the LD series Astra in any specification was a disc/drum setup, whereas the equivalent Australian Pulsars had four-wheel disc brakes as standard.|$|E
25|$|In July 2000, a hatchback/station wagon model, the AS300 (Chassis code JCE10), was {{introduced}} featuring a 3.0-liter 2JZ-GE inline-six engine. Equipped with rear- or all-wheel drive (JCE10, RWD Gita wagon; JCE15, 4WD Gita wagon), the AS300 was only available {{with an automatic}} gearbox; a <b>five-speed</b> automatic for the RWD Gita wagon and a four-speed automatic for the 4WD Gita wagon. The six-cylinder version (2JZ-GE) was only available in Japan on the Gita models. In the US, the IS 300 sedan debuted in 2000 as 2001 model and the wagon debuted in 2001 as a 2002 model with the same 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine (the 2.0-liter six-cylinder was not available), while in Europe, the IS 300 joined the IS 200 in the model lineup. All IS 300 models in the US were initially only available with the <b>five-speed</b> automatic transmission; {{this was also the}} case in Europe. However, a <b>five-speed</b> manual was made available in the US in 2001 for the 2002 model year (not available on the SportCross wagon). Visually the exterior of the European IS 200 Sport and 300 were almost identical, the only differences being the boot insignia and the larger-engined model initially having clear front indicators (later generalized to IS 200 range).|$|E
25|$|Introduced in 1998 {{with the}} AS200 (Chassis code GXE10) and RS200 (chassis code SXE10) sedans, the compact vehicle was {{produced}} using a shortened, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive midsize platform, allowing Japanese buyers {{to take advantage}} of tax savings imposed by Japanese government regulations concerning vehicle exterior dimensions and engine displacement, and adapted parts from the larger second-generation Aristo/GS. The 2.0-liter 1G-FE inline-six powered AS200 (GXE10, sedan) featured a <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission as standard, while a four-speed automatic was optional. The 2.0-liter 3S-GE inline-four-powered RS200 (SXE10, sedan) featured a six-speed manual transmission, while a <b>five-speed</b> automatic was optional. The different size engine choices gave Japanese buyers a choice of which annual road tax obligation they wanted to pay, and the larger engine offered more standard equipment as compensation.|$|E
25|$|The Camry in Japan was {{released}} on 30 January 2006 with a sales target of 1,000 units per month. Two driveline combinations are offered—the 2.4-liter engine and <b>five-speed</b> automatic transmission in front-wheel drive (FWD) configuration—or the same engine paired with the four-speed automatic utilizing all-wheel drive (AWD).|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, the 2005 {{model was}} also changed. A major change {{included}} a drive-by-wire throttle for all CR-Vs. The all-wheel drive system was improved; {{it had been}} tuned to activate faster in low traction situations. US market models were equipped with a <b>five-speed</b> automatic, {{as opposed to the}} previous four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|The major {{mechanical}} {{change was}} {{the replacement of}} both the inline-six and V12 engines with new eight-cylinder AJ-V8 in either 3.2 L or 4.0 L versions, with the 4.0 L also available in supercharged form in the XJR (A sport oriented model). No manual transmission was available, and all X308 models were supplied with a <b>five-speed</b> automatic gearbox.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} powered by a Leyland 313 {{turbocharged}} water-cooled four-stroke diesel engine coupled to a <b>five-speed</b> all-synchromesh manual gearbox and two-speed transfer case. There is permanent (4 × 4) drive. The front axle has a rating of 5,000kg, with an offset bowl to reduce overall cab height. The rear axle has a rating of 7,500kg.|$|E
25|$|Starting from 1999 a <b>five-speed</b> Selespeed {{sequential}} transmission came as {{an option}} to the 2.0 litre Twin Spark version and four-speed automatic Q-System to the 2.5 litre V6 version, the Q-system provided the option of using the car as a normal automatic or being able to shift manually with H-pattern, it has three automatic modes: city, sport and ice.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the second}} {{generation}} Neon featured a <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002-05 model years, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, the GV, GVL, and the 1100 cc {{engine and}} four-speed manual {{transmission}} {{were replaced by}} a 1,300cc OHC engine and <b>five-speed</b> manual transmission, and an optional Renault-designed three-speed automatic transmission, and also an optional air conditioner with a holder for cooling two soft drink cans on the 1990 Yugo GVX model was offered, too. The standard model became the GV Plus.|$|E
