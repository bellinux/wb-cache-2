5|$|Buffon did {{not play}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 2010–11 season as he was {{recovering}} from surgery after an injury endured during the 2010 World Cup, and he was replaced by his new deputy, Marco Storari. Juventus were knocked out of the Europa League group stage, the Coppa Italia in the quarter-finals and finished the Serie A season in seventh place, failing to qualify for Europe, {{the first time since}} the 1990–91 season.|$|E

The ship helped to sink another German submarine before she was transferred to the English Channel to protect convoys during the Normandy landings. Forester assisted in sinking a German submarine before returning to the North Atlantic for a few months. The ship was under repair <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 1945 and was then reduced to reserve in November before being scrapped in early 1946.|$|E
5|$|For the 2014 season, Busch Gardens Tampa {{expected}} attendance {{to increase}} by three to eight percent. However (as predicted in June 2014 by IBISWorld Research), combined attendance {{for the second quarter}} of the year increased by about 0.3 percent for SeaWorld Orlando, SeaWorld San Diego, SeaWorld San Antonio, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Busch Gardens Tampa. Compared to the same period in 2013, combined attendance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the year dropped by just over four percent. Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon's Fury delays.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Letcher's term, {{the state}} was still {{struggling}} {{to recover from the}} financial Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E

The limited edition version of Kud Wafter ranked first {{in terms of}} national sales of PC games in Japan in June 2010. In addition, Kud Wafter was reported to sell the most copies of any PC game in Japan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2010. At some stores in Akihabara, Kud Wafter was sold at midnight the day of its release, which is cited as not happening very often for games sold in Akihabara. Kud Wafter premiered as the No. 2 game sold on Getchu.com, a major redistributor of visual novel and domestic anime products, {{during the month of}} its release, and at No. 26 in July. The game would go on to be the No. 9 game sold <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2010, and at No. 15 for the whole year.

5|$|The {{animated}} film {{was produced by}} Shinkai Creative, CoMix Wave Films, and the producer was Noritaka Kawaguchi. Kenichi Tsuchiya was the animation director and was responsible for character design, while Hiroshi Takiguchi was the art director. Planning for the film began {{in the spring of}} 2012 and was announced on December 24 of that year. The Japanese release was initially slated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2013. Production took only six months, starting with location scouting by Shinkai around Shinjuku. Production officially started after he had created storyboards based on the photos he took.|$|E
50|$|North Melbourne {{attacked}} constantly during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> however {{returned a}} wasteful 6.15 (51) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> to Adelaide's 4.3 (27). They led by just four goals despite having 21 scoring shots to just seven in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half.</b>|$|R

5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference polls <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2007. He proved {{the most effective}} fundraiser {{of any of the}} Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, {{due to a}} {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were {{the primary focus of}} Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate {{about the role of the}} Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Jackson {{signed a}} three year, six million dollar {{contract}} with the Cleveland Indians. Jackson served as the primary setup man to closer José Mesa <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the season, but took over the closer position while Mesa answered to charges of rape. Finishing the year with an 86–75 record, the Indians finished first in the American League Central and made the playoffs. After winning against the New York Yankees in the American League Divisional Series (ALDS) and the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Indians played in the World Series against the Florida Marlins. In the World Series, Jackson recorded an ERA of 1.93 over four games pitched, although the Indians lost the World Series, four games to three.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, she {{embarked}} six Loire 130s {{and eight}} Latécoère 298s and sailed for Oran, {{where she was}} when World War II began the next month. Commandant Teste remained in North African waters until December 1939, {{when she returned to}} Toulon and landed her aircraft. She served as an aircraft transport between French North Africa and Metropolitan France <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 1940. In late June 1940, she was transferred from the over-crowded anchorage at Oran to Mers El Kébir.

She arrived at Toulon on 18 October where she was subsequently disarmed. In June 1941, Commandant Teste was reactivated as a gunnery training ship.|$|E

Punk came back after hip tossing The Miz from the top rope. Punk won the match after a GTS.|$|E

5|$|Kinsler was a 2008 AL All Star at the 79th All Star Game at Yankee Stadium. It was {{his most}} {{exciting}} moment in baseball to that point. He was a reserve voted in by his peers. In the fan balloting, Dustin Pedroia, who finished with nearly 1.3 million votes, beat him by 34,243 votes. In the game, Kinsler hit 1-for-5 {{and stole a}} base. He was called out attempting to steal another base, though replays demonstrated that the umpire had missed the call. The Washington Post and ESPN baseball writer Jayson Stark picked Kinsler as the AL MVP <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the season.|$|E
