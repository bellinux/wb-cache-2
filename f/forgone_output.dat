40|$|In recent decades, a {{majority}} of countries have experienced a systemic banking crisis requiring a major-and expensive-overhaul of their banking system. Not only do banking crises hit the budget with outlays that must be absorbed by higher taxes (or spending cuts), but they are costly in terms of <b>forgone</b> economic <b>output.</b> Many different policy recommendations have been made for limiting the cost of crises, {{but there has been}} little systematic effort to see which recommendations work in practice. The authors try to quantify the extent to which fiscal outlays incurred in resolving banking distress can be attributed to crisis management measures of a particular kind adopted by the government {{in the early years of}} the crisis. They find evidence that certain crisis management strategies appear to add greatly to fiscal costs: unlimited deposit guarantees, open-ended liquidity support, repeated recapitalization, debtor bail-outs, and regulatory forbearance. Their findings clearly tilt the balance in favor of a strict rather than an accommodating approach to crisis resolution. At the very least, regulatory authorities who choose an accommodating or gradualist approach to an emerging crisis must be sure they have some other way to control risk-taking.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests the}} opportunity-cost theory using {{a panel of}} Spanish firms during the period 1991 - 2010. Under this theory, productivity-enhancing activities, such as R&D investment, should {{increase}} during downturns because of the fall in their relative cost – in terms of <b>forgone</b> <b>output</b> –. This would imply that business cycles may have a (positive) long-term impact on productivity growth. In the spirit of Aghion et al. (2007) we allow {{the impact of the}} cycle on R&D to vary between firms with different access to credit, finding that credit constraints may reverse the countercyclicality of R&D, even if it is optimal for them. We go one step further and explore whether other productivityenhancing activities, like on-the-job training and the purchase of patents, follow a similar pattern. We find that on-the-job training expenditures are countercyclical and, unlike R&D investment, credit constraints seem not to affect their cyclical behaviour. Investments in other intangibles, such as patent purchases, are found to be acyclical, also irrespective of financial constraints, which could suggest some kind of substitution between R&D and patent purchases over the cycle. Finally, complementarities between the different intangible investments and the traditional productive factors (labour and capital) are also investigated via production function estimates, in order to assess potential indirect effects of the cycle on long-run growth...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the history of crises on {{macroeconomic}} performance. We first study {{the impact of}} past banking crises on the probability of a future banking crisis. Applying data for 1980 - 2010 for all countries for which the required information is available, controlling for conventional macro variables and the history of banking crises occurring after 1970, we do not detect a learning process from past banking crises. Countries that have already experienced one banking crisis generally have a higher likelihood of experiencing another crisis; and the depth of the present crisis {{does not appear to be}} affected by the previous historical experience with crisis events. Evidence also suggests that, in middle-income countries, higher de jure capital account openness is associated with lower likelihood of a banking crisis, a lower ratio of non-performing loans during the crisis, and higher levels of <b>forgone</b> <b>output</b> in the crisis' aftermath. In contrast, we find that past crisis experience has a significant impact on savings. When facing considerable political risk, the past does seem to matter - countries with more people who were exposed, over their lifetime, to larger disasters will tend to save more. This association, however, does not hold for countries with more stable political systems. We interpret these results as consistent with a differential sectoral adjustment to a crises hypothesis. The private sector, by virtue of its harder budget constraints, adjusts faster, whereas the government adjusts at a slower pace following a crisis. The financial sector may find itself in between the two. The too big to fail doctrine associated with large banks provides them with a softer budget constraint, delaying the day of adjustment; for some, delaying bankruptcy. Occasionally, the separation between banks and the public sector is murky, further delaying necessary adjustments of the financial sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have seen much growth in U. S. {{agricultural}} productivity and a simultaneous increase in the efficiency of agricultural production. There has, however, been a growing concern regarding the environmental and health impacts of agricultural activities. This concern has led researchers to increasingly consider both desirable, or “good,” and undesirable, or “bad,” outputs in analyses of productivity and efficiency. The majority of these studies, though, consider both “good” and “bad” outputs as non-separable joint products of the entire set of inputs, rather than considering “bad” outputs as by-products resulting from a subset of polluting inputs. The first two chapters of this dissertation conduct a state level evaluation of U. S. agricultural performance, assuming weak disposability between polluting inputs and undesirable outputs. The objective is to answer three main questions: (1) How can efficiency be measured when {{both good and bad}} outcomes are present?; (2) How can one measure productivity growth with both good outputs and bad outputs?; and (3) How can one measure the opportunity cost of reducing bad output in terms of <b>forgone</b> good <b>output?</b> To answer these questions, the nonparametric methodology of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is followed. The dataset covers the 48 contiguous states in the U. S. from 1960 to 2004 and provides information on agricultural inputs as well as “good” and “bad” outputs of crops. The results show that there is more room for reducing “bad” outputs and polluting inputs (e. g., pesticide and fertilizer) than for expanding good outputs (e. g., crops, livestock, and farm related output), particularly in the major corn and soybean producing states. The last chapter conducts a broad-based analysis of production agriculture by measuring its contribution to state-wide economies and employment in eight Northeastern states. Agriculture is defined as encompassing agricultural production (crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry) and processing (including seafood). Using 2012 data and IMPLAN, agriculture in these eight states is estimated to have contributed $ 99. 4 million to regional total sales and generated 474, 482 jobs.

This paper asks the question "what is the opportunity cost to the nation of not improving the socio-economic conditions so that they reach acceptable standard". The research method chosen was an adaptation of that used by the Canadian Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. Using this approach, the measure of costs of poverty was limited to the value of output foregone and the extra government expenditures incurred because of the low socio-economic status of Thamarrurr people. The study found that the value of <b>output</b> <b>forgone</b> in 2003 was about 44 million per year and that overall little or nothing extra was spent at Thamarrurr to account for that community's disadvantage. The total opportunity cost therefore was about 44 million per year, but since the population at Thamarrurr was growing at 3. 3 per cent per year, these costs are growing at about that rate. An analysis of the pattern of government spending reveals that in terms of the theory of economic development, not enough government funds are spent on job creation, education and training, health, housing and the development of the community's infrastructure and consequently too much was absorbed by income support and justice. There is clearly a need to increase the total level of government support for Thamarrurr and to direct most of that to job creation and capacity building...|$|R
40|$|Global capitalism, vintage early 21 st century, {{favors the}} {{movement}} of goods and capital across national borders more than it does {{the movement of}} people. It was not always this way. The first wave of globalization, {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century and the early 20 th, came with massive international migration. Around 60 million people migrated from Europe to the countries of the New World (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States) over a period of 40 years or so. In a sense, current globalization has a smaller degree of"cosmopolitan liberalism"in thedimension of international migration. While there is consensus on the benefits of an open trade regime and relatively liberal capital movements, that consensus rarely extends to the free movement of people. Solimano examines this difference in the"freedom to become global"by looking at both standard trade theory, basically the Mundell theorem of trade and migration as substitutes, and the ensuing analytical developments and empirical evidence around the Mundell result. He then looks at this asymmetry in today's global economic order from the perspective of freedom, individual rights, and transnational citizenship, as well as the potential of international migration to reduce global inequality. Preventing factor (labor or human capital) movements from lower- to higher-productivity activities (countries) may entail a global welfare loss in terms of <b>forgone</b> world <b>output</b> (although the distributive consequences for sending and receiving countries vary). International migration tends to reduce income disparities across countries. But it can increase inequality within labor-scarce receiving countries by moderating the growth of wages, because of the associated increase in the supply of labor. In contrast, in sending countries emigration can have an equalizing effect by reducing the supply of labor and raising wages. Still, international migration is bound to have a positive effect on long-run growth in receiving countries by keeping labor costs down, increasing the profitability of investment, and raising national savings. For sending countries, the impact on growth depends on the pool of labor and human resources that emigrate. In labor-abundant developing countries with chronic unemployment (or labor surplus), the growth-depressing effects of emigration can be small (compensated in part by labor remittances). Nevertheless, the emigration of highly educated people, professionals, and national investors can have a detrimental effect on long-run income levels and growth rates for sending countries. Froma global perspective, however, world output would be expected to increase if people could freely move across the planet from areas of low labor productivity to areas of high labor productivity. From the viewpoint of global economic freedoms, the result would be equally positive.
