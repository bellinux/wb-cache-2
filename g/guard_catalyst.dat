40|$|Catalytic steam {{reforming}} of bone oil, obtained by pyrolysis {{of meat and}} bone meal (MBM), was studied over particulate and monolithic Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts and their promoted varieties. Two tube reactors were used in cascade at atmospheric pressure and steam to carbon molar ratio of 5. The first reactor, loaded with granular dolomite, and the second reactor, containing Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, was operated at 800 and 700 - 750 C, respectively. The WHSV of the oil in the second reactor was usually {{in the range of}} 4. 0 - 9. 0 h- 1, whereas in the first reactor was generally ten times lower. The <b>guard</b> <b>catalyst</b> prevented the Ni-catalysts from activity loss for days and could be regenerated by air treatment at the reaction temperature. The oil was virtually fully converted to CO and H 2 -rich gas. The K or Ca additives promoted, the Mg additive adversely affected the reforming activity and stability of the Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Gold {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as an "inert" surface and bulk gold surfaces do not chemisorb many molecules easily. However, in the last decade, largely {{through the efforts of}} Masatake Haruta, gold particles, particularly those below 5 nm in size, have begun to garner attention for unique catalytic properties (1 - 8). In recent years, supported gold particles {{have been shown to be}} effective as catalysts for low temperature CO oxidation (9), selective oxidation of propene to propene oxide (10), water gas shift (11), NO reduction (12). selective hydrogenation of acetylene (or butadiene) (13) and other reactions (1 - 5, 14 - 16). Currently used in Japanese toilets for odour reduction (3), gold has demonstrated industrial potential as well for the hydrochlorination of ethyne to vinyl chloride (16 - 18) and as a bimetallic component of vinyl acetate monomer production catalysts (19, 20). Low temperature CO oxidation is of particular importance, finding applications in indoor air quality applications (21) and as a <b>guard</b> bed <b>catalyst</b> to prevent CO poisoning of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (22 - 24) ...|$|R
