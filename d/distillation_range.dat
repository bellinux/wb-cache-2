5000|$|Cetane {{index is}} used as a {{substitute}} for the cetane number of diesel fuel. The cetane index is calculated based on the fuel's density and <b>distillation</b> <b>range</b> (ASTM D86). There are two methods used, ASTM D976 and D4737. The older D976, or [...] "two-variable equation" [...] is outdated and should no longer be used for cetane number estimation. It is, however, still required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an alternative method for satisfying its aromaticity requirement for diesel fuel. D4737 is the newest method and is sometimes referred to as [...] "the four-variable equation". D4737 is the same method as ISO 4264. Cetane index in some crude oil assays {{is often referred to as}} Cetane calcule, while the cetane number is referred to as Cetane measure.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} fuel-users control quality is {{by using the}} cetane index (CI), which is a {{calculated}} number based on the density and <b>distillation</b> <b>range</b> of the fuel. There are various versions of this, depending on whether metric or Imperial units are used, and how many distillation points are used. These days most oil companies use the '4-point method', ASTM D4737, based on density, 10% 50% and 90% recovery temperatures. The '2-point method' is defined in ASTM D976, and uses just density and the 50% recovery temperature. This 2-point method tends to overestimate cetane index and is not recommended. Cetane index calculations {{can not account for}} cetane improver additives and therefore do not measure total cetane number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number and the cetane index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number.|$|E

40|$|Simulation {{study has}} shown oil {{production}} is accelerated when propane {{is used as}} an additive during steam injection. To better understand this phenomenon, distillation experiments were performed using San Ardo crude oil (12 oAPI). For comparison purposes, three distillation processes were investigated: dry-, steam-, and steam-propanedistillation, the latter at the propane-to-steam mass ratio of 0. 05 at steam injection rate 0. 5 g/min. Two sets of the distillation experiments were carried out. In {{the first set of}} experiments, the <b>distillation</b> temperatures <b>ranged</b> from 115 ????C to 300 ????C. <b>Distillation</b> pressures <b>ranged</b> from 0 psig to 998 psig for steam- and steam-propane distillation. The temperature-pressure combination used represented 15 ????C superheated steam conditions. In the second set of experiments, the <b>distillation</b> temperatures <b>ranged</b> from 220 oC to 300 oC at 260 psig. The temperature pressure combination used represented field conditions for crude oil. For both conditions, the cell was kept at each temperature plateau (cut) until no increase occurs in distillation yields. Distillation yields were collected at each cut, and the volume and weight of water and hydrocarbon measured. Based on these experiments, a thermodynamic modeling framework was developed that describes distillation effect and oil production for steam distillation experiments. The model is based on composition of crude oil, molecular weight of heavy fraction. The analytical model results are compared against the experimental data for synthetic crude and crude oil to verify the validity of the model. Main results of the study may be summarized as follows. The yields for steam distillation for saturated conditions of Tsat+ 15 o C and Psat is 10 % and with addition of 5 % of propane to steam no significant increase occurs in distillation yields. The yields for steam distillation for field conditions of 260 psig and temperature range (220 ~ 300 oC) is 18 % and with addition of 5 % of propane to steam no significant increase in distillation yields. The results indicate that propane has minimal distillation effect on the heavy oil. This occurs possibly because of lesser amount of light fractions in the heavy oil that enhance the separation of components in the oil caused by the concentration gradient...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{thermodynamic}} efficiency calculations for {{the separation of}} ternary and quaternary mixtures of hydrocarbons in conventional, heat-integrated and thermally coupled distillation sequences, are presented. When a ternary mixture was considered, energy savings achieved in the thermally coupled and heat-integrated <b>distillation</b> sequences <b>ranged</b> from 10 to 40 % in comparison to conventional direct and indirect distillation sequences. Regarding thermodynamic efficiency, thermally coupled and heat-integrated distillation sequences presented the highest values in {{almost all of the}} cases considered. As the analysis was extended to the separation of quaternary mixtures, the thermally coupled distillation sequences show acceptable energy savings and the thermodynamic efficiency of a thermally coupled distillation sequence linked to a side stripper and a side rectifier was better than that obtained in the conventional distillation sequence; however, the second law efficiency for the thermally coupled distillation with prefractionator (Petlyuk-type column) was low, when compared to that of the conventional distillation sequence for a mixture with low content of intermediate components.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} and simulation studies -conducted at the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University - confirm oil production is accelerated when propane {{is used as}} an additive during steam injection. To better understand this phenomenon, distillation experiments were performed using seven-component synthetic oil consisting of equal weights of the following alkanes: n-C 5, n-C 6, n-C 7, n-C 8, n-C 9, nC 10, and n-C 15. For comparison purposes, three distillation processes were investigated: dry-, steam-, and steam-propane-distillation, the latter at a propane:steam mass ratio of 0. 05. The injection rate of nitrogen during dry-and steam-distillation {{was the same as}} that of propane during steam-propane distillation, 0. 025 g/min, with steam injection rate kept at 0. 5 g/min. The <b>distillation</b> temperatures <b>ranged</b> from 115 ?C to 300 ?C and were increased in steps of 10 ?C. The cell was kept at each temperature plateau (cut) for 30 minutes. <b>Distillation</b> pressures <b>ranged</b> from 0 psig for dry distillation to 998 psig for steam-and steam-propane distillation. The temperature-pressure combination used represented 15 ?C superheated steam conditions. Distillate samples were collected at each cut, and the volume and weight of water and hydrocarbon measured. In addition, the composition of the hydrocarbon distillate was measured using a gas chromatograph. Main results of the study may be summarized as follows. First, the hydrocarbon yield at 125 ?C is highest with steam-propane distillation (74 wt%) compared to steam distillation (58 wt%), and lowest with dry distillation (36 wt%). This explains in part the oil production acceleration observed in steam-propane displacement experiments. Second, the final hydrocarbon yield at 300 ?C however is the same for the three distillation processes. This observation is in line with the fact that oil recoveries were very similar in steam- and steam-propane displacement experiments. Third, based on the yields of individual hydrocarbon components, steam-propane distillation lowers the apparent boiling points of the hydrocarbons significantly. This phenomenon may be the most fundamental effect of propane on hydrocarbon distillation, which results in a higher yield during steam-propane distillation and oil production acceleration during steam-propane displacement. Fourth, experimental K-values are higher in distillations with steam-propane for the components n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, and n-nonane. Fifth, vapor fugacity coefficients for each component are higher in distillations with steam-propane than with steam. Finally, Gibbs excess energy is overall lower in distillations with steam-propane than with steam. The experimental results clearly indicate the importance of distillation on oil recovery during steam-or steam-propane injection. The experimental procedure and method of analysis developed in this study (for synthetic oil) will be beneficial to future researchers in understanding the effect of propane as steam additive on actual crude oils...|$|R
30|$|The {{effluents}} from molasses based distilleries contain {{large amounts}} of dark brown colored molasses spent wash or vinasse.

40|$|AbstractTo {{overcome}} the drawback of using diesel in LTC, a new fuel concept called WDF was proposed in recent years. WDF refers to fuels {{with a wide}} <b>distillation</b> <b>range</b> from initial boiling point (IBP) of gasoline to final boiling point (FBP) of diesel. In this work, two kinds of WDF (GDBF and FDF) were studied for both short-term and long-term consideration. In the study of GDBF, 50 % gasoline proportion is selected as the optimal choice due to the load adaptability;at the same NOx emissions level for Euro VI, G 50 and diesel have similar ITE, G 50 has the soot emissions around the target value of Euro V, while diesel has one orderhigher soot emissionsat high load. In the long term, {{it is not necessary}} to employ different distillation and refinery processes to produce gasoline and diesel fuels. A novel fuel concept named FDF is proposed and an exploration of the feasibility was conducted. The measured physical and chemical properties of FDF indicate that C/H ratio, density and heat value of FDF vary between those of gasoline and diesel fuel and kinematic viscosity is close to the lower limit of diesel, which is benefit to high pressure injection. Cetane number of FDF is in the lower range of diesel fuel. The thermal efficiency, combustion and emission characteristics of a common-rail diesel engine fueled with FDF were experimentally investigated and compared with those burning the conventional diesel fuel and GDBF. The ignition delay, combustion duration changes little compared to diesel fuel while thermal efficiency is higher than diesel and GDBF; the pressure rise rate and heat release rate of FDF are higher than diesel fuel but lower than GDBF, and as the engine load increases, the combustion characteristics of FDF are close to diesel fuel; the soot, NOx and CO emissions of FDF are close to diesel fuel, however, the THC emissions are slightly higher than diesel fuel...|$|E
