5000|$|Classical Brookfield viscometers {{employ the}} {{principle}} of rotational viscometry - the torque required to turn an object, such as a spindle, in a fluid indicates the viscosity of the fluid. Torque is applied through a calibrated spring to a disk or bob spindle immersed in test fluid and the spring deflection measures the viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle. [...] The amount of viscous drag {{is proportional to the}} amount of torque required to rotate the spindle, and thus to the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid. [...] In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, Brookfield viscosities measured under the same conditions (model, spindle, speed, temperature, time of test, container, and any other sample preparation procedures that may affect the behavior of the fluid) can be compared.

50|$|Rotational latency (sometimes called {{rotational}} delay or just latency) is the delay {{waiting for the}} rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector under the read-write head. It depends on the rotational speed of a <b>disk</b> (or <b>spindle</b> motor), measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). For most magnetic media-based drives, the average rotational latency is typically based on the empirical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period.

For optical disk drives, the spirally shaped tracks are usually not perfectly circular and the assembly of the <b>disk</b> and <b>spindle</b> motor is unavoidably eccentric.

The control objective is to attenuate adaptively the specific frequency contents of periodic disturbances without amplifying its rest harmonics. FACT is implemented in a plug-in manner and provides a suitable framework for periodic disturbance rejection in the cases where the fundamental frequencies of the disturbance are alterable. It is shown that the convergence property of parameters in the proposed adaptive algorithm is exponentially stable. It is applicable to both the spindle modes of constant linear velocity (CLV) and constant angular velocity (CAV) for various operation speeds. The experiments showed that the proposed FACT has successful improvement on the tracking and focusing performance of the CD-ROM, and is extended to various compact disk drives...|$|R

Contact temperature measurement using thermocouple is not suitable for the rotating platter of HDD. Heat analysis using simula-tion software requires accurate initial parameter setting such as thermal (initial & boundary) conditions of certain regions. Temperature measurement using infrared (IR) system avoids these limitations; it is non-contact, responsive and does not require initial parameter setting.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{structural}} dynamics, rotationally periodic structures (RPS) {{have always been}} an area of interest for engineers and scientists. RPS is found in almost all industries and could be as large as jet turbines to as small as hard disk drives. We come across with RPS on daily routine like washing machine tub, small gears in home appliances and brakes in automobile etc. With such an influence in our life, an RPS dynamic response to the environment is crucial to keep them working and hence {{is the focus of}} the thesis. The research involves three major responses on rotationally periodic structures (RPS) namely vibration, thermal and shock. Hard disk drives and integrally bladed rotors (IBR) has been selected as research models. On vibratory response in rotationally periodic structures, effects on structural designs and free vibrations of integrated bladed rotor (IBR) have been investigated in this research. The migration of natural frequencies is characterized through parametric studies considering changes in blade angle and blade thickness of an underlying uniform axis-symmetric rotor. Recurring coupled repeated doublet modes, defined as replica modes, have been observed in this study by characterizing blade vibrations in-phase or out-of-phase to disk vibrations. Veering and clustering of replica modes’ natural frequencies are observed with respect to the blade design parameters. Existence of replica modes has been verified via experimental studies. Fourier content for the low frequency replica component is found to be sensitive and tuneable to blade angle design. For the thermal response of RPS, structural thermal analysis of <b>spindle</b> <b>disk</b> assembly used in hard disk drives (HDDs) was adopted. With the view toward understanding the underlying physics and to minimize the corresponding repeatable run-out (RRO) of track following position error signal (PES) in high track per inch (TPI) magnetic disk drives, analytical representations of thermal expansion mismatch between <b>disk</b> and <b>spindle</b> hub structure formulated in form of operators and finite element analysis (FEA) are employed. Parametric studies with analysis taken at different operational temperatures suggested that RRO can be minimized significantly when location of spindle notch is properly located. RRO harmonics resulted from the thermal expansion mismatch and structure misalignments are studied and concluded with simple algebraic expression related to number of fasteners used in the disk-spindle assembly. On shock response of RPS, head gimbal assembly (HGA) in HDD was analysed. Experimental observation of de-bonding phenomena between head gimbal assembly (HGA) and suspension for a commercial 3. 5 -inch enterprise HDD under non-operational 250 G shock test was performed. In this research the experimental observation and numerical finite element studies were conducted to understand the effect on the mechanical failure of HGA when it is subjected to non-operational shock in the parked position on the ramp. Different design modifications were adapted to withstand shock waves. It was observed that by changing flexure angle in HGA, shock stress can be reduced. FEA simulation results have been presented to verify the findings. The research findings in this thesis can be implemented in the industry where RPS has been widely used, as for example the new replica modes discovery in bladed rotors can also been applied on small scales like as on hard drive, where no. of blades can be replaced by no. of fasteners and the spinning hard drive will be benefited by studying its vibrations with concentration on replica modes. Furthermore, the serendipitous finding of HDD platters expansion under thermal stress can be beneficial in actually storing more data per inch as it has been recently used in TAMR (thermally assisted magnetic recording) technology.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effects of shock and the disk surface pattern on the head disk interface (HDI) response in hard disk drives (HDDs). A new local adaptive mesh method is proposed at the end to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm to simulate the sliders' steady flying attitudes. Over the past decades, {{there has been an}} increase in the demand of HDDs used in portable devices. In such applications, the work performance of a HDD mainly depends on its ability to withstand external disturbances. Studies of the HDD's responses and failures during external shocks can be very beneficial for improving the HDD's design. A multi-body operational shock (op-shock) model is developed for this purpose in this thesis. The Guyan reduction method is used to model all the components considered in the op-shock model (a <b>disk,</b> a <b>spindle</b> motor, a base plate, a pivot and a head actuator assembly (HAA)). A fluid dynamic bearing (FDB), between the rotating and stationary units in the spindle motor, is simplified as a spring-dashpot system to save computation efforts. The same simplification is applied to a ball bearing (BB) system between the rotating and stationary units in the actuator pivot. Then the reduced models for all the components are assembled to obtain a complete multi-body op-shock model. Four models which include different components are introduced in this thesis to investigate various components' effects on the HDD's operating performance. The HDDs' failure mechanisms are also studied. It is found that different components influence the HDI responses in different ways. The ramp load/unload (LUL) technology has been proved to be a better alternative to the contact start-stop (CSS) approach due to the advantages of increasing areal density and greater durability. However, the application of the LUL ramps in the HDDs increases the possibility of collisions between the disk and the ramps since the ramps sit closely to the disk's outer radius. Therefore, it is important to study the ramp effects on the HDD's response during a shock. A reduced model of a deformable ramp is developed and implemented to the multi-body op-shock model. Numerical analyses using three ramp models (no-ramp model, rigid ramp model and deformable ramp model) are carried out to study the HDD's failure dependence on different ramp models. Bit patterned media (BPM) recording is one of the promising techniques for future disk drives in order to increase the areal density above 4 Tbit/in 2. In patterned media, an individual recorded bit is stored in a distinct magnetic island. Thus, the BPM can change the topography of the disk surface and has an effect on the flying characteristics of the air bearing sliders. Proper designs of sliders and disks in the HDDs are required in order to achieve a stable work performance. So a simulator to model a slider's flying condition over a BPM disk is particularly important. Three methods (the averaging method, the Homogenization method and the Taylor expansion Homogenization methods) are implemented to simulate a slider's flying attitude, and finally an economical accurate method is chosen (the Taylor expansion Homogenization method) to investigate the slider's dynamics on partially planarized patterned media. In modern HDDs, the requirement of small and steady head disk spacing leads to more complicated air bearing surface designs. Thus it is challenging for an air bearing simulator to accurately capture the pressure under a slider's surface. A new local adaptive grid-generating algorithm is developed and is used to simulate the sliders' steady flying attitude. Local finer meshes (mesh's dimension decreases to half) are created on the nodes of the current grids, which have pressure gradients or geometry gradients larger than a pre-defined tolerance. Two sliders are used to demonstrate the applicability of this method. It is found that this new local adaptive grid-generating method improves the stability and efficiency of the simulation scheme...|$|R
