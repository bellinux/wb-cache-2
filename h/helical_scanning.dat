50|$|NT is {{a digital}} memo {{recording}} system introduced by Sony in 1992, sometimes marketed {{under the name}} Scoopman. The system stored memos using <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> on special microcassettes, which were 30 &times; 21.5 &times; 5 mm with a tape width of 2.5 mm, with a recording capacity of up to 120 minutes.

50|$|Magnetic tapes {{could be}} {{mechanically}} damaged when {{ejected from the}} machine due to moisture or other problems. Rubber drive belts and rollers hardened with age, causing malfunctions. Faults such as these damaged the tape irreversibly, a particular problem with irreplaceable tapes filmed by users. VHS tapes recorded in LP or EP/SLP mode were more sensitive to minor head misalignment over time or from machine to machine. Tapes recorded on a machine made before 1995 tend to not play well on newer machines due to slight changes in <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> head design.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Ampex {{introduced}} the first <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> video recorder, the VR-8000, which recorded video using <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> recording technology on 2 inch tape.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Toshiba {{introduced}} a new method of recording known as <b>helical</b> <b>scan,</b> releasing the first commercial <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> video tape recorder that year. It was first implemented in reel-to-reel videotape recorders (VTRs), and later used with cassette tapes.|$|R
50|$|IVC 2 inch <b>Helical</b> <b>scan</b> was a {{high-end}} broadcast quality <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> analog recording VTR format developed by International Video Corporation (IVC), and introduced in 1975. Previously, IVC {{had made a}} number of 1 inch Helical VTRs. IVC saw a chance to make a VTR that would have the quality of the then-standard 2 inch Quadruplex videotape format but with the advantages of <b>helical</b> <b>scan.</b> They then developed a VTR using this technology, the IVC Model 9000.|$|R
50|$|From 1963 to 1970, Ampex {{manufactured}} several {{models of}} VTR 2-inch helical VTRs, capable of recording and playing back analog {{black and white}} video. Recording employed non-segmented <b>helical</b> <b>scanning,</b> with one wrap of the tape around the video head drum being {{a little more than}} 180 degrees, using two video heads. One video drum rotation time was two fields of video. The units had two audio tracks recorded on the top edge of the tape, with a control track recorded on the tape's bottom edge. The 2-inch-wide video tape used was one mil (0.001 in or 0.0254 mm) thick. The VTRs were mostly used by industrial companies, educational institutions, and a few for in-flight entertainment.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of their}} last {{products}} before their end as a company was the legendary IVC model 9000 VTR, considered {{by some to be}} one of the best analog VTRs made. It used 2" [...] tape, much like the 2" [...] Quadruplex format, but using segmented <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> for the recording & playback of the video tracks (as opposed to 2" [...] Quadruplex's transverse scanning). The 9000 was used quite frequently for the production of most popular television series throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as it was capable of higher quality through many more generations than other available products. However, the leftover R & D costs from the development of the 9000 left IVC with having to go out of business by the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Helical</b> <b>scanning</b> was {{a logical}} {{progression}} beyond an earlier system (pioneered by Ampex) known as quadruplex recording, {{also referred to}} as transverse recording. In this scheme, the rotating head drum runs essentially perpendicular to a 2 in tape, and the slices recorded across the tape are nearly perpendicular to the tape's motion. U.S. quadruplex systems revolve the head drum at 14,400 revolutions per minute (240 revolutions per second) with four heads on the drum so that each television field is broken into 16 stripes on the tape (which requires appropriately complex head-switching logic). By comparison, the longer stripe recorded by a helical-scan recorder usually contains an entire video field and the two-headed drum spins at the frame rate (half the field rate) of the TV system in use.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{television}} broadcasting in Japan in the early 1950s, they saw the need for magnetic television signal recording. Dr. Norikazu Sawazaki developed a prototype <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> recorder in 1953. Independently in Germany, Eduard Schüller was also developing a <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> method of recording.|$|R

50|$|In {{some early}} {{prototype}} linear {{video tape recording}} systems developed in the early 1950s from companies such as Bing Crosby Enterprises, RCA, and the BBC's VERA, the tape speed was extremely high, over 200 in/s, to adequately capture {{the large amount of}} image information. The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional Quadruplex system from 1956, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called transverse scanning), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Transverse scanning was superseded by the later technology of <b>helical</b> <b>scanning,</b> which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at an angle across the width of the tape.|$|E
50|$|VHS and Betamax home {{videocassette}} recorders ("VCR"s) initially only {{recorded the}} audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head, which was inadequate for recording NICAM audio; this significantly limited their sound quality. Many VCRs later included high quality {{stereo audio recording}} as an additional feature, in which the incoming high quality stereo audio source (typically FM radio or NICAM TV) was frequency modulated and then recorded {{in addition to the}} usual audio and video VCR tracks, using the same high-bandwidth <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> technique used for the video signal. Full size VCRs already made full use of the tape, so the high quality audio signal was recorded diagonally under the video signal, using additional helical scan heads and depth multiplexing. The mono audio track (and on some machines, a non-NICAM, non-Hi-Fi stereo track) was also recorded on the linear track, as before, to ensure backwards-compatibility of recordings made on Hi-Fi machines when played on non-Hi-Fi VCRs.|$|E
5000|$|The SCR-584 was {{extremely}} advanced for its era. To achieve high accuracy and measure both azimuth and elevation with one antenna, it used a conical scanning system, {{in which the}} beam is rotated around the antenna's axis to find the maximum signal point, thus indicating which direction the antenna should move in order to point directly at the target. The idea was proposed by Alfred Loomis, the director of section D-1 of the National Defense Research Committee. In October 1940, it was adopted for the [...] "wholly-automatic-tracking" [...] radar project. Conical scanning was also adopted in 1941 for the Navy's 10 cm fire-control radar system, and it {{was used in the}} German Würzburg radar in 1941. The SCR-584 developed the system much further, and added an automatic tracking mode. Once the target had been detected and was within range, the system would keep the radar pointed at the target automatically, driven by motors mounted in the antenna's base. For detection, as opposed to tracking, the system also included a <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> mode that allowed it to search for aircraft. This mode had its own dedicated PPI display for easy interpretation. When used in this mode the antenna was mechanically spun at 4 rpm while it was nudged up and down to scan vertically.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} radiation dose and coronary assessability of a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) -gated scan by 64 -slice multidetector (row) computed tomography (MDCT) -coronary angiography (CA) compared with a retrospective ECG-gated <b>helical</b> <b>scan.</b> BackgroundThe 64 -slice MDCT-CA has been widely used; however, a high radiation dose by 64 -slice MDCT-CA has been reported. Prospective ECG-gated scan using “step-and-shoot” protocol can reduce radiation exposure effectively. MethodsMDCT-CA was performed in 229 consecutive patients. Fifty-six patients were excluded because of higher heart rates of > 65 beats/min; of patients with heart rates ≤ 65 beats/min, 97 were analyzed by <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> with tube current modulation and 76 were analyzed by prospective gating. Coronary assessability and diagnostic accuracy were investigated in comparison with selective CA as the gold standard. Radiation doses were evaluated in both protocols. ResultsCoronary assessability of <b>helical</b> <b>scan</b> was 95. 5 % (1, 303 of 1, 364 segments), while that of prospective gating was 96. 6 % (1, 053 of 1, 089 segments), showing similar coronary assessability (p = 0. 14). Sensitivity and specificity for coronary obstructive and occlusive lesions in the assessable segments were 97. 0 % (162 of 167) and 97. 6 % (1, 109 of 1, 136) by <b>helical</b> <b>scan,</b> while those of prospective gating were 96. 4 % (81 of 84, p = 0. 84) and 98. 5 % (955 of 969, p = 0. 12), respectively.

5000|$|The U-matic {{machines}} were always made with Stereo, and both Betamax and VHS recorded the audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head. However the relatively slow tape speed of Beta and VHS was inadequate for good quality audio, and significantly limited the sound quality. Betamax's release of Beta Hi-Fi {{in the early}} 1980s was quickly followed by JVCs release of HiFi audio on VHS (model HR-D725U). Both systems delivered flat full-range frequency response (20 Hz to 20 kHz), excellent 70 dB signal-to-noise ratio (in consumer space, {{second only to the}} compact disc), dynamic range of 90 dB, and professional audio-grade channel separation (more than 70 dB). In VHS the incoming HiFi audio is frequency modulated ("Audio FM" [...] or [...] "AFM"), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and recorded using the same high-bandwidth <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> technique used for the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS used depth multiplexing, in which the modulated audio carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6 MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use the same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process is audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.) ...|$|E

40|$|X線CTにおけるヘリカルスキャンでは，連続回転スキャン中に寝台を連続的に移動させ，投影データを螺旋状に収集する。そのため，ヘリカルスキャン画像は，寝台移動を伴わない従来のCTスキャン画像と異なる特性を示す。したがって，ヘリカルスキャンを行う場合，通常の投影パラメータに加え，寝台移動速度の設定が必要となる。最適な寝台移動速度を決定するためには，寝台移動速度がヘリカルスキャン画像に及ぼす影響および従来のCTスキャン画像との相違を客観的に評価することが重要となる。本研究では，類似度を測るピアソンの相関係数を用い，CT画像をパーソナルコンピュータに取り込み，従来のCTスキャン画像を基準としたヘリカルスキャン画像の類似度を評価した。その結果，相関係数は寝台移動速度の増大に依存して低下することが明らかになり，従来のCTスキャン画像とヘリカルスキャン画像の違いを数値にて客観的に評価することができた。ヘリカルスキャンは，短時間に広範囲の撮影が可能な優れた方法であるが，従来のCTスキャンとの画像の差を理解した上で使用することが重要であると考えられる。In <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> of X-ray {{computed}} tomography(CT), projection {{data are}} {{collected in a}} spiral mode during continuous moving of table.

40|$|Objective : To {{compare the}} organ doses and lifetime-attributable {{risk of cancer}} for electrocardiogram-triggered {{sequential}} and high-pitch <b>helical</b> <b>scanning</b> in a clinical patient population. Methods : Phantom thermoluminiscence dosimeter measurements were used {{as a model for}} the organ dose assessment of 314 individual patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography.

Results : Phantom measurements showed that heart rate had a significant influence on the delivered radiation exposure in sequential mode, and calcium scoring and contrast bolus tracking scans make a nonnegligible contribution to patients' dose. Therefore, they should be taken into account for patients' organ dose estimations. Median cancer induction risks are low, with 0. 008 % (0. 0016 %) and 0. 022 % (0. 056 %) for high-pitch and sequential scanning for men (women), respectively.
