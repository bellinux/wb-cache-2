50|$|It was {{suggested}} that {{the interior of the}} 45 metre (147 ft) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration {{to make the most of}} the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern. Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold, but his death in 1446 put an end to this project, and the walls of the dome were whitewashed. Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment. This enormous work, 3,600 metres² (38 750 ft²) of painted surface, was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators, such as Domenico Cresti, finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) Choirs of Angels; Christ, Mary and Saints; Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes; and at the bottom of the cupola: Capital Sins and Hell. These frescoes are considered Zuccari's greatest work. But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques. Vasari had used true fresco, while Zuccari had painted <b>in</b> <b>secco.</b> During the restoration work, which ended in 1995, the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue. All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system.|$|E

Carved {{similarly}} from the rock, its walls reinforced in stone, it measures 8.2 m by 14.5 m, rising to a height of 9.2 m. Both church and narthex are painted; these paintings are of [...] "crucial significance {{in the development of}} the Medieval Georgian mural painting". Its patron, Rati Surameli, is commemorated in a donor portrait on the north wall; the accompanying inscription reads [...] "Mother of God, accept ... the offering of your servant Rati, eristavi of Kartli, who has zealously decorated this holy church to your glory". On the same north wall are portraits of the royal founders, Giorgi III and Tamar; she lacks the ribbon that is the attribute of a married woman and her inscription includes the formula [...] "God grant her a long life", while that of Giorgi does not; this helps date the paintings to between Giorgi's death in 1184 and Tamar's marriage in 1186. Episodes from the life of Christ occupy the vaults and upper walls in a sequence, starting with the Annunciation, followed by the Nativity, Presentation in the Temple, Baptism, Transfiguration, Raising of Lazarus, Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, Last Supper, Washing of the Feet, Crucifixion, Harrowing of Hell, Ascension, Descent of the Holy Spirit, and Dormition (the church is sometimes known as the Church of the Assumption, which corresponds with the Orthodox Feast of the Dormition). At a lower level, more accessible as intercessors, are paintings of saints and stylites. On the rear wall of the sanctuary, behind the altar, are Twelve Church Fathers. In the narthex are scenes of the Last Judgment, Bosom of Abraham, Angels bearing a Medallion with the Cross, and three scenes from the life of Saint Stephen; other paintings were lost in the 1283 earthquake.

40|$|Introduction: {{as found}} <b>in</b> <b>Secco</b> (2000, 2001), the {{presence}} of the dark halo in a two component astrophysical object, can induce a scale length on the visible component trough the appearance of a maximum in the Clausius Virial potential energy (CV), which we expect, in general, to be monotonic. In this investigation the author used two power law density profiles, but we will find that the same occurs for more complex and realistic models. Method: we present a set of three two component dynamical models of elliptical galaxies to investigate the topology of the CV of a stellar spherical component completely embedded in a dark spherical halo. We have chosen Hernquist and Plummer mass density profiles for the two components in three different combinations: Plummer-Plummer, Hernquist-Hernquist, Hernquist-Plummer, where the first term refers to the stellar component, while the second to the dark component. In this way we can evaluate different combinations of cuspy and cored profiles and see their influence on the general behavior of CV. The fact that Plummer profiles are not perfectly describing real elliptical galaxies, and maybe also dark halos, is not so important for our present study, as the aim is to investigate the general trend of the CV. Results: it will be shown that the presence or not of stationary points in the CV are strongly depending on the ratio R between dark halo and stellar component masses, as expected, but are not much depending on the particular choice of the mass density profiles. Indeed all three models present the maximum of CV, with some restrictions on R. In general, cuspy profiles tend to restrain {{the presence of}} the CV, which appears for greater R, while cored profiles tend to enhance it. Discussion: with this preliminary study of the CV trend for two component models of elliptical galaxies we have found that the maximums in the CV are present for certain values of R also for more complex models. This can indicate that the stationary points in the CV could have a physical interesting meaning in the dynamics of elliptical galaxies...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 50 % {{of solar}} cells {{are based on}} {{multicrystalline}} silicon (mc-Si). A major limiting factor in their efficiency is recombination of electron-hole pairs at dislocations. Manufacturers of mc-Si wafers are focussing on reducing dislocation densities by modified casting techniques. However, an alternative approach is to remove the dislocations after growth and wafering. This thesis aims to explore the feasibility of using chemical processing to remove dislocations from mc-Si wafers. For measuring the depth to which dislocation cores are removed an angle lapping technique is First developed. This allows the pit diameters and depth of bulk material removed to be measured. The parameter "aspect ratio" {{is defined as the}} ratio of dislocation etch pit depth to diameter; a high aspect ratio is desirable. The results gained allow the dislocation core removal process to be studied and optimised. The first etching system explored is the Secco etch (1 K₂Cr₂O₇ (0. 15 M) : 2 HF (49 %)), a commonly used defect-revealing etch. Samples are immersed <b>in</b> <b>Secco</b> etch for various durations at a range of temperatures, and pits are formed at the locations of dislocations and grain and twin boundaries. Secco etch is found to remove dislocations to depths of up to 40 m. The activation energies for dislocation etching, etch pit widening and bulk etching are calculated as 0. 20, 0. 23 and 0. 30 eV respectively. Scanning electron microscopy is used to determine the geometry of the etch pits. Their structure is shown to be somewhat tubular, but the diameter of the pits is relatively large; too much bulk material is being removed. Further, at all temperatures the aspect ratio decreases with an increase in etch duration, so the aim of long, narrow etch tubes {{does not appear to be}} feasible using Secco etch. Finding an alternative etching system with a lower bulk etch rate is the next aim. Anodic etching, where the silicon sample is biased whilst immersed in a solution, is therefore investigated, as control of the etch strength is provided by varying the electrical parameters. The overall etch rates for both dislocation etching and bulk etching are approximately two orders of magnitude lower; etch durations of over a day are needed to produce pits comparable to 20 minutes Secco etching. This, however, does not lead to improvements in aspect ratio, and the etching behaviour is hard to control. Anodic etching appears to be much more sensitive to small, local changes in condition, evidenced by varying results across different regions of a single sample. Slower acting chemical etches are the final system that is investigated, and are chosen based on the strength of the oxidising agent present. The aim here is that the alternative etch solutions provide a very low bulk etch rate and are used at very long etch durations to produce long etch tubes with very high aspect ratio. An iodine-based etch (1 I₂ (0. 01 M) : 2 HF (49 %)) is the only candidate found to produce good defect delineation, but the dislocation etch rate is very low and again the aspect ratio is unsuitable for removing dislocations deep into wafers.
