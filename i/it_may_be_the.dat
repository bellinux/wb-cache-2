5|$|The Harpy Tomb is {{a marble}} chamber from a pillar tomb {{that stands in}} the {{abandoned}} city of Xanthos, capital of ancient Lycia, a region of southwestern Anatolia {{in what is now}} Turkey. Dating to approximately 480–470BC, the chamber topped a tall pillar and was decorated with marble panels carved in bas-relief. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Kybernis, a king of Xanthos.|$|E

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{conjecture}} {{that the}} matter composing the Oort cloud formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution.

5|$|During Operation Market Garden, the Allied {{parachute}} landings in the Netherlands, JG 11 {{was credited}} with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF Hawker Typhoons near Deventer. According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to flak and one in aerial combat against Jagdgeschwader 53 Bf 109s near Apeldoorn. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer. However, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.|$|E

He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers. Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4–2. This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last time he would play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board.

5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield {{in the search for}} fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or {{the creation of an}} area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E
