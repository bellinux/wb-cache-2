40|$|In 1990, the U. S. Congress passed {{legislation}} that amended the Clean Air Act {{to create a}} new program to mitigate the effects of acid deposition in the U. S. through emission reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) at electric utility plants across the country. The SO 2 reductions, totalling a 40 % reduction nationally from 1980 levels or a 10 million ton reduction annually, are achieved largely through an emission trading system, the largest program of its kind designed to date. This trading system has the potential to save up to half of the compliance costs associated with more traditional source-by-source emission limit programs. This paper briefly discusses background on the acid rain issue in the United States, and the principal features of the program, including: a permanent cap on utility emissions of SO 2 beginning in 2010, decision to grant up-front allocation of emission credits to reduce <b>individual</b> <b>approvals</b> of trades, the use of continuous emission monitors and automatic penalties to ensure compliance, and integration of the Acid Rain program requirements with other Clean Air Act programs. The paper also discusses the development of the allowance trading market to date, including the types of compliance options chosen and quantity and type of emissions trading being conducted.

50|$|For each {{of these}} exceptions, GDR {{citizens}} had to apply for <b>individual</b> <b>approval,</b> which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange {{only a very small}} amount of East German Marks into Deutsche Marks (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (Begrüßungsgeld, or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.|$|R

Although there were differences in the observation techniques used and the behavioral, cultural, and ethnic groups sampled, the results were similar.

5000|$|The {{coalescence}} of 'individuals' out of {{the cosmic}} flow of matter is a slow and incomplete process. [...] "Individuation is mobile, strangely supple, fortuitous and endowed with fringes and margins; all because the intensities which contribute to it communicate with each other, envelop other intensities, and are in turn enveloped" [...] (254). That is, even after individuation takes place, the world does not become passive background or stage on which newly autonomous actors relate to each other. Individuals remain bound to the underlying forces that constitute them all, and these forces can interact and develop without <b>individual</b> <b>approval.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|R

In some member states, anti-TTIP street protests and political activists received substantial support. The paper {{is concerned with the}} drivers of public support or disapproval of TTIP. In particular, we focus on the role of (dis-) trust in companies and in political institutions for attitude formation concerning economic regulation. We use data from a Eurobarometer Survey conducted in November 2014 to assess the determinants of <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> or disapproval of TTIP by European citizens. By means of a mixed-level logit regression it can be shown that disapproval is highly correlated with a lack of trust in European institutions and in large companies. Our results moreover indicate that anti-TTIP political activism has a strong impact on TTIP-related preferences...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the credit}} process in banks. Specifically, it describes the credit process {{running from the}} very beginning when a client asks for a bank loan to the final moment when he/she pays the last installment. In addition, the author explains individual steps made by banks throughout the entire repayment period and their measures adopted at the moment when a client is unable to settle his/her loan. The thesis also includes calculations used in assessing the profitability of granted credits. Furthermore, it deals with methods of distributing credits to <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> levels, i. e. if a credit can be approved directly in a client's branch or whether the approval must be given at a nationwide level. It offers a hypothesis that the standard method of determining these approval levels is ineffective and proposes a new distribution method. In the last part, both different methods are, at first theoretically, compared with each other to be later followed by an empiric analysis of effects of both methods based on an available data sample.

When wearing {{more than one}} foreign decoration (miniature medal), wear them in the order earned. Do not wear foreign decorations unless wearing other US military decorations and service medals. When authorized more than one decoration, wear them in the order earned. If authorized more than one foreign decoration from the same country, wear them in the order the country prescribes.

[...] Paragraph 11.2.2.3. refers to paragraph 10.5.1.6 (now deleted) for wear location guidance, which was deleted during the last revision.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this Master's Thesis is a {{description}} of administrative and similar proceedings leading to issue of permits, consents, statements and expert opinions needed {{for the implementation of}} entrepreneurial plans that could potentially have negative impacts on the environment. This Thesis describes the process of environmental impact assessment (so called EIA) and its specifics, as well as its relevance for further administrative proceedings. Other subject of analyses is the integrated permit, a document that substitutes selected individual administrative deeds, and also the very permits, consents and statements intended to protect the individual environmental departments (such as air, water, landscape) or to regulate environmentally relevant activities (e. g. waste treatment). Subject of analyses are also the permission procedures pursuant to the Construction Act that ensure the protection of the common public interest on environment protection by the means of so called binding opinions of environmental protection authorities necessary in the land-use and construction permit issue proceedings as well as in other land-use planning activities. The aim of this Thesis is to describe specific aspects of the <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> proceedings and their mutual procedural and factual correlation in order to eliminate interpretation difficulties caused by the fragmented legal regulation in the area of environmental protection legislation...|$|R

40|$|We {{model the}} {{endogenous}} emergence of social perceptions about occupations {{and their impact}} on occupational choice. In particular, an <b>individual's</b> social <b>approval</b> increases with his community's perception of his skill in his chosen career. These perceptions vary across communities because individuals better assess the skill of those in occupations similar to their own. Such imperfect assessment can distort choices away from comparative advantage. When skill distributions differ across occupations and/or correlate positively, the community perceives one occupation more favorably. This favored sector experiences overcrowding, but misallocation occurs across both sectors. Furthermore, a positive skill correlation can produce multiple steady states. ...|$|R
