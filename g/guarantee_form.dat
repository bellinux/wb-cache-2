5000|$|Like {{many other}} Dutch cities, Haarlem had a hospice {{situated}} {{outside the city}} walls for lepers, plague victims, and other sufferers considered by the city council to have infectious diseases. In council archives, it {{is often referred to}} as [...] "De Siecken", since that was the name of the street it was on (now the Schotersingel). The Dolhuys was situated in the former town of Schoten (annexed by Haarlem in 1927). What made this one so unusual was the privilege granted to Haarlem in 1413 to test lepers from all over the provinces Holland and Zeeland and grant them a vuilbrief, or document certifying their status as leper. With this paper, the leper was legally allowed to beg. According to tradition, a leper would be cured after begging a certain amount of money. When a vuilbrief expired, the subject could request a new one. This privilege meant a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>form</b> of income for this institution, since it also meant a steady stream of visitors and accompanying traffic.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe H 13 {{hot-working}} tool steel {{is widely used}} as die material in the warm forming of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V titanium alloy sheet. However, under the heating condition, severe friction and lubricating conditions between the H 13 tools and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V titanium alloy sheet would cause difficulty in <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>forming</b> quality. Surface modification {{may be used to}} control the level of friction force, reduce the friction wear and extend the service life of dies. In this paper, four surface modification methods (chromium plating, TiAlN coating, surface polishing and nitriding treatment) were applied to the H 13 surfaces. Taking the coefficient of friction (CoF) and the wear degree as evaluation indicators, the high-temperature tribological behavior of the surface modified H 13 steel was experimentally investigated under different tribological conditions. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the tribological properties of the TiAlN coating under dry friction condition are better than the others for a wide range of temperature (from room temperature to 500 °C), while there is little difference of tribological properties between different surface modifications under graphite lubricated condition, and the variation law of CoF with temperature under graphite lubricated is opposite to that under the dry friction...|$|R
