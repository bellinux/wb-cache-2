In order to obtain needed surface roughness, the proper setting of cutting parameters is crucial before the process take place. Therefore, an accurate mathematical model to predict surface roughness is totally needed.

40|$|Internet {{has been}} viewed by many travel {{organizations}} as an innovative and competitive marketing tool in offering travel-related information and online transaction opportunities (Doolin et al., 2002). But, Internet also has proportionate opportunities to appear new intermediaries in the new hotel value chain (Connolly et al., 1998). A substantial portion of online room reservations continues to be accounted by the third-party Web sites (Law and Cheung, 2006). Hotels have been actively involved in multi-channel distribution in order to sell products and services more efficiently {{using a combination of}} traditional and electronic channels. It is important for organizations to rely on the channels that best match the organizational goals (O’Connor and Frew, 2004). The methodology for the experiment follows Statistical Design of Experiments (SDE). SDE is a statistical technique useful for developing, improving and optimizing processes and also has important applications in research into customer psychology and behaviour (Rosenbaum 1999). However, SDE is not a new tool in marketing; pioneering works such as those by Holland and Cravens (1973), Chevalier (1975) and more recently those of Starkey, Aughton and Brewin (1997), Almquist y Wyner (2001) have used <b>full</b> <b>factorials</b> and fractional factorial designs.

The Yates analysis yields factor estimates {{for all of the}} coefficients (main effects and all relevant interactions) in 2 -level <b>full</b> and <b>factorial</b> experiments. The name “Yates analysis ” comes from the pioneering work which Yates carried out in the analysis of these designs.

40|$|The {{presented}} work is {{an investigation}} of fluid-particle separation phenomena and compression stress resistance performance of magnetorheological (MR) fluids under squeeze mode. The squeeze mode is very significant to MR machining application. Material {{used in this study}} was silicone oil based MR fluid with 20 % volume fraction of carbonyl iron particle. Compression test was performed by integrating the developed squeeze mode testing rig with a 50 kN Universal Testing Machine (UTM). The tests were conducted at constant speed and current. Each test was conducted at an initial gap of 2 mm and was stopped at a final gap of 0. 5 mm. Force-displacement data was recorded and was analysed using TestExpert® II software. <b>Full</b> <b>factorials</b> with 27 experiments were designed using Design Expert 7 software. Three factors investigated in the design of experiments were carrier fluid viscosity, supplied current, and compression speed. Responses measured were strain energy and compression stress at maximum strain. Macro images of the phenomenon were recorded and evaluated qualitatively. From the compression stress-strain results, carrier fluid viscosity was significant to vary the MR fluid properties. The observed phenomenon shows that fluid-particle separation occurred in the low viscosity carrier fluid, low compression speed and high applied current. The parameters effect on strain energy and compression stress suggests that the fluid-particle separation is significant to the squeeze mode MR fluid performance. The relationship between stress resistance performance and fluid-particle separation phenomena were significant in designing innovative MR fluid devices...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Purification of a-toxin {{produced}} by Clostridium perfringens type A in aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) was studied with a <b>full</b> two-level <b>factorial</b> design on two factors (concentrations of 8000 g mol(- 1) PEG and phosphate salt at pH 8. 0), {{to estimate the}} influence of these factors on the purification results. RESULTS: The partition coefficient (K), purification factor (PF) and activity yield (Y) were strongly influenced by the PEG and phosphate concentrations. Raising the levels of the two factors increased these responses. The highest purification factor (5. 7) was obtained with PEG and phosphate concentrations of 17. 5 % and 15 %, respectively.
