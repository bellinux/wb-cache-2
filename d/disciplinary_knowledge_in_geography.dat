30|$|To {{illustrate}} students’ {{application of}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> {{their efforts to}} improve on their initial designs, we consider excerpts from the group transcripts. We revisit firstly Lilly’s group, who were reviewing how they might effectively combine the best features of their initial designs into a redesign. It {{can be seen in}} the following discussion how the students considered the interaction of mathematics and science components in undertaking a redesign while cognizant of the problem constraints. In contrast to their initial design discussions, which not surprisingly tended to focus on what was feasible within the problem constraints, the group’s deliberations concentrated more strongly on applying <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> modifying their initial designs.|$|R
30|$|The study {{supports}} research indicating young learners’ {{potential for}} early engineering.

We offer our framework of design processes for younger learners as one way to approach early engineering education with respect to both the creation of rich problem experiences and the analysis of their learning.|$|R

30|$|We {{conclude}} {{from this}} study that well-structured engineering experiences provide {{opportunities for students to}} engage in the design processes connected to an aerospace context. Although only slight improvements occurred in the sketches between the design and redesign phases, the study reveals that students could sketch planes of varying levels of sophistication that translated into models. We suggest that scaffolding by the teacher about how to improve designs for increased detail could be included in subsequent experiences (cf. Anning 1997). In the last two phases of our engineering framework (evaluation, redesign), students began to apply <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> when recommending an improved launch technique and when explaining changes for their second design. The study highlights the importance of affording students the opportunity to complete their initial designs, then build and test their models, and subsequently negotiate and create a second design. This opportunity appeared to have contributed to students’ improved application of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> the final phases of our engineering framework.|$|R

The group decided to retain the size of the tail because “we think the lighter the plane the less weight it will take up…” and “so the wind in the air will hold it up for longer”.

40|$|Background: Internationally, {{there is}} a growing concern for {{developing}} STEM education to prepare students for a scientifically and technologically advanced society. Despite educational bodies lobbying for an increased focus on STEM, there is limited research on how engineering might be incorporated especially in the elementary school curriculum. A framework of five comprehensive core engineering design processes (problem scoping, idea generation, design and construction, design evaluation, redesign), adapted from the literature on design thinking in young children, served as a basis for the study. We report on a qualitative study of fourth-grade students’ developments in working an aerospace problem, which took place {{during the first year of}} a 3 -year longitudinal study. Students applied design processes together with their mathematics and science knowledge to the design and redesign of a 3 -D model plane. Results: The study shows that through an aerospace engineering problem, students could complete initial designs and redesigns of a model plane at varying levels of sophistication. Three levels of increasing sophistication in students’ sketches were identified in their designs and redesigns. The second level was the most prevalent involving drawings or templates of planes together with an indication of how to fold the materials as well as measurements linked to the plane’s construction. The third level incorporated written instructions and calculations. Students’ engagement with each of the framework’s design processes revealed problem scoping components in their initial designs and redesigns. Furthermore, students’ recommendations for improving their launching techniques revealed an ability to apply their mathematics <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with their science learning on the forces of flight. Students’ addition of context was evident together with an awareness of constraints and a consideration of what was feasible in their design creation. Interestingly, students’ application of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> occurred more frequently in the last two phases of the engineering framework (i. e., design evaluation and redesign), highlighting the need for students to reach these final phases to enable the science and mathematics ideas to emerge. Conclusions: The study supports research indicating young learners’ potential for early engineering. Students can engage in design and redesign processes, applying their STEM <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> doing so. An appropriate balance is needed between teacher input of new concepts and students’ application of this learning in ways they choose.

30|$|Our {{study has}} {{provided}} {{an example of}} how fourth-grade students can engage in processes of engineering design and apply <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> solving a meaningful and appealing problem. In accord with calls for better integration of the STEM disciplines and a more balanced representation of content (e.g., Honey et al., 2014), we developed the Aerospace Challenge drawing on the teachers’ science, mathematics, and technology programs. Building largely on Dorie et al.’s (2014) research, we developed an engineering design framework for this study that would cater for multiple processes in early engineering education. The five main interactive processes of problem scoping, idea generation, design and construction, design evaluation, and redesign formed our framework, with each comprising a number of components playing key roles in problem solution. The development and application of STEM content knowledge is an important feature of the framework, reflecting the well-documented role of such learning during design (e.g., Crismond and Adams 2012; Diaz and King 2007; Moore et al. 2014). Likewise, the establishment of productive collaborative groups at the outset of problem solution is an important feature.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the issues of}} {{validity}} and reliability {{in the assessment of}} the learning outcomes of WIL curricula are considered. An argument is made that there are three classes of learning outcome for WIL curricula: experience of the work-world; the development or refinement of skills; and the application of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> work contexts. It is noted that the protocols for assessing the first two of these outcome classes have a longer history and are better developed, in terms of established validity and reliability, than those for assessing the third outcome class. An elaboration is then made of the scope and meaning this third class of outcome, and it is argued that the naïve notion of “application ” can be developed fruitfully in terms of three requirements that force the explicit integration of theory and practice: (1) interpretations of the setting; (2) predictions about the impacts of possible future action scenarios therein; and (3) action choices. When all three are justified by reference to <b>disciplinary</b> canonical <b>knowledge</b> and theory a strong case can be made that students have successfully integrated theory and practice.

40|$|Economic {{research}} on risk attitudes has traditionally focused on individual decision-making issues, without any consideration for potential social influences on preferences. This has been changing rapidly {{over the last}} years, with economists often taking inspiration from earlier psychological research in their increasing consideration of social aspects in decision-making under risk. We provide a broadly conceived overview of the recent literature, defining four different categories of social influences on economic decisions under risk: (1) the observation of other agents’ outcomes; (2) the observation of the decision maker’s outcomes by other agents; (3) the direct effect of the decision maker’s choices on other agents’ outcomes; and (4) the direct dependency of the decision maker’s outcomes on other agents’ choices. While many promising insights have been gained {{over the last few}} years, several shortcomings and inconsistencies in our current understanding of social influences on decision-making under risk are pointed out.

40|$|This largely {{conceptual}} thesis {{explores the}} epistemological nature of students' engagement with <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge,</b> primarily <b>in</b> further education contexts. The disciplinary nature of students' engagement is frequently obscured by concerns relating to their engagement with educational processes. A model which distinguishes between {{different forms of}} knowledge and which places <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> at {{the centre of the}} educational context is proposed. This model serves as an organising idea throughout the thesis. Approaches to theorising educational knowledge, including social realist, sociocultural and situated theories of learning as well as Bernstein's work, are analysed, critiqued and in some cases adapted. A case study of the school science curriculum and scientific literacy explores the principles of recontextualisation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge</b> and a key debate concerning the nature of 'authentic learning' is identified. It is argued that while Bernsteinian and social realist theories are useful in elaborating the role of forms of knowledge within the curriculum, these theories tend to neglect social relations to <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> different epistemic contexts. An alternative view which recognises the function of mythological disciplinary narratives is proposed. This conceptualisation acknowledges that disciplinary discourses are only fully meaningful in their authentic contexts and emphasises the role of pedagogy in bridging the meaning that is made between agential participants in the different contexts. The fully elaborated model for forms of knowledge within the educational context locates a realist theory of knowledge within sociocultural theory and provides an epistemological account of students' relationships with <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge.</b> It provides a theoretical tool for practitioners and those engaged in curriculum development for thinking about students' engagement with <b>disciplinary</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Implications for aspects of policy and practice are discussed, as are opportunities for further research...|$|R
