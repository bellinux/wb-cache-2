The 2016 Defence White Paper included a commitment to further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E

In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} problem of free riding in NATO with regards to {{fulfilling}} the criteria of <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> as well as econometric analysis and interpretation of the <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> of the member states in the period of 2006 to 2016. Using spearman correlation test, this thesis finds a significant positive correlation between GDP of member states and their <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Explanatory variables include main economic indicators such as GDP, GNI, share of GDP devoted to <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures,</b> average annual change in <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures,</b> etc. Main findings include the conclusion that there is a significant level of free riding in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and that larger member states indeed bear the larger burden. Furthermore, based on having lower average <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> than NATO in the examined period, the thesis labels nineteen of the member states as free riding, given that their <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> are below the NATO average. After examining and analysing free riding in NATO the thesis also highlights the implications and recommendations for fiscal policy...|$|R

It examines the long-run causal relationship using the weak exogeneity test and utilizes general impulse response functions {{to determine whether a}} shock to <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> affects economic growth or vice versa. Our findings provide substantive evidence in favour of the existence of a long-run equilibrium cointegrated relationship between <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures,</b> GDP, labour and capital stock. The results of the weak exogeneity test indicate that a bi-directional causal relationship exists in the long-run between <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> and GDP. Thus, the main policy implication that emerges from the long-run results is that increasing <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Taiwan is an effective means to boost overall economic performance and, with this improved economy, it should then be able to increase its <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> further. Lastly, from our dynamic vector error correction model estimations, it is found that <b>defence</b> <b>expenditures</b> are a major means of adjusting for disequilibria that occur within the system. <b>Defence</b> <b>expenditures,</b> Economic growth, Taiwan, Capital stock, Cointegration,...|$|R

In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments.

5|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the {{amalgamation}} of {{the military}} forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power solely to the Commonwealth. Indeed, this process took some time as, to a large extent, matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, {{and there was also}} a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep <b>defence</b> <b>expenditure</b> low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.|$|E
