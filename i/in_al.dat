40|$|<b>In</b> <b>als</b> 3, an Al-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant, shoot {{development}} and root growth {{are sensitive to}} Al. Mutant als 3 seedlings grown in an Al-containing medium exhibit severely inhibited leaf expansion and root growth. In the presence of Al, unexpanded leaves accumulate callose, an indicator of <b>Al</b> damage <b>in</b> roots. The possibility that the inhibition of shoot development <b>in</b> <b>als</b> 3 {{is due to the}} hyperaccumulation of <b>Al</b> <b>in</b> this tissue was examined. However, {{it was found that the}} levels of <b>Al</b> that accumulated <b>in</b> shoots of <b>als</b> 3 are not different from the wild type. The inhibition of shoot development <b>in</b> <b>als</b> 3 is not a consequence of nonspecific damage to roots, because other metals (e. g.

5|$|In many languages, {{including}} modern European {{languages and}} Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, {{the use of}} structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part {{under the influence of}} the Arabic language <b>in</b> <b>Al</b> Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.|$|E

In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo {{home run in the}} eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second <b>in</b> <b>AL</b> MVP voting.

5|$|Rivera was a {{dominant}} reliever throughout his career, pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic {{of a role}} commonly marked by volatility and high turnover. In his 17-year tenure as the Yankees' closer, Rivera compiled considerable career numbers. A 13-time All-Star, he is the major leagues' all-time regular season leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). He pitched in 1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history, the most <b>in</b> <b>AL</b> history, and the most by a right-handed pitcher. Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen); 25 saves (fifteen consecutive, sixteen non-consecutive); 30 saves (nine consecutive, fifteen non-consecutive); 35 saves (twelve); 40 saves (nine); and 50 saves (two). Rivera's career ERA (2.21) and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live-ball era (minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making {{him one of the}} top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring. He recorded an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, tying him with Walter Johnson for the most such seasons (minimum 60innings pitched each). Rivera also ranks first in career adjusted ERA+ (205), a statistic that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline.|$|E

At the same time, he aided Jack Moroney in his own comeback to cricket at New South Wales by suggesting he subtract three years from his age when he submitted his registration form. Overall in the 1948–1949 season he scored 300runs from nine matches, his highest season total, at 25.00, and taking 21catches and six stumpings. Following the South Africa tour of 1949–1950 he returned to Australia again for one final season from 1950–1951, however played only one match, scoring five runs and taking two catches.

It was at the point that his effectiveness declined rapidly, allowing runs to score in four of his next five appearances. In a game against the Red Sox on June18, he relieved starter Carl Mathias, and immediately gave up bases on balls to the first two batters he faced, which forced in two runs, then gave up a grand slam to Jim Pagliaroni. He followed with another base on balls, and was relieved without having recording an out. Over the course of the next couple months, with his ERA steadily rising, his playing time was lessened, making just six appearances in the month of July, and five in August. He made his last major league start on August31 against the Tigers, giving up seven hits and six earned runs for the loss. In 45total appearances in 1961, he had a 2–8win-loss record and finished sixth <b>in</b> <b>AL</b> with 11saves. On September16, the Senators agreed to send $75,000 ($ current dollar adjustment) and a player to be named later to the Cincinnati Reds of the NL for pitcher Claude Osteen.
