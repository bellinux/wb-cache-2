5000|$|After Li Siyuan became Later Tang's emperor in 926, he {{appointed}} Li Jinquan military commissioner of Longwu (龍武), seated in Jing Prefecture {{in the western}} part of the empire. Li Jinquan's governance was greedy and oppressive.

This shocked the emperor, who questioned him: [...] "You must suffer from a plentitude of horses. Why else would you offer so many? Moreover, you serve at Jing Prefecture. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>characterize</b> conditions there? Surely, you do more than merely trade in horses?"
