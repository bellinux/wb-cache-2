25|$|Alomía Robles' second {{youngest}} child, Armando Robles Godoy, {{who became}} a well known Peruvian film director, says that in his fourteen years in New York City, his father never learned to speak English. He also said his father <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> baritone voice and was obsessed with the number seven, {{only one of the}} mysteries that surrounded the magical world that his father lived in.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> action, run-up and {{delivery}} and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E
25|$|Another myth of {{the origin}} of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> {{daughter}} named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{director}} David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts {{after looking}} at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> soul, an intelligence—possibilities {{for a lot of}} different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, [...] "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." [...] Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] blends {{pulsating}} {{industrial and}} dance beats with elements of trance. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast {{them with the}} hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You <b>Had</b> <b>a</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Body Would You Hold It Against Me". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated {{in an interview that}} the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} the album are noted for their {{changing}} dynamics – with [...] "middle sections [...] turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures" [...] which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as Wings, Eagles and Bread - summed by Hawkins by saying the band [...] "wanted {{to make sure that}} everything 'built' on this record, that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else {{in the course of a}} song". The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower stuff with the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. So we did everything we could to really magnify all those elements and that was fun. Usually you have a few parameters you're afraid to pass but, this time, there was no fear of going too far." [...] Mix engineer Rich Costey added that his work ...|$|E

500|$|After [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it {{for being}} {{similar to their}} 1979 hit [...] "If I Said You <b>Had</b> <b>a</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Body Would You Hold It Against Me". In a statement, David Bellamy said [...] "professionally, well, in all honesty, we feel {{completely}} ripped off. Where's the originality?" [...] The brothers's attorney Christopher E. Schmidt stated that [...] " [...] becomes somewhat uncanny if you simply double {{the beat of the}} Bellamy Brothers' song and match it up with Britney's version" [...] and pointed out that it {{was not the first time}} Martin and Luke were accused of copyright infringement. On March 2, 2011, Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them. The case was dismissed on August 11, 2011. The Bellamy Brothers released a statement that said, [...] "The Bellamy Brothers apologise to Dr. Luke and Max Martin for the Bellamys' public statements and any false impressions suggested by the statements on their website that Dr. Luke and Max Martin copy the works of others." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring {{by their}} photographs. He called them in {{separately}} for half-hour interviews {{and told them}} that he had not seen any of their previous works in film or television. Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident {{on the way to the}} first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E

In the account, Freyja is described as having been a concubine of Odin, who bartered sex to four dwarfs for a golden necklace. In the work, the Æsir once lived in a city called Asgard, located in a region called [...] "Asialand or Asiahome". Odin was {{the king of the}} realm, and made Njörðr and Freyr temple priests. Freyja was the daughter of Njörðr, and was Odin's concubine. Odin deeply loved Freyja, and she was [...] "the fairest of woman of that day."

[...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold.
