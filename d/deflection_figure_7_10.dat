In <b>Figure</b> <b>7,</b> the amplitude of ∂ w/∂ z, which becomes Am, is about 5 × 10 − 5 s − 1. Substituting A m= 5 × 10 − 5 s − 1, N 2 = 5 × 10 − 4 s − 2, and ω= 3.1 × 10 − 4 s − 1 into Equation 6, the amplitude of the wave pattern of N 2 is estimated to be 8.3 × 10 − 5 s − 2, whereas the actual amplitude in <b>Figure</b> <b>7</b> is about <b>10</b> − 4 s − 2.

The least-squares algorithm is used to fit data in circle detection. The application of conventional least-squares algorithm is limited, as roundness error is bigger, precision is lower. For detecting arc with data points of non-uniform distribution, improved least-squares algorithm, developed an analysis algorithm for assessing the minimum zone roundness error. Center and radius can be solved, without iteration and truncation error. Using the discrete data instances verified different roundness error evaluation methods. Visual measurements {{have been carried out}} using the proposed methods.

40|$|In {{this study}} we present {{simultaneous}} low-resolution longitudinal magnetic field measurements and high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the cool single giant FK Com. The variation of the magnetic field over the rotational period of 2. 4 days is compared with the starspot location obtained using Doppler imaging techniques, V-band photometry and V-I colours. The chromospheric activity is studied simultaneously with the photospheric activity using high resolution observations of the Halpha, Hbeta and Hgamma line profiles. Both the maximum (272 +/- 24 G) and minimum (60 +/- 17 G) in the mean longitudinal magnetic field,, are detected close to the phases where cool spots appear on the stellar surface. A possible explanation for such a behaviour is that the active regions at the two longitudes separated by 0. 2 in phase have opposite polarities.

Some basic properties of KMPE are presented. In particular, we apply the KMPE to extreme learning machine (ELM) and principal component analysis (PCA), and develop two robust learning algorithms, namely ELM-KMPE and PCA-KMPE. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark data show that the developed algorithms can achieve consistently better performance when compared with some existing methods.

For these ensembles, the empirical distribution of a normalized deflation time is found to collapse onto a curve that depends only on the algorithm, but not on the matrix size or deflation tolerance provided the matrix size is large enough (see <b>Figure</b> 4, <b>Figure</b> <b>7</b> and <b>Figure</b> <b>10).</b> For the QR algorithm with the Wilkinson shift, the observed universality is even stronger and includes certain non-Wigner ensembles.

40|$|We study static {{annihilation}} on complex networks, {{in which}} pairs of connected particles annihilate {{at a constant}} rate during time. Through a mean-field formalism, we compute the temporal evolution {{of the distribution of}} surviving sites with an arbitrary number of connections. This general formalism, which is exact for disordered networks, is applied to Kronecker, Erdös-Rényi (i. e. Poisson) and scale-free networks. We compare our theoretical results with extensive numerical simulations obtaining excellent agreement. Although the mean-field approach applies in an exact way neither to ordered lattices nor to small-world networks, it qualitatively describes the annihilation dynamics in such structures. Our results indicate that the higher the connectivity of a given network element, the faster it annihilates. This fact has dramatic consequences in scale-free networks, for which, once the "hubs" have been annihilated, the network disintegrates and only isolated sites are left.

We obtain conditions for mean convergence of the ILMS algorithm, and show that in the presence of fading channels, the ILMS algorithm is asymptotically biased. Furthermore, the dynamic range for mean stability depends only on the mean channel gain, and under simplifying technical assumptions, we show that the MSD, EMSE and MSE are non-decreasing functions of the channel gain variances, with mean-square convergence to the steady states possible only if the channel gain variances are limited. We derive sufficient conditions to ensure mean-square convergence, and verify our results through simulations.
