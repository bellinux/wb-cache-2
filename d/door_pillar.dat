2500|$|The FJ Cruiser {{features}} a short wheelbase, stocky frame, and grille-headlight arrangement {{much like the}} original FJ40. Other throwback design cues include a nearly vertical windshield with three windshield wipers for maximum surface area coverage. The FJ Cruiser also featured the name [...] "Toyota" [...] spelled out across the grille instead of the corporate emblem {{which has been in}} use since 1990, another reference to the FJ40 and other older Toyota trucks. The FJ's body features rear opening access doors that give a unique look to the SUV. Special high-strength steel was used to give the vehicle side impact protection without the need for a <b>door</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|E

50|$|Trafficators are {{semaphore}} signals which, when operated, protrude from the bodywork of {{a motor vehicle}} to indicate its intention to turn in the direction indicated by the pointing signal. Trafficators are often located at the <b>door</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{flashing}} orange {{direction indicator}} lights positioned {{at the front}} where there had been reflectors and in the redesigned rear light clusters replaced trafficators in the <b>door</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Strengthened body structure. The W116 {{featured}} {{a more stable}} security passenger cell with a stiffened roof frame structure. High strength roof and <b>door</b> <b>pillars,</b> along with other reinforced zones, provided enhanced vehicle occupant protection.|$|R

50|$|In April 1962 {{the car was}} {{upgraded}} {{with four}} wheel Dunlop disc brakes {{in place of the}} disc/drum combination and named Series II. Door frames were now constructed of aluminium for lightness as well as being panelled in aluminium to alleviate persistent problems with the Park Ward body's wooden <b>door</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Some {{automakers}} (such as Mercedes-Benz) {{call for}} the replacement of undeployed airbags after {{a certain period of}} time to ensure their reliability in an accident. One example is the 1992 S500, which has an expiry date sticker attached to the <b>door</b> <b>pillar.</b> Some Škoda vehicles indicate an expiry date of 14 years from the date of manufacture. In this case, replacement would be uneconomic as the car would have negligible value at 14 years old, far less than the cost of fitting new airbags. Volvo, on the other hand, has stated [...] "airbags do not require replacement during the lifetime of the vehicle," [...] though this cannot be taken as a guarantee on the device.|$|E
50|$|Luxury SUVs {{typically}} {{offer the}} most expected safety features including side airbags, ABS and traction control, {{and many of them}} also come with electronic stability control, crash resistant <b>door</b> <b>pillars,</b> dynamic head restraints and back-up sensing systems.|$|R
50|$|The wooden <b>doors,</b> <b>pillars,</b> and beams are crafted with artistic {{figures of}} {{different}} gods and goddess such as Astamatrika and Asta Bhairav. Similarly, erotic figures are also carved in wooden beams. According to archeologists, these figures on beams have tantric values.|$|R

50|$|The Ofuda is customarily renewed {{annually}} {{before the}} end of a year, and then attached to a <b>door,</b> <b>pillar,</b> or ceiling. It may also be placed inside a private shrine (kamidana). It is believed to protect the family in residence from general harm, such as a disease. A more specific o-fuda may be placed near particular objects such as one for kitchen to protect from accidental fire. A popular o-fuda called jingū-taima (神宮大麻) or simply taima (大麻) is issued by Ise Shrine. It used to be made from hemp cloth (taima) but nowadays it is made of IseWashi (Washi (Japanese paper) made in Ise) that is blessed and replaced every year — as the use of hemp as a material was common in antiquity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{streamlined}} bodywork is {{very long}} at just under 20 ft. The spare wheel was carried {{inside one of}} the rear doors which must have put an enormous strain on the hinges and <b>door</b> <b>pillar.</b> The equivalent space in the opposite door was occupied either by a second spare wheel or a cocktail cabinet. The car's unusual aerodynamic design was eye catching, with very little front overhang, but a long rear overhang (containing the engine). [...] The underside was also covered in sheet metal to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. [...] The Streamline pointed to the future in terms of space efficiency, featuring a seven-seat interior and, even {{by the standards of the}} time, excellent headroom, which seems to have been a particular concern for the designer.|$|E
5000|$|United Kingdom - all post boxes {{display the}} Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch {{at the time}} of manufacture. Exceptions are the Anonymous pillar boxes of 1879-1887, where the cypher was omitted, and all boxes for use in Scotland {{manufactured}} after 1952 (including replicas of the 1866 Penfold design) which show the Queen's Crown of Scotland instead of the Royal Cypher for Elizabeth II. Private boxes emptied by Royal Mail do not have to carry a cypher. Royal Mail post boxes manufactured since 1994 carry the wording [...] "Royal Mail", normally above the aperture (lamp boxes) or on the <b>door</b> (<b>pillar</b> boxes). Before this date all post boxes, {{with the exception of the}} Anonymous pillar boxes, carried the wording [...] "Post Office".|$|E
50|$|Later, air {{conditioning}} and a sound-proof glass division between {{the front and rear}} seats were added as options. The substantial doors required helical torsion springs inside the <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> to enable them to be opened from the inside with an acceptably low level of effort.|$|R
50|$|Light from crystal chandeliers is {{reflected}} on <b>doors,</b> <b>pillars,</b> walls and ceilings {{in a bright}} blaze that's quite blinding initially. At least 90 per cent of the temple is embellished by a mosaic of 300,000 pieces of red, blue, yellow, green, purple and white glass.|$|R

50|$|Standing near to {{the cross}} is the village's parish church. Dedicated to St Andrew, the church {{originates}} circa the 10th century, the village possibly dates {{from the time of}} King Alfred (849-899). The church consists only of a nave and chancel with, above the former, a bellcote, much of the masonry is Norman but parts date back to Saxon times. The fittings include 17th century bench-ends and a Perpendicular rood screen. Mounted on corbels in the north aisle are the remains of a hogsback grave. The carvings on these stones are either Saxon or Norse (Ringerike). The stones are unique to Lincolnshire and are probably the finest of their type in the country. In the stonework in the porch is the incised outline of a pilgrim's shoe and the year 1728, and on the right-hand <b>door</b> <b>pillar</b> are six carved figures believed to depict ancient May King and Queen ceremonial costumes. The churchyard includes a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery with 131 graves from First and Second World Wars.|$|E
5000|$|A {{choice of}} six-, nine-, or twelve-speed manual {{transmissions}} were on offer for the 2300, while the smaller 2100 received six-speed transmissions {{with or without}} synchronization. Engine options were [...] for the 2300 (with an intercooler for the more powerful model) and [...] for the 2100, {{depending on whether the}} 825 was normally aspirated or turbocharged. The 2300's cabin was mounted 40 mm higher than on the old 2200 (F218) to allow room for the intercooler plumbing, requiring extra grab handles on the <b>door</b> <b>pillar.</b> The 2300 was a considerable success in the United Kingdom, where it outsold bigger brother 2800 and made DAF a name to be reckoned with. In the early months of 1982, the DAF F2500 arrived. A fettled version of the intercooled 2300 engine provided [...] at 2400 rpm and 675 lbft Nm. The power delivery was somewhat peaky, meaning that multiple gears were a necessity. Standard fitment was the six-speed S.6-90 transmission with a splitter for twelve total gears, and a sixteen-speed [...] "Ecosplit" [...] ZF 16S112 was an available option. As with the 2300, the 2500 was available with a short or a sleeper cab, two to four axles, as tractors or as rigid trucks. The more powerful engine made it more fuel efficient than the 2300 as well as quicker and easier to drive.|$|E
50|$|Reviewers overall were {{impressed}} with the large five metre squared space inside the vehicle, surrounded by large windows and thin <b>door</b> <b>pillars.</b> RACCars.co.uk were critical of the ETG6 gearbox, echoing previous criticisms from other reviewers, but praised the new platform for absorbing road imperfections easily and improving the driving experience.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007, CEC {{released}} a free web application called the Facilitator. The Facilitator {{allows users to}} create a three-dimensional model of a room of any size, indoor or outdoor, and place models of any of CEC's products in the room. They have also included models of common elements, such as trees, <b>doors,</b> <b>pillars,</b> windows, tables, and so forth.|$|R
50|$|Both {{vehicles}} {{featured a}} large panoramic windscreen and thin <b>door</b> <b>pillars,</b> {{to enhance the}} driver's field of vision, eliminate blind spots, and {{increase the amount of}} light inside the front cabin. In addition to the front sun visors, both vehicles have two blinds attached to further reduce glare and unwelcome lights for the driver and front passenger.|$|R
5000|$|An {{increase}} in the overhang of {{the front and rear}} bumpers and increases {{in the size of the}} <b>door</b> sills, <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> and the fixed rear wing, permitting the inclusion of additional aerodynamic aids, all aimed at improving aerodynamic grip. However, the bodywork of the 2017 model must be able to cover the bodywork of the 2016 model of car.|$|R
25|$|On {{the south}} wall, {{next to the}} transept, is a still-impressive processional entrance. The <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> are surmounted by a {{segmental}} arch, and above that a round arch of three orders, the area between forming a tympanum. The entire exterior of the doorway is carved in a detailed zig-zag pattern, which was probably used widely around the building. Beyond this lay the cloister, from which the canons would enter the church in procession.|$|R
50|$|Much {{attention}} {{was given to}} aerodynamic considerations, with the body being de-guttered/seam welded {{and the use of}} filler panels for the <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> and 935-style mirrors. Prototype models had NACA-style intercooler intake ducts over the rear fenders (later dropped, as it was discovered that air was pulled out, rather than in, at speed due to a low-pressure area), while later models had additional slots in the rear bumper corners for the air to exit.|$|R

50|$|Post war, the Prefect design {{changed little}} until {{replaced}} in 1952. The headlamps {{moved into the}} wings and trafficators were fitted (internally lit semaphores springing out from the <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> to signal left and right turns), though due to space restrictions these were left out on the Australian-built Ute. Only four-door saloons were available on the home market, the two-door sector being left to the Anglia but some were made for export.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 the coupe {{received}} normal <b>doors</b> with <b>pillars,</b> {{since the}} earlier pillarless design {{proved to be}} leaky and noisy at speed.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the XR2i, {{introduced}} a year earlier, it was visually similar. The main differences were 14" [...] alloy wheels (an inch larger {{and of a}} different design than those fitted to the XR2i) with 185/55 VR14 Pirelli P600 tyres, green rather than blue stripe mouldings, colour-coded rear spoiler and <b>door</b> <b>pillars,</b> opening rear quarter windows, green tinted glass and RS bonnet louvres. Anti-lock brakes and a [...] "Quickclear" [...] heated front windscreen were options at extra cost.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir to you," [...] said Mr. Foker, politely, {{and when}} they parted for the night they shook hands with the {{greatest}} cordiality; the younger gentleman promising the elder not to leave Chatteris without a further conversation in the morning. And as the Major went up to his room, and Mr. Foker smoked his cigar against the <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> of the George, Pen, very likely, ten miles off; was lying in bed kissing the letter from his Emily.|$|R

25|$|The {{modifications}} to the Concord started with a two-door sedan monocoque (unitized) body. To add strength to the platform after the removal of its roof, fourteen steel reinforcements were welded to the undercarriage and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the <b>door</b> <b>pillars</b> for rigidity, as well as additional passenger compartment protection. The front section of the roof (ahead of the targa bar) was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material folded and included a tonneau cover {{for use in the}} down position.|$|R
50|$|Walking through ghostly {{corridors}} looming {{with huge}} portraits and Belgian mirrors, feet crunching on years of bat droppings that cover exquisite floor tiles.... it's {{easy to imagine}} these houses asleep {{in some sort of}} time capsule. But it's unlikely they will stay that way. Already an immense portion of the chettiar families belongings - pewter, brass porcelain, glass Burmese bamboo - is in the local antique shops and being shipped across the world. Houses are being dismantled and sold piece-meal, with carved <b>doors,</b> <b>pillars</b> and friezes in high demand in India and abroad.|$|R
