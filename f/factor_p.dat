The order of a Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G is pn, where n is the multiplicity of p in the order of G, and every subgroup of order pn is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.

2500|$|The C3bBb {{complex is}} {{stabilized}} by binding oligomers of <b>factor</b> <b>P</b> (Properdin). The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, {{some of which}} becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b. This newly bound C3b recruits more B, D and P activity and greatly amplifies the complement activation. When complement is activated on a cell surface, the activation is limited by endogenous complement regulatory proteins, which include CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59, depending on the cell. Pathogens, in general, don't have complement regulatory proteins (there are many exceptions, which reflect adaptation of microbial pathogens to vertebrate immune defenses). [...] Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self {{on the basis of}} the surface expression of complement regulatory proteins. Host cells don't accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement regulatory proteins, while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b. [...] Accordingly, the alternative complement pathway is one element of innate immunity.|$|E

We address one of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} problems concerning the RSA cryptoscheme: Does the knowledge of the RSA public key/ secret key pair (e, d) yield the factorization of N = pq in polynomial time? It is well-known that there is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that on input (N, e, d) outputs the <b>factors</b> <b>p</b> and q. We present the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm that factors N provided that e, d < φ(N) and that the <b>factors</b> <b>p,</b> q are of the same bit-size.

40|$|AbstractThe ring of polynomials in X, X 1,…,Xm are {{denoted by}} Fp[X, X 1,…,Xm] in Fp, {{that is the}} field of {{integers}} defined modulo p. In the usual factorization algorithm defined by Wang, the given polynomial P is first factorized modulo Δn, where Δn is an ideal. This algorithm uses a generalization of Hensel's Lemma. If there are no extraneous factors, then the factors defined modulo Δn correspond to the <b>factors</b> of <b>P</b> in Fp [X, X 1,…,Xm], or else the defined factors must be regrouped to find the <b>factors</b> of <b>P</b> in Fp[X, X 1,…,Xm]. In this paper, a mapping that transforms {{the product of the}} factors into a sum is defined. A theorem that determines whether a subproduct of the <b>factors</b> of <b>P</b> corresponds to a <b>factor</b> of <b>P</b> in Fp[X, X 1,…,Xm] is given. Therefore the regrouping of the <b>factors</b> of <b>P</b> reduces to solving a system of linear equations, as in the univariate case, with Berlekamp's algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Let t, b be {{mutually}} prime positive integers. We {{say that}} the residue class t mod b is basic if theie exists n such that tn ≡ 1 mod b; otherwise t is not basic. In this paper we relate {{the basic character of}} t mod b to the quadratic character of t modulo the prime factors of b. If all prime <b>factors</b> <b>p</b> of b satisfy p ≡ 3 mod 4, then t is basic mod b if t is a quadratic nonresidue mod p for all such p; and t is not basic mod b if t is a quadratic residue mod p for all such p. If, for all prime <b>factors</b> <b>p</b> of b, p ≡ 1 mod 4 and t is a quadratic non-residue mod p, the situation is more complicated. We define d(p) to be the highest power of 2 dividing (p - 1) and postulate that d(p) takes the same value for all prime <b>factors</b> <b>p</b> of b. Then t is basic mod b.

40|$|A two-generation {{crossing}} {{program was}} used to replace the entire chromosome complement of P strains by M strain chromosomes, the maternal contribution being from the P strain. The cytotype of chromosomally substituted females was indistinguishable from M strain cytotype, judged by the sterility of offspring from the cross of such females to P strain males. In addition, following replacement of the chromosomes, the level of DNA homologous to the <b>P</b> <b>factor</b> was sufficiently low to be explicable by low levels of <b>P</b> <b>factor</b> transposition. These {{results are consistent with}} immediate chromosomal control for the switching from P to M cytotype. However, the reverse chromosome substitution, replacing all chromosomes of an M strain with P chromosomes, did not usually lead to immediate change of cytotype properties, showing that there is a true maternal effect in the M to P direction. —The absence of true maternal inheritance for P cytotype argues against models of <b>P</b> <b>factor</b> repression which depend on autonomous replication of a nonchromosomal element.
