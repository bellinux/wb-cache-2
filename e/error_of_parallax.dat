40|$|Summary. First orbits {{are derived}} for 12 new Hipparcos binary systems {{based on the}} precise speckle {{interferometric}} measurements of the relative positions of the components. The orbital periods of the pairs are between 5. 9 and 29. 0 yrs. Magnitude differences obtained from differential speckle photometry allow us to estimate the absolute magnitudes and spectral types of individual stars and to compare their position on the mass-magnitude diagram with the theoretical curves. The spectral types of the new orbiting pairs range from late F to early M. Their mass-sums are determined with a relative accuracy of 10 - 30 %. The mass errors are completely defined by the <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> Hipparcos <b>parallaxes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the local dark matter density (LDMD) {{of the solar}} system is a classical problem in astronomy. Recently, a novel method of determining the LDMD from stellar distribution and vertical velocity dispersion profiles perpendicular to the Galactic plane was devised. This method has the advantage of abolishing conventional approximations and using only a few assumptions. Our aims are to carefully scrutinize this method and to examine influences by uncertainties of astrometric observations. We discuss how the determinations of the LDMD vary with observational precisions on parallax, proper motion, and line-of-sight velocity measurements. To examine the influences by the observational imprecision, we created mock observation data for stars that are dynamical tracers based on an analytical galaxy model and applied parametrized observational errors to the mock data. We evaluated the accuracy of determining the LDMD by applying the method to the mock data. In addition, we estimated a sample size and observational precision required to {{determine the}} LDMD with accuracy. We find that the method is capable of determining the LDMD with accuracy if the sample size and observational precisions are satisfactory. The random <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>parallaxes</b> and proper motions can cause systematic overestimation of the LDMD. We estimate the required precisions <b>of</b> the <b>parallax</b> measurements to be approximately 0. 1 - 0. 3 milliarcseconds at 1 kpc away from the Sun; the proper motion precisions {{do not seem to be}} as important as the parallaxes. From these results, we expect that using the Hipparcos catalog would overestimate the LDMD because <b>of</b> the imprecise <b>parallax</b> measurements if this method is applied; however, we emphasize the capability of the method. We expect that Gaia will provide data precise enough to determine the LDMD. Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures, A&A accepte...|$|R
40|$|Hipparcos parallaxes {{will play}} a major role in the astrophysical {{applications}} of the Hipparcos results and in this respect their accuracy is more important than their precision, at least for all the investigations of statistical character. In this Chapter, the systematic <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> the Hipparcos astrometric parameters, including the parallaxes, are evaluated by examining the possible sources of bias arising in the data reduction process. Then, the external <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parallaxes</b> are further studied on the basis of individual or statistical comparisons to ground-based distances. The validity of the Hipparcos standard errors are investigated as well. The distance of the stars was probably the most eagerly awaited fruit of the Hipparcos mission and was indeed the key element that led eventually to the decision to design a dedicated space experiment.

40|$|We present K-band {{commissioning}} {{observations of}} the Mira star prototype o Cet obtained at the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with the VINCI instrument and two siderostats. The observations were carried out between 2001 October and December, in 2002 January and December, and in 2003 January. Rosseland angular radii are derived from the measured visibilities by fitting theoretical visibility functions obtained from center-to-limb intensity variations (CLVs) of Mira star models (Bessel et al. 1996, Hofmann et al. 1998, Tej et al. 2003). Using the derived Rosseland angular radii and the SEDs reconstructed from available photometric and spectrophotometric data, we find effective temperatures ranging from T_eff= 3192 +/- 200 K at phase phi= 0. 13 to 2918 +/- 183 K at phi= 0. 26. Comparison of these Rosseland radii, effective temperatures, and {{the shape of the}} observed visibility functions with model predictions suggests that o Cet is a fundamental mode pulsator. Furthermore, we investigated the variation of visibility function and diameter with phase. The Rosseland angular diameter of o Cet increased from 28. 9 +/- 0. 3 mas (corresponding to a Rosseland radius of 332 +/- 38 R_sun for a distance of D= 107 +/- 12 pc) at phi= 0. 13 to 34. 9 +/- 0. 4 mas (402 +/- 46 R_sun) at phi= 0. 4. The <b>error</b> <b>of</b> the Rosseland linear radius almost entirely results from the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parallax,</b> since the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> the angular diameter is only approximately 1 %.

Although this level of accuracy {{is comparable to the}} standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> the relative <b>parallaxes</b> that are now routinely obtained from the ground for selected, individual objects, the absolute nature of Gaia's astrometry, combined with the sample increase from one hundred to several thousand sub-stellar objects with known distances, ensures the uniqueness of Gaia's legacy in brown-dwarf science for the coming decade(s). We shortly explore the gain in brown-dwarf science that could be achieved by lowering Gaia's faint-end limit from 20 to 21 mag and conclude that two spectral-type sub-classes could be gained in combination with a fourfold increase in the solar-neighbourhood-volume sampled by Gaia and hence in the number of brown dwarfs in the Gaia Catalogue.
