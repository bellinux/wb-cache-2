50|$|Dear Citizens, Each {{election}} is always followed by certain results and various assessments. Above the actual election results {{much more important}} is the public’s confidence in regards to those results. Public’s confidence can be formed only by neutral and objective assessments. <b>From</b> <b>today</b> <b>on</b> many local and international organizations will present their assessments on these elections. Nonetheless, no rating can be full and reliable for the Armenian society, if the Armenian Police doesn't present objectively on how many calls related to the following serious electoral violations were and how many of them were valid: Voting bribes,Double voting,Directed voting,Ballot stuffing,Committee member or proxy’s pressure during the calculation of votesFalsification of results of vote counting Moreover, the Police should also publicize basis and reasons for considering those calls valid or invalid. Also is essential to find out urgently and to inform the society on why the Gala TV website activities were disrupted during the Election Day. It’s also crucial to find out all the cases of journalist and observers activity obstacles and to take to responsibility the guilty ones. Not credible activity of the RA Police may obscure positive achievements of all the phases of these Elections. Hence, the RA Policy is responsible to carry the heavy burden of the public’s reliability on the Elections results and of the Elections’ general assessment. I urge all the institutions and individuals to cooperate with the Police, in order to swiftly and efficiently reveal all the electoral crimes and for the society to receive the actual picture and amount of the electoral violations. On the abovementioned essential and other electoral violations the Human Rights Defender received 253 calls. Before presenting our comprehensive assessment on the elections we will continue receiving calls on the electoral violations during the election different stages, follow relevant publications of mass media, assessments of the observer organizations and post-electoral developments.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} report State Officer Seeley predicts that three days <b>from</b> <b>today,</b> <b>on</b> January 4 th, Spanish {{influenza}} will increase in Portland. Five days later, on January 8 th, {{he says that the}} number of deaths from influenza will increase. • Dr. Seeley: “About three days after any unusual mixing or massing of people affording close contact there is {{an increase in the number}} of cases reported. Thus we find each Tuesday high following Saturday’s exposures. After each of the peace celebrations and also following Halloween there was a sharp increase on the three days’ schedule. December 28 there was another high point, following Christmas exposures. We may expect another high point about January 3 or 4, following New Year’s celebration. About five days after an increase in the number of cases there is an increase in the number of deaths. Of all public gatherings or amusements, dances contribute the greatest number of cases. The disease is mostly spread by those who have it so mild they scarcely know they are sick, and by those who have recently recovered. How long a case remains a carrier is not definitely determined, but the general opinion at the meeting of the American Health Association put it at about three weeks. All country and city health officers are notified to quarantine cases sufficiently long so as to be reasonably sure they are no longer carriers. Quarantine measures properly applied are effective, but there is rather a large list of offenders who disregard quarantine, some innocently, some purposely. ”• According to Dr. Seeley, of the 27, 478 cases in Oregon, 11, 560 have been in Portland. • There have been 841 deaths in Portland and 920 in the rest of the state. • The number of new cases for the past 24 hours (160) is a lot higher than the number of new cases that have been reported during the past two weeks. • A warrant for the arrest of Portland physician Dr. Fisch was filed after Dr. Parrish complained that Dr. Fisch failed to report a case of influenza at the beginning of the epidemic. This is the first warrant for arrest that has been filed since the City Council passed legislation that required doctors to report all fresh cases of influenza immediately to the Health Bureau. Dr. Fisch defends himself, claiming that he was not yet aware of the case’s diagnosis. Dr. Parrish is not satisfied with this explanation. Newspaper article 1...|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{neighboring}} disciplines, anthropology rarely studies how actual {{future events}} affect current behavior. Such studies could {{lay the groundwork}} for studies of ethno-forecasting. Psychologists argue that people forecast poorly, but some empirical work in cultural anthropology suggests that at least with weather, rural people might make reasonably accurate forecasts. Using data from a small-scale, pre-industrial rural society in the Bolivian Amazon, this study estimates the effects of future weather on the current collection of planted crops and wildlife. If actual future events affect current behavior, then this would suggest that people must forecast accurately. Longitudinal data covering 11 consecutive months (10 / 2002 – 8 / 2003, inclusive) from 311 women and 326 men ≥age 14 in 13 villages of a contemporary society of forager-farmers in Bolivia’s Amazon (Tsimane’) are used. Individual fixed-effect panel linear regressions are used to estimate the effect of future weather (mean hourly temperature and total daily rain) over the next 1 – 7 days <b>from</b> <b>today</b> <b>on</b> the probability of collecting wildlife (game, fish, and feral plants excluding firewood) and planted farm crops (annuals and perennials) today. Daily weather records come from a town next to the Tsimane’ territory and data on foraging and farming come from scans (behavioral spot observations) and surveys of study participants done during scans. Short-term future weather (≤ 3 days) affected the probability of collecting planted crops and wildlife today, although the effect was greater on the amount of planted crops harvested today than on the amount of wildlife collected today. Future weather beyond 3 days bore no significant association with the amount of planted crops harvested today nor with the amount of wildlife collected today. After controlling for future and past weather, today’s weather (mean hourly temperature, but not rain) affected the probability of collecting wildlife today, but today’s weather (temperature or rain) did not affect the probability of collecting planted crops today. The study supports prior work by anthropologists suggesting that rural people forecast accurately. If future weather affects the probability of harvesting planted crops and collecting wildlife today, then this suggests that Tsimane’ must forecast accurately. We discuss possible reasons for the finding. The study also supports growing evidence from rural areas of low-income nations that rural people tend to protect their food production and food consumption well against small idiosyncratic shocks or, in our case, against ordinary daily weather that is not extreme. However, the greater responsiveness of daily foraging output compared with daily farming output to today’s weather suggests that foraging might not protect food consumption as well as farming against adverse climate perturbation...|$|E
40|$|The climate {{impact of}} the iron and steel {{industry}} can be mitigated through increased energy efficiency, emission efficiency, material efficiency, and product use efficiency resulting in reduced product demand. For achieving ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation targets in this sector all measures could become necessary. The current paper focuses on one of those four key measures: emission efficiency via innovative primary steelmaking technologies. After analysing their techno-economical potential until 2100 in part A of this publication, the current research broadens the evaluation scope for the crucial year 2050, based on a Multicriteria-Analysis (MCA). 12 criteria from five different categories ("technology", "society and politics", "economy", "safety and vulnerability" and "ecology") are used to assess the same four future steelmaking technologies in a systematic and holistic way in Germany, as one possible location. The technologies in focus are the blast furnace route (BF-BOF), blast furnace with carbon capture and storage (BF-CCS), hydrogen direct reduction (H-DR), and iron ore electrolysis (EW). These four technologies have been selected, as explained in part A of this paper, because they are the most commonly discussed technological options under discussion by policymakers and the {{iron and steel industry}}. The results of the current work should provide decision makers in industry and government with a long-term guidance on technological choices. In 2050 the MCA shows significantly higher preference scores for the two innovative routes H-DR and EW compared to the blast furnace based routes. The main reasons being higher scores in the economical and environmental criteria. BF-CCS shows its greatest weakness in the social acceptance and the safety and vulnerability criteria. BF-BOF has the lowest economy and ecology score of all assessed routes, which is due to the projected high cost for carbon dioxide emission and increasing prices for fossil fuels. A first indicative trend assessment from today towards 2050 shows that H-DR is the preferred MCA option <b>from</b> <b>today</b> <b>on.</b> Three exemplary weighting distributions (representing the perspectives of the steel industry, environmental organisations and the government), used to simulate different stakeholder angle of view, don't have a strong influence on the overall evaluation of the steelmaking routes. The results remain very similar, with the highest scores for the innovative routes (H-DR and EW). This leads to the conclusion that EW and in particular H-DR can be identified as the preferred future steelmaking technology across different perspectives. Specific innovation efforts and dedicated programs are necessary to minimize the time until marketability and to share the development burden. The similarity of the MCA results from different perspectives indicates a great opportunity to reach a political consensus and to work together towards a common future goal. Regarding the pressing time horizon a concentrated engagement for one (or few) technological choices would be highly recommended...|$|E

40|$|By {{applying}} {{fractal geometry}} to Italy’s coastline, with its differing geology and geomorphology, {{we were able}} to calculate the fractal dimension both of the whole coast and of some coastal sectors as well as highlight the geomorphic processes strictly related to its evolution. We analysed six different coastal sectors, subdivided along regional tectonic lines, which delimit zones of different tectonic styles, and {{on the basis of the}} physiography of the Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Ionian margins (north-western and north-eastern Italy, Puglia and Calabria) and lastly on the basis of the physiographic singularity of the two larger islands (Sardinia and Sicily). For the different coastlines examined our results showed that Italy’s more or less straight present-day coastline has an average fractal dimension slightly above unity. Thus, we may suppose that, overall, the coastline has experienced concurrent overlay of secondary marine modelling processes, mostly resulting from erosive wave action and active morphoselection processes in different climatic conditions <b>from</b> <b>today’s,</b> <b>on</b> primary tectonic processes, responsible for the present structure of coastal landscapes. In general, tectogenesis was more intense in the Pliocene-Pleistocene epoch, whereas morphogenesis occurred in the late Quaternary. The different fractal degree of the various sectors would indicate that coastal evolution at certain moments was controlled by postglacial eustatic fluctuations, at others by more or less intense effects related to Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic events and to Pleistocene-Holocene volcanic activity; in recent and historical times, such phenomena appear to have been overlain by coastal dynamics...|$|R

Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around {{the same time as the}} Gaskiers glaciation.|$|R
