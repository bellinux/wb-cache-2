5|$|To {{counter the}} power of Saavedra, Moreno sought to modify the {{military}} balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, {{in the short run}} this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who <b>got</b> <b>promoted</b> precisely because of such rules.|$|E

25|$|In {{previous}} years, {{when a team}} got relegated, {{the team}} that <b>got</b> <b>promoted</b> could only negotiate with the company that had the television rights {{of the team that}} got relegated.

500|$|By this point, {{the only}} {{military}} support for Moreno was Domingo French, head of [...] "The Star" [...] regiment. Castelli and Belgrano supported him, but were {{far away from}} the capital on their respective military campaigns. The activists of the May Revolution supported him as well, as did other members of the Junta and other patriots like Vieytes and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña. Saavedra kept the strong support of the Regiment of Patricians, and added that of the merchants and even some supporters of the former regime who deemed the moderated Saavedra a lesser evil. Moreno sought to modify the military balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up until that point, the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, in the short run this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who <b>got</b> <b>promoted</b> precisely because of such rules. He also thought that support from the lower classes was instrumental {{to the success of the}} Revolution, and wrote letters to Chiclana instructing him to generate such support at Upper Peru. Such popular involvement would take time to consolidate: the Guerra Gaucha, the War of the Republiquetas, and the rise of José Gervasio Artigas took place later, not as of 1810.|$|E
500|$|In July 1974, {{the first}} {{newsprint}} edition was published and signaled an {{evolution in the}} history of the Gay Blade. A fifth anniversary edition of the paper was not published in October 1974 because of a lack of revenue and interest, marking the only time the paper failed to publish an edition in its history. The new focus on being a newspaper allowed the publication's circulation to grow in 1974 and 1975 from five hundred copies distributed at less than a dozen sites to over 4,000 copies available at thirty-five locations throughout the city. The June 1975 edition of the Blade dropped the word 'Gay' from the title of the publication after it was discovered that a newspaper in New York City held the rights to the name Gay Blade. [...] The new name of the publication was now The Blade. It continued to be published on newsprint paper and had no additional format changes until near the end of the decade. Incorporating as a non-profit corporation under the title of [...] "Blade Communications, Inc." [...] in November 1975, the paper continued its growth. Don Michaels, an important voice on the pages of the publication, was named the editor of the paper in January 1978. Michaels began strict enforcement of a policy that prohibited pen names from being used in bylines. By November 1978, the Blade was regularly featuring color printing on its pages and beginning in 1979, the Blade changed into a bi-weekly publication. Starting in October 1980, the name of the publication changed to The Washington Blade and the corporation re-incorporated as a for-profit, employee-owned business. In July 1981, the Blade ran a front-page story entitled [...] "Rare, Fatal Pneumonia Hits Gay Men," [...] making the paper one of the first gay newspapers in the country to write about the disease that has come to be known as AIDS. In November 1981, Don Michaels <b>got</b> <b>promoted</b> to the position of publisher, a position he would hold for over two decades.|$|E

He struggled with his sexuality until towards the end of his marriage in 1988: [...] "I learned the lesson about being yourself before that, and being open about my sexuality was the last piece in the jigsaw. I wasn't open about my sexuality until I was a commander."
