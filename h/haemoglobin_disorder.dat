40|$|OBJECTIVES: To audit {{services}} for prenatal diagnosis for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Comparison {{of the annual}} number of cases recorded in a United Kingdom register of prenatal diagnoses for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders,</b> with the annual number of pregnancies at risk of these disorders, by ethnic group and regional health authority. The number of pregnancies at risk was estimated using data on ethnic group from the 1991 census and data from the United Kingdom thalassaemia register, which records the number of babies born with thalassaemia. SETTING: The three national prenatal diagnosis centres for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders.</b> SUBJECTS: 2068 cases of prenatal diagnosis for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> in the United Kingdom from 1974 to 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Utilisation of prenatal diagnosis by risk, ethnic group, and regional health authority. Proportion of referrals in the first trimester and before the birth of any affected child. RESULTS: National utilisation of prenatal diagnosis for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> was around 20 %. During the past 10 years it has remained steady at about 50 % for thalassaemias and risen from 7 % to 13 % for sickle cell disorders. Utilisation for sickle cell disorders varies regionally from 2 % to 20 %. Utilisation for thalassaemias varies by ethnic group. It is almost 90 % for Cypriots and ranges regionally for British Pakistanis from 0 % to over 60 %. About 60 % of first prenatal diagnoses are done for couples without an affected child. Less than 50 % of first referrals are in the first trimester. CONCLUSIONS: National utilisation of prenatal diagnosis for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> is far lower than expected, and there are wide regional variations. A high proportion of referrals {{are still in the}} second trimester and after the birth of an affected child. The findings point to serious shortcomings in present antenatal screening practice and in local screening policies and to inadequate counselling resources, especially for British Pakistanis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSummary:In {{order to}} obtain an {{approximate}} assessment {{of the public health}} burden that will be posed by the inherited disorders of haemoglobin in southern Vietnam, several thousand individuals were screened for these conditions. A smaller sample was screened for glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency. The important haemoglobin disorders identified were β thalassaemia, haemoglobin E and a variety of different forms of α thalassaemia. There were sufficient G 6 PD-deficient individuals to materially affect malaria control programme design. The most remarkable finding was wide variation in the gene frequencies of these conditions among the ethnic groups sampled. The approximate number of babies expected to be born with clinically-significant haemoglobin disorders in Vietnam was estimated from the gene-frequency data.

40|$|Doctors and {{patients}} make decisions together {{every day in}} an attempt to improve health outcomes in patients. We aimed to investigate such decisions, outcomes and the processes undertaken in decision making in patients living with a clinically significant <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorder</b> as well as other haematological illnesses. Initially a quantitative health needs assessment was undertaken in NSW, Australia examining the health and management of patients with haemoglobin disorders utilising patient reported outcomes. This assessment noted significant practice variation. A qualitative, interview based study of haematologists is then reported examining how treatments were selected or implemented. This study examined the integration of published evidence into such processes. Evidence based medicine is then examined from the perspective of illness definition in haematological malignancy and the increasing approach to targeted therapies resulting in highly individualised treatment approaches. Medical decision making (MDM) as a social process is then discussed with reference to individual clinician differences in risk epistemology, unit culture and self-referential behaviours. It is proposed that if MDM is examined from such a perspective practice variation is not only inevitable but in some cases preferable.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{widespread}} belief that genetic disorders are of little importance in low income countries, an opinion that is perhaps understandable given the often daunting prevalence of infectious diseases and nutritional problems faced by these populations. The failure to recognize genetic disorders as significant contributors to the overall disease profile of low income countries is, however, a serious error. For example, an estimated 7. 6 million children are born per year with a severe congenital or genetic disorder (Alwan and Modell 2003), and one in seven of the world’s population are carriers of a <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorder</b> (WHO 2002).

There is also convincing preliminary evidence that some sub-populations are genetically predisposed to contract serious infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and leprosy (Pitchappan 2002). Further, because of the requirement to treat β-thalassaemia major individuals with regular blood transfusions, in 2003 Thalassaemia International Federation estimated that 30 – 80 % of all cases worldwide were infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, a testament to the lack of adequate blood screening facilities in low income countries.

Our objectives were {{to evaluate the}} left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic functions in Saudi patients with SCD originally from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Design and settingProspective hospital based echocardiography study on adolescent and adult patients with SCD. MethodsForty-five patients with SCD were recruited for echocardiographic study while 45 patients, matched for age and sex, served as controls. Left and right ventricular dimensions and LV wall thicknesses, LV mass index (LVMI) and LV contractility variables were obtained. Left atrial dimension and volume and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) were also estimated. We also evaluated parameters of LV diastolic function, including early and late mitral flow velocities (E and A wave respectively), E/A ratio, deceleration time (MVDT), A wave duration (MVA D), LV isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and tissue Doppler velocities, such as lateral annular e‘ wave, a‘ wave, e‘/a‘ ratio and E/e‘ ratio. ResultsThere were increases in the LV dimensions, LV volumes, stroke volume, and LVMI of the SCD patients. The preload was increased (LV diastolic volume) and afterload was decreased (low diastolic blood pressure). The LVEF was equivalent, though there was evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction in 24 %, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in 40 % of the SCD patients.

40|$|AbstractSickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorder</b> that {{alters the}} {{deformability}} of erythrocytes through abnormal polymerization of haemoglobin. Children with SCA {{have an increased}} risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria. To guide the antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccinations in children with SCA in Gabon, we characterized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae from children with and without SCA. We performed a cross-sectional study and compared nasal and pharyngeal S. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus and H. influenzae isolates from SCA children (n = 73) with comparators matched for age, residence and sex (n = 143) in a matched-comparison analysis. The resistance pattern and capsular type were identified for each isolate. The total carriage rate for S. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus and H. influenzae was 13. 8 %, 46. 7 % and 12. 5 %, respectively, and did not differ between groups (p > 0. 05). The mean number of days under antibiotic treatment in the past year was higher in children with SCA than in controls (penicillin: 70. 1 vs 0. 1 days, p 0. 00002). The total non-susceptibility rate was 30 % for oral and parenteral (meningitis) penicillin in S. pneumoniae, resistance rates were 1. 6 % for oxacillin in Staph. aureus and 14. 8 % for ampicillin in H. influenzae. Susceptibility to antibiotic agents and distribution of capsular types did not differ significantly between both groups. In conclusion, carriage and resistance rates are similar in children with and without SCA.

Little is known about the acceptability of such screening. AIM: To explore parents' experiences of, and attitudes towards, new universal genetic screening for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders.</b> DESIGN OF STUDY: Narrative interview study. SETTING: Primary and community care settings across England. METHOD: Narrative interviews were undertaken with a maximum variation sample of 39 people who had experienced gene-carrier identification through antenatal and newborn screening for sickle cell, thalassaemia, and other haemoglobin variants within the previous 2 years. RESULTS: Most parents were unaware screening had occurred or had given it little consideration and so were surprised or shocked by results. However, they were glad to learn of their carrier status, reproductive genetic risk, or their newborn's carrier status. Participants emphasised that antenatal screening should happen as early as possible. Many would rather have known their carrier status before pregnancy or before entering a relationship. Although most were satisfied with the information they received, significant misunderstandings remained. There were culturally diverse attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis and termination. These procedures were acceptable to some parents with strong religious beliefs, including Christians and Muslims. CONCLUSION: Parents support screening for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> but need to be better informed and better prepared for results and what they mean. Sensitivity to patient diversity in attitudes and choices is also required. Universal screening for genetic reproductive risk will increasingly involve generalists, particularly in primary care, presenting opportunities for screening before or earlier in pregnancy, which is likely to be welcomed by patients...|$|R
40|$|Beta-Thalassaemia-Major is {{a life-long}} genetic <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorder</b> where {{patients}} require intensive treatment regimens to stay alive, including frequent blood transfusions and daily chelation therapy. Adherence to chelation therapy {{is vitally important}} to prevent organ damage and potential death. Little {{research has been conducted}} into the psychosocial correlates of chelation adherence representing a significant gap in the literature. Information concerning psychosocial factors is important when considering potential interventions to improve adherence and improve health outcomes. The present study aimed to address this gap in the literature by investigating correlates of chelation adherence on a daily (episodic) basis as well as on a generic (global) basis. Using constructs suggested by the Health Action Process Approach, the study hypotheses were that situational self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancies would differentiate episodes of adherence and non-adherence. A secondary hypothesis was that lower levels of depression and perceptions of severe illness consequences would be associated with higher global adherence. Thirty-seven participants with Beta-Thalassaemia Major were recruited for the study, 31 of whom completed the episodic part of the study and all who completed the global parts of the study. A structured interview was used to obtain accounts of adherent and non-adherent episodes including behavioural situational variables as well as psychological situational variables (e. g. self-efficacy, mood and outcome expectancies). Validated questionnaires were used to assess depression, anxiety and illness perceptions and their relationship with adherence. Bivariate analyses revealed that a number of behavioural situational variables were associated with adherence episodes as well as ratings of self-efficacy and outcome expectancies. Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that positive outcome expectancies and higher self-efficacy together Significantly predicted adherent episodes, however, only self-efficacy independently predicted adherent episodes. No associations between global adherence and depression, anxiety and illness perceptions were found. The findings are discussed in relation to general adherence literature as well as to chelation adherence specifically. Theoretical and practice implications are explored.

40|$|Background Sickle cell {{disease is}} a genetic <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorder,</b> which can cause severe pain, {{significant}} end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Sickle cell disease {{is one of the}} most common severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. These complications can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance) and increased mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and updated in 2014. Objectives We wanted to determine whether trials involving people with sickle cell disease that compare regular long-term blood transfusion regimens with standard care, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) any other drug treatment show differences in the following: mortality associated with chronic chest complications; severity of established chronic chest complications; development and progression of chronic chest complications; serious adverse events. Search Methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. Date of the last search: 25 April 2016. We also searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 26 January 2016), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 26 January 2016. Selection Criteria We included randomised controlled trials of people of any age with one of four common sickle cell disease genotypes, i. e. Hb SS, Sß 0, SC, or Sß+ that compared regular red blood cell transfusion regimens (either simple or exchange transfusions) to hydroxycarbamide, any other drug treatment, or to standard care that were aimed at reducing the development or progression of chronic chest complications (chronic sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension). Data Collection and Analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main Results No studies matching the selection criteria were found. Authors' Conclusions There is a need for randomised controlled trials looking at the role of long-term transfusion therapy in pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Due to the chronic nature of the conditions, such trials should aim to use a combination of objective and subjective measures to assess participants repeatedly before and after the intervention. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Zinc is {{important}} for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Preventive zinc supplementation {{has been shown to}} reduce the incidence of acute diarrhoea by 20 %. Few trials have evaluated its effect against malaria. Because trial results for both outcomes are inconsistent, research priorities must shift from studies to measure efficacy to identifying factors that determine the magnitude of the effect of zinc supplementation. We hypothesized that protection by zinc supplementation depends on concomitant supplementation with other nutrients. Objectives: Specific objectives were: a) to assess the effect of supplementation with zinc, alone or in combination with other nutrients, on the rates of malaria (primary objective); b) to assess intervention effects on rates of diarrhoea and other common diseases; c) to identify factors that determine the magnitude of the effect of the interventions. Our studies also provided an opportunity to assess effects of α+-thalassaemia on malaria and malaria-associated anaemia. This <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorder</b> is highly prevalent in eastern Africa and that has recently been reported to protect against severe malaria. Methods: In a highly malaria-endemic area in rural Tanzania, we randomised children (n= 612) aged 6 - 60 months with height-for-age z-score ≤ – 1. 5 SD to daily supplementation with: a) zinc, vitamins and other mineral elements (‘multi-nutrients’); b) zinc; c) multi-nutrients without zinc; or d) placebo. Those with Plasmodium infection at baseline were treated. Field staff and participants were blinded to treatment. Sick children were detected and evaluated in a research clinic. The primary outcome, an episode of malaria, was pre-defined as current Plasmodium antigenaemia in children with guardian-reported fever and any of the following: a) confirmed fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37. 5 °C), or b) unconfirmed fever with inflammation (whole blood C-reactive protein concentrations ≥ 8 mg/L), separated by at least 14 days from a previous malaria episode. Results: The primary analysis included 1, 572 episodes of malaria and 526 child-years of observation. The prevalence of zinc deficiency (plasma zinc concentration 10, 000 parasites/ μL increasing by 27 % (1 %- 61 %) and 53 % (11 %– 111 %) in the youngest children (6 - 17 months) and in children with iron deficiency, whilst there was no evident effect in older children or those without iron deficiency (p-values for interaction: 0. 02 and 0. 007). Despite the increase in malaria rates, the children who had the lowest haemoglobin concentrations during malaria (those aged 6 - 17 months) were better able to maintain their haemoglobin concentrations when having received multi-nutrients. Direct epidemiological evidence is lacking, however, if and under what conditions the higher haemoglobin concentrations during malaria (and expected reduced risk of death due to severe malarial anemia) outweigh the possible increase in other potentially lethal disease manifestations. Multi-nutrient supplementation seemed to increase the rate of diarrhoea by 19 % (– 6 % to 50 %). Subgroup analysis indicated that this effect depended on Giardia intestinalis infection at baseline (p-values for interaction: 0. 03) : in those without multi-nutrients, infection was associated with a reduction in rates of diarrhoea by 68 % (34 %- 85 %), whilst there was no evidence for such protection in those receiving multi-nutrients. Similar effect modification was found for fever without localizing signs. Of 612 children in the trial, 50 % had normal genotype, whilst 41 % and 9 % were heterozygote and homozygous, respectively, for α+-thalassaemia. We found no evidence of group differences in malaria rates between genotypes. Subgroup analysis suggested, however, that the effect of α+-thalassemia depended on age. Thus in children below 18 months, malaria rates were increased by 30 % (2 %– 65 %) in heterozygotes, whereas they were decreased by 20 % (5 %– 32 %) in older children (p-value for interaction: 0. 001). Similar patterns were found for homozygotes, even though estimates were less precise due the smaller numbers of children in this age class. Based on data from a pilot survey and a study in Kenya, we found that children with α+- thalassaemia (particularly homozygotes) were protected against the decline in haemoglobin concentration associated with mild to asymptomatic infections, particularly when these infections were accompanied by inflammation. Interpretation and conclusions for policies: We found no evidence that addition of vitamins and other mineral elements increased the health benefits of zinc supplements. The beneficial effects of zinc described in this thesis strengthen the case for scaling up zinc interventions in deficient populations of African children, without concerns that it will cause adverse effects due to malaria. Multi-nutrient supplementation may be unsafe in malaria-endemic areas, particularly in young children with iron deficiency. Thus the recommendation by the World Health Organization that iron supplements should be administered routinely to iron-deficient infants in settings with adequate access to anti-malarial treatment is insufficiently supported by evidence and should be reconsidered. Our results underscore that supplementation or home fortification, even when targeting deficient subgroups in settings with access to adequate primary care, should not be recommended in malariaendemic areas until their safety has been demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{elevated}} {{burden of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) amongst South Asian populations is a complex and multi-factorial phenomenon. South Asians evolved from environments where malaria was endemic, and while <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> frequent this group, a link to CVD has not been described. Using a case–control feasibility study, haemoglobin abnormalities identified by mass spectrometry were compared between South Asian patients with CVD (n = 72) and non-CVD controls (n = 84). Carotid-artery intima media thickness (CIMT) {{was used as a}} marker of vascular damage. Ultracentrifugation was used to separate lipoprotein subfractions, which were analysed for iron. Haemoglobin anomalies were more frequent for CVD patients than controls (34. 7...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review studies {{addressing}} {{the question of}} whether there are social inequalities in either the offer or the uptake of prenatal testing in the UK. METHOD: Systematic review of studies assessing the offer or uptake of prenatal screening or diagnosis according to social class or ethnic origin. Electronic databases were searched using a strategy developed for a review of inequalities in access to maternity care supplemented with terms specific to prenatal testing. Further papers were identified from reference lists, citation searches and key organizations. RESULTS: From over 600 identified papers, 41 were potentially relevant. Twenty met the inclusion criteria. The studies included covered screening and/or diagnosis for Down's syndrome, neural tube defects, <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> and HIV. Many studies were limited by small numbers or poor reporting of data and analysis. Six studies reported data on prenatal testing according to women's social class or educational level. None found any significant social inequalities in testing. Some studies suggested that women of South Asian origin might be up to 70 % less likely to receive prenatal testing for <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> and Down's syndrome than White women. A small number of studies suggested that South Asian women might be less likely to be offered testing. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides some evidence of ethnic inequalities in access to prenatal testing. Further research is required to improve our understanding of why testing may not be offered, the reasons for failure to take up testing when offered, and to identify whether there are other social inequalities in access to prenatal testing...|$|R
40|$|New {{techniques}} of DNA analysis {{have been applied}} to the prenatal diagnosis of the common <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders.</b> Currently, {{it is possible to}} provide a comprehensive programme for the prevention of these conditions, although this entails the use of several different techniques including globin chain synthesis analysis, direct identification of mutations with restriction enzymes, linkage analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and the use of oligonucleotide probes. At present, the best combination of these approaches has to be worked out for individual populations, but as the {{techniques of}} chorion villus sampling and DNA analysis improve {{it should be possible to}} rationalise these prenatal diagnosis programmes and thus make them simpler and less expensive...|$|R
40|$|The {{unstable}} haemoglobins are molecular {{variants of}} adult haemoglobin which, {{because of the}} nature of the substitution, tend to undergo spontaneous oxidation within the red cell and precipitate to form insoluble inclusions or Heinz bodies. Their presence results in the so-called congenital Heinz-body haemolytic anaemia. Already there have been three extensive reviews (Carrell & Lehmann, 1969; White & Dacie, 1971; White, 1974). Thus, the molecular abnormalities will be mentioned only briefly and readers are referred to the earlier accounts. This paper will concentrate on the clinical presenta-tion and diagnosis of the unstable <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders.</b> Also, the more recent studies on the chemical processes involved in Heinz-body formation and how they cause Hairing* to the red cell will be discussed. 1.

40|$|Inherited haemoglobinopathies are {{the most}} common {{monogenic}} diseases, with millions of carriers and patients worldwide. At present, we know several hundred disease-causing mutations on the globin gene clusters, in addition to numerous clinically important trans-acting disease modifiers encoded elsewhere and a multitude of polymorphisms with relevance for advanced diagnostic approaches. Moreover, new disease-linked variations are discovered every year that are not included in traditional and often functionally limited locus-specific databases. This paper presents IthaGenes, a new interactive database of haemoglobin variations, which stores information about genes and variations affecting <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders.</b> In addition, IthaGenes organises phenotype, relevant publications and external links, while embedding the NCBI Sequence Viewer for graphical representation of each variation. Finally, IthaGenes is integrated with the companion tool IthaMaps for the display of corresponding epidemiological data on distribution maps. IthaGenes i...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, around 600 {{people are}} {{affected}} by thalassaemia major and 6 - 10 000 by sickle-cell <b>disorders.</b> These <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> are recessively inherited and have greater prevalence in certain ethnic groups. This paper explores affected families' and practitioners' views {{about the role of}} primary health care in haemoglobinopathy services. The paper is based on a qualitative study of 62 parents of affected children and 51 professionals, from seven districts in northern England. Services were lacking in coherence but showed some examples of good practice. Primary care staff were felt, by other professionals, to be poorly informed about haemoglobinopathies. Their greater potential in facilitating screening for carrier status and diagnosis was emphasized by practitioners and policy makers. The potential for primary care involvement in screening and caring for haemoglobinopathies remains to be realized...|$|R
40|$|Haemoglobinopathies {{constitute}} the commonest recessive monogenic disorders worldwide, {{and the treatment}} of affected individuals presents a substantial global disease burden. Carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis represent valuable procedures that identify couples at risk for having affected children, {{so that they can}} be offered options to have healthy offspring. Molecular diagnosis facilitates prenatal diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of carriers and patients (especially ‘atypical’ cases who often have complex genotype interactions). However, the <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> are unique among all genetic diseases in that identification of carriers is preferable by haematological (biochemical) tests rather than DNA analysis. These Best Practice guidelines offer an overview of recommended strategies and methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies, and emphasize the importance of appropriately applying and interpreting haematological tests in supporting the optimum application and evaluation of globin gene DNA analysis...|$|R
40|$|Despite major {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of the molecular pathology, pathophysiology, and control and management of the inherited <b>disorders</b> of <b>haemoglobin,</b> thousands of infants and children with these diseases are dying through lack of appropriate medical care. This problem will undoubtedly increase over the next 20 years because, {{as the result of a}} reduction in childhood mortality due to infection and malnutrition, more babies with <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders</b> will survive to present for treatment. Although WHO and various voluntary agencies have tried to disseminate information about these diseases, they are rarely mentioned as being sufficiently important to be included in setting health care priorities for the future. It takes considerable time to establish expertise in developing programmes for the control and management of these conditions, and the lessons learned in developed countries will need to be transmitted to those countries in which they occur at a high frequency...|$|R
40|$|When making {{decisions}} about prenatal diagnosis, couples not only draw on {{their understanding of the}} condition but also broader aspects of their cultural identity. This article looks at how faith and religion mediate attitudes towards screening, prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy for sickle cell and thalassaemia disorders. The article specifically reports on a qualitative study, which used focus groups from a variety of faith communities (Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and Christian), at risk of <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>disorders,</b> living in England. Our findings suggest that the decision about whether or not to have diagnostic testing generally related to attitudes towards the termination of pregnancy. The consequences of the condition were as important as religious beliefs to most people. More generally, faith beliefs emerged as negotiable and contingent: realized within a broader moral framework. Religion was felt not to be prescriptive and reproductive decisions were seen as personal. When {{making decisions}}, people utilize faith within a broader context of individual, family and social relationships...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{document}} current United Kingdom {{practice for}} antenatal screening for inherited disorders of globin chain synthesis and to compare such practice with guidelines {{published by the}} British Committee for Standards in Haematology and the Standing Committee on Sickle Cell, Thalassaemia and other Haemoglobinopathies (SMAC). METHODS: The members of the UK Forum on <b>Haemoglobin</b> <b>Disorders</b> were surveyed about their current practice for antenatal haemoglobinopathy screening. The UK Forum is a national group of haematologists, paediatricians, laboratory scientists, and counsellors {{working in the field}} of diagnosis and management of <b>disorders</b> of <b>haemoglobin</b> synthesis; such <b>disorders</b> including the alpha and beta thalassaemias, sickle cell disease, and other haemoglobinopathies. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires from 38 hospitals (or cooperating groups of hospitals) were analysed. The great majority of hospitals were applying appropriate laboratory methods, but problems were commonly encountered in ensuring that appropriate testing of antenatal patients and, when necessary, of their partners, was carried out early in pregnancy. When screening was selective there was quite often a failure to identify all women in whom testing was indicated, and cut off points used as an indication for further testing were sometimes inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Many practical problems are still encountered in following guidelines for the antenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies. A need for improved administrative procedures and increased funding was identified. In addition {{there is a need for}} agreed guidelines giving more specific advice on technical aspects of laboratory practice...|$|R
