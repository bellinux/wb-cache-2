40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} current treatment options and of the outcomes of penile carcinoma has been performed with special focus on controversial issues. A MedLine search using specified search terms was done during the period 1988 - January 2013. Demolitive surgery is considered as the "gold standard" treatment of invasive penile carcinoma staged higher than T 2, but negative psychological outcomes were reported. On the other hand, conservative surgical techniques {{have been associated with}} higher recurrence rates. Potency-sparing technique (glansectomy and apexes sparing) preserves penile length: the reconstruction of glans anatomy and function is a key point to restore anatomy and sexual functions. Techniques such as glanduloplasty have given satisfactory anatomic, functional and sexual outcomes. Lymphadenectomy is indicated in any case of inguinal palpable nodes that persist after a course of antibiotic therapy, but also in all the cases staged T 2 or higher, or in any high-grade penile cancer. It is still being debated the extension of inguinal lymphadenectomy for penile cancer: unilateral, bilateral, and extended to pelvic lymph nodes. Due to the specific radioresistance of penile cancer, radiation therapy is currently indicated in case of unresectable penile cancers with palliative intent. Chemotherapy is indicated as adjuvant therapy for stage T 1 -T 3, N 1 - 3, M 0, or as neo-adjuvant therapy in the event of extensive pelvic and <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> or as palliative treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic cancers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions {{are prone}} to {{reactivation}} and recurrence in response to various local or systemic triggering factors. OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of five bedridden geriatric patients who presented with herpetic recurrences on the buttocks, gluteal cleft, and perianal region during hospitalization. METHODS: Data were gathered regarding age, gender, reason for hospitalization, localization of lesions, clinical presentation, previous clinical diagnosis and topical treatments, immune status and immunosuppressant drug intake, as well as prior history of labial or genital herpes. A skin biopsy was taken for histologic examination and immunohistochemical viral identification. Viral culture and viral serology were performed and data regarding antiviral therapy were recorded. RESULTS: The five patients (three women, two men) were aged > 80 years and hospitalized for either severe drug-induced renal insufficiency (one case), severe pneumonia (two cases), or stroke causing restricted mobility (two cases). Numerous well demarcated, painful ulcerations developed in the perianal region of these patients, and one patient also presented with some vesicular lesions. The lesions had been confused with mycotic and/or bacterial infections for 10 - 14 days. No <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> were present {{and there was no}} fever. None of the patients had a previous history of recurrent labial or genital HSV infections or HIV infection. Histology was suggestive of HSV infection in two of five patients. Immunohistochemistry identified HSV type I (three patients) and HSV type II (two patients) infections. Viral culture with immunofluorescence viral identification revealed HSV type I in one of the four patients in whom a swab for viral culture was taken. Serology revealed past HSV infection. All lesions cured gradually after 10 - 14 days of intravenous acyclovir (aciclovir) treatment. CONCLUSION: Herpetic lesions of the perineal region represent a rare complication in bedridden geriatric patients {{in the absence of a}} previous history of HSV infections at the same site. Common traits of patients with this condition were the presence of numerous ulcerated lesions, prolonged time course, and confinement to bed. The latter probably modifies the skin condition, which triggers viral reactivation and favors cutaneous extension of the infection. Complementary diagnostic methods for viral detection and identification are mandatory. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|The {{secondary}} stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) lymphadenitis and lymphangitis, often with tender <b>inguinal</b> and/or femoral <b>lymphadenopathy</b> because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|R
40|$|The {{lymphadenopathy-associated}} virus (LAV) prototype strain of human T-lymphotropic virus type III/LAV was transmitted to juvenile chimpanzees with no prior immunostimulation by (i) intravenous injection of autologous cells infected in vitro, (ii) intravenous injection of cell-free virus, and (iii) transfusion from a previously infected chimpanzee. All five animals that {{received more than}} one 50 % tissue culture infective dose were persistently infected with LAV or chimpanzee-passaged LAV for up to 18 months. During this time they developed no illnesses, but they exhibited various degrees of <b>inguinal</b> and axillary <b>lymphadenopathy</b> and significant reductions in rates of weight gain. Detailed blood chemistry and hematologic evaluations revealed no consistent abnormalities, {{with the exception of}} immunoglobulin G (IgG) hypergammaglobulinemia, which became apparent in one animal 6 months postinfection and continued at more than 1 year postinfection. Transient depressions followed by increases in the numbers of T 4 cells to levels greater than normal were observed in all animals after virus inoculation. However, the number of LAV-infected peripheral blood cells decreased with time after infection. Results of enzyme immunoassays showed that all infected animals seroconverted to IgG anti-LAV within 1 month postinfection and that antibody titers remained high throughout the period of observation. In contrast, only three of the five LAV-infected chimpanzees had detectable IgM antibody responses, and these preceded IgG-specific serum antibodies by 1 to 2 weeks. Virus morphologically and serologically identical to LAV was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all infected animals at all times tested and from bone marrow cells taken from one animal 8 months after infection. One chimpanzee that was exposed to LAV only by sharing a cage with an infected chimpanzee developed lymphadenopathy and an IgM response to LAV, both of which were transient; however, no persistent IgG antibody response to LAV developed, and no virus was recovered from peripheral blood cells during a year of follow-up. Thus, LAV readily infected chimpanzees following intravenous inoculation and persisted for extended periods despite the presence of high titers of antiviral antibodies. However, the virus was not easily transmitted from infected to uninfected chimpanzees during daily cage contact...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMetastatic {{carcinoma}} to the vulva is rare, {{where the}} incidence {{is believed to}} be between 5 % and 8 %. However, malignant tumors have been described in 3 – 11 % of systemic scleroderma (SSc) cases. We report the case of one patient, a 66 -year-old postmenopausal woman, whose medical history was marked with rheumatic vascular disease (systemic scleroderma) since 1993 without muscular, renal, cardiac lesions or HTA (arterial hypertension) and without tobacco history. The woman presented with a new vulvar mass of the right labia in December 2011 that had progressively enlarged in size. CT scan of the abdominopelvic region demonstrated a lobular mass of the right labia with central necrosis, 7 cm on the wide axis, and the rectum and the vaginal wall were normal. No <b>inguinal</b> or iliac <b>lymphadenopathy</b> was noted. An outpatient excisional biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated malignant tumor suggestive of carcinoma. IHC: CK 7 +/CK 20 −, estrogen receptors−, AE 1 AE 3 +, vimentine+, S 100 −, Desmina−, CD 34 −, KI 67 : 20 %. The thoracic scan revealed a large mass of 4 cm× 3 cm in the right lung base with right paratracheal lymphadenopathy 3 cm× 2 cm. A bronchoscopy revealed discrete stenosis of the mediastinal portion of the right bronchial tree. The bronchial biopsy also revealed poorly differentiated lung carcinoma, non-small cell, which was identical with the vulvar tumor. ConclusionThe presence of the single lung lesion with only one lymphadenopathy paratracheal with pathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) profile similar to the vulvar lesion, and a particular IHC profile with CK 7 + and CK 20 − was detected – that is more specific to the primitive pulmonary cancer, and the presence of only one sarcoma marker vementine+, desmine and actine−. Also the presence of KI 67 : 20 %, predicted the proliferative and great metastatic power of the lung tumor was observed. Additionally, lung cancer was the most frequent type and may develop in scleroderma as reported in most studies. This allows to conclude for primitive lung carcinoma revealed with vulvar metastasis after elimination of the possibility of vulvar sarcoma. The patient was treated by chemotherapy (Taxol/Platin) with partial response from the lung after 3 cycles and palliative radiotherapy in the vulva with a good response. This case described primary lung carcinoma associated with scleroderma, revealed by a vulvar metastasis, which {{may be related to the}} aggressiveness of lung cancer when the lung fibrosis follow-up is not performed well to detect early the development of lung tumors in the patient with systemic scleroderma...|$|R
