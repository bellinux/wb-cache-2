5|$|Gallium {{is found}} {{primarily}} in the +3 oxidation state. The +1 oxidation is also <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> compounds. For example, the very stable GaCl2 contains both gallium(I) and gallium(III) and can be formulated as GaIGaIIICl4; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0°C disproportionating into elemental gallium and gallium(III) chloride. Compounds containing gallium-gallium bonds are true gallium(II) compounds; for example, GaS can be formulated Ga24+(S2−)2, and the dioxan complex Ga2Cl4(C4H8O2)2 contains a Ga–Ga bond.|$|E

5|$|A natural bobtail can be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> {{members of}} the breed, {{which is not a}} {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although it can be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin {{may have been due}} to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E

Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> of the graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack}} of weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

5|$|In benign infections <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> {{wild and}} captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head}} and trunk in juveniles, which appear for a few weeks and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E
5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. It {{is written in}} the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a language that is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sets of phrases and prayers which have come down from the pre-migration era.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E
