5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent {{to that of a}} graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E

Between 1 July and 31 December, the {{financial}} ombudsman dealt with 11,524 complaints about Barclays, finding {{in favour of}} customers in 84% of cases.

500|$|The {{extensive}} {{reliance on}} the money-printing press to finance the war {{contributed significantly to the}} high inflation the South experienced {{over the course of the}} war, although fiscal matters and negative war news also played a role. Estimates of the extent of inflation vary by source, method used, estimation technique, and definition of the aggregate price level. According to a classic study by Eugene Lerner in 1956, a standard price index of commodities rose from 100 at the beginning of the war to more than 9200 by the war's de facto end in April 1865. By October 1864, the price index was at 2800, which implies that a very large portion of the rise in prices occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of the war. This drop in the demand for money, the corresponding increase in [...] "velocity of money" [...] (see next paragraph) and the resulting rapid increase in the price level has been attributed to the loss of confidence in Southern military victory or the success of the South's bid for independence.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{majority}} of battalion commands went to older reservists, many of whom had commanded battalions or served in the First AIF. As the war went on, the average age of battalion commanders declined from 42.9 years old in 1940 to 35.6 in 1945. The prevalence of regular officers in senior positions also rose, and in 1945 they held half of all senior appointments. They remained under-represented in unit commands, and, as in 1940, there was still only one infantry battalion commanded by a regular officer. [...] Following the outbreak of war with Japan, many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead Militia formations and fill important staff posts as the Army expanded. The following year, though, the Army reached its greatest extent after which it shrank in size. With a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than required, Blamey faced public and political criticism after he [...] "shelved" [...] several senior officers. The career prospects of junior officer were also affected, particularly in the infantry. Of the 52 officers promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of 1944 only five were infantrymen, while two were engineers, and 45 were from the supporting arms.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{simmering}} tension between Serb-chauvinists and the communists, the Provincial Committee of the KPJ for Bosnia-Herzegovina held a conference at Ivančići in the Romanija region on 7–8 January 1942. This conference was chaired by Tito, {{and one of the}} outcomes was the creation of a [...] "Volunteer Army" [...] of soldiers that would fight alongside the Partisans under shared command, but were not willing to become Partisans themselves. The Supreme Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia. This was intended to drive a wedge between Bosnian Chetnik bands and the Serbian-based Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Seven [...] "volunteer" [...] detachments were raised, all in eastern Bosnia, and some battalions and companies of former Chetniks were placed under the command of existing detachments. In all, the [...] "Volunteer Army" [...] numbered a maximum of 7,000–8,000 fighters who were, according to the historian Marko Attila Hoare, of [...] "dubious political loyalty and military value". The short-lived [...] "Volunteer Army" [...] concept was dispensed with following pro-Chetnik coups in both [...] "volunteer" [...] and Partisan detachments in eastern Bosnia in April and May 1942, and was quietly abolished by Tito in November 1942. After this, until the formation of the Yugoslav Army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of the war, the title of the Partisan army was the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia.|$|E

[...] Unlike other figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: [...] "The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government.

Labor representatives of the board resigned in protest. The mass resignations set off a crisis within the Truman administration. Unwilling to alienate labor by imposing wage controls involuntarily, Truman appointed a National Advisory Board on Mobilization Policy to come up with recommendations to win labor's support for wage and price controls. On April 17, the National Advisory Board suggested re-establishing the WSB with a greatly enlarged membership. The National Advisory Board also recommended giving the WSB the power to intervene in labor disputes. The WSB should have the power, the report said, to make economic and non-economic recommendations in labor disputes as well as submit disputes directly to the president.|$|E

During the economic crisis which occurred during the Korean War, the United Labor Policy Committee oversaw the labor representatives on the Wage Stabilization Board (WSB), which regulated wages in the defense industry in the United States. [...] During the buildup to the 1952 steel strike, the WSB imposed nationwide wage controls on January 26, 1951.
