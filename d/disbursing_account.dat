This thesis resolved that the initial IDA implementation achieved those goals with respect to procurement and to blanket purchase agreements. Additional procedures are required which will include imprest fund and referral transactions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOver {{ninety percent of}} all procurement actions fall into the small purchase category. The high cost of borrowing money has caused many vendors to criticize the government for its untimely bill paying of small purchase invoices. This study was undertaken to determine if untimely payment of small purchase invoices {{is a problem for}} the Department of the Navy and its suppliers which is adversely impacting the ability to do business. The results of this study indicate: Settling billions of dollars in payments has become an important part of federal procurement. Navy bill paying functions are handled as part of the Integrated <b>Disbursing</b> and <b>Accounting</b> (IDA) system concept, when fully implemented IDA will improve the timeliness of small purchase invoice payments. In spite of difficulties they are currently experiencing, contractors are optimistic about doing business with the Navy. The biggest delay in the Navy bill paying cycle occurs in the certification process. The timeliness of paying small purchase invoices may be improved by considering two models proposed for future use. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between energy consumption and economic growth for Pakistan based on annual data {{for the period of}} 1972 - 2012. The demand for energy is increasing rapidly in the globalizing world. Most of the countries are facing shortage of energy and consequently it is severely affecting the economic growth. In Pakistan, there is insufficient investment in the energy sector to the extent that majority of commercial energy infrastructure is still underdeveloped. There are many flaws in the demand side and supply side especially relating to payments. Consequently a huge amount is <b>disbursed</b> on <b>account</b> of circular debit in Pakistan. The empirical results state that the consumption of electricity is significantly stimulating economic growth among other sources of energy. The oil consumption is also affecting economic growth adversely because of its high volume of import. The variable of trade openness has also positive impact on economic growth in the period. The study has important policy implication for Pakistan’s economy that there should be shift from expensive imported fuel (oil) to indigenously available alternative fuel (gas or coal) in order to reduce import burden and consequently current account balance. The government should make short run as well as long run plans of low-priced energy generation domestically {{to meet the needs of}} high energy consumption...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 113 - 121). International {{recognition of}} the health problems being faced by developing countries have resulted in significant increases in external development assistance for health since the late 1980 s. However, it has been established that this aid has not been effective due to poor coordination, harmonization and alignment. As part of the aid development architecture, donors and recipient countries have defined approaches, modalities and methods of working aimed at improving harmonization, alignment and management of aid for results. One such approach is the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) which involves ensuring that "all significant funding for the sector supports a single sector policy and expenditure programme, under government leadership, adopting common approaches across the sector, and progressing towards relying on government procedures to <b>disburse</b> and <b>account</b> for all funds. " (Foster et ai, 2000 a, p. 6). In Zambia, the health SWAp has been in existence since 1993. The adoption of the health SWAp was necessitated {{by a desire to}} optimize the use of domestic and externally mobilised financial and in-kind development assistance through the integration of all vertical programmes into a sectoral framework that would meet common national goals and objectives. This was after it was realised that the health system was inefficient in its provision of health services due to the existence of fragmented, multiple donor-assisted projects which the Ministry of Health could not effectively coordinate and manage. This paper explores the contribution of the health SWAp to the provision of effective health care in Zambia since its inception in 1993. The study considered the SWAp as both an aid instrument and as a process and the evaluation is made by looking at both the individual elements of a SWAp and the SWAp mechanism as a whole. The study assesses the contribution of the SWAp to fostering working relationships, accountability for finances and progress, efficient allocation and use of resources, financial sustainability and promotion of geographical equity of access to health care resources. The study was exploratory and a retrospective approach was used to track and associate changes before the introduction of the health SWAp and after the SWAp implementation period 1993 - 2005. In order to take account of certain contextual factors in the broad health reform continuum, a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques were used. This includes 21 in-depth key informant interviews, a Focus Group Discussion (FGD), non-participant observation at 4 different SWAp coordination meetings and a comprehensive document review. Study participants were senior members of the Health Sector AdviSOry Committee that were drawn from 6 provinces (including the capital city Lusaka). The actual selection of interviewees was done purposively based on the possession of requisite expertise, diversity and availability...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to study the {{performance}} of the RRBs since 1980 to 2009. In order to know the implications of transformation of RRBs in 2004, the study focuses financial results before and after amalgamation. RRBs were established “with a view to developing the rural economy by providing, for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans and small entrepreneurs, and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto”(RRBs Act, 1976). RRBs alone have organized roughly 12 lakh self-help groups, 45 per cent of the total self-help groups in the country. RRBs have also issued over 40 lakh Kisan Credit Cards to the farmers and organized over 5, 000 out of 11, 000 farmers’ clubs under NABARD scheme. Though the growth in credit when seen in isolation gives an impression of the impressive strides made by RRBs in <b>disbursing</b> credit, they <b>account</b> for a very small proportion (around 3 per cent) of the total assets of the Indian banking sector, despite their significant branch network. While C-D ratio for 50 RRBs was more than 60 per cent that for 87 banks was less than 40 per cent in March 2004. The Government of India (Ministry of Finance) issued notifications on September 12, 2005 for amalgamation of 28 RRBs into nine new RRBs sponsored by nine banks in six States. These amalgamations have become effective from September 12, 2005. After amalgamation, RRBs transformation has resulted in a 200 per cent increase in net profits, a 100 per cent increase in business, a gradual {{reduction in the number of}} loss-making banks and addition of 1, 000 outlets. All this has been because of consolidation among RRBs. The Central government initiated the process of amalgamating RRBs in September, 2005. Then there were 196 RRBs. The study reveals that, RRBs seem to have better Non-Performing Assets (NPA) management with net NPA coming down every year after the amalgamation. In 2005 - 06, the net NPA stood at 3. 96 per cent. It declined to 1. 98 per in 2008 - 09. RRBs are extending loans to non-agricultural sector in rural areas also. They are broad-basing their credit pattern. Malaprabha Grameen Bank went ahead to finance vehicles for rural transport system. Financing of vehicles for rural transportation helped villagers, as they sold their produce in urban areas. The reduction in number of RRBs has not resulted in any sudden reduction in staff strength since there was no termination of services of employees after amalgamation. Unlike commercial banks no voluntary retirement schemes were introduced in RRB...|$|R
