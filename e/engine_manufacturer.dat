5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|In 1827 {{a rolling}} mill capable of 100 tons of bar iron per week was {{installed}} at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> In 1833, the iron puddling process was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, {{at the age of}} nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturers</b> made hit-and-miss <b>engines</b> {{during their}} peak use—from {{approximately}} 1910 {{through the early}} 1930s when more modern designs began to replace them. Some of the largest <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturers</b> were Stover, Hercules, International Harvester (McCormick Deering), John Deere and Fairbanks Morse.|$|R
5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer</b> BMW since 1980 on the {{development}} of a turbocharged engine for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, {{en route}} from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, {{suffered}} an uncontained engine failure, resulting {{in a series of}} related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction with the <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained engine failure. Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the airplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.|$|E

25|$|A joint {{investigation}} by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, aircraft manufacturer, <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security was launched. Azerbaijan Airlines believed defective spare parts caused the crash. The {{joint investigation}} commission found that vibration caused the nuts on the engine mounts to loosen and fall off. This caused the engine turbines to shift and became damaged, leading to the crash. Azerbaijan Airlines deputy head Nazim Javadov, however, said {{the use of the}} defective parts for repairs was permitted by the <b>engine</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> Russian company Perm Motors.|$|E
