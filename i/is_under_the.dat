6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> LAW, OR <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of <b>the</b> law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse; for mark, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, seeing those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> other covenant <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but <b>the</b> rest <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law (Gal 3:9).|$|R
