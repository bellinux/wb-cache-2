40|$|Effluents from {{wastewater}} treatment works (WwTWs) contain estrogenic contaminants that can cause feminised responses in fish. In order to assess the identity of estrogenic contaminants taken up by fish exposed to effluents, an analytical method was developed to detect estrogenic substances in fish bile, where many xenobiotics are excreted and concentrated. Estrogenic metabolites in bile were deconjugated using enzymatic hydrolysis and the estrogenic activity was determined using a yeast estrogen receptor transcription screen (YES). Hydrolysed samples were concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to fractionation by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Active HPLC fractions were detected by YES assay and analysed by gas chromatography¿mass spectrometry (GC¿MS) after trimethylsilylation. The method was validated using bile samples from immature female rainbow trout, which {{had been exposed to}} either tap water or an undiluted estrogenic effluent for 10 days. Hydrolysis of bile from effluent-exposed fish was complete within 16 h and most of the estrogenic activity in the bile was released by ß-glucuronidase rather than sulfatase or ß-glucosidase treatment. The estrogenic activity of hydrolysed bile from effluent-exposed fish ranged between 530 and 1440 ng E 2 eq/mL and was 17 ¿ 48 -fold greater than the activity of bile from reference <b>fish</b> exposed to <b>tap</b> water. The estrogenic activity of bile samples decreased with time in storage (at - 70 °C by 7 % per month). The recovery of estrogenic activity from SPE was 96 ± 7 % (mean ± SD), from HPLC fractionation 87 ± 7 % and for the whole method 81 ± 7 % (n = 7). 17 ß-Estradiol, estrone, 17 a-ethinylestradiol, nonylphenol and short-chain nonylphenol polyethoxylates were all identified from GC¿MS analysis of active HPLC fractions of bile from effluent-exposed trout, whereas only 17 ß-estradiol was detected in bile from <b>fish</b> exposed to <b>tap</b> water. There were also several other minor estrogenic components, at present unidentified, in bile of effluent-exposed fish. The work shows that fractionation of fish bile is a useful approach to identifying mixtures of estrogenic contaminants taken up by fish from WwTW effluents and has the potential for application in the detection of other endocrine disrupting chemicals in fish tissues...|$|R

Burrowing species include the mudskippers, the red band-fish Cepola rubescens (burrows up to 1 m deep, often with a side branch), the yellowhead jawfish Opistognathus aurifrons (chambers up to 22cm deep, lined with coral fragments to solidify it), the convict blenny Pholidichthys leucotaenia [...] whose burrow is a maze of tunnels and chambers thought to be as much as 6 m long, and the Nicaragua cichlid, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, who drills a tunnel by spinning inside of it. [...] In the case of the mudskippers, the burrows are shaped like a J and can be as much as 2 m deep. Two species, the giant mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri and the walking goby Scartelaos histophorus, build a special chamber at the bottom of their burrows into which they carry mouthfuls of air. Once released the air accumulates {{at the top of the}} chamber and forms a reserve from which the fish can breathe – like all amphibious fishes, mudskippers are good air breathers. If researchers experimentally extract air from the special chambers, the fish diligently replenish it. The significance of this behaviour stems from the facts that at high tide, when water covers the mudflats, the fish stay in their burrow to avoid predators, and water inside the confined burrow is often poorly oxygenated. At such times these air-breathing <b>fishes</b> can <b>tap</b> into the air reserve of their special chambers.|$|R

50|$|Like {{most of the}} {{indigenous}} ethnic groups of the Senegambian region—the Baga, the Serer, the Balanta, the Konyagi, etc.-- the Jola ethnic group did not develop a political scale that expanded beyond village level compared to ethnic groups that migrated to the region like the Sonikes and the Mandingos. But {{this does not mean}} they did not develop a sophisticated political system. The egalitarian nature of their societies (rare in most societies), structured around the limited village environment gave them the possibilities to develop a political system based on collective consciousness, which they worked through their initiation rites.

40|$|Effluents from {{wastewater}} treatment works (WwTWs) contain estrogenic substances that induce feminizing effects in fish, including vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis and gonadal intersex. Fish vary in their responsiveness to estrogenic effluents, but the physiological basis for these differences are not known. In this study, uptake of estrogen from two WwTW effluents (measured in hydrolyzed bile) and estrogenic response (VTG induction) were compared in a salmonid (rainbow trout, Onchorhynchus mykiss) and a cyprinid fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus). Immature rainbow trout were more responsive than maturing roach to the estrogenic effluents. The more potent of the two estrogenic effluents (containing between 24. 3 and 104. 1 ng estradiol- 17 equivalents/L [E 2 eq/L]) resulted in a 700 -fold and 240 -fold induction of plasma VTG in male and female trout, respectively, but only a 4 -fold induction in roach (and in males only). The less potent effluent (varying between 4. 1 and 6. 8 ng E 2 eq/L) induced VTG in the trout only, with a 4 -fold and 18 -fold induction in males and females, respectively. In <b>fish</b> exposed to <b>tap</b> water, the estrogenicity of the hydrolyzed bile was 0. 03 0. 01 ng E 2 eq/L (for both sexes in trout), 0. 18 0. 04 ng E 2 eq/L in male roach, and 0. 88 0. 15 ng E 2 eq/L in female roach. The higher bile content of estrogen in control roach reflected their more advanced sexual status (and thus higher endogenous estrogen) compared with the immature female trout. In trout maintained in effluents, the bile content of estrogen was 100 -fold and 30 -fold higher than controls at WwTW A and B, respectively. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for estrogenic activity in bile were between 16 344 and 46 134 in trout and between 3543 and 60 192 in roach (no gender differences were apparent). There were strong correlations between VTG induction and the estrogenic activity of bile extracts for both trout and roach. The results confirm that estrogenic contaminants bioconcentrate to a high degree in fish bile and that the level (and nature) of this accumulation may account for responsiveness to the endocrine disruptive effects of estrogenic effluents. Immature fish were the more appropriate life stage for quantifying estrogen exposure and uptake in bile, as they contain little circulating endogenous oestrogen compared with sexual maturing fish. The nature of the estrogenic contaminants is detailed in an accompanying paper...|$|R
40|$|Fish can {{be exposed}} to a complex mixture of {{chemical}} contaminants arising from the exposure to wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) effluents. Some of these contaminants are estrogenic and {{have been associated with}} feminisation of male fish and the presence of populations containing intersex individuals. However the detection of trace levels (ng/L) of estrogenic chemicals surface waters can be difficult and does not give information on the exposure of aquatic organisms to these contaminants. In this study we assessed whether the analysis of estrogenic substances that bioconcentrate in fish bile can be used to detect the exposure of fish to feminising contaminants in receiving waters and effluents, and thus facilitate their monitoring of these substances in aquatic environments. Estrogenic metabolites in bile were deconjugated using enzymatic hydrolysis and partially purified by solid phase extraction. Steroidal and xenoestrogens were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl ethers and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) using multiple reaction monitoring. The method was validated using spiked bile samples from immature female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as well as bile from sexually mature roach (Rutilus rutilus) that had been exposed to either tap water or an undiluted estrogenic effluent for 10 days or captured from a river site downstream of a WwTWs effluent discharge. The mean recovery of target analytes from spiked bile was between 86 and 99 % and the limit of detection was between 0. 1 and 0. 7 ng/mL bile for bisphenol A (BPA), 17 ß-estradiol (E 2), estrone (E 1) and 17 a-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), and 11, 60 and 327 ng/mL bile for branched nonyl chain isomeric mixtures of 4 -nonylphenolethoxylate (NP 1 EO), 4 -nonylphenol (NP) and 4 -nonylphenoldiethoxylate (NP 2 EO), respectively. All target analytes were detected in bile from roach exposed directly to a WwTWs effluent, with concentrations between 6 ¿ 13 µg/mL bile for NP, 18 ¿ 21 µg/mL for NP 1 EO, 75 ¿ 135 µg/mL for NP 2 EO, 0. 7 ¿ 2. 5 µg/mL for BPA, E 2 and E 1 and 17 ¿ 29 ng/mL for EE 2.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to explore the role of variety seeking {{behaviour}} towards fish consumption frequency. Second, it aimed to investigate how personality related factors; variety seeking tendency (related to food and personality) and perceived behavioural control affect the nature of variety seeking behaviour. Third, to investigate how product and motivational related factors; attitudes, health involvement and perceived risk affect the nature of variety seeking behaviour and fish consumption in the Sri Lankan context. In line with Hoyer and Ridgway (1984) proposed framework, a conceptual framework was developed with the constructs of variety seeking behaviour, variety seeking tendency (related to food and personality), perceived behavioural control, attitudes, health involvement, perceived risk and fish consumption frequency to achieve the objectives. A questionnaire survey was conducted using a convenience sample of 250 consumers in Galle in Sri Lanka. The items used to measure the constructs were either taken or adopted from the previous research studies. Confirmatory factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling in AMOS 16. 0 were employed to analysis the data. This study found that variety seeking behaviour plays a vital role in fish consumption frequency among consumers. The findings confirmed the theory that variety seeking tendency as a general personality trait positively influences the variety seeking tendency related to food (VST Food) while specific VST Food showing a significant effect on fish consumption frequency. Health involvement was found to be positively significant with fish consumption frequency as well as with the VST Food while having an insignificant relationship with the variety seeking behaviour. Conveneinec/ availability, price/ value and knowledge were not significant indicators of perceived control. Nevertheless, PBC and perceived risk act as a barrier for variety seeking behaviour. However, the effect of perceive risk on the fish consumption frequency was negligible. Surprisingly, attitudes did not have a significant impact on either fish consumption frquency or variety seeking behaviour. The main reason for this is probably skewness of the data set. Practical implications drawn from this research are that <b>fish</b> marketers should <b>tap</b> the consumers’s intrinsic desire for variation through providing different fish species in to the market place. Further, it is suggested that providing information on the most commonly eaten fish species by the government authorities through mass media will reduce the perceived risk and PBC associated with variation of fish and stimulate the health involvement towards variation of fish consumption. This research has contributed to fill the gap in variety seeking behaviour literature in which specifically incorporating effect of both personal related and product/ motivational related factors. This research was based on a convenience sample of consumers which did not represent the whole population, thus the results could not generalize to Sri Lanka. Future research should uncover additional individual and product related factors and their interactions which may relevant to explain variety seeking behaviour.

40|$|Fisheries and {{aquaculture}} {{are very}} important sectors in the Norwegian industry. Fish and its by-products are considered wholesome foodstuff and are popular especially due to their nutritional value. Therefore, consumer safety {{is a very important}} topic and methods for prolonging shelf-life {{play a vital role in}} the fishing and aquaculture industries. These methods are mostly based on cooling and freezing techniques, as bacteriological and enzymatic activities are generally reduced at low temperatures. However, freezing and cooling are quite energy- and time-consuming. Freezers are often designed as batch-operations, especially on board fishing vessels, and thus act as bottlenecks in the production chain. Therefore, an optimal operation should be imposed in order to minimize the time the good is spending in the freezer. If a good is in the freezer longer than necessary, this operation can be denoted as overfreezing. Hence, the aim is to monitor and operate the freezing processes in an optimal way with respect to quality, but also with regards to energy use and environmental impact. This can be achieved by a better understanding of the factors that influence the quality of fish and seafood during freezing and thawing. Furthermore, comprehension of the actual processes that happen during phase change are of importance; this includes the derivation of a mathematical model to describe the temperature evolution in the food. This model can also be used to monitor and operate the reversed freezing process, namely thawing. Considering not only freezing but also the thawing process as an additional and often inevitable production step makes sense due to the fact that it is difficult to process frozen fish. The thesis is structured into five parts, which are divided thematically: Introduction and Preliminaries, Mathematical Modeling, Freezing and Thawing Applications, Experiments and Closing Remarks. Part I gives an introduction to the context of this thesis. The importance of the fishing industry for the Norwegian economy is highlighted. Furthermore, preliminaries about topics related to freezing and thawing of foodstuff in general, and fish and fish products in particular, are presented. These preliminaries include methods of industrial applicable and more theoretical nature. Furthermore, a Chapter is dedicated to the concise introduction to quality aspects of fish, in a general way, but also with respect to freezing and thawing applications and processes. In Part II, a mathematical model for freezing and thawing processes is derived from the diffusion equation, a partial differential equation (PDE). This model represents a form of a linear heat equation, which is extended by a nonlinear term. This nonlinear term enters the equation due to the fact that phase change occurs in both freezing and thawing, and therefore the parameters of the diffusion equation are modeled state- and thus temperaturedependent. Similarities between this model and other types of PDEs, in particular the Burgers’ equation and its potential form, are investigated. However, due to the statedependency of the coefficients, known transformations can not be applied in order to use already established stability results for this kind of heat equation. Therefore, the stability of the model is investigated. This is conducted in order to show that the model can be used for describing freezing and thawing applications, which are in fact known to be stable due to the laws of thermodynamics. Part III presents applications of the model derived in Part II for freezing and thawing processes, respectively. Firstly, an observer based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed for both, freezing in plate freezers and thawing in contact thawing devices. The aim is to estimate the temperatures in the inner domain of a block of foodstuff. Therefore, some assumptions have to be imposed, e. g. that temperatures on the surface of the block are measurable. Secondly, the models are subject to Optimal Control Problems (OCP), where an optimal input function, meaning the temperature at the boundaries, is calculated in order to either optimally freeze or thaw blocks of foodstuff. This is done for open loop Optimal Control (OOC), which holds for perfect knowledge of the process with no measurement and estimation disturbances. Furthermore, closed loop Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied, where measurement / estimation errors as well as discrepancies between the model and the real process are taken into account. In Part IV experimental results for a freezing process in a horizontal plate freezer and a thawing process in a rebuilt horizontal plate freezer adapted for thawing purposes (plate thawer) are shown. Both of these experiments have been conducted at Matís Food Research in Reykjavík, Iceland. The freezing experiments were conducted with a rectangular tray made of aluminum, which was placed in between the plate freezer walls and filled with tap water. Temperature loggers were placed in several positions inside the tray to log the temperature during phase change from liquid to solid. Ammonia was used as the refrigerant in the plate freezer. For the thawing process the same tray was used. Blocks of frozen headed and gutted (H/G) cod were placed inside the tray and between the walls of the re-built plate freezer. The medium to thaw the <b>fish</b> blocks was <b>tap</b> water. Temperature loggers were attached to the fish blocks, namely in the center, half-way to the center and just below the surface. In Part V the thesis is closed with the conclusion and an outlook on future work...|$|R
