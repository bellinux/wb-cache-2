40|$|The {{differences}} {{of understanding and}} {{point of view on}} gender and gender equity have become the basis of this study. It exploits the distinction any further particularly in academic community. The focus of study is specifically on the orientation of research theme and the direction of <b>gender</b> <b>study</b> analysis which are written by in undergraduate thesis. The study is successful in identification that <b>gender</b> <b>study</b> themes have been dominated by the contextual study or ap-licative-empiric instead of the study of textual or normative-legalistic. <b>Gender</b> <b>study</b> is viewed as the study about women not about <b>gender</b> or the <b>study</b> utili-zing <b>gender</b> as tool of analysis. The analysis of women study mostly use des-criptive one, it only describes position and role of women, whereas the <b>gender</b> <b>study</b> uses critical analysis, that ilustrate the arguments behind the role and position of women. It could be identified wether the position and role of women  are equal or not wiht men. Copyright (c) 2015 by KARSA. All right reserved DOI:  10. 19105 /karsa. v 23 i 1. 612   </p...|$|R

40|$|The authors report {{research}} {{that attempts to}} shift the traditional focus of visual cues to auditory cues {{as a basis for}} stereotyping. Moreover, their approach examines whether gender-signaling vocal cues lead not only to between-category but also to within-category <b>gender</b> stereotyping. <b>Study</b> 1 showed that both men and women vary within category in how feminine their voices sound and that Perceptions of vocal femininity are highly consensual. Furthermore, the measured acoustic characteristics that differed between gender were also related to perceptions of within-gender femininity. Subsequent studies demonstrated that variability in vocal femininity affects gender stereotyping when the targets are all of the same <b>gender</b> (<b>Study</b> 2) and when the targets are of different <b>genders</b> (<b>Study</b> 3). In the latter case, evidence of both category-based and feature-based stereotyping was found.
