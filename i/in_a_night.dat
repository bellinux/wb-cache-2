5|$|On 23 June, {{the ship}} was present when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an {{abortive}} attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he {{did not wish to}} engage his numerically superior opponents <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, civil strife {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E
5|$|On 15June1839 the {{entrepreneur}} and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built {{under the direction}} of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1October1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.|$|E

5|$|The Device Forts {{along the}} Solent also fell into Parliamentary hands {{early in the}} conflict. Calshot was garrisoned throughout, as was Brownsea, which was {{strengthened}} and equipped with additional guns. West Cowes was rapidly taken after firing on a nearby Parliamentary ship, and the Royalist commander at Yarmouth quickly negotiated a surrender of his tiny garrison. The heavily outnumbered garrison at Southsea Castle was stormed by Parliamentary forces <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> attack. Like Camber, St Andrew's and Netley were rapidly occupied and then decommissioned by Parliament. In the north-east, Hull also sided with Parliament, and its castle and blockhouses were used {{as part of the}} town's defences during multiple sieges.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{called for}} the Marine regiments to advance on the Somme-Py <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> attack. After successfully making this advance, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion's companies laid down a heavy suppressing fire as both the 4th Marine Brigade and French 4th Army stormed Mont Blanc. The companies stayed in place until relieved on 10 October 1918. The battalion was then reconstituted and moved to Camp Marchand. During its time at Marchand, command of the battalion passed to Major Matthew H. Kingman.|$|E
5|$|There {{were seven}} Commando {{missions}} {{carried out on}} the Channel Islands. Operation Ambassador {{was the first and}} largest of these, employing 140 men from No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> raid on 14 July 1940. Later raids were much smaller; only 12 men of No. 62 Commando took part in Operation Dryad in September 1942, when they captured seven prisoners and located several German codebooks. Operation Branford, a reconnaissance mission that aimed to identify a suitable gun position to support future raids on Alderney, followed only days later. In October of that year 12 men from No.s 12 and 62 Commandos took part in Operation Basalt, a raid on Sark that saw four Germans killed and one taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Emperor Michael II {{learned of}} the Arab landing, and before the Andalusians had secured their control over the entire island, he reacted and sent {{successive}} expeditions to recover the island. Losses suffered during the revolt of Thomas the Slav hampered Byzantium's ability to respond, however, and if the landing occurred in 827/828, the diversion of ships and men to counter the gradual conquest of Sicily by the Tunisian Aghlabids also interfered. The first expedition, under Photeinos, strategos of the Anatolic Theme, and Damian, Count of the Stable, was defeated in open battle, where Damian was killed. The next expedition was sent a year later and comprised 70 ships under the strategos of the Cibyrrhaeots Krateros. It was initially victorious, but the overconfident Byzantines were then routed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> attack. Krateros managed to flee to Kos, but there he was captured by the Arabs and crucified. Makrypoulias suggests that these campaigns must have taken place before the Andalusians completed their construction of Chandax, where they transferred the capital from the inland site of Gortyn.|$|E
5|$|In early March, Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō was tasked to {{take the}} {{reinforced}} 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok. While scouting for Russian ships in the area, the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect. Upon their return to Japan a few days later, the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur. Yakumo was then transferred to Rear Admiral Dewa Shigetō's 3rd Division. On 23 June, the ship was Dewa's flagship when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he {{did not wish to}} engage his numerically superior opponents <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Royal Sovereign and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> action, the only method by which {{he thought he could}} achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.|$|E

5|$|In spring 829, Michael II sent a new fleet to Sicily under Theodotus, who {{was well}} acquainted with the island, having already served as its strategos in the past. After landing, Theodotus marched his army to Enna, where the Arabs were {{continuing}} the siege. He was defeated in the subsequent battle, but {{was able to find}} refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became so confident of victory that they struck their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims tried to break out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed them in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|Morosini {{initiated}} a more energetic {{approach in the}} Venetian pursuit of the war: {{in the spring of}} 1655, he raided the Ottoman supply depot at Aigina and razed the port town of Volos <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> attack on 23 March. In early June, Morosini sailed to the Dardanelles, awaiting the sally of the Ottoman fleet, which was however delayed because of political upheaval in the Ottoman government. Leaving Lazzaro Mocenigo with half the fleet (36 ships) to keep watch at the Straits, Morosini returned to the Cyclades. A week after his departure however, on 21 June, the Ottoman fleet, numbering 143 ships under Mustapha Pasha, appeared. The resulting battle was a clear Venetian victory. The Ottoman fleet avoided action {{for the remainder of the}} year, before it withdrew to winter quarters, leaving Morosini free to undertake an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the strategically important island fortress of Malvasia (Monemvasia) off the south-eastern coast of the Peloponnese. In September, Morosini was posted as the new provveditore of Crete, with Lorenzo Marcello as the new Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
5|$|Texas' win, by a {{score of}} 25–22, was the lowest scoring game Texas would {{experience}} all season, {{both in terms of}} points scored by Texas and total points. Fourth-ranked OSU became the highest-ranked non-conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at an opponent's home stadium. The previous high came in 1983 when third-ranked Texas pulled off a 20–7 upset versus fifth-ranked Auburn. Texas became the first non-conference opponent to beat the Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990, putting an end to a 36-game home victory string over non-conference opponents. The Longhorns also were the first team to beat the Buckeyes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> game at The Horseshoe and it was UT's 10thstraight victory in a night-game road contest.

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} bootleggers being ambushed, and then {{moves to a}} Temperance rally two days earlier during which Nucky Thompson attracts the {{attention}} of a pregnant woman who later seeks assistance from Thompson for her husband, Schroeder. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> club the day after the rally, we are introduced to other characters, including Thompson's brother, Eli, the town sheriff, and Jimmy Darmody, a political assistant. Thompson makes a deal to supply alcohol to four gangsters, including Arnold Rothstein who agrees to use his own men to transport the alcohol. Meanwhile, Schroeder drunkenly tangles with Thompson, and then beats his (Schroeder's) wife into a miscarriage. The next day, Darmody plots with Al Capone to rob Rothstein's incoming whiskey shipment. The episode returns to the ambush and we see Capone and Darmody shoot all the bootleggers and run off with the whiskey, with Darmody later giving Thompson a share of the heist.|$|E
5|$|In the West, the Muslims {{continued}} to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced {{to rely on the}} aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve any progress. Following the fall of Enna in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little. Syracuse was attacked again in 869, and in 870, Malta fell to the Aghlabids. Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of Apulia, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915. In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, largely because the Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting marble for the construction of the Nea Ekklesia, Basil's new church. In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the droungarios Nasar, scored a significant victory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> battle over the Aghlabids who were raiding the Ionian Islands. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before defeating another Muslim fleet off Punta Stilo. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples. These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and Calabria and forming the thema of Longobardia, which would later evolve into the Catepanate of Italy. A heavy defeat off Milazzo in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.|$|E
5|$|The Squadron {{did not see}} {{action in}} the Battle of France {{on the first day}} of the campaign—10 May—but many other Battle squadrons did and {{suffered}} high losses attacking German ground forces. The squadron's airfield came under air attack from the first day. Junkers Ju 88s destroyed hangars and two aircraft <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> attack. On 11 May it was bombed again and three of four aircraft were lost attacking German Army columns in daylight hours. On 14 May McLachlan flew his first sortie over the Sedan bridgeheads. The German thrust at Sedan threatened to outflank the Maginot Line in the south and the Allied Armies in the north by breaking through in the centre and advancing to the English Channel. On 12 May Sedan fell. Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps and Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XXXXI Panzer Corps were breaking through onto the west bank on the 14 May. Desperate to halt the attacks, General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces in consultation with Air Vice-Marshal Playfair, commander of the AASF, ordered all available units to attack. No. 88 Squadron was committed to the air offensive. Six aircraft attacked armoured column positions, four attacked bridges. One aircraft was lost. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire and German fighter opposition MacLachlan attacked and got away at low altitude. Allied units suffered 50 percent losses that day. On 15 May the airfield was hit twice again and the squadron moved back near Troyes.|$|E
