The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the estimates of BEF, BEF-based biomass <b>densities,</b> <b>and</b> their uncertainties using different estimators (mean-of-ratios, ratio-of-means, and regression estimators) in double sampling. Our results demonstrated that increased uncertainty is associated with regression-based biomass <b>densities,</b> <b>and</b> that the computation of BEF using merchantable timber volume should utilize regression estimators, not the usual ratio estimators, which preferably, should be avoided altogether, as they are found to be subjective and more susceptible to errors and personal judgment...|$|R
