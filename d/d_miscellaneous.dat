40|$|International audienceSubsurface sediments of the Sonora Margin (Guaymas Basin), {{located in}} {{proximity}} of active cold seep sites were explored. The taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities were investigated from 1 to 10 meters below the seafloor. Microbial community structure and abundance {{and distribution of}} dominant populations were assessed using complementary molecular approaches (Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, 16 S rRNA libraries and quantitative PCR with an extensive primers set) and correlated to comprehensive geochemical data. Moreover the metabolic potentials and functional traits of the microbial community were also identified using the GeoChip functional gene microarray and metabolic rates. The active microbial community structure in the Sonora Margin sediments was related to deep subsurface ecosystems (Marine Benthic Groups B and <b>D,</b> <b>Miscellaneous</b> Crenarchaeotal Group, Chloroflexi and Candidate divisions) and remained relatively similar throughout the sediment section, despite defined biogeochemical gradients. However, relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal dominant lineages were significantly correlated with organic carbon quantity and origin. Consistently, metabolic pathways for the degradation and assimilation of this organic carbon as well as genetic potentials for the transformation of detrital organic matters, hydrocarbons and recalcitrant substrates were detected, suggesting that chemoorganotrophic microorganisms may dominate the microbial community of the Sonora Margin subsurface sediments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{introduction}} of low power general purpose processors (like the Intel ® Atom ™ processor) expands {{the capability of}} handheld and mobile internet devices (MIDs) to include compelling visual computing applications. One rapidly emerging visual computing usage model is known as mobile augmented reality (MAR). In the MAR usage model, the user is able to point the handheld camera to an object (like a wine bottle) or a set of objects (like an outdoor scene of buildings or monuments) and the device automatically recognizes and displays information regarding the object(s). Achieving this on the handheld requires significant compute processing resulting in a response time {{in the order of}} several seconds. In this paper, we analyze a MAR workload and identify the primary hotspot functions that incur a large fraction of the overall response time. We also present a detailed architectural characterization of the hotspot functions in terms of CPI, MPI, etc. We then implement and analyze the benefits of several software optimizations: (a) vectorization, (b) multi-threading, (c) cache conflict avoidance and (<b>d)</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> code optimizations that reduce the number of computations. We show that a 3 X performance improvement in execution time can be achieved by implementing these optimizations. Overall, we believe our analysis provides a detailed understanding of the processing for a new domain of visual computing workloads (i. e. MAR) running on low power handheld compute platforms. 1...|$|E
40|$|Intra-capsular femoral neck {{fractures}} {{are seen}} commonly in elderly people following a low energy trauma. Femoral neck fracture has a devastating {{effect on the}} blood supply of the femoral head, which is directly proportional to the severity of trauma and displacement of the fracture. Various authors have described {{a wide array of}} options for treatment of neglected/nonunion (NU) femoral neck fracture. There is lack of consensus in general, regarding the best option. This Instructional course article is an analysis of available treatment options used for neglected femoral neck fracture in the literature and attempt to suggest treatment guides for neglected femoral neck fracture. We conducted the "Pubmed" search with the keywords "NU femoral neck fracture and/or neglected femoral neck fracture, muscle-pedicle bone graft in femoral neck fracture, fibular graft in femoral neck fracture and valgus osteotomy in femoral neck fracture. " A total of 203 print articles were obtained as the search result. Thirty three articles were included in the analysis and were categorized into four subgroups based on treatment options. (a) treated by muscle-pedicle bone grafting (MPBG), (b) closed/open reduction internal fixation and fibular grafting (c) open reduction and internal fixation with valgus osteotomy, (<b>d)</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> procedures. The data was pooled from all groups for mean neglect, the type of study (prospective or retrospective), classification used, procedure performed, mean followup available, outcome, complications, and reoperation if any. The outcome of neglected femoral neck fracture depends on the duration of neglect, as the changes occurring in the fracture area and fracture fragments decides the need and type of biological stimulus required for fracture union. In stage I and stage II (Sandhu′s staging) neglected femoral neck fracture osteosynthesis with open reduction and bone grafting with MPBG or Valgus Osteotomy achieves fracture union in almost 90 % cases. However, in stage III with or without AVN, the results of osteosynthesis are poor and the choice of treatment is replacement arthroplasty (hemi or total) ...|$|E
