5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and <b>geography)</b> <b>is</b> the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota's varied <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> {{inhabited}} by {{many species of}} birds. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted particularly well to the area after being introduced from China, and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. The wild turkey is another large bird found {{in many areas of}} the state. The numerous lakes and wetlands of eastern South Dakota support migratory populations of Canada geese, snow geese, mallards, pelicans, and wood ducks. The prairie serves as home to songbirds such as meadowlarks (both the eastern and western varieties), goldfinches, and bluebirds, and the open landscape of the plains also suits many carnivorous birds, such as hawks, falcons, and owls.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> also radically altered. A new {{mountain}} range {{was formed in}} Britain by a day-long ice age, and the Earth now has twelve and a half continents. Many locations have been displaced and reduced to islands, including Oxford University and the London borough of Deptford, which {{is now in the}} Indonesian Ocean {{as a part of the}} Cockney Islands. The solar system is equally altered: Jupiter has been deep fried by Harry Ramsden's, Mercury and Neptune have been knocked together, and there was an initiative to destroy the Moon, which according to the show was deleterious to the nightlight industry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} how `other&# 039; <b>geographies</b> <b>are</b> represented, generally {{from outside}} `main-stream&# 039; cartography. It begins by discussing maps and {{the representation of}} place and space. Then it looks at how maps are used to understand spatial relationships. This is followed by an overview about how maps are used or incorporated into popular media. The use of spatialisation and how other <b>geographies</b> <b>are</b> represented using the map metaphor is covered next. Finally, issues about extending cartographic representations to accord {{with the use of}} interactive and integrated media to visualise other <b>geographies</b> <b>is</b> addressed...|$|R

25|$|The {{geography}} of Mars, {{also known as}} areography, entails the delineation and characterization of regions on Mars. Martian <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> mainly focused on what is called physical geography on Earth; that is the distribution of physical features across Mars and their cartographic representations.|$|E
5000|$|To date, Art Jewelry Forum has {{produced}} one exhibition titled <b>Geography,</b> which <b>was</b> shown in 2011 at SOFA Chicago {{and at the}} Society of North American Goldsmiths conference in Seattle in 2011. <b>Geography</b> <b>was</b> a thematic exhibition focusing on the scientific view of physical geography, the relational cultural geography, {{and the effects of}} natural surroundings on artists. <b>Geography</b> <b>was</b> curated by Susan Cummins and Mike Holmes and features over seventy pieces of jewelry from a wide array of international artists: ...|$|R

25|$|Wisconsin's <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> diverse, {{with the}} Northern Highland and Western Upland {{along with a}} part of the Central Plain occupying {{the western part of the}} state and {{lowlands}} stretching to the shore of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin is second to Michigan in the length of its Great Lakes coastline.|$|E
25|$|The state's <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three regions created {{by the rise of}} the Sierra Madre Occidental {{mountains}} and the separation of the Baja California Peninsula, with all three running roughly north-south. The mountains dominate eastern Sonora, while the center is dominated by plains and rolling hills, which then extend west to the coast on the Gulf of California.|$|E

25|$|Sonora's natural <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three parts: the Sierra Madre Occidental in {{the east of the}} state; plains and rolling hills in the center; and the coast on the Gulf of California. It is {{primarily}} arid or semiarid deserts and grasslands, with only the highest elevations having sufficient rainfall to support other types of vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Fairfield's <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> {{typical of}} the American Midwest: around the city is rolling {{farmland}} specializing in corn, soybeans, cattle and hogs. Running west–east through the city is U.S. Route 34; the city of Burlington is {{to the east and}} Ottumwa to the west. North-South is Iowa Highway 1, leading north to Iowa City and south to the Missouri state border.|$|E
25|$|Colchis was {{populated}} by Colchians, an early Kartvelian-speaking tribe, ancestral {{to the contemporary}} Western Georgians, namely Svans and Mingrelians, {{as well as the}} related Lazs. Its <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> mostly assigned to what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Abkhazeti, Svaneti, Racha; modern Russia’s Sochi and Tuapse districts; and present-day Turkey’s Rize, Trabzon and Artvin provinces.|$|E

There {{is a need for}} more timely and regular statistics on a wider-range of themes. Accuracy of data and statistics based on the local <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> of higher importance than the frequency of data production. Genealogists are concerned about the potential loss of historical records.|$|E
25|$|Some of Puducherry's {{districts are}} {{themselves}} amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called pockets in India. The Puducherry district {{is made of}} 11 such pockets, {{some of which are}} very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mahé district is made up of three pockets. This unusual <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> a legacy of the colonial period with Puducherry retaining the borders of former French India.|$|E
25|$|The Fulufjället massif {{is a high}} plateau deeply gouged {{by several}} rivers that flow into the mighty river Dalälven, which, far downstream, creates the unique {{topography}} of Färnebofjärden National Park. The <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> dominated by lichen, bare mountains, and valleys with dense old-growth forest.

25|$|Strabo, whose <b>Geography</b> <b>is</b> {{the main}} {{surviving}} {{source of the}} story, was sceptical about its truth. Modern scholarship tends to consider it relatively credible. During the 2nd century BCE Greek and Indian ships met to trade at Arabian ports such as Aden (called Eudaemon by the Greeks). Another Greek navigator, Hippalus, is sometimes credited with discovering the monsoon wind route to India. He is sometimes conjectured to {{have been part of}} Eudoxus's expeditions.|$|E
25|$|Development <b>{{geography}}</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch}} of geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E
25|$|Maguire's {{presentation}} of Oz's <b>geography</b> <b>is</b> also tinged with politics. A large political prison, Southstairs, exists in caverns below the Emerald City. Gillikin, home of Shiz University, has more industrial development than {{other parts of}} Oz. Munchkinland is Oz's breadbasket {{and at one point}} declares its independence from the rule of the Emerald City. Quadling Country is largely marshland, inhabited by the artistic and sexually free Quadlings. The Vinkus (Maguire's name for Winkie Country) is largely open grassland, populated by semi-nomadic tribes with brown skin.|$|E
