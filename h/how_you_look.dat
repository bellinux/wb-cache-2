The song {{originally}} leaked onto the Internet in February 2010, under the title [...] "No Hassle". In an interview with music website Stereogum, Robyn spoke of the song's origin, saying; [...] "We [...] were talking about Ace of Base {{and we were just}} having fun with that kind of genre music.

500|$|During the Bulls' playoff run in 1993, {{controversy}} arose when Jordan {{was seen}} gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, {{the night before}} {{a game against the}} New York Knicks. In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25million from Jordan on the golf course. In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive?

[...] When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, [...] "No." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, the singer's {{recording}} label, Capitol Records, {{was against}} {{the inclusion of the}} song as a track on Teenage Dream as they deemed [...] "Peacock" [...] too controversial. [...] "They were all a bit worried about the word 'cock' and it gave me déjà vu because they did the exact same thing with 'I Kissed a Girl,'" [...] Perry stated. Unhappy with the idea of making her music more family friendly, she insisted on including the songs the label objected to. [...] "They said, 'We don't see it as a single, we don't want it on the album.' And I was like, 'You guys are idiots'." [...] When asked about [...] "Peacock", Perry stated: [...] "I'm hoping it will be a gay-pride anthem, peacocks represent a lot of individuality..... It's not just like, 'I wanna see your bulge.

[...] Prior to the release of Teenage Dream, the singer debuted [...] "Peacock" [...] in early August 2010 when she performed it at the MTV World Stage in Malaysia.|$|E
