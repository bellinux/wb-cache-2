This biliquid foam technology was patented as polyaphron dispersions (PAD) containing a complex <b>internal</b> <b>phase,</b> which are made as droplets of oil or multiphase liquid in an aqueous (or other hydrogen-bonding liquid) phase.

5000|$|In chemistry, a {{suspension}} is a heterogeneous mixture containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually {{they must be}} larger than one micrometer. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but get suspended throughout {{the bulk of the}} medium. Particles of suspension are visible to the naked eye.It is when particles are left floating around freely in a solvent. The <b>internal</b> <b>phase</b> (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. Unlike colloids, suspensions will eventually settle. An example of {{a suspension}} would be sand in water. The suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed. This distinguishes a suspension from a colloid, in which the suspended particles are smaller and do not settle. Colloids and suspensions are different from solutions, in which the dissolved substance (solute) does not exist as a solid, and solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed. A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol or particulate. In the atmosphere these consist of fine dust and soot particles, sea salt, biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates, nitrates, and cloud droplets. Suspensions are classified {{on the basis of the}} dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. In modern chemical process industries, high-shear mixing technology has been used to create many novel suspensions. Suspensions are unstable from the thermodynamic point of view; however, they can be kinetically stable over a large period of time, which determines their shelf life. This time span needs to be measured to ensure the best product quality to the final consumer."Dispersion stability refers to the ability of a dispersion to resist change in its properties over time."

40|$|Inhibition of {{hemolysis}} by plasma {{has been}} studied in systems containing saponin, digitonin, and sodium lauryl sulfate, using the methods developed {{for the study of}} the kinetics of progressive reactions. The results are that the progressive nature of the hemolytic reaction in saponin systems becomes less when the inhibitor is added, that the addition of inhibitor to digitonin systems has no effect on the final result although the velocity of the progressive reaction is reduced, and that the effect of plasma in lauryl sulfate systems is intermediate between the effects in saponin systems and digitonin systems. A simple explanation is that the lysin is very strongly fixed, to form an <b>internal</b> <b>phase,</b> to the cell surfaces in digitonin systems, less strongly in laurate systems, and still less strongly in saponin systems. To answer the question as to whether, in a system in which some of the lysin forms as <b>internal</b> <b>phase,</b> the addition of an inhibitor results in a redistribution of the lysin between the <b>internal</b> <b>phase</b> and the bulk phase, sodium lauryl sulfate-S 35 and sodium cetyl sulfate-S 35 were prepared, and their distribution between the <b>internal</b> <b>phase</b> and the bulk phase was measured before and after the addition of plasma, the lysins being added to the cells either before or after the addition of the inhibitor. The results show that there is a large uptake of these lysins at the red cell surfaces when they are added first, and that the subsequent addition of plasma greatly reduces the quantity of lysin held in the <b>internal</b> <b>phase.</b> Further, if the inhibitor is added first and the lysin subsequently, the internal lysin phase is very incompletely formed.

40|$|One {{of the two}} {{possible}} explanations for the progressive nature of certain hemolytic reactions (Ponder and Cox, 1952) is that the system contains an <b>internal</b> <b>phase</b> near the red cell surfaces, and that this phase is less affected by dilution than is the bulk phase of the system. There is indirect evidence {{in favor of this}} explanation in systems containing saponin, digitonin, and sodium taurocholate (Ponder, 1953), but it is desirable that the evidence on such an important point should be direct because, if an <b>internal</b> <b>phase</b> is formed, the kinetics of the hemolytic system have to be considered in relation to the concentration of lysin there, rather than (as heretofore) in relation to the initial lysin concentration in the system. An attempt has already been made (Ponder, 1946) to show that saponin, sodium taurocholate, and sodium glycocholate form an <b>internal</b> <b>phase,</b> different in concentration from, and to some extent independent of, the concentration in the bulk phase.

No evidence of there being an <b>internal</b> <b>phase</b> was obtained, but the lysins could be used only in very low (subasymptotic) concentration, and under such conditions recent considerations have pointed to the reaction between lysin and cell components being a reversible one in which only a small amount of the lysin is combined with the cell components at any one time (Ponder, 1948). In other experiments, however, sodium taurocholate was allowed to react with red cell ghosts for some hours, and still no evidence for the accumulation of the lysin in an <b>internal</b> <b>phase,</b> or of the "utilization " of lysin in a hemolytic reaction, was obtained.
