40|$|<b>Ferroresonance</b> {{phenomenon}} {{occurs in}} electrical circuits which are consisting of magnetizing cores, {{such as in}} the transmission and distribution networks with transformers, electrical machines or reactors. Transformers often operate close to the knee point of the magnetizing curve under normal condition.

This phenomenon is reflected in the change of the equivalent nonlinear reactance of the transformer. Now, if the value of the saturated reactance reaches a value such that it causes resonance with the equivalent capacitance of the network, then an over current or over voltage may occur. Transformers, electrical motors, reactors and generators are examples of equipment having magnetizing cores. <b>Ferroresonance</b> may cause melting of the lamination of the transformer or electrical machine which eventually may lead to the failure of the equipment.

Sustained <b>ferroresonance</b> without immediate mitigation measures can cause the transformers {{to stay in a}} state of saturation leading to excessive flux migrating to transformer tanks via internal accessories. The symptom of such an event can be unwanted humming noises being generated but the real threatening implication is the possible overheating which can result in premature ageing and failures. The main objective of this thesis is to determine the accurate models for transformers, transmission lines, circuit breakers and cables under transient studies, particularly for <b>ferroresonance.</b> The modeling accuracy is validated on a particular 400 / 275 kV transmission system by comparing the field test recorded voltage and current waveforms with the simulation results obtained using the models. In addition, a second case study involving another 400 / 275 kV transmission system with two transformers is performed to investigate the likelihood of the occurrence of sustained fundamental frequency <b>ferroresonance</b> mode and a possible quenching mechanism using the 13 kV tertiary connected reactor. A sensitivity study on transmission line lengths was also carriedout to determine the probability function of occurrence of various <b>ferroresonance</b> modes. To reproduce the sustained fundamental and the subharmonic <b>ferroresonance</b> modes, the simulation studies revealed that three main power system components which are involved in <b>ferroresonance,</b> i. e. the circuit breaker, the transmission line and the transformer, can be modeled using time-controlled switch, the PI, Bergeron or Marti line model, and the BCTRAN+ or HYBRID transformer model. Any combination of the above component models can be employed to accurately simulate the <b>ferroresonance</b> system circuit. Simulation studies also revealed that the key circuit parameter to initiate transformer <b>ferroresonance</b> in a transmission system is the circuit-to-circuit capacitance of a double-circuit overhead line. The extensive simulation studies also suggested that the <b>ferroresonance</b> phenomena are far more complex and sensitive to the minor changes of system parameters and circuit breaker operations. Adding with the non-linearity of transformer core characteristics, repeatability is not always guaranteed for simulation and experimental studies. All simulation studies are carried out using an electromagnetic transient program, called ATPDraw. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceBrunei GovernmentGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} MOSA on {{controlling}} of the non-conventional <b>ferroresonance</b> overvoltage in the iron core voltage transformer is studied. It is expected that MOSA can generally damp <b>ferroresonance</b> overvoltages. Time-domain study is used to analyze this effect. Study is done on a voltage transformer rated 100 VA, 275 kV. The magnetization characteristic of the transformer coil is modeled by a single-parameter twoterm polynomial with q = 7 degree of nonlinearity. Core loss is modeled by linear resistance. Simulation results show that connecting the MOSA in parallel to the voltage transformer, shows a great controlling effect of the <b>ferroresonance</b> oscillations. Phase plane, time domain voltage waveforms, FFT analysis and bifurcation diagrams are also given. Significant effect on settling down to the chaos, the range of parameter values {{that may lead to}} <b>ferroresonance</b> overvoltages and controlling these phenomena are obtained and presented...|$|E
40|$|Implementation of the {{new class}} of 1000 MW power units to a power system creates new {{problems}} associated with the operation of its individual components and circuits. One such issue is the phenomenon of <b>ferroresonance</b> in the internal load network. This is not a new problem but it requires examination due to the higher level of supply voltage (10 kV). This paper examines the possibility of <b>ferroresonance</b> occurrence and its character depending on the extent of the network, voltage transformers’ load, the effect of grounding resistors in the star point of the power transformer and the presence of varistor surge arresters. The results are presented in the form of <b>ferroresonance</b> maps. They allow assessing the impact of various parameters on the phenomenon, explaining the reasons for possible failure and properly programming the network conditions {{in order to avoid the}} risk of <b>ferroresonance...</b>|$|E
