5|$|Magnapop {{established}} their <b>fan</b> <b>base</b> {{in the early}} 1990s through touring and the festival circuit—particularly in central Europe, where they first broke through to the mainstream.

By the end of 1992, they were getting positive write-ups in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993.

5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban <b>fan</b> <b>base.</b> Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|Anarky {{retained}} {{interest among}} a cult <b>fan</b> <b>base</b> during this obscure period.

5|$|During the 1970s and '80s (the main era for {{organised}} football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for {{the levels}} of hooliganism in their <b>fan</b> <b>base</b> and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the '70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in terms}} of <b>fan</b> <b>base,</b> the two fan bases are close in a way. Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and a danger to themselves and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, at ease with themselves and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E

The Central Coast region has about 300,000 residents, which gives the Mariners the A-League's smallest local <b>fan</b> <b>base.</b> Accordingly, the Mariners acquired a small-market image among commentators.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} further {{promoted}} {{on her first}} headlining tour, The Virgin Tour, which only visited cities in the United States and Canada. Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large <b>fan</b> <b>base</b> in both countries. However, the final schedule did not reflect the idea.
