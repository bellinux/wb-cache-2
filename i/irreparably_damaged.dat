5|$|Nine Comets, {{including}} Comet 1s {{operated by}} BOAC and Union Aeromaritime de Transport and Comet 4s flown by Aerolíneas Argentinas, Dan-Air, Malaysian Airlines, and United Arab Airlines, were <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> during takeoff or landing accidents that were survived by all on board. A hangar fire damaged a No. 192 Squadron RAF Comet 2R beyond repair on 13 September 1957, and three Middle East Airlines Comet 4Cs {{were destroyed by}} Israeli troops at Beirut, Lebanon on 28 December 1968.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> by the force of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson was {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's right eye had been <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E

50|$|Stoker {{wins the}} vocal support of blood-thirsty fans who had at first rooted {{against him and}} ends up {{defeating}} his opponent. He pays for his decision with a beating in an alley outside the arena from Little Boy, Tiger Nelson, and their cronies. The group <b>irreparably</b> <b>damages</b> Stoker's hand with a smash from a brick.|$|R
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged,</b> {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
25|$|As briefly {{discussed}} above, {{the stresses}} involved in firing {{this sort of}} device require an extremely heat-resistant material. Otherwise the rails, barrel, and all equipment attached would melt or be <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{continued}} to fly competitively {{for three more}} years, attending all the Rhön events from 1925 to 1928, frequently flown by Akaflieg Dessau students, one of whom <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> it there in 1928.|$|E
40|$|Today, the {{thousands}} of Ge'ez manuscripts still kept by the Eritrean and Ethiopian monastic libraries are under risk. The joined action of time and men can <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> this philological treasure. Cataloguing and studying the Ge'ez manuscripts {{is a good way}} for preserving them from dispersion, and this task can be better accomplished through a project of systematic online publication {{of the results of the}} scientific inquiries...|$|R
50|$|As recent as {{the year}} 2006, {{attempts}} were being made by the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a breakwater to stop any further deterioration from <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaging</b> the centuries old fort. Senate Vice President Orlando Parga has led efforts to modify some of the construction projects that would encroach on the fort or would hamper the Corps of Engineers' preservation and reconstruction efforts.|$|R
50|$|In July 2010, President Jakaya Kikwete renewed {{his support}} for an {{upgraded}} road through the northern portion of the park to link Mto wa Mbu, southeast of Ngorongoro Crater, and Musoma on Lake Victoria. While {{he said that the}} road would lead to much-needed development in poor communities, others, including conservation groups and foreign governments like Kenya, argued that the road could <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the great migration and the park's ecosystem.|$|R
25|$|In 2015 {{the wooden}} {{flagpole}} {{was found to}} be <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> by termites. A new metal flagpole was installed to replace it. The new pole has a new plaque, with the same wording as the original.|$|E
25|$|The Valley Inn Tavern in Heathcote, {{built in}} 1877, survived the initial quake, {{but had to}} be torn down after the large 5.1 {{magnitude}} aftershock.

25|$|Shipped to Montreal in June 1910 to {{take part}} in the Montreal Air Meet, the Baddeck No. 1 was flown by McCurdy who crashed on 30 June 1910. Baddeck No. 1 was <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged,</b> being {{replaced}} in flight testing by the Baddeck No. 2.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Chitlapakkam was {{upgraded}} as a town panchayat. The town hit {{the headlines}} in the late 1980s and early 1990s when residents came together to successfully protect the Chitlapakkam Lake. Fearing that onslaught in different forms would <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the lake, like-minded citizens joined together and mobilised public support and sensitised the State government {{to the need for}} preventing the shrinking of the lake in the form of encroachments.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{an effort}} to convert the theater into a nightclub was blocked in court {{on the grounds that}} it would <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the theater's {{historic}} and protected architecture. Subsequently, the theater underwent a revival in its concert hall business, filling New York's low-to-mid-sized venue notch between the larger Radio City Music Hall and various smaller clubs and ballrooms. The Madison Square Garden Company began operating the Beacon in 2006.|$|R
50|$|At {{the middle}} range of UV, UV rays cannot ionize but can break {{chemical}} bonds, making molecules unusually reactive. Sunburn, for example, {{is caused by}} the disruptive effects of middle range UV radiation on skin cells, which is the main cause of skin cancer. UV rays in the middle range can <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the complex DNA molecules in the cells producing thymine dimers making it a very potent mutagen.|$|R
25|$|The ginkgo {{tree that}} had {{stood next to}} Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū's stone {{stairway}} approximately from the Shinto shrine's foundation in 1063, and which appears in almost every old depiction of the shrine, was completely uprooted and <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> in March, 2010. According to an expert who analyzed the tree, the fall was likely due to rot.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{machines}} {{without a}} transformer circuit topology, {{such as that}} of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the PM assembly of PMSMs can be <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged,</b> if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Tropical Storm Henri {{struck the}} valley and {{produced}} an even more catastrophic flood. While the two steel bridges (and an iron trestle at Ashland) survived the flood, the remaining bridges were swept away or <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged.</b> Despite {{the damage caused by}} these storms, the Wilmington and Western continued to operate on the remaining track, and replaced all of the destroyed bridges with steel trestles. The line officially reopened into Hockessin on June 30, 2007.|$|E
50|$|The minions of Sōgon, the MJBK are monsters {{formed from}} the Logos World upon a text {{receiving}} his mystical syringes spawned {{from his book}} of magic. Upon formation the text they form {{in the real world}} will dissipate following their birth before using their meaning to cause physical destruction. Upon reaching full power the MJBK will erase the concept of their meaning in the collective minds of humanity, <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaging</b> their ability to communicate and think.|$|R
50|$|Current {{solutions}} to sticky-shed syndrome seek to safely remove the unwanted {{moisture from the}} tape binder. Two different strategies are commonly employed: applying heat to the tape (commonly called 'baking'), and changing the environment to lower the humidity. Baking is widely practiced, but can destroy tapes. While modification of humidity by safely controlling the environment may take significantly longer, its major benefit {{is that it does}} not <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the tape. Alternate practices have also been developed by engineers to fix affected tapes.|$|R
50|$|The request {{prompted}} Adrian of Utrecht, the regent {{appointed by}} Charles V, {{to declare that}} Charles would lose Castile if she granted her support. Although she was sympathetic to the Comuneros, she was persuaded by Ochoa de Landa and her confessor Fray John of Avila that supporting the revolt would <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the country and her son's kingship and she therefore refused to sign a document granting her support. The Battle of Villalar confirmed that Charles would prevail over the revolt.|$|R
25|$|The movement's {{cloverleaf}} logo {{created the}} impression {{that it was a}} single organisation rather than independent organisations sharing common principles. The brand was strengthened by the creation of the Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG) in 1993, providing Co-op branded products and other food supplies to its members: by 2002, the CRTG provided 100% of food supplies sold by UK consumer co-operatives. Over time, the brand became tarnished by inconsistent customer delivery and image perceptions of the cloverleaf logo were <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged.</b> Market research carried out in the early 2000s showed a consistent decline in consumer ratings.|$|E
25|$|At least 16 {{commercial}} aircraft made damaging in-flight {{encounters with the}} ash cloud ejected by the June 15 eruption, as did other aircraft on the ground. The encounters caused loss of power to one engine on each of two aircraft. 10 engines were damaged and replaced, including all three engines of one DC-10. Longer term damage to aircraft and engines was reported, including accumulation of sulphate deposits on engines. The eruption also <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> the Philippine Air Force's recently retired fleet of Vought F-8s, as these were in open storage at Basa Air Base at the time.|$|E
25|$|It {{was located}} {{at the corner of}} Balderas and Avenida Juárez in the {{historic}} center and completely collapsed within moments of the quake. Shortly after its collapse, it began to burn due to a gas leak, which made it extremely difficult to rescue survivors. Nothing survived of the hotel. The space is now the Plaza de la Solidaridad park. A small museum {{on the north side of}} the park houses a mural by Diego Rivera which was originally housed in the huge Hotel Del Prado across the street. That hotel was <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> in the earthquake and subsequently demolished.|$|E

What other symbiotic lifeforms does a human need to live a healthy life? For example, gut flora and many other species of microorganisms may be necessary for proper biological and immunological functioning. Babies normally acquire these from their mothers and the wider environment, but {{this would not be}} the case for embryos in colonization ships.|$|R
25|$|The AWA was {{no longer}} the top {{promotion}} after the WWWF rejoined the NWA. The AWA reached new heights, however, after powerhouse wrestler Hulk Hogan gained nationwide attention from starring in Rocky III, and became a solid fan favorite. Despite Hogan being the AWA's top draw, Gagne would not let him be champion, believing technical wrestlers, like him and Nick Bockwinkel, should be the focus of a wrestling company. Since founding the AWA, Gagne had built the company off of technical wrestling. Hogan left in 1983, <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaging</b> the AWA.|$|R
500|$|Declaring that {{he would}} [...] "fight like a wounded animal" [...] for re-election, Mugabe {{approached}} the 2013 elections believing {{that it would be}} his last. He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> Tsvangirai's credibility. The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting Mugabe. They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being told what to do by the military, although at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue.|$|R
25|$|In May 2003 the DZR was {{certified}} {{for operations}} under night {{visual flight rules}} (NVFR) and in March 2004 it became the first {{company in the world}} to receive certification as an airship pilot flight school. The D-LZZF Friedrichshafen prototype, used in training and charter service, went on a survey mission to South Africa for de Beers in 2005. It was <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> by a tornado while moored in Botswana in 2007 and is no longer in service. The D-LZZR Bodensee was sold to Nippon Airship Corporation in 2004 and renamed JA101Z Yokoso! Japan. That commercial service was ultimately unsuccessful and the ship was resold to the DZR in 2011. It resumed operations the under its original name in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to fly the}} Cygnet II at Baddeck, Nova Scotia between 22 and 24 February 1909, {{met with}} failure. When the AEA Silver Dart was ready for flight testing, the engine {{was removed from the}} Cygnet II, and then returned. Rebuilt again as the Cygnet III with a more {{powerful}} 70hp Gnome Gamma engine, its final flight was on 19 March 1912, at Bras d'Or Lake, Nova Scotia, piloted by John McCurdy. The results were highly unsatisfactory with the Cygnet III only able to lift off the ground for a foot or two, typically considered remaining in ground effect. After a final trial on 17 March, the tetrahedral cell bank failed structurally, leaving the aircraft <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged.</b> The Cygnet II and III were abandoned following this flight attempt.|$|E
25|$|On 23 February, Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch's tallest hotel, was {{reported}} {{to be on the verge}} of collapse. The 26-storey building was displaced by half a metre in the quake and had dropped by 1 metre on one side; parts of the emergency stairwells collapsed. The building was thought to be <b>irreparably</b> <b>damaged</b> and have the potential to bring down other buildings if it fell; an area of a two-block radius around the hotel was thus evacuated. The building was eventually stabilised and, on 4 March it was decided the building would be demolished over the following six months, so that further work could be done with the buildings nearby. Demolition was completed in May 2012. The 21-storey PricewaterhouseCoopers building, the city's tallest office tower, is among the office buildings to be demolished.|$|E
50|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} can be {{susceptible to}} prompt-criticality accidents if a large increase in k-effective (or reactivity) occurs, e.g., following failure of their control and safety systems. The rapid uncontrollable increase in reactor power in prompt-critical conditions {{is likely to}} <b>irreparably</b> <b>damage</b> the reactor and in extreme cases, may breach the containment of the reactor. Nuclear reactors' safety systems are designed to prevent prompt criticality and, for defense in depth, reactor structures also provide multiple layers of containment as a precaution against any accidental releases of radioactive fission products.|$|R
