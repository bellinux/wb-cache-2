25|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> {{backpack}} is {{a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. <b>Internal</b> <b>frame</b> packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|E
25|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> {{backpack}} {{consists of}} strips of either metal or plastic that mold to one's back {{to provide a}} good fit, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. Usually a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The close fitting of the back section to the wearer's back allows the pack to be closely attached to the body, and gives a predictable movement of the load.

30|$|Negative OTL experiences, {{coupled with}} strong <b>internal</b> or {{external}} <b>framing,</b> {{are indicative of}} a loss of agency of either the student or the instructor. Strong external framing that mandates a strong <b>internal</b> <b>framing</b> indicates that the instructor has limited agency in providing positive OTL for her students. Similarly, strong <b>internal</b> <b>framing</b> coupled with a negative OTL experience indicates the students have reduced agency {{in their ability to}} learn. This sense of loss of student agency is of particular importance in Calculus I, as self-efficacy is a strong predictor of first-year college GPA (Zajacova et al. 2005).|$|R
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that wall tents are set up by two or three people. Tents with a sewn-in floor are typically harder to set up if they have <b>internal</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
30|$|Both {{external}} and <b>internal</b> <b>framing</b> {{can either be}} strong or weak, where the degree of framing {{is indicative of the}} degree to which different actors control, or feel they have agency to control, what happens in the class (Hoadley 2003). A strong external framing indicates that the instructor has little control over what or how she teaches. For instance, we may expect a new graduate teaching assistant who is teaching a coordinated section of calculus to have strong external framing. A weak external framing indicates that the instructor has more freedom related to content, exposure, and emphasis in the course, and thus provides the instructor more control over the OTLs she provides. A strong <b>internal</b> <b>framing</b> indicates that the teacher sets the pace and emphasis of the course, regardless of cues from the students, whereas a weak <b>internal</b> <b>framing</b> indicates that the instructor has a less ridged structure for the course, yielding some of the agency and power to the students. For instance, a classroom where the teacher regularly adjusts the lesson based on feedback from the students has weak <b>internal</b> <b>framing.</b> While this can occur during a very interactive lecture, this sort of weak framing is typical of classrooms implementing student-centered instructional approaches, as these approaches are, by design, guided by the students rather than the instructor (Haugen 2011).|$|R

25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: frameless, {{external}} frame, <b>internal</b> <b>frame,</b> and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|E
25|$|The one {{exception}} to the supposed 'look but don't touch'-policy was the so-named boat no. 10, which was slowly appearing due to apparent soil erosion. For five days, archaeologists carefully examined the midsection of the ship. They uncovered wooden planks, disintegrated rope, and reed bundles. Wood-eating ants had reduced much of the ship's hull to frass (ant excrement), but the frass had retained {{the shape of the}} original hull. The midsection of this boat revealed the construction methods used and confirmed the oldest ‘planked’ constructed boat yet discovered. The boat's construction revealed it had been constructed from the outside in, as there was no <b>internal</b> <b>frame.</b> Averaging 75ft long and 7–10ft wide at their greatest width, these boats were only about two feet deep, with narrow prows and sterns. Several boats were white-plastered, as were the Abydos tombs, and no. 10 was painted yellow.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} model is proposed for predicting the scattering pressure by a fluid-loaded cylindrical shell stiffened by axisymmetric <b>internal</b> <b>frames</b> and impacted by an acoustic plane wave. The proposed developments consist in {{an extension of}} the Circumferential Admittance Approach (CAA) [Maxit, et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 128, 137 - 151 (2010) ] to an obliquely incident plane wave excitations. CAA consists in assembling a {{numerical model}} of the fluid loaded shell with finite element models of the <b>internal</b> <b>frames.</b> The scattering pressure model deduced from CAA can then take into account: (a), <b>internal</b> <b>frames</b> having a cross section with a complex geometry and thickness variations (like T-shaped stiffeners, bulkheads, hemispherical end caps); (b), variations of the frame spacings; (c), the frame-shell coupling in the three translational directions and the tangential rotation. Comparison with numerical and experimental results of the literature for a periodic stiffened shell shows that the scattering from Bragg, Bloch-Floquet, and Helical waves are correctly predicted. The effects on the backscattering pressure of the axial and tangential coupling forces are highlighted. Finally, an example of non-periodically stiffened shell is presented to highlight the versatility of the proposed approach...|$|R

25|$|The nail's design {{began when}} its inventor, civil {{engineer}} Ed Sutt, {{traveled to the}} Caribbean {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Marilyn. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95mph (155km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the findings showed that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse. Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility, which had received funding through a grant from FEMA. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity. The outcome of the project's research showed {{that the best way to}} strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the roofing and wall sheathing to the <b>internal</b> <b>frame,</b> and with this information Sutt signed on as a fastener engineer for the Stanley subsidiary, Bostitch.|$|E

2500|$|The {{external}} frame is typically made from aluminum, other lightweight metal alloy, and recently reinforced synthetic polymers or plastic and {{is equipped with}} a system of straps and tautly-stretched netting which prevents contact between the metal frame and user's back. In addition to comfort, this [...] "stand-off" [...] provides the additional benefit of creating air circulation between the frame and the wearer's back. For this reason, {{external frame}} packs are generally considered to be a [...] "cooler load" [...] than <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> designs. External frame packs have a fabric [...] "sack" [...] portion which is usually smaller than that of <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> packs, but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items. In addition, the sack can often be removed entirely, permitting the user to customize the configuration of their load, or to transport a non-conventional load such as a quartered game animal. Military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes, sizes and weights.|$|E

2500|$|Cristofori's pianos use an <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> member (bentside) {{to support}} the soundboard; in other words, the {{structural}} member attaching {{the right side of}} the soundboard is distinct from the external case that bears the tension of the strings. This system was also applied by Cristofori to harpsichords. The use of a separate support for the soundboard reflects Cristofori's belief that the soundboard should not be subjected to compression from string tension. This may improve the sound, and also avoids the peril of warping—as harpsichord makers Kerstin Schwarz and Tony Chinnery point out , , a severely warped soundboard threatens a structural catastrophe, namely contact between strings and soundboard. Cristofori's principle continues to be applied in modern pianos, where the now-enormous string tension (up to 20 tons) is borne by a separate iron frame (the [...] "plate").|$|E
2500|$|The OA vz. 27's armored {{body was}} {{mounted on a}} {{purpose-built}} ladder frame chassis. The chassis design was unusual {{as it could be}} driven in both directions as it had both forward and rear drivers. Both axles could be driven and steered, but not {{at the same time as}} the reverser lever controlled the direction of travel and which axle was being used so it was not a true four-wheel drive design[...] The forward driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had his own vision port. The rear driver sat on the vehicle's left side. A heavy Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 water-cooled machine gun was mounted in the center of the rear hull with 72° of traverse. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from doors in both sides of the vehicle and a hatch in the turret. The gunner sat in a small, conical turret with 360° of traverse. It had an observation port in the front, vision slits on both sides and an armored searchlight on a swing arm in the rear. The turret had a Schwarzlose MG vz. 07/24 machine gun in a forward-facing ball mount and two other ball mounts were fitted on the sides of the turret. A ZB vz. 26 light machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 5750 rounds were stored for the machine guns.

60|$|This, then, in short, is the case: Nature makes many PARTICULAR THINGS, {{which do}} agree one with another in many {{sensible}} qualities, and probably too in their <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> and constitution: {{but it is}} not this real essence that distinguishes them into species; it is men who, taking occasion from the qualities they find united in them, and wherein they observe often several individuals to agree, range them into sorts, in order to their naming, for the convenience of comprehensive signs; under which individuals, according to their conformity to this or that abstract idea, come to be ranked as under ensigns: so that this is of the blue, that the red regiment; this is a man, that a drill: and in this, I think, consists the whole business of genus and species.|$|E

30|$|As {{illustrated}} by the orange markings and triangle points, two variables are associated with higher reports of positive OTL: reporting more student-centered practices and agreeing with the statement “I believe I have the knowledge and ability to succeed in this course.” These two factors speak to very different reasons why a student would feel that there was enough {{time for them to}} learn the more difficult ideas in calculus––one is indicative of the classroom structure (i.e., weak <b>internal</b> <b>framing)</b> and one is student-specific. Of all factors investigated in this study, that most strongly associated with positive OTL is student-centered practices. This suggests that the biggest contributor to students reporting positive OTL is a class environment that provides them a variety of ways to learn, including whole-class discussion, opportunities to explain their thinking, and asking questions. These instructional practices all may provide students with mechanisms to influence their own learning experience, which is indicative of a weak <b>internal</b> <b>framing.</b>|$|R
30|$|External framing {{also has}} a strong {{influence}} over how much control the instructor can yield to the students (i.e., the <b>internal</b> <b>framing).</b> For instance, an instructor might be very aware that the content, exposure, or emphasis of their course is not supporting student learning, but strong external framing prohibits adjusting the OTL for her students (e.g., {{she does not have}} the option to alter the pacing in class based on feedback from students because of the external constraints). Alternatively, it may be the case that an instructor is not adjusting the OTL for her students because she is teaching in a way that inhibits her from receiving feedback from students (e.g., by not asking for students to give input in class) or not attending to this feedback (e.g., by not adjusting her teaching based on student input). In either scenario, the students would experience strong <b>internal</b> <b>framing</b> that results in the students lacking the ability to influence their OTL.|$|R

60|$|How {{much the}} making of species and genera is in order to general names; and how much general names are necessary, if not to the being, yet {{at least to the}} {{completing}} of a species, and making it pass for such, will appear, besides what has been said above concerning ice and water, in a very familiar example. A silent and a striking watch are but one species, to those who have but one name for them: but he that has the name WATCH for one, and CLOCK for the other, and distinct complex ideas to which those names belong, to HIM they are different species. It will be said perhaps, that the inward contrivance and constitution is different between these two, which the watchmaker has a clear idea of. And yet it is plain they are but one species to him, when he has but one name for them. For what is sufficient in the inward contrivance to make a new species? There are some watches that are made with four wheels, others with five; is this a specific difference to the workman? Some have strings and physics, and others none; some have the balance loose, and others regulated by a spiral spring, and others by hogs' bristles. Are any or all of these enough to make a specific difference to the workman, that knows each of these and several other different contrivances in the internal constitutions of watches? It is certain each of these hath a real difference from the rest; but whether it be an essential, a specific difference or no, relates only to the complex idea to which the name watch is given: as long as they all agree in the idea which that name stands for, and that name does not as a generical name comprehend different species under it, they are not essentially nor specifically different. But if any one will make minuter divisions, from differences that he knows in the <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> of watches, and to such precise complex ideas give names that shall prevail; they will then be new species, to them who have those ideas with names to them, and can by those differences distinguish watches into these several sorts; and then WATCH will be a generical name. But yet they would be no distinct species to men ignorant of clock-work, and the inward contrivances of watches, who had no other idea but the outward shape and bulk, with the marking of the hours by the hand. For to them all those other names would be but synonymous terms for the same idea, and signify no more, nor no other thing but a watch. Just thus I think it is in natural things. Nobody will doubt that the wheels or springs (if I may so say) within, are different in a RATIONAL MAN and a CHANGELING; no more than that there is a difference in the frame between a DRILL and a CHANGELING. But whether one or both these differences be essential or specifical, is only to be known to us by their agreement or disagreement with the complex idea that the name man stands for: for by that alone can it be determined whether one, or both, or neither of those be a man.|$|E
60|$|The first requisite, then, in an Epitaph is, that {{it should}} speak, in a tone which shall sink into the heart, the general {{language}} of humanity as connected with the subject of death--the source from which an epitaph proceeds--of death, and of life. To be born and to die are the two points in which all men feel themselves to be in absolute coincidence. This general language may be uttered so strikingly as to entitle an epitaph to high praise; yet it cannot lay claim to the highest unless other excellencies be superadded. Passing through all intermediate steps, we will attempt to determine at once what these excellencies are, and wherein consists the perfection of this species of composition.--It will be found to lie in a due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception, conveyed to the reader's mind, of the individual, whose death is deplored and whose memory is to be preserved; at least of his character as, after death, it appeared to those who loved him and lament his loss. The general sympathy ought to be quickened, provoked, and diversified, by particular thoughts, actions, images,--circumstances of age, occupation, manner of life, prosperity which the deceased had known, or adversity {{to which he had}} been subject; and these ought to be bound together and solemnised into one harmony by the general sympathy. The two powers should temper, restrain, and exalt each other. The reader ought to know who and what the man was whom he is called upon to think of with interest. A distinct conception should be given (implicitly where it can, rather than explicitly) of the individual lamented.--But the writer of an epitaph is not an anatomist, who dissects the <b>internal</b> <b>frame</b> of the mind; he is not even a painter, who executes a portrait at leisure and in entire tranquillity; his delineation, we must remember, is performed {{by the side of the}} grave; and, what is more, the grave of one whom he loves and admires. What purity and brightness is that virtue clothed in, the image of which must no longer bless our living eyes! The character of a deceased friend or beloved kinsman is not seen, no--nor ought to be seen, otherwise than as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist, that spiritualises and beautifies it; that takes away, indeed, but only to the end that the parts which are not abstracted may appear more dignified and lovely; may impress and affect the more. Shall we say, then, that this is not truth, not a faithful image; and that, accordingly, the purposes of commemoration cannot be answered?--It is truth, and of the highest order; for, though doubtless things are not apparent which did exist; yet, the object being looked at through this medium, parts and proportions are brought into distinct view which before had been only imperfectly or unconsciously seen: it is truth hallowed by love--the joint offspring of the worth of the dead and the affections of the living! This may easily be brought to the test. Let one, whose eyes have been sharpened by personal hostility to discover what was amiss in the character of a good man, hear the tidings of his death, and what a change is wrought in a moment! Enmity melts away; and, as it disappears, unsightliness, disproportion, and deformity, vanish; and, through the influence of commiseration, a harmony of love and beauty succeeds. Bring such a man to the tomb-stone on which shall be inscribed an epitaph on his adversary, composed in the spirit which we have recommended. Would he turn from it as from an idle tale? No;--the thoughtful look, the sigh, and perhaps the involuntary tear, would testify that it had a sane, a generous, and good meaning; and that on the writer's mind had remained an impression which was a true abstract of the character of the deceased; that his gifts and graces were remembered in the simplicity in which they ought to be remembered. The composition and quality of the mind of a virtuous man, contemplated by the side of the grave where his body is mouldering, ought to appear, and be felt as something midway between what he was on earth walking about with his living frailties, and what he may be presumed to be as a spirit in heaven.|$|E

Data collection on risk attitudes is commonly collected from an investor’s choice between uncertain outcomes of a risky investment.

Individuals develop <b>internal</b> <b>frames</b> of reference as a simplifying behavioural heuristic when faced with decision making under uncertainty. The framing of attitudinal survey questions will condition an investor’s response to risk attitudes. Alternative frames can reverse attitudinal responses to the same choice.
