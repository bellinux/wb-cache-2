25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired <b>input</b> <b>frequency</b> equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the superheterodyne receiver.|$|E

In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the <b>input</b> <b>frequency,</b> to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.|$|E

They {{can be used to}} demodulate a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an <b>input</b> <b>frequency</b> (frequency synthesis), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in digital logic circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz.|$|E

25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the <b>input</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E
500|$|The phase {{difference}} between the two output ports of a hybrid coupler should be 0°, 90°, or 180° depending on the type used. [...] However, like amplitude balance, the {{phase difference}} is sensitive to the <b>input</b> <b>frequency</b> and typically will vary a few degrees.|$|E

A simple {{discussion}} is given {{on the origin}} of intermodulation distortion in nonlinear devices concluding with reasons for placing primary interest on third order products. Nearby third order products are located at 2 f(x) – f(y) and f(x) + f(y) – f(z) where f(x), f(y), and f(z) represent all frequencies in a group. The number of nearby IM products of this type is equal to N(N - 1) (1 + (N - 2 / 2)) where N is the number of <b>input</b> <b>frequencies</b> to the nonlinear device. For eight input signals, for example, a total of 224 intermodulation products are produced that are located in a bandwidth that is three times the bandwidth between the highest and lowest <b>input</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The graphical method of locating intermodulation products is rapid and simple. Basically, interfering frequencies are found by the alignment of two pieces of paper. On each piece of paper, the spacings between all <b>input</b> <b>frequencies</b> are plotted on a linear scale.

2500|$|Earliest {{research}} towards {{what was}} later named the phase-locked loop {{goes back to}} 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to Edwin Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver, the Homodyne or direct-conversion receiver. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a local oscillator was tuned to the desired <b>input</b> <b>frequency</b> and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information. [...] The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the superheterodyne receiver. [...] Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal {{was applied to the}} oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the desired signal. The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal L'Onde Électrique.|$|E
2500|$|Most musical {{instruments}} generate a fairly complex waveform. It contains {{a number of}} harmonic partials, including the fundamental frequency (which a typical listener perceives as the pitch of the note) and additional [...] "harmonics" [...] (also called [...] "partials" [...] or [...] "overtones"). Each instrument produces [...] different ratios of harmonics, which is what makes notes of the same pitch played on different instruments (e.g., an A 440Hz note played on oboe, violin or electric guitar) sound different. As well, this waveform [...] constantly changes. This means that for non-strobe tuners to be accurate, the tuner must process a number of cycles and use the pitch average to drive its display. Background noise from other musicians or harmonic overtones from the musical instrument can impede the electronic tuner from [...] "locking" [...] onto the <b>input</b> <b>frequency.</b> This is why the needle or display on regular electronic tuners tends to waver when a pitch is played. Small movements of the needle, or LED, usually represent a tuning error of 1 cent. Typical accuracy {{of these types of}} tuners is around +/- 3 cents. Some inexpensive LED tuners may drift by as much as +/- 9 cents.|$|E

40|$|From a {{practical}} standpoint most dynamic response analysis techniques are complicated, expensive, and time consuming to mechanize and operate. Adaptive parameter tracking techniques partially overcome these faults, {{but they have}} prescribed forms which is an undesirable restriction for basic research. To overcome these drawbacks, an on-line Fourier analysis technique has been developed which deals only with the input and error signals in a manual feedback control system. Several sine waves are used for the input, and the on-line data measurement includes the error variance and a simple means for obtaining the sine and cosine transforms of the error signal {{at each of the}} <b>input</b> <b>frequencies.</b> From this relatively small amount of data, we show simple ways to compute the open- and closed-loop dynamic response at <b>input</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the relative amount of linearly correlated power in the error signal...|$|R

Secondly, recovery from depression is activity dependent and is faster at higher <b>input</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Frequency-dependent recovery is a Ca 2 +-dependent process and does not reflect an underlying augmentation. Frequencydependent recovery and release-independent depression are correlated, such that at those connections with a large amount of release-independent depression, recovery from depression is faster.
