5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>A</b> longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E
500|$|Bang {{started writing}} the novel in 1885 in Vienna, after remembering Skørping Station: [...] "It {{was in one}} of those windows behind the flowers that I saw <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> face which I {{had not been able to}} erase from my memory for two years and which, as if a painter, I felt like drawing in soft, melancholic, almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover {{illustration}} for this book." ...|$|E
500|$|During the season, the {{producers}} worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios {{to help create}} Raina's Inhuman look, and introduce the Inhumans to the MCU. To get to the final look, the writers {{spent a lot of}} time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film Nightbreed, specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because [...] "She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to [...] "make her feel like the first real Inhuman" [...] and give <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, {{the producers}} wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, [...] "Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [...]" ...|$|E

6000|$|It was but {{a moment}} she sat in this place, [...] She'd a scarf on her neck, and <b>a</b> smile on <b>her</b> <b>face!</b> [...] <b>A</b> smile on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>a</b> rose in her hair, [...] And she sat there, and bloom'd in my cane-bottom'd chair.|$|R
60|$|Damaris {{came forward}} and threw her arms about the older woman, lifting <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> their lips met even Cynthia White {{realized}} that she had no business there. She vented the irritation of her embarrassment on the innocent Jeanette.|$|R
2500|$|... "Thus from maidenhood {{to middle}} age, {{before the time}} when the last {{wrinkles}} of old age finally spread over <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> woman is a pleasant armful for a man to embrace, and, even if the beauty of her prime is past, yet ...|$|E

King Jr., whose firm built the pedestal and erected the statue, let the veil fall from <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>A</b> 'huge shock of sound' erupted as a thunderous cacophony of salutes from steamer whistles, brass bands, and booming guns, together with clouds of smoke from the cannonade, engulfed the statue for the next half hour." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{artwork and}} visuals for the album were shot with American fashion {{photography}} Guy Arochin a vintage apartment. Glasshearts album cover was unveiled on 5 September 2011. An editor for The Metro described the cover photo. Lewis stares {{directly at the}} camera [...] "in {{a continuation of the}} more sexy and sophisticated look she has been sporting in recent months." [...] The reviewer commented on Lewis' styling: [...] "Her long dark hair is swept back from her face, aside from her ruffled fringe, while two black stars have been carefully applied below her eyes, adding to the overall dramatic effect." [...] Becky Bain from music website Idolator, commented that although [...] "Lewis looks beautiful", the image processing makes her look [...] "incredibly washed out in this over-saturated photo"; Bain was less impressed with the star-like beauty marks on <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>A</b> competition run by Lewis' website gave fans the opportunity {{to be part of the}} artwork for the deluxe edition of the album. Fans were asked to send in pictures of themselves posing with a heart, for inclusion in the album liner booklet. Additionally, Lewis hand-signed 3,000limited edition copies of the album which exclusively went on sale through online retailer Play.com, while retailer HMV sold the album with an exclusive slipcase.|$|E
6000|$|MARY has {{returned}} with FAITH BLY, who stands demure and pretty on [...] {{the far side}} of the table, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>an</b> embodiment of the pathetic [...] watchful prison faculty of adapting itself to whatever may be best [...] for its owner at the moment. At this moment it is obviously best [...] for her to look at the ground, and yet to take in the faces of MR [...] MARCH and MARY without their taking <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in. <b>A</b> moment, for all, [...] of considerable embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> smile {{lightened}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> for <b>a</b> {{moment as}} she squeezed his fingers.|$|R

2500|$|By 28 May several witness reports {{had been}} {{received}} by the police. One sighting of Nelson, at 5.15pm, reported {{that she had been}} with a man who was [...] "very drunk" [...] and was being violent towards her, [...] "punching her on the head". Another witness said he saw Nelson walk past his garden in Newmains {{in the company of a}} man with a tattooed face. A third witness had seen Nelson and a man of similar appearance in Newmains, and said: [...] "He just looked angry," [...] punching a lamp post as he walked past and saying he was going to [...] "kill some cunt tonight." [...] One witness said he had overheard the man, who was [...] "angry and agitated," [...] saying that he would [...] "end up killing someone tonight." [...] Another witness heard him tell Nelson: [...] "This is all your fucking fault" [...] while pointing angrily in <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>A</b> fourteen-year-old girl also saw the pair together [...] "boozing behind Newmains Asda." [...] She said he was bare-chested and sunburnt and told her his name was [...] "Rab Bayne" [...] and had [...] "asked me to rate his body, like out of ten." [...] She described how the pair were drinking alcohol that they claimed was stolen – the male drinking tequila and Nelson drinking vodka. A passer-by reported seeing Nelson with a man with a facial tattoo outside the Scotmid store in Newmains, where she was rubbing suntan lotion into his sunburned back which was [...] "red as a lobster". He said: [...] "She didn't look too happy. I thought it was a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. They must have got something in the shop, sun tan lotion, because as they were walking away the girl was rubbing something onto his shoulders." [...] A shirtless, sunburned man with a tattooed face was also seen [...] "wandering aimlessly" [...] in Cambusnethan on the evening of 22 May, attracting the attention of a family who had gathered to watch the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on television. One of the group said: [...] "What attracted attention was his hairstyle and his back was very, very red from the sun." [...] Police also received information that Robert Bayne had telephoned an acquaintance on 24 May and asked for help to [...] "batter" [...] the last people to see Nelson. Crucially, the call was made before the body had been identified. The witness said: [...] "He asked me to help him batter [...] I don't know why he said this because we didn't know it was Zoe who was found." ...|$|E
60|$|She did {{not look}} at Lewisham, but before her, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> white misery.|$|E
60|$|Miss Temple looked {{somewhat}} demure, {{turned away}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> little, but said nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>a</b> {{sufficient}} answer, and he {{drew her}} down to him.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the tension}} of the girl relaxed. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> showed <b>a</b> rebirth of soul.|$|R
60|$|Heyst {{told her}} that he thought she could do a little better than that, if it was only a {{question}} of getting out of the world. She looked at him with special attention, and with a puzzled expression which gave to <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>an</b> air of innocence.|$|R
60|$|The girl-wife studied <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> {{moment and}} then dropped her hand and hurried after her mother.|$|E
60|$|Her glance was now eager, her lip tremulous, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> little pale. She leant towards him.|$|E
60|$|She shrank {{a little}} {{back for a}} moment. There flashed across <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> quiver, as though of pain.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> with <b>a</b> sudden intensity--a pretty face enough, flushed and earnest.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> for <b>a</b> moment shone. Then {{she looked}} down at her gown. He laughed.|$|R

60|$|Dora {{looked at}} her in surprise, and the flush on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{subsided}} <b>a</b> little.|$|R
60|$|The slight anxiety {{passed from}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> like <b>a</b> cloud. <b>Her</b> smile was {{positively}} brilliant.|$|R
60|$|A last {{gleam of}} her old energy flickered up in <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> like <b>a</b> dying flame.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. McFarlane {{met him at}} the hitching-bar, and it {{required}} but a glance for him to read in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> troubled state of mind.|$|E
60|$|Akoon gritted his teeth. The {{young men}} took El-Soo by the arms. She did not resist, and was led, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> sullen flame, to Porportuk.|$|E
60|$|Tua hid {{her eyes}} in her hands for a moment, then she glanced up {{and there was another}} look upon <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>a</b> strange, new look.|$|E
60|$|He stood up, held <b>her</b> <b>face</b> for <b>a</b> moment {{between his}} hands, {{and kissed her}} forehead.|$|R
