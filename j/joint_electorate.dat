6000|$|Then {{there is}} the {{question}} of the joint electorate--what is called the mixed electoral college. I was very glad to read this paragraph in the paper that you were good enough to send to me. You recognise the very principle that was at the back of our minds, when we came to the conclusion about mixed electoral college. You say:--"In common with other well-wishers of India, the Committee look forward to a time when the development of a true spirit of compromise, or the fusion of the races, may make principles indicated by his Lordship capable of practical application without sacrificing the interests of any of the nationalities, or giving political ascendency to one to the disadvantage of the others. But the Committee venture to think that, however ready the country may be for constitutional reforms, the interests of the two great communities of India must be considered and dealt with separately." [...] Therefore, to begin with, the difference between us in principle about the <b>joint</b> <b>electorate</b> is only this: we are guilty of nothing worse than that we were premature, in the views of these gentlemen--we were impatient idealists. You say to me, [...] "It is very fine; we hope it will all come true; but you are premature; we must wait." [...] Still, though premature, I observe that your own suggestion in one of those papers adopts and accepts the principle of the scheme outlined in our despatch. It is quite true to say, [...] "Oh, but you are vague in your despatch." [...] Yes, a despatch is not a Bill. A Minister writing a despatch does not put in all the clauses and sections and subsections and schedules. It is the business of a Minister composing a despatch like mine of November 27, 1908, to indicate only general lines--general enough to make the substance and body of the scheme intelligible, but still general. I should like to say a word about the despatch. It is constantly assumed that in the despatch we prescribed and ordered the introduction of the joint electoral college. If any of you will be good enough to look at the words, you will find that no language of that sort--no law of the Medes and Persians--is to be found in it. If you refer to paragraph 12 you will see that our language is this:-- ...|$|E

40|$|M. C. Rajah, a {{prominent}} Dalit leader of South India emerged {{even before the}} rise of B. R. Ambedkar asnational leader. Certainly, he was a pioneer to B. R.

He was the architect of the Rajah-Moonji pact whichonce he thought that it would solve the woes of the Depressed Classes and they would attain social equality in parwith caste Hindus in the passage of time. This fact favoured <b>joint</b> <b>electorates</b> for Depressed Classes. Like this Pact,Poona Pact, signed between Gandhi and Ambedkar also favoued <b>joint</b> <b>electorates</b> for Depressed Classes. Hence theRajah-Moonje Pact was a precursor for the Poona Pact, the Magna Carta of Depressed Classes. M. C. Rajah who hadbeen fervently criticizing Gandhi and Congress party throughout his political career suddenly became moderatetowards them in the wake of Round Table Conferences. When Mahatma Gandhi christened the Depressed Class as'Harijans', it was M. C. Rajah who directly quarreled against Gandhi, and refused to accept the term 'Harijan'. WhenGandhi claimed that he was the only champion to safeguard the rights of Harijans, Both M. C. Rajah andB. R. Ambedkar were the front rank leaders of India who laid firm foundation for the elevation of DepressedClasses in India. They were the 'Messiahs of the lakhs and lakhs of the Depressed Class population'...|$|R

Pakistan ended its dominion status and adopted a republican constitution in 1956, which proclaimed an Islamic republic. The populist leader H. S.

5000|$|A {{number of}} seats in the Parliament of India, State Assemblies, Municipalities and Village level {{institutions}} are reserved for Dalits or Scheduled Castes (SC) and Adivasis or Scheduled Tribes (ST). The election of SC and ST candidates is by a <b>Joint</b> or mixed <b>electorate,</b> which includes all castes, even though the SC/Dalits and ST/Adivasis {{may be in a}} minority in the constituency [...] This system was introduced by the Constitution of India in 1950 and was supposed to be in place for the first 10 years, to ensure participation in politics by these groups which were deemed weak and needing special protection [...]|$|R
50|$|India has {{seats in}} the Parliament of the country, State Assemblies, Local Municipal Bodies and Village level {{institutions}} reserved for untouchable castes, also called Dalits or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The election of Untouchables and Tribes candidates is by a <b>Joint</b> or mixed <b>electorate,</b> which includes all castes. Out of 543 constituencies in India's parliament, a total of 131 seats (18.42%) are Reserved or blocked for Representatives from Scheduled Castes (84) and Scheduled Tribes (47) only. This is different from separate electorate practiced in other countries. Many Indian states, like Kerala and Bihar, have parliamentary reserved seats for the Anglo-Indian community, as does the Lok Sabha.|$|R

He was also affiliated with the National Commission for Justice and Peace and was instrumental in leading the fourteen-year campaign that led to the restoration of Pakistan's <b>joint</b> <b>electorate</b> system in 2002.|$|E
50|$|The Constitution of the Free State of Bengal {{would provide}} for {{election}} to the Bengal Legislature {{on the basis of}} a <b>joint</b> <b>electorate</b> and adult franchise, with reservation of seats proportionate to the population among Hindus and Muslims. The seats set aside for Hindus and Scheduled Caste Hindus would be distributed amongst them in proportion to their respective population, or in such manner as may be agreed among them. The constituencies would be multiple constituencies and the votes would be distributive and not cumulative. A candidate who got the majority of the votes of his own community cast during the elections and 25 percent of the votes of the other communities so cast, would be declared elected. If no candidate satisfied these conditions, that candidate who got the largest number of votes of his own community would be elected.|$|E
50|$|Again, in the Round Table Conferences in 1930-32, {{the concept}} of {{separate}} electorates for the so-called Untouchables (now called Dalits) was raised by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, {{as a way to}} ensure sufficient representation for the minority Dalits, in government. This provision was strongly opposed by Gandhi {{on the grounds that the}} move would disintegrate Hindu society. If the Dalits were given a separate electorate, then certain constituencies would have been reserved for them, and only the Dalits would have been able to vote for the candidates contesting those seats, thus alienating the rest of the Hindus. Finally, a compromise was reached with Ambedkar and Gandhi with the Poona Pact in which the parties agreed that certain constituencies would be reserved for the Dalits, where the Dalits could elect 4 candidates per constituency who would then be candidates for election by the <b>joint</b> <b>electorate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Pakistan {{came into}} being in August, 1947 with the {{marginal}} characteristics of a developed polity. Despite the apparent existence of disagreeable political phenomena all the components of Parliamentary democracy, {{and for that matter}} a developed polity, were beginning to surface in Pakistan as the year 1958 wore on and a general election was becoming imminent. The first significant index of political development was Pakistan's achieving a general ideological consensus and resolution of regional cleavages in the country. On the question of integrative institution - building, the amalgamation of all units of West Pakistan into one unified province was a political landmark. The formula of parity between the two wings in all matters and the machineries for implanting it were am. The period 1956 - 1958 witnessed further strengthening of institutions which were created. The one-unit scheme was further solidified. The edges of centre fugal forces were blunted, and the grievances of the former smaller units of West Pakistan were attended to. The regionalism of East Pakistan, comparatively. speaking, was dwindling. The controversy over was also finally solved with the ushering of a <b>joint</b> <b>electorate</b> system. It can he thus maintained that within the period 1954 - 1958, the regional and ideological cleavages were greatly resolved paving the way for a " Common value orientation " - the desideratum for a developed polity. Also there occurred significant change in the political-system, in that the early domination of the Services was: on the wane. The Hindus which were looked upon with jaundiced eye in the early period were given a sense of partnership with the majority community in the use of political power. Similarly, the parliament in the period 1956 - 1958 made some headway towards the right direction. What is more, the trends, were identifiable in that, the two parties namely, the M. L. and A. L. were emerging as the two major political parties of Pakistan. Despite all these achievements towards political development, Pakistan could not retain the parliamentary apparatus on the Westminster model, for; some small | group of people who happened to have their fingers on the triggers of power, had no loyalty to democratic institutions and sabotaged the working of the parliamentary government in Pakistan...|$|E
