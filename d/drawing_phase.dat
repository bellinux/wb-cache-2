50|$|Gameplay — The game starts by {{a chosen}} player (if the first game) or the winner (of the {{previous}} game) drawing {{the first two}} cards. Each player then draws two cards until the lead has 20 cards in their hand and announces {{the end of the}} <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> by drawing one last card and discarding the first card.

More than 200 polymers have been successfully electrospun from a number of naturals and synthetic polymers, which characterized based on their potential applications [9]. The transformation of polymer solutions into nanofibers in the electrospinning process is affected by several parameters including the solution and processing condition [10].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{phase diagram}} is a {{integrated}} graphic {{which represents the}} relationship among the state of material phase, temperature and composition. It can help the researchers {{to get the information}} about the change of material composition phase species at different temperature, the relative amount of each phase may occur and the changes when the temperature changes. So the phase diagram is known as the material design guide book, map of the metallurgical workers, and the source of thermodynamics data. In this paper, the main work is that the analysis of the characteristic of the graphic and the internal correlation of the data through the investigation and analysis of the existing methods of <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> diagram, combined with the phase diagram image and data, and then propose a method to represent the binary phase diagram based on Bezier curve which achieved a simple, efficient and accurate way to represent and store phase diagram.

50|$|Any game above can {{be played}} {{with two or three}} <b>draw</b> <b>phases</b> and {{therefore}} three or four betting rounds. Triple draw lowball, either ace-to-five or deuce-to-seven, has gained some popularity among serious players. The 2004 World Series of Poker included a deuce-to-seven triple-draw lowball event, and each WSOP from 2007 on has featured one event as well. The Poker Player's Championship, which was introduced in 2010 as the replacement for the $50,000 buy-in HORSE tournament that had been in every WSOP since 2006, includes 2-7 triple-draw lowball as one of its rotating games.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{development}} of electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has become {{a powerful tool for}} characterizing the local crystallography of bulk materials at the nanoscale. Although EBSD is now a well-established characterization method in materials science, it has rarely been used in art and archaeology, and nearly exclusively in metallic materials. However, EBSD could also be exploited to characterize ancient materials and to highlight their local crystallography (e. g., in the study of natural or artificial pigments). We discuss the potential of EBSD, as outlined in studies and from its application with an ancient material - Egyptian blue - in identification of crystalline phases, <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> maps, and the extraction of several microstructural parameters (e. g., the grain size and the aspect-ratio distribution of phases).

40|$|Background Chronic {{hypoxemia}} has {{deleterious effects}} on psychomotor function {{that can affect}} daily life. There are no clear results regarding short term therapy with low concentrations of O 2 in hypoxemic patients. We seek to demonstrate, by measuring the characteristics of drawing, these effects on psychomotor function of hypoxemic patients treated with O 2. Methods Eight patients (7 / 1) M/F, age 69. 5 (9. 9) yr, mean (SD) with hypoxemia (Pa O 2 62. 2 (6. 9) mmHg) performed two drawings of pictures. Tests were performed before and after 30 min breathing with O 2. Results Stroke velocity increased after O 2 for the house drawing (i. e. velocity 27. 6 (5. 5) mm/s basal, 30. 9 (7. 1) mm/s with O 2, mean (SD), p < 0. 025, Wilcoxon test). The drawing time ‘down’ or fraction time the pen is touching the paper during the <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> decreased (i. e. time down 20. 7 (6. 6) s basal, 17. 4 (6. 3) s with O 2, p < 0. 017, Wilcoxon test). Conclusions This study shows that in patients with chronic hypoxemia, {{a short period of}} oxygen therapy produces changes in psychomotor function that can be measured by means of drawing analysis.

40|$|Several {{researches}} {{had worked}} {{on the development of}} sketch interpreters. However, very few of them gave a complete cycle of the sketch interpreter which can be used to transform an engineering sketch to a valid solid object. In this paper, a framework of the complete cycle of the sketch interpreter is presented. The discussion in this paper will stress out on the usage of line labelling and graph coloring application in the validation of two dimensional (2 D) line <b>drawing</b> <b>phase.</b> Both applications are needed to determine whether the given 2 D line drawing represent possible or impossible object. In 2008, previous work by Matondang et al., has used line labelling algorithm to validate several 2 D line drawings. However, the result shows that line labelling algorithm itself, is not adequate, as the algorithm does not have a validation technique for the result. Therefore, in this research study, {{it is going to be}} shown that if a 2 D line drawing is valid as a possible object by using the line labelling algorithm, then it can be colored using graph coloring concept with a determine-able minimum numbers of color needed. This is equal in vice versa. By that way, it is said that the 2 D line drawings is valid. The expected output from this phase is a valid-labeled of 2 D line drawing with differen...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{scribbling}} stage of drawing has been historically regarded as meaningless and transitional, {{a sort of}} prelude to the actual <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> of childhood, recent studies have begun to re-evaluate this important moment of a child's development and find meaning in what was once considered mere motor activity and nothing more. The present study analyzes scribbling in all its subphases and discovers a clear intention behind young children's gestures. From expressing the dynamic qualities of an object and the child's relationship with it, to gradually reducing itself to a simple contour of a content no more alive on the paper, {{but only in the}} child's own imagination, we trace the evolution of the line as a tool that toddlers use to communicate feelings and intentions to the world that surrounds them. We will provide a selected number of graphical examples that are representative of our theory. These drawings (13 in total) were extracted from a much wider sample derived from our studies on children's graphical-pictorial abilities, conducted on children aged 0 to 3 years in various Italian nurseries. Our results appear to indicate that scribbling evolves through a series of stages, and that early graphical activity in children is sparked and maintained by their relationship with their caregivers and the desire to communicate with them...|$|E
40|$|The failure {{mechanism}} of a propellant consisting of hydroxyl terminated poly-butadiene filled with ammonium perchlorate and aluminum (HTPB/AP/Al) {{was determined by}} performing in-situ uniaxial tensile tests in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental test plan contained uniaxial tensile test experiments performed at room temperature (25 Â°C) at three different strain rates (30, 150 and 750 μm min− 1). The in-situ images and in-situ videos collected by the SEM were correlated with the stress-strain diagrams created with the tensile experiments, in order to relate the {{failure mechanism}} to the features found in the stress-strain diagram. No significant strain rate dependency of the failure mechanism was observed when working with strain rates up to 750 μm min− 1 and working at room temperature. The stress-strain diagram showed indications of existing cracks and voids opening up prior {{to the creation of}} new cracks and/or voids in the sample, debonding of binder with AP particles as well as nucleation and coalescence of voids. On the fracture surfaces of the samples, it was apparent that the binder cleanly separated from the large AP particles but had a better bond with the aluminum particles. However, a difference in the appearance of a short <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> in the stress-strain diagram of the propellant is observed at different strain rates. The presented results clearly demonstrate the major advantage of the combination of microscopic tensile tests with microscopic observations, linking the stress-strain behavior to the mechanical deformation processes taking place in these propellant samples at the microscopic level...|$|E
40|$|Important {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) {{properties of}} five (5) different core sizes Ge-doped optical fibers {{have been studied}} to develop new TL material with better response. These are drawn from same preform applying different speed and tension during <b>drawing</b> <b>phase</b> to produce Ge-doped optical fibers with five (5) different core sizes. The results of the investigations are also compared with most commonly used standard TLD- 100 chips (LiF:Mg,Ti) and commercial multimode Ge-doped optical fiber (Yangtze Optical Fiber, China). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and EDX analysis of the fibers are also performed to map Ge distribution across the deposited region. Standard Gamma radiation source in SSDL (Secondary Standard Dosimetry Lab) was used for irradiation covering dose range from 1 Gy to 10 Gy. The essential dosimetric parameters that have been studied are TL linearity, reproducibility and fading. Prior to irradiation all samples ∼ 0. 5 cm length are annealed at temperature of 400 °C for 1 hour period to standardize their sensitivities and background. Standard TLD- 100 chips are also annealed for 1 hour at 400 °C and subsequently 2 hours at 100 °C to yield the highest sensitivity. TL responses of these fibers show linearity over a wide gamma radiation dose that is an important property for radiation dosimetry. Among all fibers used in this study, 100 μm core diameter fiber provides highest response that is 2. 6 times than that of smallest core (20 μm core) optical fiber. These fiber-samples demonstrate better response than commercial multi-mode optical fiber and also provide low degree of fading about 20 % {{over a period of}} fifteen days for gamma radiation. Effective atomic number (Zeff) is found in the range (13. 25 to 13. 69) which is higher than soft tissue (7. 5) however within the range of human-bone (11. 6 - 13. 8). All the fibers can also be re-used several times as a detector after annealing. TL properties of the Ge-doped optical fibers indicate promising applications in ionizing radiation dosimetry...|$|E
