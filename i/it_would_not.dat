5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be the speed of photons.|$|E

5|$|The {{route through}} the station will be busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be {{diverted}} via Herne Hill– an additional four trains per hour in both directions. This {{is due to}} the redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be possible for the 12-car peak trains to call at Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
