He {{returned}} to the USA with his wife in 1949, apparently because the Communist government forced them out of China.

25|$|Ozerov lengthily dwelt on the {{question}} who would be cast as Zhukov, until the Marshal himself aided him, telling <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> star of The Chairman. Thus, Mikhail Ulyanov received the role. Ivan Konev was irritated by Yuri Leghkov, who depicted {{him in the first}} two parts. He demanded Ozerov would replace him with someone else, complaining the actor was constantly bothering him with questions. Vasily Shukshin was called to substitute Leghkov.|$|E
25|$|There, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{case of a}} uniformly {{accelerated}} box not in a gravitational field, {{and noted}} {{that it would be}} indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks {{at the top of a}} box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.|$|E

25|$|According {{to early}} Muslim historians, towns that {{surrendered}} without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims {{were allowed to}} retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques. One of the earliest examples {{of these kinds of}} conversions was in Damascus, Syria, where in 705 Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I bought the church of St. John from the Christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, When He was left in Africa, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> laws of the world and studied them. Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.|$|E
500|$|After the performance, Epstein and Taylor {{went into}} the {{dressing}} room (which he later described as being [...] "as big as a broom cupboard") {{to talk to the}} group.

[...] Epstein replied with, [...] "We just popped in to say hello. I enjoyed your performance." [...] He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, said, [...] "Well done, then, goodbye", and left. Epstein and Taylor went to Peacock's restaurant in Hackins Hey for lunch, and during the meal Epstein asked Taylor what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> group. Taylor replied that he honestly thought they were [...] "absolutely awful", but there was something [...] "remarkable" [...] about them.

[...] Later, when Epstein was paying the bill, he grabbed Taylor's arm and said, [...] "Do you think I should manage them?" ...|$|E
500|$|Olinda's {{position}} was precarious. [...] "He lacked {{the character and}} skills to impose his authority, while the attempts he did make to take control were seen as presumptuous, a usurpation of a position belonging to the emperor alone." [...] The [...] "generation of politicians {{who had come to}} power in the 1830s, following upon the abdication of Pedro I, had learned from bitter experience the difficulties and dangers of government. By 1840 they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] The Liberals took the dispute over lowering the age of majority directly to the populace, inciting them to place pressure on the politicians. The Brazilian people supported lowering the age of majority and a popular song was heard in the streets: [...] "We want Pedro the Second,/ Although he is not of age;/ The nation excuses the law,/ and long live the majority!" [...] As emperor, Pedro II [...] "was the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland [...] This position gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent." [...] The Conservatives werenâ€™t opposed to the Liberal plan, and both (including the regent himself, who would inevitably lose his office) wished to end the regency. Olinda asked Pedro II what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue of majority, and he simply answered, [...] "I have not thought about that," [...] and continued, [...] "I have already heard about it, but I have not given it any attention." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cross Cafe in Mumbai was {{formerly}} Hitler's Cross cafe. The business sought {{to attract attention}} by using the Hitler theme, and was decorated with Nazi imagery.

However, from what I know about Hitler, I find this name rather amusing." [...] Alternative names suggested included Stalin Samosa Shop, Ayatollah Khomeini's Falafels, and Kim Jong's Juicy Juice.|$|E

2500|$|Wendell Potter {{admitted}} {{that while he}} was working as Head of Corporate Communications at CIGNA, the health insurance industry umbrella agency America's Health Insurance Plans had developed a campaign to discredit Michael Moore and the movie. When asked what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film Potter said that [...] "I thought that he {{hit the nail on the}} head with his movie.

2500|$|In {{response}} to an interviewer who asked Schnitzler what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> critical view that his works all seemed to treat the same subjects, he replied, [...] "Iwrite of love and death. What other subjects are there?" [...] Despite his seriousness of purpose, Schnitzler frequently approaches the bedroom farce in his plays (and {{had an affair with}} one of his actresses, Adele Sandrock). Professor Bernhardi, a play about a Jewish doctor who turns away a Catholic priest in order to spare a patient the realization that she is on the point of death, is his only major dramatic work without a sexual theme.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the National Science Foundation, Steven Vogt was asked what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> chances of life existing on Gliese 581g.

Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say that... the chances of life on this planet are 100%. I have almost no doubt about it."

2500|$|On 24 April {{after these}} weeks of debate over who would {{run for the}} presidency, foreign {{minister}} Abdullah GÃ¼l was put forward as the only candidate. Jonathan Rugman, a British reporter in Turkey for the Guardian, had published an article on 27 November 1995 following an interview with Abdullah GÃ¼l, who was then {{a member of the}} Welfare Party and made remarks such as [...] "the Republican Era is over" [...] Immediately following the announcement, a group of 14 people was arrested for gathering to protest his candidacy in front of the Ã‡ankaya Palace (the presidential complex). After the arrest, smaller groups also gathered, chanting [...] "if carrying the Turkish flag is a crime, take us too" [...] (...) [...] Drivers passing by reportedly showed support by waving flags from their cars. A similar protest took place in KuÄŸulu park. When asked about this at a reception, General Ergin Saygun responded by quoting the [...] 12 April speech of YaÅŸar BÃ¼yÃ¼kanÄ±t.

2500|$|On September 29, 2010, astronomers {{using the}} Keck Observatory {{proposed}} two additional planets, Gliese 581f and Gliese 581g, both in nearly circular orbits based on {{analysis of a}} combination of data sets from the HARPS and HIRES instruments. The proposed planet Gliese 581f was thought to be a 7 Earth-mass planet in a 433-day orbit and too cold to support liquid water. The candidate planet Gliese 581g attracted more attention: nicknamed Zarmina by one of its discoverers, the predicted mass of Gliese 581g was between 3 and 4 Earth-masses, with an orbital period of 37 days. The orbital distance was calculated to be well within the star's habitable zone, though the planet was expected to be tidally locked with one side of the planet always facing the star. In an interview with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the National Science Foundation, Steven Vogt was asked what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> chances of life existing on Gliese 581g.

2500|$|The wing commander, Colonel Gabriel, {{was asked}} by Senator Stennis, what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> filing <b>the</b> false {{intelligence}} reports.
