5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's <b>fuel</b> <b>costs</b> while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E

Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen as {{a storage}} medium in {{renewable}} energy systems {{has been the}} subject of various studies in recent years. Such a system consists of a long-term and a short-term storage system. In a battery, energy is stored for short term whereas the electrolyser, H- 2 -tank and fuel cell combination is used for long-term energy storage to increase the reliability of supply. The same purpose can be achieved by introducing a diesel generator instead of long-term storage. The advantage of such a system is that it needs low investment cost. However, the main disadvantage is that it needs to supply fuel for the operation of the generator. The advantage of hydrogen-based long-term storage over a diesel generator is that it does not need any supply of fuel. In photovoltaic-wind-diesel hybrid systems, the surplus energy during the good season is not stored. In the present study, the possible sites for renewable applications are specified depending on the seasonal renewable energy variation and <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> at the site of application. The critical <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> is calculated depending on the seasonal solar and wind energy difference. The actual <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> at the site of application is compared with critical <b>fuel</b> <b>cost.</b> To find out the actual <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> at the location of application, the transportation cost is also included. If the actual <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> is higher than the critical <b>fuel</b> <b>cost,</b> the location is cost-effective for hydrogen-based storage. Otherwise, the site is suitable for a diesel-generator backup system. It is found that at present hydrogen storage is not cost-effective compare to a diesel-generator-based system. In the near future when the target cost of the electrolyser and the fuel cell is achieved, the scope of the hydrogen-based storage system will also increase and it will also be cost competitive with diesel-generator system for remote applications.

40|$|Abstract — The {{energy supply}} to demand is {{narrowing}} down {{day by day}} around the world, the growing demand of power has made the power plants of scientific interest, {{but most of the}} power plants are designed by the energetic performance criteria. With introduction of electricity act 2003, power sector has been opened to private players. Many private players have added huge capacity of power generation. This has resulted in very competitive environment in the power sector. So to run the business, the cost of generation has to be less than cost of selling power. Hence In order to sustain, in this competitive environment it becomes imperative to focus on reduction in the generation <b>cost.</b> And ultimately <b>fuel</b> <b>cost.</b> With this background the project on <b>Fuel</b> <b>cost</b> optimization is taken. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cost</b> is governed by many variables. To optimize <b>fuel</b> <b>cost,</b> optimization of these variables is essential. For this purpose optimization model for each major factor is developed. These models are developed using Microsoft Visual Basic software. All the variables that affect the <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> are analysed. Seven different types of coal were taken for analysis and their suitability, costs, efficiency, Heat rate were obtained. A case study was taken keeping blending ratio as constraint and analysis of the seven types of coal was carried out and optimized result was obtained. title...|$|R
