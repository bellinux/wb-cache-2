In this scenario we can not totally depend on the conventional power sources. It is timely to find out alternative cleaner energy sources. Geothermal is a prominent energy source which can produce uninterrupted power supply. Thermal springs of Sri Lanka are a manifestation of the earth's internal heat, and this tremendous potential of geothermal energy is not yet fully investigated for vast range of applications mainly for power generation. This research project mainly focused on assessing the feasibility ofPadiyathalawa hot springs to produced geothermal energy.

40|$|Samples from ore–bodied {{areas at}} {{different}} locations in Papalanto and Ifo in Ogun-State, South-West of Nigeria, where Ewekoro cement industry is situated, were analyzed {{so as to}} recover some secondary minerals of economic value. The following parameters were evaluated, conductivity, turbidity, colour, pH and other chemical parameters. Variations of Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, chloride ion contents, and temperature were also studied. Mineral-forming heavy metals were in the ranges Fe: 89. 0 – 1080 mg/l; Mg: 869 – 1120 mg/l; Pb: 23 – 80 mg/l; Zn: 180 - 480 mg/l.

30|$|Surface <b>geochemical</b> {{petroleum}} <b>exploration</b> {{is defined}} as the search for migrated surface hydrocarbons and their alteration products, including changes in vegetation and microbial populations [Hitzman et al. 2009; Rashed et al. 2008; Davis and Updegraff 1954; Schumacher 2000]. Microbes play a profound role on the oxidation of migrating hydrocarbons, and are directly responsible for many surface manifestations of petroleum seepage. In this context, the Microbial Prospection for Oil and Gas (MPOG), developed in Germany and used as a stand-alone technique for detecting microseepages since 1961, is based on the knowledge that oil and gas fields emit a continuous stream of light-hydrocarbon gases towards the Earth's surface [Schumacher 2000; Wagner et al. 2002; Tucker and Hitzman 1996].|$|R

By this time CFE has an extensive program of exploration in the central part of Mexico, in the Eje Neovolcdnico. In this area, several fields with hydrothermal alteration are under exploration, like the Michoac 6 n geothermal area, where Los Azufres geothermal field is being developed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Myra Falls Price deposit is a zinc-rich volcanogenic massive-sulphide {{ore-body}} {{located in}} a mountainous region of central Vancouver Island, British Columbia. High rainfall and steep hydraulic gradients limit the water–mineral contact, which results in a low solute load in the oxygenated groundwater. Despite this, significant element contrasts exist that permit the development of groundwater <b>geochemical</b> methods for <b>exploration.</b> Zinc displays the strongest and most reliable anomaly contrasts in groundwaters associated with mineralization related to the Price deposit. Statistical procedures are used to differentiate two overlapping subpopula-tions of Zn concentrations, which are partitioned into two constituent populations. A threshold value of 20 µg/l was established, which includes an uncertainty that allows up to 10 % of the background population being defined as anomalous. Zn anomalies can be further enhanced with a suite of pathfinder elements associated with primary mineralization and hydrothermal alteration, including Cu, Pb, Cd, Mn, As, Sb, Ba and U.

This study used GIS techniques to analyse and visualize <b>exploration</b> <b>geochemical</b> data, to extract spatial information from Landsat images, gravity and aeromagnetic data and to model gold potential using logistic regression, weights of evidence, Dempster-Shafer and fuzzy logic methods. Regional <b>exploration</b> <b>geochemical</b> data from various data sets were represented using the catchment method. Experimental regression analyses {{for evaluating the}} influence of Fe-Mn scavenging effect and lithological variations show that zinc is most affected by these factors. The importance of anomalous catchments and dilution effect for zinc was also evaluated using mineralization rating and productivity methods. Soil samples collected in {{this study suggest that}} there is no base metal mineralization associated with gold at Whympston area, but limited anomalous haloes around the Loddiswell Mine. Lineaments were extracted from Landsat images using the objective lineament extraction and enhancement method. A shaded relief technique was used to enhance the variations of topographical, gravity and aeromagnetic data. Gravity and aeromagnetic data were also processed using second vertical derivative and reduction to the magnetic pole. Results show structural features possibly related to faults on the processed images and highlight highly elevated magnetic anomalies over the Kingsbridge area suggesting an association with possible unexposed hornblende schist related to the Start Complex. Both descriptive and conceptual models for gold occurrences were constructed, which were then correlated with results from the inductive and deductive modelling methods used. Logistic regression and weights of evidence methods have relatively good correlations with known gold occurrences and highlight the importance of felsite in the area. However, very low weights are related to binary patterns over the areas associated with unexposed gold potentials. Dempster-Shafer and fuzzy logic methods can overcome the shortcomings for incomplete data in data driven methods. These methods allow the inputting of weights (degree of belief and membership grade) from well documented mineral deposit models without any prior knowledge of gold mineralization in the area. The deficiency of deductive methods is that there are sometimes large discrepancies between the predicted favourable areas and known gold occurrences...|$|R

The Petite Anse – Diamanthot spring {{is located at the}} foot of a small volcano -Morne Jacqueline – part of a NW-SE volcano-tectonic corridor. The Southern flank of this volcano collapsed leading to the outcrop: 1) A previous neutral, high temperature hydrothermal activity corresponding to a MT conductive layer interpreted as a clay cap of the present geothermal system. The bottom of the conductive layer displays also a doming shape, characterizing the top of geothermal system; 2) A dyke of diorite coinciding with the top of a huge MT resistive body, following the volcanic corridor, and interpreted as a magma intrusion; it generates several on and off-shore spots of magmatic degassing; this intrusive gas –rock may act as a heat source and interact with the geothermal fluid. The Petite Anse spring water is of Na-Cl type due to a seawater contribution. The associated geothermal reservoir temperature is estimated at 190 - 210 °C.

Regional geological assessment was followed by regolith mapping, surface geochemical programmes and RAB drilling in areas of transported cover. The prime geochemical sampling media were the various ferruginous lags, outcrops and lateritic pisoliths and nodules recovered from RAB drilling.

40|$|The {{development}} of ideas on modern analogues for ophiolite complexes {{can be divided}} into three parts. In the first (1963 to 1972), ophiolites were mainly viewed as on-land analogues of the crust and upper mantle formed at mid-ocean ridges. The second (from 1972 to 1984) is a period of paradigm shift to the view that the majority of ophiolites forms above subduction zones, and can be grouped as the class known as supra-subduction zone ophiolites. The third (from 1984 onward) is a period that has led to a much better understanding of what these supra-subduction zone settings represent. The realization that many ophiolites were linked to subduction resulted from a combination of advances in <b>geochemical</b> discrimination methods, <b>exploration</b> through dredging and drilling of arc-basin systems of the Western Pacific and South Atlantic, and further field studies in ophiolite terranes. The transition in ideas from a mid-ocean ridge to a subduction origin was prolonged and much-debated, primarily because many of the best-developed ophiolites had the geochemical characteristics of subduction environments, yet none of the geological characteristics (arc volcanics and overlying volcanogenic sediments) thought to characterize those environments. This in turn led to a need for a non-generic term, supra-subduction zone, to describe this ophiolite type. Since the supra-subduction zone concept became established, precise analogues continued to be debated. Subduction initiation and ridge-trench intersections are probably the most important settings, with back-arc rifting and spreading and oblique subduction also significant...|$|R
40|$|Propylitic {{alteration}} halos to porphyry deposits {{are characterized}} by low- to moderate intensity replacements of primary feldspars and mafic minerals by epidote, chlorite, calcite ± actinolite, pyrite, prehnite and zeolites. The pyrite halo that surrounds porphyry deposits typically extends part way through the propylitic halo, and provides strong responses to conventional <b>geochemical</b> and geophysical <b>exploration</b> techniques. When exploring outside of the pyrite halo, porphyry deposits {{have proven to be}} difficult to detect based simply on the presence of weak epidote-chlorite alteration. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of epidote from propylitic alteration zones around porphyry and skarn deposits in the central Baguio district, Philippines, have shown that low-level hypogene geochemical dispersion halos can be detected at considerably greater distances than can be achieved by conventional rock chip sampling of altered rocks. Epidote chemistry can provide vectoring information to the deposit center and potentially provides insights into the potential metal endowment of the porphyry system, providing explorers with both vectoring and fertility assessment tools. Epidote chemistry varies with respect to distance from porphyry deposit centers, with the highest concentrations of proximal pathfinder elements (e. g., Cu, Mo, Au, Sn) detected in epidote from close to the potassic alteration zone. Distal pathfinder elements (e. g., As, Sb, Pb, Zn, Mn) are most enriched in epidote more than 1. 5 km from the deposit center. Rare earth elements and Zr are most enriched in epidote {{from the edge of the}} pyrite halo. The lateral zonation in epidote chemistry implies that at Baguio the geochemical dispersion patterns were produced by lateral outflow of spent fluids from the porphyry center, rather than from ingress of peripheral, non-magmatic waters...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{inspection}} and comparison of lithological, topograph-ical, geochemical and geophysical maps {{is a necessary}} (and often successful) way of interpreting geological features across poorly exposed or poorly explored areas. In mineral <b>exploration,</b> <b>geochemical</b> and geophysical maps are used to visually identify anomalies believed to reflect mineral occur-rences. Outcropping mineral occurrences of a certain size can produce elevated concentrations of elements in stream sedi-ment samples, or create magnetic or radioactive signals retrievable by airborne surveys. However, if the regional data are widely spaced, and if the occurrences are small or poorly exposed, the anomalies created may be too subtle to be recog-nised visually. In such cases, statistical data analyses may help identify deviations from background variations and trends in the data. Furthermore, visually based correlation between distribution patterns on maps is often limited to a few para-meters, and multi-variable relationships are easily overlooked or not possible to deduce. Gold occurrences in Greenland occur in specific host rocks {{as a result of}} mineralising processes, e. g. hydrothermal activity, that have affected a larger area. Thus, the favourable environment for a gold occurrence may be reflected in regional scale survey data as subtle changes in certain geo-chemical and geophysical properties. If such changes, i. e. a multi-parameter signature for gold mineralisation, can be identified, the regional data can be searched for areas that might hold the same signature.
