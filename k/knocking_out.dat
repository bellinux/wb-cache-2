5|$|On Hill 301, further west, the First Rifle Regiment under Col. Hermann Balck {{had helped}} take the {{position}} by nightfall. With help from two platoons of the 3rd Company of the 34th Assault Engineer Battalion, it had succeeded in <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> the bunker positions. The regiment inched westward {{and was able to}} see the 2nd Panzer Division on the extreme west flank of the 1st Panzer, attacking the bunker position near Donchery. Several Panzers were knocked out. The First Rifle Regiment, 1st Panzer, had crossed the boundary into the 2nd Panzer's territory. They eased the 2nd Panzer's passage by <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> several bunkers on their eastern flank and succeeded in cutting the Donchery-Sedan road. The infantry also succeeded in <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> most of the casemates in the area using flamethrower teams to destroy the bunkers whose infantry failed to surrender quickly. The last bunker to surrender did so at 22:40 hours on 13 May. By that time, elements of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had negotiated the Meuse river.|$|E
5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> VLDLR.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 2006, Cotto {{defended his}} WBO Junior Welterweight title by <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> Gianluca Branco, {{who had to}} give up during the eighth round of their bout due to a {{shoulder}} injury. Cotto dominated the fight as a result of jab combinations in a card that took place in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Only New Zealand, in 2015, has {{successfully}} defended their {{title in the}} World Cup. The stage at which the defending champions were <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> has been: 1991 – SF – New Zealand <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> by Australia; 1995 – QF – Australia <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> by England; 1999 – SF – South Africa <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> by Australia; 2003 – F – Australia <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> by England; 2007 – F – England <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> by South Africa; 2011 - QF - South Africa <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> by Australia. Australia's loss in the quarter-finals in 1995, and South Africa's loss in the quarter-finals in 2011 are the worst performances by the defending champions.|$|R
50|$|Double mice <b>knock</b> <b>outs</b> of APLP2 and its homologues, APP and APLP1 {{have shown}} a strong {{indication}} that APLP2 has the key physiological role among the family members. APLP2/APP double <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> mice and APLP2/APLP1 double <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> mice each show a lethal phenotype (postnatal day 1), whereas APLP1/APP double <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> mice are apparently normal, demonstrating {{the importance of the}} APLP2 protein.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly afterward, also at Elsdorf, another T26E3 <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> a Tiger I and two Panzer IVs.

5|$|Alarmed that Mitchell {{may take}} over the Enterprise, Kirk decides to maroon him on an {{unmanned}} lithium-cracking facility on the remote planet of Delta Vega. Once there, the landing party tries to confine Mitchell, but his powers have become too great. He kills navigator Lt. Lee Kelso and escapes by <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> Kirk and Spock, taking with him Dr. Dehner, who has now developed similar powers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its thick frontal armour, {{flanking}} manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements. Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was fairly}} light, {{estimated}} at approximately $50million (2007 USD). Precipitation peaked at 14.13inches (358.9mm), while wind gusts to 85mph (137km/h) were reported. The heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} dozens of homes, and closed several highways. Trees and power lines were downed, <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> power {{to hundreds of thousands}} of customers. The hurricane caused one fatality in the State of Texas. Additionally, as the storm progressed inland, rainfall was reported throughout the Southeast United States.|$|E

5|$|Now with Jock Stein as manager, Celtic enjoyed another {{successful}} run in Europe in 1965–66, {{reaching the}} semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup by <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> Go Ahead Deventer, AGF Aarhus and Dynamo Kyiv. They lost 1–2 on aggregate to Liverpool in the semi-final, although a last minute Bobby Lennox goal was controversially disallowed {{in the second}} leg at Anfield which would have seen Celtic win the tie via the recently implemented away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|Storms {{accompanying}} Billie and its remnants brought {{heavy rains}} and strong winds to South Korea, <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> police telephone lines in Busan.

40|$|American options {{give us the}} {{possibility}} to exercise them at any moment of time up to maturity. An optimal stopping domain for American type options is a domain that, if the underlying price process enters we should exercise the option. A <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> option is a American barrier option of <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> type, but with more general shape structure of the <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> domain. An algorithm for generating the optimal stopping domain for American type <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> options is constructed.

5|$|The German Generals, in {{particular}} Guderian, were relieved that the Luftwaffe had prevented the Allied bombers from <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> their supply bridges. By nightfall, at least 600 tanks, {{including those of}} the 2nd Panzer Division which had to use the 1st Panzer Division's bridge at Gaulier (owing to theirs not having yet been constructed), were across the Meuse. The German victory in the air battle had been decisive.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy force {{took only}} {{ten minutes to}} disable the corvettes. They then began to pull {{survivors}} out of the sea, but the rescue was suspended at about 22:30, when the TA 20 {{was picked up by}} radar and fired upon. The first salvo hit her bridge killing all officers, and <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> her fire-control system. She sank close to Pag Island. Neither TA 20, nor the corvettes managed to radio news of the attack.|$|E

5|$|After moving inland, the storm's northwestward track {{brought it}} over the Louisiana border on two {{separate}} occasions, first reaching Washington Parish as a minimal hurricane. Winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees, damaging houses and <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> power to over 15,000 customers in the process. The hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strewn debris throughout communities such as Bogalusa and Franklinton in Washington Parish, the hardest-hit area in the state. Downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses, chiefly near Bogalusa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, <b>knocking</b> <b>out</b> her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel.

5000|$|In [...] "Plus One", <b>Knock</b> <b>Out</b> captures Agent Fowler and June Darby {{when they}} obtain a Predacon talon fossil at a museum. Due to Predaking having damaged the {{communication}} system {{in retaliation for}} Starscream's trying to order him about, <b>Knock</b> <b>Out</b> was unable {{to get through to}} Megatron on getting a Ground Bridge for him. The Predacon talon sample ends up on the car of a train causing <b>Knock</b> <b>Out</b> to drag Agent Fowler and June along. When <b>Knock</b> <b>Out</b> informs Megatron of this and the fact the Arcee and Wheeljack are after him, Megatron sends the Insecticons to help <b>Knock</b> <b>Out</b> claim the Predacon talon fossil. With the help of a Ground Bridge, <b>Knock</b> <b>Out</b> gets away with the Predacon talon fossil and hands it to Megatron.
