5|$|Elisabeth and her Spanish entourage <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the Bidasoa {{river on}} the Spanish border {{with a huge}} escort of French Catholic nobles on 14 June 1565. She then rode into Saint-Jean de Luz, where Catherine greeted her tearfully with embraces and kisses. During the {{reception}} ceremonies, ten of Catherine’s soldiers dropped dead from standing too long in the heat in their armour. The next day, Elisabeth made a dazzling entry into Bayonne on a horse whose harness was studded with gems worth 400,000 ducats.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, six Beauforts of No. 100 Squadron RAAF <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Milne Bay on 5 September. An {{additional}} three Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF, {{the first}} to operate this aircraft, joined them the following day. The Beauforts were tasked with providing additional support against further landings and undertaking anti-shipping missions. On 6 September, the Allied offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force, fighting a number of minor actions against small groups {{that had been left}} behind after the evacuation.|$|E

5|$|On 28 July 1915, Royal Edward {{embarked}} 1,367 {{officers and}} men at Avonmouth. The majority were reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry Division, {{with members of}} the Royal Army Medical Corps. All were destined for Gallipoli. Royal Edward was reported off the Lizard on the evening of the 28th, and <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Alexandria on 10 August, a day after sister ship Royal George had sailed from Devonport. Royal Edward sailed for Moudros on the island of Lemnos, a staging point for the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|On {{the last}} day of February 1872, two days after the thanksgiving service, 17-year-old Arthur O'Connor (great-nephew of Irish MP Feargus O'Connor) waved an {{unloaded}} pistol at Victoria's open carriage just after she <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Buckingham Palace. Brown, who was attending the Queen, grabbed him and O'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. As a result of the incident, Victoria's popularity recovered further.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing of}} his son's {{death and the}} {{collapse}} of his rearguard, Pyrrhus summoned his Molossian cavalry and charged the Spartans. In the battle that followed, Pyrrhus killed the Spartan leader Evaclus with his own hand and succeeded in annihilating the pursuing Spartan troops. After this skirmish, the Epiriotes continued their march to Argos. However, upon reaching his destination, he found that Antigonus <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Argos first and camped to the city's north. The Macedonian presence compelled Pyrrhus to pitch camp at Nauplion to the south of Argos.|$|E

5|$|As the day progressed, the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment counterattacked in the Bénouville area in {{an attempt}} to get through to the bridges. The coup-de-main force and the 7th Parachute Battalion held their position, {{knocking}} out 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through. The British troops moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the bridges. Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E
5|$|González and Olid <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> {{an uneasy}} accord, neither wishing to openly {{clash with the}} other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had {{made the mistake of}} {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of the}} Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5|$|John Dalton's {{original}} atomic hypothesis {{presumed that}} all elements were monatomic {{and that the}} atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on {{what is now called}} Avogadro's law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild animal community once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian {{newspaper}} al-Ayyam {{reported that}} Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds {{at his home}} in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret service. Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, Taher Jalil Habbush, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April Wiggin and his brigade headquarters, {{with one}} {{squadron}} and one troop of Worcestershire Hussars, <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Bir el Hamisah from Katia. Wiggin moved there {{in response to}} an intelligence report that an Ottoman force was at Bir el Mageibra some distance to the south and, with the agreement of his commander H. A. Lawrence, he prepared to launch a surprise attack. At dawn on 23 April, Wiggin found and destroyed a large but almost empty camp at Bir el Mageibra, capturing six prisoners. He was back at Bir el Hamisah by 09:00, having covered a distance of , when he heard news of Ottoman attacks.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move {{and most of it}} <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E
5|$|Retrieving his boats, Corbet {{determined}} to sail to Île Bourbon directly. By 04:00 on 12 September he <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Saint-Denis and there landed his wounded and came ashore for news, learning that two French frigates were just offshore, blockading the port. The French ships had spotted Africaine in the harbour and despatched the small brig Entreprenant to Isle de France with information of her whereabouts, although Corbet had raised flags that successfully deceived the French {{into believing that}} his frigate was Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea. The French ships were Astrée, commanded by Pierre Bouvet, and Iphigénie, formerly one of the British frigates captured at Grand Port, under René Lemarant de Kerdaniel.|$|E
5|$|Rowley, {{stationed}} at Saint-Paul {{to the west}} of Saint-Denis, received word that Africaine <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Saint Denis and immediately sought to drive off the French blockade. Sailing eastwards, Boadicea came within sight of Bouvet's squadron at 15:00 and the British flagship followed by the small brigs HMS Otter and HMS Staunch. Corbet recognised Rowley's intention and joined the attack, embarking 25 soldiers from the 86th Regiment of Foot to replace his losses at Grand Bay. The French, still believing Africaine to be Boadicea, assumed that Boadicea was an East Indiaman named Windham in disguise, and fell back towards Isle de France before the British force.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{insertion}} were considered, {{both for the}} paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using four-wheel drive vehicles, and a water-borne insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> their position. The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, {{largely due to the}} West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The German 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment {{continued}} to attack Bénouville and Le Port, assisted by their tanks, mortars and infantry. The attack caused serious {{problems for the}} understrength 7th Parachute Battalion, until the leading tank was blown up with a Gammon bomb, blocking the road. During the attack, 13 of the 17 tanks {{trying to get through}} to the bridge were destroyed. The paratroopers were then reinforced by number One Platoon from 'D' Company. The platoon moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. Numbers Five and Six Platoons also moved into positions opposite the Gondrée Café, on {{the west bank of the}} canal. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the bridges and the three glider platoons were moved back to their original positions.|$|E
