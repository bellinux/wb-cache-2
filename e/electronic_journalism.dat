40|$|Background. Providing an {{worksite}} {{fitness center}} for employees {{is an effective}} setting to increase an adult’s levels of physical activity, demonstrably reducing health care costs and elevating employee productivity. Increasing compliance and adherence among employees to consistently utilize an onsite facility remains a challenge. ^ Purpose. To illustrate if two <b>electronic</b> behavioral <b>journalism</b> newsletters can increase employee participation in a free worksite wellness center. ^ Design. A randomized control trial was implemented. ^ Setting. A large petroleum-producing corporation located in Houston, Texas Subjects. 70 full or part time employees that had checked into visited the wellness center during September, October, and November 2009. ^ Intervention. Two behavioral journalism newsletters were created based on authentic community member role model interviews. Newsletters were distributed to intervention group participants via company email. Intervention and control group participant’s visits to the wellness center were monitored via a key card check in system at the facility for two weeks following the newsletter intervention. ^ Analysis. Count variable statistics were used to identify rate differences between the intervention and control group wellness center visits. A binomial test for equality of proportions was used to identify differences between participants that {{had at least one}} visit to the wellness center compared with those with none. ^ Results. Both intervention and control groups had a baseline of zero wellness center visits. The control group had a mean visit rate 0. 441 and the intervention group had 0. 857. A 0. 416, almost one half more visits were found among the intervention group. ^ Conclusion. This study indicates that behavioral journalism newsletters featuring a role model from within the worksite population can be a cost effective communication method to improve participation in an onsite wellness center. ...|$|R

40|$|Cyber {{journalism is}} a term coined {{following}} the convergence of various traditional media {{brought about by the}} proliferation of media industries due to current influx of new technology and globalisation. Cyber journalism is made possible by the internet technology and globalisation. Cyber journalism has gained importance over the past years and new terms are attached to it – some popular ones are internet journalism, online journalism, blogs and citizen journalism. Cyber journalism is functioning as a pervasive medium along with the traditional media such as print and <b>electronic.</b> However, cyber <b>journalism</b> has created a big vacuum in journalism education and training since it is a recent development in journalism and journalism educators are caught unprepared. Whilst journalism educators are well groomed and prepared towards the epistemology of journalism education and well aware of the demands of professionalism in the real world, the emergence of cyber journalism has brought new challenges to schools offering journalism courses. Journalism educators have {{to strike a balance between}} the demands of new journalism knowledge and professionalism. Furthermore with the onset of new technologies, the definition of cyber journalist has gone beyond the realm of journalistic education. Anybody who is techno-savvy can become a cyber-journalist. The question of epistemology, professionalism, responsibility and credibility have now become an epitome of cyber journalism. This paper will discuss the fundamentals of cyber journalism and strategies in bridging the gap between professionalism and the epistemology...|$|R
5000|$|Franzen recounts his [...] "despair {{about the}} American novel" [...] {{beginning}} in 1991 during what he {{viewed as the}} media assent to the jingoism surrounding the Gulf War and the presidency of George H. W. Bush. During this time, Franzen finds parallels to his own life's ambiguities surrounding a war {{to those of the}} Brooklyn protagonist in the novel Desperate Characters dealing with the despair surrounding the Vietnam War. Franzen also notes the novel's possible interpretation that in such times literary representation may fail to rise to desperate settings, surmising that the novel may precede Phillip Roth's declaiming of the realistic novel in the 1980s. During those years, however, Franzen believed the aesthetic solution was a push towards illogical and surreal representations of contemporary culture, using as an example Joseph Heller, particularly the novel Catch-22. Franzen completed his first novel The Twenty-Seventh City in this style with the hopes that it would spark social change, but despite its being published to warm reviews, the work garnered little attention from the culture at large. Franzen found himself attributing this to the gap presented by magazines and newspapers no longer committing to book reviews in significant numbers due to the market having little use for the individual [...] "final" [...] product of writers, as opposed to more temporary and dispensable forms of entertainment. Franzen suspected up to the time of the late-Victorians, novels still had the cultural role and expectations of instructing and possibly constructively affronting social sensibilities; <b>electronic</b> media from <b>journalism</b> to music having taken both these roles, with the rise of visual media and its quick delivery forcing all recognition to a very literal level. Franzen finds these developments sharply in contrast to the circumstances and rewards of lasting attention promised in Tom Wolfe's literary manifesto, [...] "Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast". In contrast, Franzen posits that in the current cultural, media, and technological circumstances, major cultural problems are themselves cognitively reduced to surface issues for which immediate cures must be found. Franzen's recognition of these trends, along with the quick rise and cultural saturation of electronic media temporarily left him in despair as to the possibility of universal cultural engagement.|$|R
