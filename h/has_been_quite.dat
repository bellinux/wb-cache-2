However, in 2005, the responsibility for support to rural communities was given to FISE and donor funds are now channeled through it.|$|E
25|$|The {{level and}} {{severity}} of police brutality in Greece {{over the last few}} years <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> alarming and surprising. Due to recent financial crisis many austerity measures have been put in place, meaning that many individuals and families are struggling to survive. Greek citizens have opposed these austerity measures from the beginning, showing their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has increased significantly, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.|$|E

Shah Rukh Khan, {{the owner of the}} Kolkata Knight Riders (who have won the Indian Premier League twice) and the Trinbago knight riders (who have won the Caribbean Premier League twice), will now hope for a similar success from his new investment in the Cape Town franchise.

25|$|Yeast {{is added}} to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of {{thousands}} of litres) called a washback. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon Pine or stainless steel. The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as wash. Up until this point the process <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> similar to the production of beer.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{normally}} moves either in small schools or as solitary individuals, although large aggregations {{of up to}} 10,000 individuals are known in unusual circumstances. Throughout some parts of its range, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species; for example statistics from Santa Catarina Island indicate it is the third most abundant species. The biology, particularly reproductive and growth biology <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> extensively studied in the blue runner due to this high abundance in the Atlantic, and its importance to fisheries and the ecology of its environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} humanism in Marxist thought <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> contentious. Many Marxists, {{especially}} Hegelian Marxists and also those committed to political programs (such as many Communist Parties), have been strongly humanist. These humanist Marxists believe that Marxism describes the true potential of human beings, {{and that this}} potential can be fulfilled in collective freedom after the Communist revolution has removed capitalism's constraints and subjugations of humanity. A particular version of the humanism within the marxism {{is represented by the}} school of Lev Vygotsky and his school in theoretical psychology (Alexis Leontiev, Laszlo Garai). The Praxis school based its theory on the writings of the young Marx, emphasizing the humanist and dialectical aspects thereof.|$|E

25|$|Beneath {{the soil}} of Miyakojima is a Ryukyu {{limestone}} layer which is porous, highly permeable, and does not preserve rainwater. Under the limestone layer is a Shimajiri mudstone layer of bedrock, which is an impermeable rock. In the local dialect, it is called kucha. Tectonic movements accompanied by several faults have formed underground valleys, and groundwater flows along these valleys. The underground basins are divided into 22 valleys. Thus, 40 per cent of the abundant rainfall on Miyakojima penetrates the surface and quickly flows underground out into the ocean, unused. In addition, the strong subtropical sunshine evaporates as much as 50 per cent of the rainfall. The result is that only 10 per cent of the precipitation flows along the surface. Using natural water resources on Miyakojima <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> difficult, owing to these natural conditions.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, the ReUnion Street Festival <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> {{successful}} in ensuring students enjoy homecoming in an enjoyable and responsible matter. The festivale {{can be described}} as a collection of programmed events that serve as the capstone for Queen’s Homecoming. Its mission is to provide a regulated forum for students and alumni to unitedly celebrate their Queen’s pride. The festival takes place on the Saturday night of every homecoming, and offers a solution to the previous lack of programming during this time period. It predominantly takes place on Union Street, between University Avenue and Division Street, with a separate designated and confined area for patrons of legal age to consume alcohol. Since its inception in 2014, the festival has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from alumni and students who attended the event, local police, Queen's University, city staff, and city councillors.|$|E
25|$|Jung's work {{on himself}} and his {{patients}} convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep innate potential. Based on his study of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Taoism, and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called individuation, is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self {{and at the same}} time to meet the Divine. Unlike Freud's objectivist worldview, Jung's pantheism may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to our well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life with the universe as a whole. Jung's ideas on religion gave a counterbalance to the Freudian scepticism of religion. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> popular and is still treated in modern textbooks on the psychology of religion, though his ideas have also been criticized.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{antiandrogen}} {{activity of}} spironolactone, {{it can be}} quite effective in treating acne in women, and also reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered {{to be one of}} the beneficial side effects and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female pattern hair loss (FPHL). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, it should be noted that not all cases of FHPL are dependent on androgens.|$|E
