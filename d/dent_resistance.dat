40|$|Abstract: For the {{improvement}} of fuel consumption, the study {{on the use of}} lightweight material or thinner sheet have been carried out in automotive industry. With the need for the use of thinner sheet, the <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> became one of the major concern in th design of exterior panels in automotive industry. Many studies have been carried out for the <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> by experiment or quasi-static numerical simulation. In this study, the dent formation behavior is investigated by dynamic finite element analysis using ABAQUS. Dent formation may be affected by many factors such as sheet thickness, material properties, pre-strain, and sheet curvature. The effect of these factors on <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> is investigated. From the analysis following three conclusions are derived. First, <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> become hard as the sheet curvature radius increases. Second, dynamic <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> is mainly affected by bending stress rather than tensile stress. Third, the pre-strain itself do not give any guidance for dynamic <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> and dynamic <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> have to be decided considering the strain hardening and thickness reduction together. The results are considered to be reliable and useful to improve the dent damage of automotive panels.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> with {{static loading}} on a {{circular}} sheet is studied using finite element method. The effects of thickness and material strength are considered using simulated {{model for the}} sheet and for the loaded applied. <b>Dent</b> <b>resistance</b> is a quality criterion for automotive body panels which {{should be considered in}} design. It depends on material strength, thickness, panel geometry/shape. Due to the complexity of the problem, the verification of <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> of body panels is often done after the panels are formed and assembled. A computer simulation technique was developed here for <b>dent</b> <b>resistance</b> prediction, which can potentially be used in early design stages before panels are produced. Simulation techniques are discussed using implicit (FEA) for denting simulation. The attentions are focused on correlation of computer simulation and then compared with some experimental results for verification.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} assumption in {{the change}} literature is that employees typically {{do not like}} change and try to resist it. Such <b>resistance</b> (<b>Dent</b> & Galloway Goldberg, 1999; Ford, Ford, & D'Amelio, 2008; Piderit, 2000; Stanley, Meyer, & Topolnytsky, 2005; Strebel, 1996) is generally seen {{as an obstacle to}} change (Ford et al., 2008), and contributes to the generally assumed failure rate of around 70 % of change projects (Beer & Nohria, 2000). To understand why this failure rate exists, and to increase the likelihood for success, scholars have researched the cognitive readiness for change (Armenakis & Bedeian, 1999; Armenakis, Harris, & Mossholder, 1993; Rafferty, Jimmieson, & Armenakis, 2013). Fewer studies have focused on how resistance and readiness change during transition periods. The dominant models in this area are built on Kübler-Ross’ “change curve” (1969). The curve and its adaptations (see Elrod & Tippett, 2002, for a review) suggest that individuals and organizations go through fundamental losses of morale, described as anger, depression, despair (or similar terms), before moving to a state of acceptance and constructive handling of the situation, and that performance also follows this path. But {{does it have to be}} that way? Research in organizational behavior and change suggests that engaged employees show less signs of resistance towards change and are less cynical towards change initiatives (Burke, 2011; Ford et al., 2008; Reichers, Wanous, & Austin, 1997). That would, theoretically, lead to a different trajectory than that suggested by the change curve. No research was found to indicate what characterizes such a different trajectory, however. This paper builds on multiyear longitudinal studies of transformation processes in two divisions in two different companies. An outspoken ambition was to engage employees in the change processes. The companies were in different industries (telecommunications vs. health care), and the divisions had different functions (product development unit vs. factory). The study used action research methods where selected employee task forces were involved in collecting data (Beer, 2013; Beer & Eisenstat, 2004). A total of 713 interviews were performed by task forces in 11 interview processes. Data from internal performance measurements was also used to support findings. Whereas the change curve and its adaptions indicate that engagement/satisfaction levels and productivity levels drop during change processes, this did not happen in the two cases. Instead, both engagement/satisfaction levels and performance levels increased. These results occurred as the organizations underwent massive organizational changes. Reponses from organizational members (from first line employees to the level below top management) showed that members went through four major stages that we denote as general dissatisfaction, self-doubt, concern and in the end demand. The study fills a gap in the literature on organizational change by providing empirical evidence of the unfolding of organizational transformation processes, especially for the case of engaging transformation methods. The positive outcome of the change processes are discussed using literature on organizational change. A main argument is that the nature of the change processes change with the managerial approach and method...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the weight}} of an {{automobile}} is a continuous process among auto manufacturers. The "body in white" (BIW, i. e., {{the body of the}} car) deserves attention, being a major contributor to the weight of the vehicle. By virtue of a high strength to weight ratio (density smaller than aluminum) and a higher Young's modulus than aluminum, aluminum-lithium alloy sheet appears to hold promise as an autobody material. Because auto components are required in large numbers and are formed at room temperature, formability under these conditions becomes significant. Aluminum-lithium alloys acquire, because of aging over a short period of time, a good amount of strength and hence <b>dent</b> <b>resistance.</b> In principle, they can be given, through suitable heat treatments, a high formability as well as <b>dent</b> <b>resistance,</b> i. e., an ideal combination of properties. To this end, tensile properties have been determined for a number of heat treatments comprising three different solutionizing temperatures and for three aging times at each of the three aging temperatures. Considerable influence of heat treatment was observed on the mechanical properties (which in turn characterize both formability and <b>dent</b> <b>resistance),</b> such as the strain hardening exponent, average normal anisotropy, yield stress, ultimate tensile stress, and percentage elongation to failure. For each property, the best three heat treatments leading to a high formability were identified. Consequently, heat treatments that imparted the greatest formability for processes such as deep drawing and stretch forming have been identified. The investigations show that the best heat treatment for one property {{may not be the best}} for another property, calling for a compromise to obtain the most practicable heat treatment schedule. Results shed light on not only the biaxial formability but also springback behavior that is important in the BIW components. Further, the properties obtained from the heat treatment giving good formability in deep drawing were used to simulate car body fender and the S-rail using sheet metal forming simulation software PAMSTAMP 2 G. A comparison of simulation of aluminum-lithium alloy fender and S-rail with those made from steel demonstrates advantages using aluminum-lithium alloys in terms of weight reduction. Finally, based on the current oil prices and the projected demand for oil in the next decade, aluminum-lithium alloys seem to have an edge despite the difficulties in manufacturing, assembly, and joining of the aluminum-lithium components...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a numerical method of predicting both static and dynamic denting phenomena in automotive body panels. The {{finite element method}} {{is used as a}} predictive tool to assess panel performance prior to production of tooling. A custom software package has been developed to transform existing finite element forming models into ready-to-run finite element denting models, minimising the effort required to perform dent simulations.

Tearing or cracking of the outer bent surface are often very common. In this study we attempt to understand the relations between the microstructural features of the sheets and their hemming behavior.

40|$|The {{threat to}} future {{legislation}} regarding fuel consumption and emission {{has forced the}} automotive industry to develop lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The two main objectives of this industry are the reduction in car weight and improvement in safety. To achieve this, most of the panels {{that make up the}} car bodies prefer high strength materials coupled with better formability. The performances of conventional high strength steels are not sufficient. It has been found out that bake hardenable steel sheets are an excellent solution to the above problem. These steels offer good formability (low yield strength for good shape fixability) during press operations and also higher final yield strength during paint baking operations for good <b>dent</b> <b>resistance.</b> Paint bake hardening is essentially the strain aging increment found after forming and aging for 20 minutes at 180 °C. It is commonly assumed in the steel industry that the carbon and nitrogen in solution in the ferrite at the time of paint bake hardening is responsible for the bake hardening strengthening increment observed. However, numerous studies have shown that there is little correlation between the interstitial solute level and the measured paint bake hardening responseIt was tried to develop ultra low carbon steel that can provide a consistent BH increment of 100 MPa, while retaining good formability. It is to maximize the paint bake hardening increment in ultra low carbon, high strength steel sheets in a consistent and reproducible manner and hence to obtain cost savings in steel plants from improved product yieldThe focus was to develop criteria for bake hardening based on the fundamental understanding of the interaction between the strain sources- temper rolling and pre- strain, interstitial character and content, and the bake hardening time-temperature response. Characterization of the grain boundary distribution, and hence establishing a correlation between the grain boundary hardening, segregation of interstitial solutes and the grain boundary mis-orientation have been established.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} emissions {{targets are}} encouraging vehicle manufacturers to prioritise reduction of vehicle mass. The falling cost of carbon fibre is increasing {{the viability of}} lightweight carbon-based body panel systems across {{a broad range of}} production volumes. In the present work an automated process has been developed for the manufacture of random fibre preforms at medium volume production levels (30 - 50, 000 ppa). This thesis seeks to understand the influence of key microstructural parameters on the mechanical and physical properties of carbon fibre laminates produced by directed fibre preforming. The principal parameters studied are fibre length, tow filament count and laminate thickness. A statistical process simulation has been developed to predict preform density variation and the results are compared with experimental tensile properties. Experimental studies have shown that there is a notable reduction in areal density variation and consequently an increase in tensile properties with shorter fibres (115 mm to 6 mm) and thicker laminates (1. 5 mm to 4 mm for a constant volume fraction). Shorter lengths improved preform coverage and gave higher tensile strength, whilst thicker laminates reduced the presence of unreinforced areas which cause stress concentrations. Tow filamentisation has been induced by pneumatic means to reduce the mean filament count and maximise the mechanical performance when using inexpensive, 24 K bundles. By maximising the level of filamentisation both stiffness and strength can be increased by 20 % and 45 % respectively. An analytical stiffness model is presented to predict the effect of tow filament count on the in-plane elastic constants. Filament count and out-of-plane fibre orientation distributions are determined from optical microscopy and are incorporated into a multi-level Mori-Tanaka based model. Predictions are within 8 % of the experimental data for laminates containing large fibre bundles and 10 % for laminates with highly filamentised bundles. An expression for critical bundle length has been developed for more accurate strength prediction, {{based on the number of}} filaments within the bundle. Experimental results confirm that the critical tow length is proportional to the tow filament count. Directed fibre preforming has been benchmarked against other competing processes in respect of mechanical properties, weight saving potential and cost. A full-scale demonstrator component has been manufactured using a variety of carbon composite solutions, which can all provide 40 to 50 % weight saving for an equivalent bending stiffness to steel and greatly improved <b>dent</b> <b>resistance.</b> Directed fibre preforming has shown great promise for both semi-structural and structural components for medium volume applications, particularly when aligned fibres are introduced. The results from this work can be directly scaled for industrial application to provide a cost effective, lightweight alternative to steel.
