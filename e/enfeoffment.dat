5|$|Initially, {{troops of}} the {{competing}} archbishops of Cologne fought over control of sections of the territory. Several of the barons and counts holding territory with feudal obligations to the Elector also held territory in nearby Dutch provinces; Westphalia, Liege and the Southern, or Spanish Netherlands. Complexities of <b>enfeoffment</b> and dynastic appanage magnified a localized feud into one including supporters from the Electorate of the Palatinate and Dutch, Scots and English mercenaries on the Protestant side, and Bavarian and papal mercenaries on the Catholic side. In 1586, the conflict expanded further, with the direct involvement of Spanish troops and Italian mercenaries on the Catholic side, and financial and diplomatic support from Henry III of France and Elizabeth I of England on the Protestant side.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he more often sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, <b>enfeoffment</b> of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the majority consensus of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert de Clare {{was the son}} of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester – {{known as}} Gilbert 'the Red' – who in 1290 married Joan of Acre, {{daughter}} of EdwardI. As a condition for the marriage, the earl had to surrender all his lands to the king, only to have them returned jointly to himself and his wife for the lifetime of either. This grant was made on the condition that the lands would pass to the couple's joint heirs, but if they were childless to Joan's heirs from any later marriages. The younger Gilbert was born the next year, around 10May 1291, securing the inheritance for the de Clare family, but his father died only four years later, on 7December 1295, while the boy was still a minor. Because of the joint <b>enfeoffment,</b> Joan kept the custody of the family lands, and did homage to the king on 20January the next year.|$|E
50|$|In 265, Sima Yan forced Cao Huan to abdicate and {{established}} the Jin dynasty. Mindful of historical precedent, Sima Yan sought {{to bolster the}} power of the Sima clan by enfeoffing his uncles, cousins and sons. Big <b>enfeoffments</b> were entitled to an army of five thousand; intermediate <b>enfeoffments</b> an army of three thousand, and small <b>enfeoffments</b> an army of one thousand five hundred. As time passed, these princes and dukes were also given administrative powers over their lands, and also were granted the power to levy taxes and employ central officials.|$|R

50|$|Official {{positions}} (Ämter) and {{sovereign rights}} over a particular territory (feudal regalia) could be awarded as a fief. It {{was in this}} way that the House of Thurn and Taxis received its Postlehen or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous <b>enfeoffments</b> of church rights, church fiefs (Stifte or feudal ecclesiastica) and <b>enfeoffments</b> of foundations associated with an altar (feudum altaragli). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.|$|R
25|$|The {{rulers of}} Jin had {{steadily}} lost political powers {{since the middle}} of the 6th century BC to their nominally subordinate nobles and military commanders, a situation arising from the traditions of the Jin which forbade the <b>enfeoffment</b> of relatives of the ducal house. This allowed other clans to gain fiefs and military authority, and decades of internecine struggle led to the establishment of four major families, the Han, Zhao, Wei and Zhi.|$|E
25|$|The {{order was}} {{bestowed}} {{for the first}} and only time on December 2, 1616, at the great celebrations that took place in Kolding, {{on the occasion of the}} <b>enfeoffment</b> of Slesvig to the King's nephew, Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Although this was the first time the order came into use, it is assumed that it was created to celebrate the happy outcome of the Kalmar War. The twelve men knighted were all noblemen who had distinguished themselves during the war.|$|E
25|$|The deposed ducal House of Welf could {{maintain}} its allodial possessions, {{which did not}} remain part of the Duchy of Saxony after the <b>enfeoffment</b> of the Ascanians. The Welf possessions were elevated to the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg (also Brunswick and Lunenburg) in 1235. This duchy continued to use the old Saxon coat-of-arms showing the Saxon Steed in argent on gules, while the Ascanians adopted for the younger Duchy of Saxony their family colours, a barry of ten, in sable and or, covered by a crancelin of rhombs bendwise in vert, symbolising the Saxon dukedom.|$|E
50|$|In the 13th century, the Lords of Oberstein {{tried to}} gain a {{foothold}} in the villages that lay between Wolfersweiler and Baumholder. They renewed these attempts in the centuries that followed, bolstered by their <b>enfeoffments</b> from the Duchy of Lorraine.|$|R

In addition, due to immigration by Lombards and Normans, Latin Christianity gradually replaced that of the Greek Byzantine tradition.

No feudal revolt of importance arose against Roger.|$|R
25|$|In {{the course}} of the Great Reduction of 1680 in the {{following}} year the general government of Swedish Bremen-Verden revoked the <b>enfeoffment</b> of seignorial Himmelpforten to the Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt counts, so that Gustaf Mauritz Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt lost the Amt Himmelpforten to the Swedish crown. In 1681 two conventuals were still alive and received again their annuities. In 1684 the reestablished Bremen-Verden general government ordered a greater repair of the decayed former abbey church, and also the remaining convent buildings were restored to some extent, all carried out by the socage farmers. At that time the former Vorwerke were not run with the labour of the socage farmers any more, but all leased to tenants.|$|E
25|$|Confucius judged a good ruler by his {{possession}} of de ("virtue"): {{a sort of}} moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others {{without the need for}} physical coercion (Analects 2.1). Confucius said {{that one of the most}} important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of de is through a devotion to the correct practices of li. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's de include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of <b>enfeoffment,</b> toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.|$|E
25|$|In 1288 Albert II {{applied at}} King Rudolph I for the <b>enfeoffment</b> {{of his son}} and heir Duke Rudolph I with the Palatinate of Saxony, which ensued a long lasting dispute with the eager clan of the House of Wettin. When the County of Brehna was reverted to the Empire after the {{extinction}} of its comital family the king enfeoffed Duke Rudolph. In 1290 Albert II gained the County of Brehna and in 1295 the County of Gommern for Saxony. King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia succeeded in bringing Albert II in favour of electing Adolf of Germany as new emperor: Albert II signed an elector pact on 29 November 1291 that he would vote the same as Wenceslaus. On 27 April 1292 Albert II, with his nephews still minor, wielded the Saxon electoral vote, electing Adolf of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{examples}} of large [...] "multi-family castles" [...] have survived, especially in southern France and the Massif Central. Foremost {{among these are}} the Tours de Merle (Saint-Geniez-ô-Merle, Corrèze). Also in the Limousin is the smaller castle of Château de Saint-Hilaire et des Plas at Curemonte. In north and central France, too, several very large castles ended up as joint <b>enfeoffments,</b> such as the giant castle of Chauvigny (Vienne).|$|R
50|$|In 1731 Hanover also gained Hadeln, {{a former}} exclave of Saxe-Lauenburg (since 1689 in {{imperial}} custodianship), conveying it to Bremen-Verden. It took George II Augustus until 1733 to persuade Charles VI to enfeoff him {{also with the}} Duchy of Bremen and the Principality of Verden, colloquially called Duchies of Bremen-Verden. At both <b>enfeoffments</b> George II Augustus swore that he would respect the existing privileges and constitutions of the estates in Bremen-Verden and in Hadeln, thus confirming 400-year-old traditions of estate participation in government.|$|R
5000|$|The {{corpse of}} Gottschalk I, Lord of Diepholz was {{translated}} from Midlum to Wolde too.

25|$|While he sent an Imperial army to Italy, Henry {{initially}} {{stayed in}} Germany {{to settle the}} succession of Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia, who had also died on the Third Crusade. He had planned to seize the Thuringian landgraviate as a reverted fief, but Louis' brother Hermann was able to reach his <b>enfeoffment.</b> The next year, the king followed his army across the Alps. In Lodi he negotiated with Eleanor of Aquitaine, widow of King Henry II of England, to break the engagement of her son King Richard with Alys, a daughter of late King Louis VII of France. He hoped to deteriorate English-French relations and to isolate Richard, who had offended him by backing Count Tancred in Sicily. Eleanor acted cleverly; she reached Henry's assurance {{that he would not}} interfere in her son's conflict with King Philip II of France, and she would also prevent the marriage of Henry's younger brother Conrad with Berengaria of Castile to confine the Hohenstaufen claims to power.|$|E
500|$|The {{widespread}} <b>enfeoffment</b> {{of foreign}} knights and the {{processes by which}} land ownership was converted from customary tenures into feudal, or otherwise legally-defined relationships, would revolutionise the way the Kingdom of Scotland was governed, as did the dispersal and installation of royal agents in the new mottes that were proliferating throughout the realm to staff newly created sheriffdoms and judiciaries for the twin purposes of law enforcement and taxation, bringing Scotland further into the [...] "continental" [...] model.|$|E
2500|$|Since the <b>enfeoffment</b> of Count Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt {{with the}} former convent this seigniorial entity with its three Vorwerke, its socage farmers and {{revenues}} from dues and fines in its jurisdictions was called the Amt Himmelpforten. The last Convent Scribe Erich Everdt Gröning(k) officiated as administrator of the Amt between 1658 and 1663, in 1663 and 1666 his sons Franz and then Heinrich Gröning became Himmelpforten's first bailiffs (Amtmann/Amtleute [...] ). The term convent continued to be in use, but referred more to the buildings and the pertaining glebe and socage farms than to the wider administrative subdivision, also including neighbouring villages (Breitenwisch, Großenwörden, Horst upon Oste) subject to the former convent's jurisdiction and to dues to be collected.|$|E
25|$|Because Tugh Temür's {{accession}} was so transparently illegitimate, it {{was more}} important for his regime than for any previous reign to rely on liberal <b>enfeoffments</b> and generous awards to rally support from the nobility and officialdom. During his four-year reign, twenty-four princely titles were handed out, nine of which were of the first rank. Of these nine first-rank princes, seven were not even Kublai Khan's descendants. Not only were the imperial grants restored in 1329, but all the properties confiscated from the Shangdu loyalists also were given to princes and officials who had made contributions to the restoration; in all, 125 individual properties are estimated to have changed hands.|$|R
5000|$|Henry I himself visited Carlisle the {{following}} year, from October or November 1122. While there, {{he ordered the}} castle to be fortified and created [...] "several tenures that would come {{to be regarded as}} baronies" [...] : William Meschin in Copeland (where William built Egremont Castle); Waltheof, son of Gospatrick in Allerdale; Forn, son of Sigulf, in Greystoke; Odard, the sheriff, in Wigton; Richard de Boivill in Kirklinton. There is some doubt as to whether these <b>enfeoffments</b> were new or whether they were confirmations of tenants-in-chief under Ranulf's previous administration. Sharpe argues that Henry did not create [...] "the institutions of county government" [...] when he took charge directly.|$|R
50|$|In 1525, rebel farmers {{stormed the}} Steckelberg, {{but failed to}} take it. From the mid-16th century, the {{secondary}} family seat {{at the foot of}} Castle Hill in the parish of Ramholz gained in importance to its owners. Steckelberg Castle maintained its defensive role until the late 17th century, as <b>enfeoffments</b> during the Thirty Years' War make clear. Philipp Daniel von Hutten (died 1687) was the last aristocratic inhabitant of the castle, however. From this period there is also a hand drawing showing the castle in its final phase, having probably remained largely unaltered since 1509. In 1700, the castle was already being used as a quarry. It can be assumed that, {{in the course of the}} Thirty Years' War it became uninhabitable.|$|R
2500|$|Following Sima Zhao's {{death in}} 265, later that year, the Wei emperor Cao Huan abdicated his throne to Sima Zhao's son, Sima Yan, who {{established}} the Jin dynasty {{to replace the}} Cao Wei state. After Sima Yan was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Wu, he enfeoffed Xun Xu as the Duke of Jibei Commandery (濟北郡公). However, Xun Xu declined the <b>enfeoffment</b> after seeing that Yang Hu also declined his. However, he still remained as a marquis under the new title [...] "Marquis of Jibei" [...] (濟北侯). Xun Xu was then concurrently appointed as Supervisor of the Palace Writers (中書監), Palace Attendant (侍中), and zhuzuo (著作; senior writer). The emperor also tasked him and Jia Chong with drafting {{the laws of the}} Jin dynasty.|$|E
2500|$|During the Carolingian epoch, {{the custom}} grew up of {{granting}} these as regular heritable fiefs or benefices, {{and by the}} 10th century, before the great Cluniac reform, the system was firmly established. Even the abbey of St Denis was held in commendam by Hugh Capet. The example of the kings {{was followed by the}} feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever. [...] In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the council of Cloveshoe. [...] These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions. [...] The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief {{as in the case of}} any other. [...] The <b>enfeoffment</b> of abbeys differed in form and degree. [...] Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as dean (decanus), but also as abbot (abbas legitimas, monasticus, regularis).|$|E
2500|$|Following the rebellion, the Duke of Zhou {{established}} the new Fengjian system {{in order to}} consolidate the Zhou rule and to stabilize the kingdom. The vassal states of the Zhou kingdom were reorganized: Two thirds of the states were bestowed {{to members of the}} royal family and families loyal to them, while members of the house of Shang and their allies were transferred to distant fiefs where they could not pose a threat to the central kingdom. The fiefs that were given to {{members of the royal family}} were generally placed at strategic points all along the two main geographic axes of north China, the Yellow River and the Taihang Mountains. The [...] "Fengjian <b>enfeoffment</b> system would become the foundation of Zhou rule and the dynasty's crowning achievement". The rebel states of Guan, Yan, Pugu, and Cai were dissolved, though the latter was later revived. The territories of Yan and Pugu were annexed into the newly founded states of Lu and Qi, respectively. The Shang royal domain at Yin was dismantled and integrated into Wey, which was given to Kangshu Feng, a loyalist uncle of King Cheng. Meanwhile, Weizi Qi, who was Wu Geng's uncle but had remained loyal throughout the revolt, was enfeoffed with the state of Song, an ancient cultural center of the Shang people. In line with the creation of several new states, a program of rapid colonization was initiated by settling Zhou people and building new cities in the East in order to subjugate the hostile Dongyi and Huaiyi. As result, the Rebellion of the Three Guards began the military conflict between the Zhou dynasty and the independent tribes and states of the East, which would last until the fall of the Western Zhou in 771 BC.|$|E
50|$|Laudert {{was divided}} into two villages. It is unknown whether the {{division}} came about {{as the result of}} two separately founded villages which grew towards each other as in the example above, and the evidence does not support this hypothesis anyway. Far likelier is that the split was brought about by the various landholders’ activities: <b>enfeoffments,</b> donations and pledges. The two parts of the village are known in Laudert’s history as Laudert-trierisch and Laudert-pfälzisch for the Electorate of Trier and the Electoral Palatinate sides respectively. The Frankish kings, by virtue of the right of conquest, took over what had been Roman state domain, which led to many other holdings and lordly rights. The great territorial pledges of the 13th and 14th centuries to the feudal lords entailed an utter relinquishment of the economic and lordly might that attended “Imperial Estate” (“Reichsgut”) holdings, and it further saw too it that there were frequent changes in lordship.|$|R
40|$|This MA {{looks at}} the generations of twelve English, landed, settler {{families}} in medieval Ireland who lived through the catastrophic fourteenth century: Archdeacon, Avenei, Le Bret, Cantwell, Erley, Freyne, Grace, Hacket, Laffan, Marsh, Maunsell and Shorthall. These families owned land in the heavily colonised area of south Leinster and East Munster. Throughout the fourteenth century they {{had to contend with}} those natural conditions of the decline of royal government, the so called 'Gaelic resurgence', and the development of marcher customs. The first chapter aims to set the scene {{with the arrival of the}} families and their original <b>enfeoffments</b> in Ireland, and the condition of Ireland in 1300. Subsequent chapters cover those issues that were important to their physical, economic and cultural service to the king, and holding office in local and royal government: English common-law, also, was an important feature even in the liberties. Chapter three discusses marcher life and relations with the Gaelic Irish, for the Irish were not a constant enemy; they were neighbours, tenants and often relatives. Chapter four illustrates some of changes in family culture that arose ill response to their environment. At the end of the century all, except the Erley family, still held Irish lands but maintained an English identity though regionalised and marked out by many Gaelic customs...|$|R
50|$|About 1200, Kellenbach had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention. Theoderich vom Stein built a castle {{house at the}} village and {{is said to have}} been the father of the line of the Lords of Kellenbach, a sideline of the Lords of Stein (whose seat was at Castle Steinkallenfels, which still exists, albeit as a ruin). Until the early 18th century, the village was the seat of a court and administrative region, belonging to which were also the neighbouring villages of Henau, Königsau, Schwarzerden and, for a time, Weitersborn. In the 1560 Kellenbacher Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), the Lords of Steinkallenfels and their coheirs were named as lords of the court at the Kellenbach High Court. Meanwhile, however, the landlordship and jurisdiction was divided into four lordly shares by division of inheritance, sale and <b>enfeoffments,</b> so that the Kellenbach High Court was a Ganerbschaft (a joint holding or inheritance), with joint high jurisdiction. A one-fourth share of the court was held by the Amt of Koppenstein. This share had been acquired by Count Simon III of Sponheim in 1403 from Johann von Treis. The other three fourths belonged to the Knights of Stein-Kallenfels, the Knights of Schmidtburg and the Lords of Kellenbach.|$|R

50|$|Walsdorf had {{its first}} documentoary mention in Würzburg’s oldest book of <b>enfeoffments,</b> {{for the year}} 1317. It is entered there along with the whole circle of {{surrounding}} places as bambergisches Lehen der Leutersheim von Lisberg (“Bamberg fief of the Leutersheims of Lisberg”). Changing lordly masters {{in the years that}} followed determined the community’s fate, whereby its location in the border areas between the Bishopric of Bamberg and the Bishopric of Würzburg allowed it a certain freedom in its own development. As a Bamberg fief under the ownership of the Leutersheims at Lisberg, ownership passed to the Lords of Thüngfeld in 1399 and then in 1524 to Wolf von Krewelsheim (= Crailsheim). Particularly formative effects were wrought beginning in 1525 by the Crailsheims’ overlordship. They determined the community’s religious allegiance, the community structure and the community’s prosperity, turning it into a wealthy market community in the northern Steigerwald (forest). The landowner was an adherent of the Reformation and belonged to Martin Luther’s watch as he made his way to Worms. As a result, the subjects, too, had to embrace the Evangelical faith, which, however, led to decades-long quarrels with the Bishopric of Bamberg and for a time to confiscation of all lands. This also made it necessary to hold Evangelical church services in part at the castle then belonging to the Lord.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of the Shang dynasty in 1046 BCE, the early kings made hereditary land grants to various relatives and descendants. These <b>enfeoffments</b> were accompanied by a title according to the Five Orders of Nobility (五等爵位), with only the Zhou ruler bearing the title of [...] "King" [...] ( [...] , wáng). Along with the land and title came a responsibility to support the Zhou king during an emergency and to pay ritual homage to the Zhou ancestors. In the Yellow River Valley, of the earliest vassal states, the State of Cai was founded following a grant of land by the first Zhou King to his younger brother. Other states founded at this time included Cao, Yan, Jin, and Chen. The central State of Song was created as a land grant to the nobility of the defeated Shang dynasty. On the periphery, the states of Yan, Qi, and Jin in the north and northeast had more room to expand and grew into large states. [...] In the south, Xiong Yi was granted the fiefdom of Chu, which grew powerful and its later rulers declared themselves kings. [...] At this time, states (such as Yue) that were considered not as civilized were not eligible for vassaldom. [...] Around the borders of the main states lay many smaller entities which over time would be absorbed by their larger neighbors.|$|R
50|$|Schwarzerden’s name is {{interpreted}} by placename researchers as meaning a settlement area with dark-coloured, humus-rich soil, {{and indeed the}} words for “black earth” are still quite obvious in the village’s name to a modern German speaker. In 1325, Schwarzerden had its first documentary mention when Prince-Archbishop-Elector of Trier Baldwin of Luxembourg acquired rights and landholds at the village from the knight Sir Friedrich of Steinkallenfels. Mentioned in 1334 was a forest with the name Schwartzerdyn that was “propre castrum Coppenstein” (near Castle Koppenstein, now a ruin outside neighbouring Henau) that the Prince-Archbishop-Elector also chose to buy. In 1355, the knight Sir Tilmann vom Stein (Wartenstein) was enfeoffed with this landhold. The Trier landholds were {{in the time that}} followed granted to families of the lower nobility as mesne fiefs. Named as feudal lords were the Family von Rüdesheim (1439) and the Family von der Leyen (1543). Furthermore, the Knights of Schmidtburg (1517) and the Vögte of Hunolstein (1555) were furnished with rights and landholds in Schwarzerden. During the Middle Ages, the village belonged to the High Court of Kellenbach, which also comprised the villages of Kellenbach, Henau and Königsau. The Lords of Steinkallenfels and their coheirs might originally have been the only court lords in this judicial zone. Through division of inheritance, sale and <b>enfeoffments,</b> though, the court lordship was later shared by several local lords, making the High Court of Kellenbach a condominium under joint high-court jurisdiction. In 1601, there were 14 hearths (for which read “households”) in Schwarzerden, which would have made the number of inhabitants roughly 60 or 70. By 1579, the Schwarzerden villagers were still having to pay two Simmer in “toll oats” (Zollhafer) to the Lords of Steinkallenfels for using the market at Kirn. Clear from this on the one hand is an older dependence on the Steinkallenfelses, {{and on the other hand}} a certain economic tendency on the villagers’ part towards Kirn. In 1702, there were eleven families living in Schwarzerden who were subjects of the Counts of Sponheim. In 1766, there were all together 44 households who were all subject to the sovereignty of the Margrave of Baden, who was now the rightful heir to the Sponheim comital family’s territory. In the course of French Revolutionary administrative restructuring about 1800, the village was assigned to the then newly founded Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Monzingen in the Canton of Sobernheim and the Arrondissement of Simmern. After French rule ended in the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank, Schwarzerden passed in 1816 to the Bürgermeisterei (“Mayoralty”) of Gemünden in the Prussian district of Simmern, where it remained until the latest administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. Since 8 November 1970, Schwarzerden has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land.|$|R
