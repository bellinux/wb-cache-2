5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders {{why she would}} be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.|$|E

25|$|A Chinese Buddhist {{account of}} the 6th century CE {{attributes}} its creation to the god Brahma, though Monier Monier-Williams, Sylvain Lévi and others thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have <b>been</b> given the name because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> moulded by the Brahmins.|$|R
5|$|Paulinus' missionary {{efforts are}} {{difficult}} to evaluate. Bede implies that the mission in Northumbria was successful, {{but there is little}} supporting evidence, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that Paulinus' missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual. Although Osric, one of Edwin's successors, was converted to Christianity by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin's death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the region by Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrenes were pagans and worshiped {{a number}} of Semitic gods, with Bel {{at the head of}} their pantheon. Zenobia {{accommodated}} Christians and Jews, and ancient sources made many claims about the queen's beliefs; Manichaeist sources alleged that Zenobia was one of their own. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.|$|E
5|$|The army of {{the early}} Republic {{continued}} to evolve, and {{although there was a}} tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the Second Samnite War.|$|E
50|$|According to the North American Society for Serbian Studies, {{rather than}} {{connecting}} the ethnonym to the poorly known Spali, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> as per the old view, a Greek {{rendering of the}} name Sorpoi/Sorboi - connected to the Serbs.|$|R

50|$|The type {{locality}} on the specimen’s label {{was given}} as Caracas in Venezuela. However Storer, when discussing the specimen and {{the characteristics of}} its preparation, suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to derive from the Paria Peninsula of northern Venezuela.|$|R
5|$|The use {{of black}} and white is {{regarded}} as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition in Black and White. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-World War I black and white oval paintings, such as Pier and ocean, 1915. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings.|$|E
5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering {{that the number of}} castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace {{in the western part of}} the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
50|$|In {{conversation}} with radio presenter Billy Sloan on BBC Scotland's Music Through Midnight show on 5 June 2015, Grant revealed {{he was writing}} material and suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> for a solo album than another Love & Money project.|$|R
50|$|Kayentachelys was {{originally}} grouped as a primitive cryptodire {{and part of}} its own family, Kayentachelyidae. Below is the classification of Kayentachelys within Cryptodira: However, later analysis showed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> a primitive testudinatan outside the group containing living turtles.|$|R
60|$|Harold was uneasy at the {{discovery}} that there were still some redskins on the island. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> possible, of course, that {{the one he had}} heard might be alone as a scout, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that others of the tribe were also there.|$|R
5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E

30|$|This {{provenance}} service concerns uncovering hidden correlation {{that frequently}} occurs for every parameter participating in simulations. As an example, the service can find any association rule such {{that when the}} value of a certain field <b>was</b> ‘A’, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> for another field to <b>be</b> ‘B’, or <b>more</b> generally, when {{the value of a}}n input parameter <b>was</b> ‘A’, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> for another input parameter to be ‘B’. Through the service, a user can find out a hidden execution pattern of simulations in which given that a value was ‘X’ for an input parameter, the value of another input parameter was ‘Y’ in most cases. The most relevant technique for realizing this service is frequent pattern mining mentioned earlier.|$|R
50|$|Legends {{about the}} {{progenitor}} of the Kastrati say that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Drekale's brother {{who had come}} from Kuči, while Đ.

5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E

50|$|Excavations {{and surveys}} {{indicate}} that the site was not a permanent domestic habitat.

5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the phalanx {{was that it}} was only effective when fighting in large, open spaces, which left the Romans at a disadvantage when fighting in the hilly terrain of the central Italian peninsula. In the 4th century BC, the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> however, that they were copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the Second Samnite War (326 to 304 BC).|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{has nine}} or more subspecies which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Zenobia's {{territorial}} control during her early reign is debated; according to historian Fergus Millar, her authority {{was confined to}} Palmyra and Emesa until 270. If this was the case, the events of 270 (which saw Zenobia's conquest of the Levant and Egypt) are extraordinary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> that the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband, a view supported by Southern and historian , and backed by ancient sources (such as the Roman historian Eutropius, who wrote that the queen inherited her husband's power). The Augustan History also mentioned that Zenobia {{took control of the}} East during Gallienus' reign. Further evidence of extended territorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus, who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.|$|E
