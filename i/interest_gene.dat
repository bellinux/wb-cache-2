40|$|Modern {{problems}} of concept annotation associate {{an object of}} <b>interest</b> (<b>gene,</b> individual, text document) {{with a set of}} interrelated textual descriptors (functions, diseases, topics), often organized in concept hierarchies or ontologies. Most ontologies can be seen as directed acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts. Given an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent subgraph; that is, a subgraph such that if an object is annotated by a particular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that generalize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large space of possible consistent subgraphs; however, until now we have not been aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a given ontology. In this work we propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent subgraphs of directed acyclic graphs. The algorithm recursively partitions the graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We prove the correctness of this algorithm and then apply it to characterize four major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights into concept annotation spaces and predictability of ontological annotation. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies on}} {{mechanisms}} under drought stress {{have been based}} on gene expression. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (QRT-PCR) is the most sensitive method to detect the transcript of <b>interest</b> <b>gene.</b> To avoid bias, expression of the target gene is usually normalized relative to one or multiple reference genes which should not fluctuate in all samples. The most widely used reference genes are those which belong to actin family; however, many researchers make use of paralogous genes for actin without proper validation of their presumed stability of expression. If an unstable housekeeping gene (HKG) is selected to normalize the target, the results obtained may be spurious. So, we evaluated the gene expression of 10 HKGs, including 8 paralogous genes for actin, together with b-tub and eEF- 1 a in rice. For the entire sample pools analyzed, ACT(X 16280) 1 and eEF- 1 a were the most stable genes in the different stages of rice panicle development. In this study, we used ACT(X 16280) 1, eEF- 1 a and the geometric mean of ACT(X 16280) 1 and eEF- 1 a as internal controls to study the relative expression of gene GS 3, controlling grain length and weight, during different stages of panicle development under drought stress. A sharp increase of GS 3 expression (up to 4. 8 fold) at spikelet primordium differentiation stage was observed under drought stress. The shrinking of grain size under drought stress could be attributed to the over expression of GS 3 which is a negative regulator for grain size...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate and profile genes involved in the interaction between articular movement and anti-TNF therapy in an in vitro model. Murine LS 48 cells, an established substitute for invasive RA synovial fibroblasts, were cultured, stretched and/or treated with anti-TNF-alpha antibody for 24 h. RNA was isolated and gene transcript levels were determined using U 74 Av 2 Affymetrix GeneChips to identify transcriptional events. Positive findings were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We identified 170 differentially regulated genes, including 44 of particular <b>interest.</b> <b>Gene</b> expression fell into different functional groups that can be explained by RA pathogenesis and experimental conditions. For 21 genes of the 44 of particular interest, regulation could be confirmed by real-time PCR. Remarkably, we found structural as well as functional genes differently regulated between stretched cells, anti-TNF-treated cells, and stretched cells treated with anti-TNF antibody. Additionally, we also found a large number of genes that are apparently not related to the experimental conditions. Mechanical exertion modulates gene expression and subsequently cellular response to anti-TNF therapy. Results in exerted cells correspond to current knowledge regarding RA pathogenesis and underline the relevance of our experimental approach.

The simple and effective inoculation medium was composed of Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, 5 % sucrose, 44 nmol/L benzylaminopurine, and 0. 075 % surfactant Tween- 20 with pH 5. 7. The transformation efficiencies of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains AGL 1 and EHA 105 were compared with the Agrobacterium density at OD 600 = 0. 8 – 1. 0 and the co-cultivation at 25  °C for 48  h. A. tumefaciens strain EHA 105 gave slightly higher transformation efficiency than AGL 1, with statistically non-significant difference. The floral-drop transformation using the optimal floral-dip conditions showed higher transformation efficiency than the floral-dip method, but the dropped flowers turned brown and died within 2 d. Production of transgenic rice variety RD 41 by the floral-dip method was achieved using A. tumefaciens strain EHA 105 with the optimal conditions. Screening for the gusA gene by PCR using the gusA specific primers in the T 0 lines, there were 4 transgenic lines from 286 T 0 lines (1. 4 % transformation efficiency).

Auditory hallucinations are a very significant and disruptive symptom of schizophrenia affecting between 60 % and 80 % of schizophrenic patients. In this paper we have used a network-based transcriptomic analysis aiming to identify differences in gene expression between schizophrenic patients with and without auditory hallucinations. Gene expression data from blood samples drained from 30 schizophrenia patients were generated using Affymetrix Human Gene 2. 0 ST Genechips. Affymetrix Expression console was used for normalization and quality control purposes. The RMA normalization method was applied for gene summarization and then a filter applied to keep only the most variably expressed probesets (4, 508). These dataset was analysed using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) package in R. The gene co-expression network analyses allowed us to identify eleven different gene modules based on their topological overlap.

Of particular <b>interest,</b> <b>gene</b> targeting studies in mice have established PTP 1 B as a critical physiological regulator of insulin signaling and PTP 1 B knockout mice are resistant to both diabetes and obesity. At {{the start of this}} thesis, the mechanism underlying the role of PTP 1 B in obesity was not completely understood. Furthermore, the importance of PTP 1 B in cellular and oncogenic signaling was not well established. My doctoral research has primarily been aimed at addressing these two broad questions. Using leptin deficient mice as a genetic model of obesity, I demonstrate that the absence of PTP 1 B can lead to decreased adiposity and increased metabolic rate. Specifically, I showed that PTP 1 B deficient mice display increased sensitivity towards the metabolic actions of the hormone leptin. Substrate trapping studies demonstrate that PTP 1 B dephosphorylates the JAK 2 kinase within the leptin signaling pathway, and hypothalami from PTP 1 B deficient mice display increased leptin mediated STAT 3 activation. My studies identify PTP 1 B as a critical regulator of body metabolism. In order to characterize the cellular role of PTP 1 B in oncogenic signaling, I generated fibroblast cell lines from PTP 1 B deficient mice. Although, PTP 1 B dephosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, PTP 1 B deficient fibroblasts exhibit impaired growth factor mediated MAPK activation. I found that loss of PTP 1 B leads to decreased Src activation, increased p 120 RasGAP expression, and increased p 62 Dok phosphorylation in immortalized fibroblasts. Collectively this results in decreased Ras activity, and thus, MAPK activation. Hence, my findings point to a mechanism by which PTP 1 B can act as a positive regulator of Ras signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, and consequently offers an explanation as to w...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{most studies}} of genetic {{variation}} utilise molecular markers, {{making it possible}} to detect variation at the DNA level. This has greatly facilitated studies of genetic variation in population and evolutionary genetics, systematics and transmission genetics. By studying the inheritance of molecular markers in crosses, it is possible to map the markers, i. e. to determine their genomic positions. Utilising mapped markers can make studies of genetic variation much more efficient. The present thesis explores several different applications of molecular markers requiring that the genomic positions be known, using beet (Beta vulgaris) as a model. Marker maps are often the basis for mapping genes of <b>interest.</b> <b>Gene</b> mapping studies usually focus on qualitative variation in traits determined by a single gene. Such genes are fairly easy to map in crosses segregating for the trait, although the resolution for the map position may be poor unless very large samples are studied. One method to increase the resolution is to use linkage disequilibrium mapping, which has been successfully employed in mapping several human disease genes. I have explored the possibility of using this method in plants as well, taking the gene for annuality in beets as an example. Mapping the genes responsible for variation in quantitative traits is much more complicated, since the genotypes in the genes cannot be observed directly. An example of the mapping of a quantitative trait, namely Cercospora resistance in beet, is included in the thesis. Utilising a high-density AFLP map, five genes were detected and mapped. Two different topics in population genetics that require mapped markers are presented. First, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium in both wild and cultivated beets is investigated. It is shown that linkage disequilibrium is only present between markers that are tightly linked. This result has important implications for an understanding both of the genetics underlying evolution and of how to conduct linkage disequilibrium mapping in beets. Secondly, I have studied the relation between levels of genetic variation and of recombination in natural populations of sea beets. The neutral theory predicts that genomic regions of high and low recombination should be equally variable. Results of empirical investigations in Drosophila are not in line with this prediction. Several non-neutral explanations have been invoked. Our study {{is one of the first}} on this topic in any other organism than Drosophila. The results show that the same positive correlation between levels of genetic variation and of recombination as in Drosophila is found in beets...|$|E

40|$|Disease, injury, and age {{problems}} compromise human {{quality of}} life and continuously motivate the search for new and more efficacious therapeutic approaches. The field of Tissue Regeneration and Engineering has greatly evolved over the last years, mainly due to the combination of the important advances verified in Biomaterials Science and Engineering with those of Cell and Molecular Biology. In particular, a new and promising area arose – Nanomedicine – that takes advantage of the extremely small size and especial chemical and physical properties of Nanomaterials, offering powerful tools for health improvement. Research on Stem Cells, the self-renewing progenitors of body tissues, is also challenging to the medical and scientific communities, being expectable the appearance of new and exciting stem cell-based therapies in the next years. The control of cell behavior (namely, of cell proliferation and differentiation) is of key importance in devising strategies for Tissue Regeneration and Engineering. Cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors and other signaling molecules, most of them proteins, have been identified and found to regulate and support tissue development and regeneration. However, the application of these molecules in long-term regenerative processes requires their continuous presence at high concentrations as they usually present short half-lives at physiological conditions and may be rapidly cleared from the body. Alternatively, genes encoding such proteins can be introduced inside cells and be expressed using cell’s machinery, allowing an extended and more sustained production of the protein of <b>interest</b> (<b>gene</b> therapy). Genetic engineering of stem cells is particularly attractive because of their self-renewal capability and differentiation potential. For Tissue Regeneration and Engineering purposes, the patient’s own stem cells can be genetically engineered in vitro and, after, introduced in the body (with or without a scaffold) where they will not only modulate the behavior of native cells (stem cell-mediated gene therapy), but also directly participate in tissue repair. Cells can be genetically engineered using viral and non-viral systems. Viruses, as a result of millions of years of evolution, are very effective for the delivery of genes in several types of cells, including cells from primary sources. However, the risks associated with their use (like infection and immunogenic reactions) are driving the search for non-viral systems that will efficiently deliver genetic material into cells. Among them, chemical methods that are promising and being investigated use cationic molecules as carriers for DNA. In this case, gene delivery and gene expression level remain relatively low when primary cells are used. The main goal of this thesis was to develop and assess the in vitro potential of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers based carriers to deliver genes to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). PAMAM dendrimers are monodispersive, hyperbranched and nanospherical molecules presenting unique characteristics that make them very attractive vehicles for both drug and gene delivery. Although they have been explored for gene delivery {{in a wide range of}} cell lines, the interaction and the usefulness of these molecules in the delivery of genes to MSCs remains a field to be explored. Adult MSCs were chosen for the studies due to their potential biomedical applications (they are considered multipotent cells) and because they present several advantages over embryonic stem cells, such as easy accessibility and the inexistence of ethical restrictions to their use. This thesis is divided in 5 interconnected chapters. Chapter I provides an overview of the current literature concerning the various non-viral systems investigated for gene delivery in MSCs. Attention is devoted to physical methods, as well as to chemical methods that make use of polymers (natural and synthetic), liposomes, and inorganic nanoparticles as gene delivery vectors. Also, it summarizes the current applications of genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells using non-viral systems in regenerative medicine, with special focus on bone tissue regeneration. In Chapter II, the potential of native PAMAM dendrimers with amine termini to transfect MSCs is evaluated. The level of transfection achieved with the dendrimers is, in a first step, studied using a plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding for the β-galactosidase reporter gene. The effect of dendrimer’s generation, cell passage number, and N:P ratio (where N= number of primary amines in the dendrimer; P= number of phosphate groups in the pDNA backbone) on the level of transfection is evaluated, being the values always very low. In a second step, a pDNA encoding for bone morphogenetic protein- 2, a protein that is known for its role in MSCs proliferation and differentiation, is used. The BMP- 2 content produced by transfected cells is evaluated by an ELISA assay and its effect on the osteogenic markers is analyzed through several classical assays including alkaline phosphatase activity (an early marker of osteogenesis), osteocalcin production, calcium deposition and mineralized nodules formation (late osteogenesis markers). Results show that a low transfection level is enough to induce in vitro osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. Next, from Chapter III to Chapter V, studies are shown where several strategies are adopted to change the interaction of PAMAM dendrimers with MSCs cell membrane and, as a consequence, to enhance the levels of gene delivery. In Chapter III, generations 5 and 6 of PAMAM dendrimers are surface functionalized with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) containing peptides – experiments with dendrimers conjugated to 4, 8 and 16 RGD units were performed. The underlying concept is that by including the RGD integrin-binding motif in the design of the vectors and by forming RGD clusters, the level of transfection will increase as MSCs highly express integrins at their surface. Results show that cellular uptake of functionalized dendrimers and gene expression is enhanced in comparison with the native dendrimers. Furthermore, gene expression is dependent on both the electrostatic interaction established between the dendrimer moiety and the cell surface and the nanocluster RGD density. In Chapter IV, a new family of gene delivery vectors is synthesized consisting of a PAMAM dendrimer (generation 5) core randomly linked at the periphery to alkyl hydrophobic chains that vary in length and number. Herein, the idea is to take advantage of both the cationic nature of the dendrimer and the capacity of lipids to interact with biological membranes. These new vectors show a remarkable capacity for internalizing pDNA, being this effect positively correlated with the –CH 2 – content present in the hydrophobic corona. Gene expression is also greatly enhanced using the new vectors but, in this case, the higher efficiency is shown by the vectors containing the smallest hydrophobic chains. Finally, chapter V reports the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of novel gene delivery vectors based on PAMAM dendrimers (generation 5) conjugated to peptides with high affinity for MSCs membrane binding - for comparison, experiments are also done with a peptide with low affinity binding properties. These systems present low cytotoxicity and transfection efficiencies superior to those of native dendrimers and partially degraded dendrimers (Superfect®, a commercial product). Furthermore, with this biomimetic approach, the process of gene delivery is shown to be cell surface receptor-mediated. Overall, results show the potential of PAMAM dendrimers to be used, as such or modified, in Tissue Regeneration and Engineering. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PAMAM dendrimers are studied as gene delivery vehicles in this context and using, as target, a cell type with clinical relevancy. It is shown that the cationic nature of PAMAM dendrimers with amine termini can be synergistically combined with surface engineering approaches, which will ultimately result in suitable interactions with the cytoplasmic membrane and enhanced pDNA cellular entry and gene expression. Nevertheless, the quantity of pDNA detected inside cell nucleus is always very small when compared with the bigger amount reaching cytoplasm (accumulation of pDNA is evident in the perinuclear region), suggesting that the main barrier to transfection is the nuclear membrane. Future work can then be envisaged based on the versatility of these systems as biomedical molecular materials, such as the conjugation of PAMAM dendrimers to molecules able to bind nuclear membrane receptors and to promote nuclear translocation.

40|$|In {{order to}} test whether 18 S rDNA can {{influence}} positively xylanase gene effective expression in the yeast of Candida utilis, a targeting vector pGLR 9 K-XA was constructed by adding an <b>interested</b> <b>gene</b> xynA from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis into the vector pGLR 9 K which is constructed by ourselves. pGLR 9 K contains the 18 S rDNA, GAP promoter and CYH resistance gene sequence, {{all of which is}} from C. utilis. Then the vector pGLR 9 K-XA was transformed into C. utilis. To test the vector and transformed system, PCR, Southern blot and DNS methods were used. The results showed that xylanase gene can be detected in the chromosome DNA of recombinant C. utilis and the enzyme activity of xylanase is up to 60 IU ml(- 1) in the study. It is suggested that this system can be used to express exogenous genes in C. utilis as a bioreactors. This is the first report that xylanase gene was expressed in C. utilis...|$|R

The inducer-treatment of tobacco callus mediates an excision event in which the selectable marker gene and Cre gene between two lox sites were deleted. A chloroacetanilide-induced promoter (In 5 - 2) was used to control the expression of Cre gene in this system. Molecular analysis of transgenic tobacco plants showed the <b>interested</b> <b>gene,</b> b-glucuronidase (gus), was integrated into the genome whether removing has been successful, and forty-five out of forty-eight T 0 plants were transgenic tobacco without the marker gene, hpt. This system uses a single vector to circumvent the flaw of other dual recombinase vector systems. Key words: chloroacetanilide-induced promoter (In 5 - 2); Cre/lox; marker-free; transgenic tobacco Since the first transgenic plant was created in 1983, a lot of transgenic crops, such as tobacco, tomato, maize, cotton, etc., have come into the world carrying the external genes (David, 2000). Genetic transformation is becoming an im-portant tool in obtaining transgenic plants. The marker gene, a necessary portion of the plant transformation vector, i...|$|R

The use of Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG) as inducer of <b>interested</b> <b>gene</b> expression under {{control of the}} lac promoter was investigated. The optimization of enzyme induction by IPTG was determined at shake flask level to be 0. 52 mM at exponential growth phase. Enzyme preparation was performed by lysis the cultured cells. Afterwards, the cell suspension was incubated at 75 °C to denature all heat sensitive proteins in the cell suspension that have been removed by subsequent centrifugation. Finally, the clarified supernatant containing heat resistant Taq DNA polymerase was collected and stored at - 80 °C. The activity of enzyme was compared with commercial Taq DNA polymerase, which remained when stored in buffer containing 50 % glycerol, at - 20 C. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 94 KDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE and yielded appropriate enzyme activity comparing to the commercial Taq DNA polymerase...|$|R
40|$|The innate {{immune system}} plays {{a pivotal role in}} {{defending}} invasion of microorganisms for scallops. Previous studies on immune-related genes in the Yesso scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis (Jay, 1857) have mainly focused on characterization and expression pattern in response to bacterial challenge, no research has been carried out on the cytogenetic level yet. In the present study, eight fosmid clones containing the sequences of key immune-related genes (PyNFkB, PyTRAF 2, PyTRAF 4, PyTRAF 7, PyMyd 88 - 1, PyMyd 88 - 3, PyMKK- 7 and PyTNFR) were isolated and seven of them were successfully mapped on chromosomes of P. yessoensis utilizing fluorescence in situ hybridization. Wherein, PyMyd 88 - 1, PyMyd 88 - 3 and PyMKK- 7 located on the same chromosome pair with adjacent positions and the other genes were mapped on four non-homologous chromosome pairs, showing a similar distribution to another five model species. The isolation and mapping of such genes of the Yesso scallop will lay a foundation for studies such as assignment of <b>interested</b> <b>genes</b> to chromosomes, construction cytogenetic maps and so on...|$|R
