25|$|The band {{is not in}} {{competition}} with other Christian bands. We feel we are competing with Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon. We {{need to be aware}} of them, because the people who come to see Petra go to see those bands as well. We are being very naïve if we don't <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mind. We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mind.|$|E
500|$|On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to {{recommend}} to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who {{had hoped to}} have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten {{would be likely to}} favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence. [...] Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, [...] "That's the end of that." [...] On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, [...] "You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that {{has nothing to do with}} the business of the State ... I think we should <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State." [...] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, [...] "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Longineu Parsons {{mentioned}} in a YouTube video that Yellowcard had {{started talking about}} a new record. Yellowcard's official Facebook page announced on August 1, 2010, that the band had reformed and would be {{working on a new}} record. Regarding the direction of the new album, Key said on the Hopeless Records website on August 2, [...] "We’re talking about a ton of different ideas, and we’re itching to start as soon as possible. Ultimately, we want to make something the fans will love. What we love to do most is look out from the stage and see people exploding with energy, and I think we <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mind while we are writing. We miss being out on the road playing for Yellowcard fans all around the world, and without their support, we wouldn’t have a career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bachmann {{also spoke}} of the delegation's visit to Islamabad to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Aziz {{at the same time}} as the siege of Islamic fundamentalists at the Lal Masjid mosque {{elsewhere}} in the city. She reported that [...] "The group [...] had to travel in armored vehicles and was constantly accompanied by Pakistani military... We were all able to see extremely up close and personal what it's like to be in a region where fighting is occurring. We constantly felt like we were in need of security." [...] Bachmann told reporters upon her return that [...] "the dangers posed by Islamic terrorism in Iraq, Britain and Pakistan justified the continued American military presence in Iraq." [...] She said [...] "We don't want to see al-Qaida get a presence in the United States. Al-Qaida doesn't seem to show any signs of letting up.

2500|$|Blackman {{attended}} a Baptist church during her teenage years, but became {{a follower of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{at the age of}} 18; she also started studying Kabbalah in the 2000s. Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship. [...] "I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or not, because you have a focused intent", says Blackman. [...] "You transcend, because you're crossing barriers {{that a lot of people}} and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then you can do something good with it. I don't <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mind 100 per cent of the time – I'm human – but I try to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gans {{said that}} casting of Mitchell {{as the lead}} for the film is [...] "a matter of feeling. If you play Silent Hill you know that each {{character}} has a very special poetic quality. They are both twisted and sophisticated. We tried to <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mind when we did the casting on this film." [...] Bean's role in the film was originally kept to {{the beginning and the}} end of the movie, but due to studio pressure for a male lead, his role was expanded into a subplot. Gans cast Holden after seeing her in The Majestic: [...] "in The Majestic, she was beautifully feminine and I cast her so I could show her other side, make her strong and sleek. Gans saw Ferland as [...] "the ideal actress" [...] after viewing the television show Kingdom Hospital and her screen test for Terry Gilliam's film Tideland. To prepare for her role, Krige read the book The End of Days by Erna Paris, a book about tyranny during the Spanish Inquisition.|$|E
2500|$|Rousey {{appeared}} nude on {{the cover}} of ESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein. Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E
