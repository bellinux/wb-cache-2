50|$|Max Zorn is a <b>Dutch</b> <b>tape</b> {{artist who}} creates artwork from {{ordinary}} brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps {{as a new}} form of street art at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on acrylic glass with a surgical scalpel, the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it, mimicking the effects similar to stained glass window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei-Cycle 2013, the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in Freiburg, Germany.|$|E
