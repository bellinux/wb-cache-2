5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} have been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents {{commonly used in}} induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which have been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300nm. Here, the 18km (k was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15km sample (k was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be around 0.002).|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen in Leggetts Creek ranges from 28.95% to 236.75%, {{with an average}} of 119.27%. The {{concentration of}} nitrates in the creek was once <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be 2.50 milligrams per liter and the concentration of phosphates was once <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be 1.58 milligrams per liter. However, in 2001, the concentration of nutrients and sodium in the creek was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be the highest of tested sites in the area. The concentration of nitrates was 6.3 milligrams per liter and the concentration of nitrogen was 6.87 milligrams per liter. The concentration of orthophosphate was 1.998 milligrams per liter and the total phosphorus concentration was 2.228 milligrams per liter. The sodium concentration was 84.3 milligrams per liter. Little or no overall impairment was observed in 2008.|$|E

It thus became the first known sungrazing comet. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 solar radii.|$|E

5|$|Agnolín and Novas (2013) found Archaeopteryx and (possibly synonymous) Wellnhoferia {{to be the}} basalmost avialans (Avialae being {{defined by}} the authors as {{including}} Archaeopteryx lithographica and Passer, their most recent common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants), with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing Anchiornis and Xiaotingia being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae. Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, et al., using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna, also found Archaeopteryx {{to be a member of}} Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing Passer domesticus, but not Dromaeosaurus albertensis or Troodon formosus). Archaeopteryx was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> form a grade at the base of Avialae with Xiaotingia, Anchiornis, and Aurornis. Compared to Archaeopteryx, Xiaotingia was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be more closely related to extant birds, while both Anchiornis and Aurornis were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be more distantly so.|$|E
