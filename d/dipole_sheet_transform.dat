This procedure {{requires the use of}} a fairly neutral reference. The frequently advocated average reference creates problems because its effect is not merely to change a (steady) zero reference level, but to dynamically zero-center all scalp potentials at each latency. Ghost potential fields are thus created at the latencies for which the integral of scalp recorded potentials differs from zero. These distortions of brain mapping have been analyzed with a true 3 -shell head model in conjunction with the emulation of SEP components. In the head model, surface potential fields generated by <b>dipoles</b> or <b>dipole</b> <b>sheets</b> of various depths and orientations were computed either over the north hemisphere, so as to emulate scalp recorded SEP components, or over the entire equivalent head sphere.

The data have been obtained through accurate force and motion measurements on a laboratory fish-like robotic mechanism, 1 : 2 m long, covered with a flexible skin and equipped with a tail fin, at Reynolds numbers up to 10 ^ 6, with turbulence stimulation. The lateral motion of the body {{is in the form of}} a travelling wave with wavelength lambda and varying amplitude along the length, smoothly increasing from the front to the tail end. A parametric investigation shows sensitivity of drag reduction to the non-dimensional frequency (Strouhal number), amplitude of body oscillation and wavelength lambda, and angle of attack and phase angle of the tail fin. A necessary condition for drag reduction is that the phase speed of the body wave be greater than the forward speed U.

40|$|While {{the most}} {{familiar}} consequences of specimen charging in transmission electron microscopy can be eliminated by evaporating a thin conducting film (such as a carbon film) onto an insulating specimen, or by preparing samples directly on such a conducting film to begin with, a more subtle charging effect still remains. We argue here that specimen charging is in this case likely to produce a <b>dipole</b> <b>sheet</b> rather than a layer of positive charge at {{the surface of the}} specimen. A simple model of the factors that control the kinetics of specimen charging, and its neutralization, is discussed as a guide for experiments that attempt to minimize the amount of specimen charging. Believable estimates of the electrostatic forces and the electron optical disturbances that are likely to occur suggest that specimen bending and warping may have the biggest impact on degrading the image quality at high resolution. Electron optical effects are likely to be negligible except {{in the case of a}} specimen that is tilted to high angle. A model is proposed to explain how both the mechanical and electron-optical effects of forming a dipole layer would have much greater impact on the image resolution in a direction perpendicular to the tilt axis, a well-known effect in electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals...|$|R

However, {{the abundance of}} lithium (Li) {{is one of the}} major critical issues for using Li battery technologies. Therefore, for large-scale applications a sodium (Na) ion battery is one of the apt alternatives for portable electronics instead of expensive Li ion batteries.

Hence, in this present work, we explore an innovative concept of storing Na+ ions in reduced graphene oxide/antimony (Sb) metal composites.

40|$|Epithelial {{invagination}} is a morphological {{process in}} which flat cell <b>sheets</b> <b>transform</b> into three-dimensional structures through bending of the tissue. It is accompanied by apical constriction, in which the apical cell surface is reduced {{in relation to the}} basal cell surface. Although much is known about the intra-cellular molecular machinery driving apical constriction and epithelial invagination, information of how extra-cellular signals affect these processes remains insufficient. In this study we have established several in vivo assays of placodal invagination to explore whether the external signal BMP regulates processes connected to epithelial invagination. By inhibiting BMP activity in prospective cranial placodes, we provide evidence that BMP signals are required for RhoA and F-actin rearrangements, apical constriction, cell elongation and epithelial invagination. The failure of placode invagination after BMP inhibition appears to be a direct consequence of disrupted apical accumulation of RhoA and F-actin, rather than changes in cell death or proliferation. In addition, our results show that epithelial invagination and acquisition of placode-specific identities are two distinct and separable developmental processes. In summary, our results provide evidence that BMP signals promote epithelial invagination by acting upstream of the intracellular molecular machinery that drives apical constriction and cell elongation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a point heat source on the {{two-dimensional}} irrotational flow of a slightly compressible nonviscous and nondiffusive fluid is studied. Heat is added at a constant rate and with a prescribed spatial distribution. The Mach number M is assumed small and the governing equations are solved to order M by a generalization of the Rayleigh-Janzen expansion. The interaction between entropy variations produced by the heat source and the pressure field generates a wake consisting of a vortex <b>sheet</b> and a <b>dipole</b> <b>sheet</b> extending downstream of the heat source, and this in turn perturbs the flow at order M. A general result is that if heat is added where the gas is compressed by the flow, the impulse directed against the free stream is increased and vice versa. Cross-stream impulse is produced if the heat source {{is not on the}} axis of symmetry (if any) of the flow. This would result in a lifting force if a cylinder is providing the perturbation to the free stream. When heat is added on the downstream dividing streamline of a symmetrical flow the order M velocity field at infinity is that due to an apparent mass source and it is shown that the required flux of mass and momentum is supplied from infinity via the wake. Detailed calculations are performed for the case of the self-propagation of a symmetrical vortex pair, where heat is added downstream of the rearward stagnation point. The resultant increase in the pair impulse is shown to lead to a slow increase in the vortex pair separation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} {{method of}} shaping free form buildings composed of many original complete parts roofed with profiled steel <b>sheets</b> <b>transformed</b> effectively into hyperbolic paraboloid strips is {{proposed in the}} paper. The method uses tetrahedral compositions of various kinds connected one to another with their relevant faces contained in planes of a spatial network called control structure. The control structures enable: a) controlling structural systems and architectural forms of the complex buildings {{as well as their}} morphological systems, b) arranging regularly the roof shells in three-dimensional space, c) integrating the roof and elevation forms as well as their consistent composition into the natural and built environments. The effectiveness of the transformations consists in the fact that displacements of adjacent folds in the sheeting are big, whereas strain is small. The effective transformations affect the fold's shape {{in such a way that}} the folds are contracted in the middle on their length and stretched at their crosswise ends depending on supporting conditions produced by curvature and a mutual location of skew directrices. The supporting conditions are diversified along each directrix, so the diversified arrangement of the supporting points of the shell folds to the skew directrices has to be calculated. For this purpose, an innovative computer program was created. Because of the diversified fold shape changes, two individual shell sheeting's cannot be connected one to another with their transversal borders to obtain a smooth shell. However, many shells can be set together with their transversal edges to achieve a compound ribbed roof of medium or large span. Thus, the resultant shell roof has to be characterized by edges disturbing its smoothness...|$|R

40|$|An {{explicit}} Wiener–Hopf {{solution is}} derived {{to describe the}} scattering of sound at a hard–soft wall impedance transition at x = 0, say, in a circular duct with uniform mean flow of Mach number M. A mode, incident from the upstream hard section, scatters at x = 0 {{into a series of}} reflected modes and a series of transmitted modes. Of particular interest is the role of a possible instability along the lined wall in combination with the edge singularity. If one of the 2 ̆ 2 upstream 2 ̆ 2 running modes is to be interpreted as a downstream-running instability, an extra degree of freedom in the Wiener–Hopf analysis occurs that can be resolved by application of some form of Kutta condition at x = 0, for example a more stringent edge condition where wall streamline deflection at the downstream side. In general, the effect of this Kutta condition is significant, but it is particularly large for the plane wave at low frequencies and should therefore be easily measurable. For small Helmholtz numbers, the reflection coefficient modulus |R 001 | tends to (1 + M) /(1 -M) without and to 1 with Kutta condition, while the end correction tends to 8 without and to a finite value with Kutta condition. This is exactly the same behaviour as found for reflection at a pipe exit with flow, irrespective if this is uniform or jet flow. Although the presence of the instability in the model is hardly a question anymore since it has been confirmed numerically, a proper mathematical causality analysis is still not totally watertight. Therefore, the limit of a vortex sheet, separating zero flow from mean flow, approaching the wall has been explored. Indeed, this confirms that the Helmholtz unstable mode of the free vortex <b>sheet</b> <b>transforms</b> into the suspected mode and remains unstable. As the lined-wall vortex-sheet model predicts unstable behaviour for which experimental evidence is at best rare and indirect, the question may be raised if this model is indeed a consistent simplification of reality, doing justice to the double limit of small perturbations and a thin boundary layer. Numerical time-domain methods suffer from this instability and {{it is very important to}} decide whether the instability is at least physically genuine. Experiments based on the present problem may provide a handle to resolve this stubborn question...|$|R
40|$|Cranial placodes are {{transient}} thickenings of the vertebrate embryonic head ectoderm {{that will}} give rise to sensory (olfactory, lens, and otic) and non-sensory (hypophyseal) components of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In most vertebrate embryos, these four sensory placodes undergo invagination. Epithelial invagination is a morphological process in which flat cell <b>sheets</b> <b>transform</b> into three-dimensional structures, like an epithelial pit/cup. The process of invagination is crucial during development as it {{plays an important role}} for the formation of the lens, inner ear, nasal cavity, and adenohypophysis. Using the chick as the model system the following questions were addressed. What signals are involved in placode invagination? Is there any common regulatory molecular mechanism for all sensory placode invagination, or is it controlled by unique molecular codes for each individual placode? Are placode invagination and acquisition of placode-specific identities two independent developmental processes or coupled together? To address this we used in vivo assays like electroporation and whole embryo culture. Our in vivo results provide evidence that RhoA and F-actin rearrangements, apical constriction, cell elongation and epithelial invagination are regulated by a common BMP (Bone morphogenetic protein) dependent molecular mechanism. In addition, our results show that epithelial invagination and acquisition of placode-specific identities are two independent developmental processes. BMP signals {{have been shown to be}} essential for lens development and patterning of the retina. However, the spatial and temporal requirement of BMP activity during early events of lens development has remained elusive. Moreover, when and how retinal cells are specified, and whether the lens plays any role for the early development of the retina is not completely known. To address these questions, we have used gain- and loss-of-function analyses in chick explant and intact embryo assays. Here, we show that during lens development BMP activity is both required and sufficient to induce the lens specific marker, L-Maf. After the L-Maf upregulation the cells are no longer dependent on BMP signaling for the next step of fiber cell differentiation, which is characterized by up-regulation of δ-crystallin expression. Regarding the specification of retinal cells our results provide evidence that at blastula stages, BMP signals inhibit the acquisition of eye-field character. Furthermore, from optic vesicle stages, BMP signals emanating from the lens are essential for maintaining eye-field identity, inhibiting telencephalic character and inducing neural retina cells...|$|R
