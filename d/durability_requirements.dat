50|$|To reduce {{component}} size, weight, <b>durability</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{and most}} importantly, cost, the magnetic circuit must be optimized to deliver more {{energy to the}} projectile for a given energy input. This has been addressed to some extent {{by the use of}} back iron and end iron, which are pieces of magnetic material that enclose the coil and create paths of lower reluctance in order to improve the amount of magnetic flux coupled into the projectile. Results can vary widely, depending on the materials used; hobbyist designs may use, for example, materials ranging anywhere from magnetic steel (more effective, lower reluctance) to video tape (little improvement in reluctance). Moreover, the additional pieces of magnetic material in the magnetic circuit can potentially exacerbate the possibility of flux saturation and other magnetic losses.|$|E

40|$|Normally in {{reinforced}} concrete structures, the reinforcing steel is well protected against corrosion by concrete. The reinforcing steel remains passive under high alkalinity. However, the highly desirable <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> {{is not always}} achieved in practice due to various environmental factors. Corrosion of reinforcement in concrete is a common cause of deterioration in many RC structures. Two main cause of corrosion of reinforcement in concrete are: Carbonation and presence of Chloride ions. Carbonation {{is the result of}} the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere and alkaline hydroxides in the concrete. The rate of carbonation depends on the thickness of the concrete cover and also on its quality in terms of the mixing ratios that achieve the highest quality. The relative humidity and temperature mainly affects the carbonation of concrete. Permeability, nature and intensity of cracks, and cover thickness will influence the initiation and sustenance of reinforcement corrosion. The expansion of the corroding steel causes surface cracking and subsequent spalling of the cover concrete.

40|$|The {{demands for}} {{improved}} fuel economy, performance and emissions continue to pose challenges for engine designers and the materials they choose. This {{is particularly true}} for modern diesel engines, where the primary path to achieving improved engine performance and emissions {{is to increase the}} Peak Firing Pressure in the combustion chamber. The resulting increase in thermal and mechanical loading has required a change from conventional grey cast iron to Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) in order to satisfy <b>durability</b> <b>requirements</b> without increasing the size or the weight of the engines.

40|$|Nowadays, polymer {{applications}} {{have reached}} almost {{every level of}} our lives and <b>durability</b> <b>requirements</b> are extremely different from one application to the other. Out of all these polymer applications, geosynthetics remains the most critical as long as it may involve very long-term <b>durability</b> <b>requirements</b> (i. e. over 50 to 100 years service life) and that a failure may be dramatic in terms of costs and potential human injuries. After over 30 years of R&D and lessons learned from failures, the geosynthetic industry has reached a very high level of knowledge with regard to durability concerns and associated material formulation. For each product, the list of degradation mechanisms can be drawn and a specification built. However, a significant fraction of geotechnical engineers are often not used to consider material aging issues, as long as this is not a concern for most of geotechnical applications, involving relatively inert materials like water and soil. This paper was thus prepared in order to introduce basic elements involved in geosynthetics aging. A review of polymer basic properties is presented in the first section, followed by a description of potential degradation mechanisms of typical geosynthetics polymers. It is believed that the understanding of these elements will help geotechnical engineers gain better acceptance of geosynthetics for long-term applications and help them specify the products with regard to the adequate degradation mechanisms.

40|$|The {{phase of}} {{building}} management has a strategic importance {{because of the}} necessary scheduling of maintenance during executive planning. Moreover, {{in order to obtain}} the greatest sustainability of the intervention, a reasonable duration of service life must be balanced with global quality-cost ratio. A contribution towards this objective is given by the reduction in the achievable resources and raw materials consumption through the improvement of the <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> of building and its parts. This is true even for the interventions on the existing public building stock, especially if there is lacking of maintenance planning and scheduling. This work, taking cues from a maintenance intervention "at happened breakdown" on an Engineering school building in Palermo, deals with the introduction of process innovations in the management phase, directed towards preventive intervention strategies. Beyond the collection of the informative data, the time behaviour of envelope surfaces is monitored through a viewpoint system. Particular attention has been given to the finishing plaster (rasante) layer and the relative colour, to be evaluated depending on the different technical solutions and exposure to weather conditions. The study, following the methodology of ISO 15686, also foresees accelerated ageing tests on samples of different materials, in order to formulate hypothesis and correlations on the degradation evolution, from a maintenance planning and scheduling viewpoint. The correlations were obtained by taking the colour difference as a representative parameter of the evolution of colour in natural and artificial aging conditions. The results show that the different exposure of surfaces to weathering induces a different decay of surfaces colour, compatible with that induced in the laboratory at different steps of artificial aging...|$|R

40|$|Haynes 188, a cobalt-based superalloy, {{will be used}} to make {{thermal energy}} storage (TES) {{containment}} canisters for a 2 kW solar dynamic ground test demonstrator (SD GTD). Haynes 188 containment canisters with a high thermal emittance (epsilon) are desired for radiating heat away from local hot spots, improving the heating distribution, which will in turn improve canister service life. In addition to needing a high emittance, the surface needs to be durable in an elevated temperature, high vacuum environment for an extended time period. Thirty-five Haynes 188 samples were exposed to 14 different types of surface modification techniques for emittance and vacuum heat treatment (VHT) durability enhancement evaluation. Optical properties were obtained for the modified surfaces. Emittance enhanced samples were exposed to VHT for up to 2692 hours at 827 C and {{less than or equal to}} 10 (exp - 6) torr with integral thermal cycling. Optical properties were taken intermittently during exposure, and after final VHT exposure. The various surface modification treatments increased the emittance of pristine Haynes 188 from 0. 11 up to 0. 86. Seven different surface modification techniques were found to provide surfaces which met the SD GTD receiver VHT <b>durability</b> <b>requirement.</b> Of the 7 surface treatments, 2 were found to display excellent VHT durability: an alumina based (AB) coating and a zirconia based coating.

Large {{volume of}} {{reclaimed}} asphalt pavements (RAP) aggregates are generated during pavement rehabilitation and reconstruction and disposed along road alignment while {{large quantities of}} groundnut shell ash (GSA) are generated from the combustion of groundnut shell and also disposed in large quantities on production sites. This paper presents results of the laboratory evaluation {{of the characteristics of}} GSA stabilized RAP with a view to determining its suitability for use as highway pavement material in flexible pavements construction. The RAP-GSA mixtures were subjected to British standard light (BSL) (standard Proctor) compactive effort to determine the compaction characteristics and California bearing ratio (CBR). Test results show that the properties of RAP improved with GSA treatment. The particle grading improved from 99. 13 % coarse aggregate and 0. 87 % fines, with AASHTO classification of A- 1 -b for 100 % RAP and 9. 08 % coarse aggregate and 90. 92 % fines, with AASHTO classification of A- 4 for 100 % GSA to 15. 66 – 91. 72 % coarse aggregate and 8. 28 – 84. 32 % fines, with AASHTO classification in the range A- 4 (silty soil) to A- 1 -a [granular materials], for the various RAP-GSA mixes. Maximum dry density (MDD) decreased while the optimum moisture content (OMC) increased with higher GSA content in the RAP + GSA mixes.
