40|$|AbstractInformation {{security}} and data protection {{is the key}} topic of discussion in this research paper. This provides the impor-tance of network security where the network administrator role is to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent activities on the computers connected on this network. For this, the primary task is to construct a <b>double</b> <b>verification</b> check tool for the ad-ministrator identity before getting login access to the network. We develop a Matlab based encryption tool which combines visual image encryption using template image fusion and symmetry cipher key cryptographic techniques for this purpose. This provides a reliable and also a simple algorithm tool ensuring data privacy and integrity of the information stored in the computers connected on the network. *Author for correspondence 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} convenient; sensitive; accurate; and {{economical}} technique for genotyping of hepatitis B viruses (HBVs). Methods: The mercapto-modified B 1; B 2; C 1; and C 2 -specific genotyping probes {{consisted of two}} probes for each HBV genotype {{that served as a}} <b>double</b> <b>verification</b> system. These probes were fixed on the surface of No. 1; 2; 3; and 4 gold electrodes; respectively; via Au-S bonds. Different charge generated by the binding of RuHex to phosphate groups of the DNA backbone before and after hybridization was used for distinguishing the different genotypes. Results: During hybridization with genotype B; the charges detected at the No. 1 and 2 electrodes were significantly increased; while the charge at the No. 3 and 4 electrodes did not change significantly. During hybridization with genotype C; the charges detected at No. 3 and 4 electrodes were significantly increased; while the signals remained unchanged at the No. 1 and 2 electrodes. During hybridization with mixed genotypes (B and C); the charges detected at all four electrodes were significantly increased. The linear range of detection was 10 – 7 to 10 – 10 mol/L and the sensitivity for detecting mixed B (10 %) or C (10 %). Conclusions: Rapid genotyping of HBVs based on electrochemical sensing is simple, has good specificity; and can greatly reduce the cost. This method can be used for sensitive detection of mixed B and C HBV genotypes...|$|E
40|$|Research {{into the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of clinical tests is often hampered by single or <b>double</b> partial <b>verification</b> mechanisms, that is, not all patients have their disease status verified by a reference test, neither do all patients receive all tests under evaluation (index tests). We show methods that reduce verification bias introduced when omitting data from partially tested patients. Adjustment techniques are well established {{when there are}} no missing index tests and when the reference test is missing at random. However, in practice, index tests tend to be omitted, and the choice of applying a reference test may depend on unobserved variables related to disease status, that is, verification may be missing not at random (MNAR). We study <b>double</b> partial <b>verification</b> in a clinical example from reproductive medicine in which we analyse the diagnostic values of the chlamydia antibody test and the hysterosalpingography in relation to a diagnostic laparoscopy. First, we plot all possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity of both index tests in two test ignorance regions. Then, we construct models in which we impose different assumptions for the verification process. We allow for missing index tests, study the influence of patient characteristics and study the accuracy estimates if an MNAR mechanism would operate. It is shown that data on tests used in the diagnostic process of the same population are preferably studied jointly and that the influence of an MNAR verification process was limited in a clinical study where {{more than half of the}} patients did not have the reference test.

40|$|For most {{existing}} {{routing protocols}} of mobile ad hoc network (MANET), more efficient security mechanisms against the attacks from malicious, compromised and selfish nodes are highly demanded. This paper proposes {{a series of}} security mechanisms for the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol. Three techniques, including digital signature, one-way hash function and <b>double</b> one-way hash <b>verification</b> are introduced to ensure the authentication, nonrepudiation and integrity of the important routing information in AODV protocol. The comparison with some existing secure AODV protocols demonstrates that our solution expands the security scope and guards against several attacks out of their range...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobile agent}} {{paradigm}} {{has been proposed}} as a promising solution to facilitate distributed computing over open and heterogeneous networks. Mobility, autonomy, and intelligence are identified as key features of mobile agent systems and enabling characteristics for the next-generation smart electronic commerce on the Internet. However, security-related issues, especially integrity protection in mobile agent technology, still hinder {{the widespread use of}} software agents: from the agent’s perspective, mobile agent integrity should be protected against attacks from malicious hosts and other agents. In this paper, we present Code-on-Demand(CoD) mobile agents and a corresponding agent integrity protection scheme. Compared to the traditional assumption that mobile agents consist of invariant code parts, we propose the use of dynamically upgradeable agent code, in which new agent function modules can be added and redundant ones can be deleted at runtime. This approach will reduce the weight of agent programs, equip mobile agents with more flexibility, enhance code privacy and help the recoverability of agents after attack. In order to meet the security challenges for agent integrity protection, we propose agent code change authorization protocols and a <b>double</b> integrity <b>verification</b> scheme. Finally, we discuss the Java implementation of CoD mobile agents and integrity protection. Keywords: Mobile agents; Integrity protection; Code-on-Demand; Electronic commerce 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mass cytometry (Cytometry by Time of Flight, CyTOF) allows single-cell {{characterization}} on {{the basis}} of specific metal-based cell markers. In addition, other metals in the mass range such as silver can be detected per cell. Bacteria are known to be sensible to silver and a protocol was developed to measure both the number of affected cells per population and the quantities of silver per cell. Methods: For mass cytometry ruthenium red was used as a marker for all cells of a population while parallel application of cisplatin discriminated live from dead cells. Silver quantities per cell and frequencies of silver containing cells in a population were measured by mass cytometry. In addition, live/dead subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry and distinguished by cell sorting based on ruthenium red and propidium iodide <b>double</b> staining. <b>Verification</b> of the cells’ silver load was performed on the bulk level by using ICP-MS in combination with cell sorting. The protocol was developed by conveying both, fast and non-growing Pseudomonas putida cells as test organisms. Results: A workflow for labeling bacteria in order to be analyzed by mass cytometry was developed. Three different parameters were tested: ruthenium red provided counts for all bacterial cells in a population while consecutively applied cisplatin marked the frequency of dead cells. Apparent population heterogeneity was detected by different frequencies of silver containing cells. Silver quantities per cell were also well measurable. Generally, AgNP- 10 treatment caused higher frequencies of dead cells, higher frequencies of silver containing cells and higher per-cell silver quantities. Due to an assumed chemical equilibrium of free and bound silver ions live and dead cells were associated with silver in equal quantities and this preferably during exponential growth. With ICP-MS up to 1. 5 fg silver per bacterial cell were detected. Conclusion: An effective mass cytometry protocol was developed for the detection and quantification of silver in single bacterial cells of different physiological states. The silver quantities were generally heterogeneously distributed among cells in a population, the degree of which was dependent on micro-environmental conditions and on silver applied either in ion or nanoparticle-aggregated form...|$|R
