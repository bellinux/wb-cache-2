25|$|Mark Messier {{was born}} in Edmonton, Alberta, the son of Mary-Jean (Dea) and Douglas Messier. He has an older brother Paul, and two sisters Jennifer, and Mary-Kay, who is {{director}} of brand initiatives for Bauer Hockey. Bauer Hockey and Hockey Canada launched The First Shift initiative in 2012 {{in an effort to}} ease the transition for families who are new to the game. The program, which is open to kids between the ages of six and 10 who have never played hockey before, hopes to see one million new players registered in hockey leagues across Canada by 2022. Alongside his sister, Mark is an advocate for First Shift, which is a six-week program for $199 that also gives <b>kids</b> <b>all</b> their starter equipment. His brother Paul and sister Jennifer are managing one of their brother's investments—a small hotel—in Harbour Island, Bahamas.|$|E
500|$|The {{legacy of}} Rosewood {{remained}} in Levy County. For decades no black residents lived in Cedar Key or Sumner. Robin Raftis, the white {{editor of the}} Cedar Key Beacon, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, [...] "Things happened {{out there in the}} woods. There's no doubt about that. How bad? We don't know... So I said, 'Okay guys, I'm opening the closet with the skeletons, because if we don't learn from mistakes, we're doomed to repeat them'." [...] Raftis received notes reading, [...] "We know how to get you and your <b>kids.</b> <b>All</b> it takes is a match".|$|E
500|$|... "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] {{was based}} on a real-life event: lead singer Gaz Coombes' arrest and caution for {{possession}} of cannabis at age fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. <b>Kids</b> <b>all</b> around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cul-de-sac}} kids do {{not include}} the Eds as part of their group, making the trio outcasts. The group of kids include: Jonny 2×4 (David Paul [...] "Buck" [...] Grove) is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance, and {{spends most of his time}} with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank; Jimmy (Keenan Christensen) is a weak, insecure, and accident-prone child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah (Janyse Jaud), Ed's spoiled and ill-tempered younger sister; Rolf (Peter Kelamis) is an immigrant, who often participates in unconventional customs; Kevin (Kathleen Barr) is a cynical and sardonic jock who detests the Eds, particularly Eddy; Nazz (Tabitha St. Germain; Jenn Forgie; Erin Fitzgerald), usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical dumb blonde and an unattainable love interest for the cul-de-sac <b>kids.</b> <b>All</b> of the cul-de-sac kids share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, Lee (Janyse Jaud), May (Erin Fitzgerald; Jenn Forgie), and Marie (Kathleen Barr), three teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park and are in love with the Eds.|$|E
500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three <b>kids,</b> <b>all</b> of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E

2500|$|The family visits Shøp, a store {{based on}} Ikea, {{and decides to}} go to the food court. There, they meet Apu and Manjula. They say {{that they would like to}} have a baby. They {{eventually}} do, and Manjula gives birth to octuplets with the help of fertility drugs, given by the Simpsons and Apu. It makes headlines across Springfield, with local companies giving the Nahasapeemapetilons free products. However, their feat is eclipsed when a family in Shelbyville give birth to nine babies. With the discovery, the gifts were revoked. Apu and Manjula swiftly find they are not up to the task of raising eight <b>kids</b> <b>all</b> at once.|$|E
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 10th anniversary of What to Do When You Are Dead, the band performed {{a series of}} shows in September, October and December 2015, during which they performed the album in its entirety. In 2015, Maria Sherman of Fuse.tv wrote that the album [...] "laid the foundation for future pop-punk bands to explore concept records in very real ways". Calling it [...] "impressive at the time, this band from the suburbs [...] a power pop-punk record with a linear, intricate narrative". AXS contributor Tarynn Law wrote that [...] "the instantly relateable tracks that filled What To Do When You Are Dead soundtracked the teenage angst of <b>kids</b> <b>all</b> {{around the country for}} years to come". Brian Aberback of NorthJersey.com noted that the album [...] "put Armor for Sleep on the indie-rock map and continues to resonate heavily with fans 10 years later". Jorgensen later called the album a [...] "diary entry. Without that, I {{think a lot of people}} when [...] lives go on they forget what they went through at a certain point in time so for me that’s the biggest markers for me to remember where I was at the point in my life." ...|$|E
