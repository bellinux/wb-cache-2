J. Schroet. ] resistance. Two-hundred full-sib families (FS) representing the C 5 selection cycle were evaluated together with the genepool parental landraces, <b>experimental</b> <b>varieties</b> derived from previous cycles and local checks in Striga-infested fields at Sadoré (Niger) and Cinzana (Mali). Substantial and mostly significant selection progress could be documented. The accumulated percentage gain from selection amounted to 51 %/ 1 % lower Striga infestation (measured by area under Striga number progress curve, ASNPC), 46 %/ 62 % lower downy mildew incidence, and 49 %/ 31 % higher panicle yield of the C 5 -FS compared to the mean of the genepool parents at Sadoré/Cinzana, respectively. <b>Experimental</b> <b>varieties</b> selected from previous cycles also revealed lower ASNPC and mostly higher yield compared to genepool parents at their selection sites. Significant genetic variation among the C 5 -FS and operative heritabilities of 76 % (Cinzana), 84 % (Sadoré) and 34 % (combined across locations) for ASNPC will enable continued selection gain for Striga resistance. High genotype×environment interaction variances for all target traits suggest that different <b>experimental</b> <b>varieties</b> need to be extracted from the genepool for different sites.

The carotenoid-derived volatile, -ionone, was identified in both standard yellow sweet corn (Hybrix 5) and a zeaxanthin-enhanced <b>experimental</b> <b>variety</b> (HZ) designed for sufferers of macular degeneration. As -ionone is highly perceivable at extremely low concentration by humans, it was important to confirm if alterations in carotenoid profile may also affect flavor volatiles.

No correlation existed with either lutein (R 2 = 0. 06) or antheraxanthin (R 2 = 0. 10). Delaying harvest of cobs resulted in a significant increase of both carotenoid and -ionone concentrations, producing a 6 -fold increase of ?-ionone in HZ and a 2 -fold increase in Hybrix 5, reaching a maximum of 62 g/kg FW and 24 g/kg FW, respectively...|$|E

The objective {{of this investigation was}} to assess the effect of different crushing treatments on juice extraction and sugar quality traits of sweet sorghum cultivars grown in different seasons. Three sweet sorghum cultivars along with three stalk crushing treatments namely (i) stalk only crushed (leaf, sheath and panicle removed), (ii) stalk plus sheath crushed (leaf and panicle removed), and (iii) whole plant crushed (but only panicle removed) were assessed in split–split-plot design during 2009 rainy (Kharif) and 2009 post-rainy (Rabi) seasons. The percent juice extraction and juice sugar quality traits were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) in different crop seasons, but were non-significant among cultivars and crushing treatments. Sweet sorghum cultivars grown during rainy season had significantly higher total soluble sugars (TSS), sucrose and purity per cent than in post-rainy season. <b>Experimental</b> <b>variety</b> SPSSV 30 showed significant superiority by 25 % in TSS and sucrose content than check namely CSH 22 SS. Effect of crushing treatments on juice extraction and sugar quality traits were non-significant except juice brix. It is recommended that the complete sweet sorghum stalks after removing the panicle can be crushed without the need for removing leaf and sheath both in large research trial samples, and bulk harvested stalks at biofuel processing facility. This will reduce processing time at the sugar mill and helps avoiding rapid deterioration of stalk sugars in the ambient field condition, as removal of leaf and sheath in sweet sorghum is highly cumbersome unlike sugarcane, where it is relatively easy...|$|E

The highest yielding variety in this study was DP 555 BR with a yield of 2203 pounds of lint per acre, but FM 991 BR produced the highest gross revenue per acre at $ 1527 per acre. Sierra, a new Acala variety from California, was the highest yielding Acala with a lint yield of 1872 pounds per acre and a gross revenue of $ 1324 per acre. The average lint yield was 500 pounds per acre higher that the 2002 season indicating that 2003 was an above average cotton growing year and that the heat units per day in the week following planting were above the threshold. In addition to the yield, several other agronomic variables were measured. These included plant height, total nodes, and boll weights. From plant height and total nodes the height to node ratios were calculated. Differences were seen between these variables by variety but the most notable point was that the plants were robust in their growth habit and fruiting forms were heavier than the previous year.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Hops {{contribute}} many desirable aromas to beer. Traditionally hop aromas {{have been}} described by the point of addition in the brewing process (dry-hop, finish-hop, or kettle-hop). The compounds present in the oil provide {{a wide range of}} aroma qualities. Since the composition of the oil is different for each hop variety {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the aroma qualities of each variety would be different. Moreover, since a different composition of compounds would be added to the beer at each addition point, it would be expected that different hop varieties would produce beers with different aroma qualities. Trained panel free-choice profiling was used to evaluate the aroma qualities of selected raw hops and of dry-hopped lagers and finish-hopped lagers produced with the same hops. The first study compared the aroma qualities of eight commercial and seven experimental varieties of raw hops. The raw hops had intense aromas and were separated into five different groups based on their aroma qualities. Three experimental varieties were found to have similar aroma qualities to varieties with German parentage. There was a strong correlation between the concentration of the hop oil compounds and the aroma qualities that separated the varieties. The second and third studies compared the aroma qualities of American Lagers dry-hopped (second) and finish-hopped (third) with twelve of the fifteen hop varieties from the first study. In both studies the lagers were separated into three groups based on their aroma qualities. There was no relationship that could be applied to all varieties between the aroma qualities of the dry-hopped lagers and the finish-hopped lagers.

40|$|AbstractTo feed {{a growing}} world {{population}} in the coming decades, agriculture must strive to reduce {{the gap between the}} yields that are currently achieved by farmers (Ya) and those potentially attainable in rainfed farming systems (Yw). The first step towards reducing yield gaps (Yg) is to obtain realistic estimates of their magnitude and their spatial and temporal variability. In this paper we describe a new yield gap assessment framework. The framework uses statistical yield and cropping area data, remotely sensed data, cropping system simulation and GIS mapping to calculate wheat yield gaps at scales from 1. 1 km cells to regional. The framework includes ad hoc on-ground testing of the calculated yield gaps. This framework was applied to wheat in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. Estimated Yg over the whole Wimmera region varied annually from 0. 63 to 4. 12 Mgha− 1 with an average of 2. 00 Mgha− 1. Expressed as a relative yield (Y%) the range was 26. 3 – 77. 9 % with an average of 52. 7 %. Similarly large spatial variability was described in a Wimmera yield gap map. Such maps can be used to show where efforts to bridge the yield gap are likely to have the biggest impacts. Bridging the exploitable yield gap in the Wimmera region by increasing average Y% to 80 % would increase average annual wheat production from 1. 09 Mtonnes to 1. 65 Mtonnes. Model estimates of Yw and Yg were compared with data from crop yield contests, <b>experimental</b> <b>variety</b> trials, and on-farm water use and yields. These alternative approaches agreed well with the modelling results, indicating that the proposed framework provided a robust and widely applicable method of determining yield gaps. Its successful implementation requires that: (1) Ya as well as the area and geospatial distribution of wheat cropping are well defined; (2) there is a crop model with proven performance in the local agro-ecological zone; (3) daily weather and soil data (such as PAWC) required by crop models are available throughout the area; and (4) local agronomic best practice is well defined...|$|E
