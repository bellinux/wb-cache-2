5|$|Ward {{was named}} an Associated Press (AP) first-team All-American as a {{defensive}} middle guard in 1950 and as an offensive guard in 1951. He is the only player to have ever achieved the honor for both an offensive and defensive position. In 1950, legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice named Ward a Look magazine All-American, and <b>every</b> <b>team</b> that Maryland had played selected Ward to The Chicago Tribunes All-Players All-America team. He was also named to the 1950 All-Southern Conference team.|$|E
5|$|However, {{before the}} start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the {{president}} of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team out of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, <b>every</b> <b>team</b> had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{voted to}} allow {{professional}} athletes {{to compete in}} Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held {{in the middle of}} the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed to compete starting in 1998. The format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States—followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; <b>every</b> <b>team</b> played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.|$|E
5|$|Just like {{individual}} competitions, {{there are}} two rounds, but with a difference. Each round is divided into four rotations or 'legs', in which a member of <b>every</b> <b>team</b> jumps once in the same order. Points are scored {{the same as they}} are in individual competitions; however, an athlete's points for a jump are instead added to their team's total tally. The starting order of teams in the first round, and first three legs of the second round, is based on their standings in the Nations Cup. Teams are narrowed down to eight for the second round based on points scored, with the same four athletes jumping in their order of rotation as before.|$|E

At the same time, no team from the Big East, which had an {{automatic}} place in a BCS bowl, was in the top 25. The teams ranked immediately ahead and behind Kent State, UCLA and Texas, had to play higher-ranked teams on the road during the championship weekend. UCLA visited 8th ranked Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game, and Texas visited sixth-ranked Kansas State to end both teams' regular seasons. Because of Northern Illinois' ranking entering the game, {{it had not been}} initially thought that the Huskies would be able to jump into the top 16 with a win, even with losses by UCLA and Texas.|$|E
