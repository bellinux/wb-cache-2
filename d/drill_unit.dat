The methods based on the analysis and systematization of statistic data are chosen, they help to determine at first approaching the main measure-ments of replenishment ships. The formulas for calculation of the number of re-plenishment ships are given taking into account the received measurements dur-ing fleet location in different ports. Three variants of fleet location, the active ports Olya and Makhachkala and a port on the artificial island, are considered. The most rational place {{of oil and gas}} production fleet location is an active port Makhachkala...|$|R

5000|$|Beves {{was the son}} of Edward Leslie Beves, {{a prosperous}} Brighton timber merchant, and was educated at Windlesham House School, then at Rugby, and {{eventually}} at King's College, Cambridge, where he gained a scholarship in classics in December 1914, three months after the beginning of the First World War. However, he joined the Rifle Brigade and served in the army throughout the war. By 1919, he was a captain commanding the <b>drill</b> <b>unit</b> of the Central School of Instruction at Berkhamstead. In 1919 he finally arrived at King's, where he graduated in 1922 with a First in the Classical Tripos and a Second in modern languages. He then got a job as a clerk at the House of Commons, but after writing a thesis on the Holy Grail he was given a Fellowship of King's. In 1926 he was appointed as dean of the college and in 1946 as vice-provost. At his death in 1961, The Times said of him [...] "although he wrote little, he delivered ... important lectures on sixteenth century French literature". He was also chairman of the governing body of Trent College.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Too {{develop a}} {{flexible}} drill device {{that can be}} inserted into the shoulder joint so that arthro-scopic transosseous suture repair for Bankart lesion is possible. Materials and Methods: We created a device composed of a flexible <b>drill</b> <b>unit</b> and a guide pipe unit. The flexible <b>drill</b> <b>unit</b> was made of flexible multifilament wires (1. 2 mm in diameter) that was twisted into one cord {{so that it can}} flex in any direction and a drill bit (1. 2 mm in diameter) that is attached onto one end of the flexible wire. The guide pipe unit was a 150 mm long metal pipe (2. 0 mm in inner diameter and 3. 0 mm in outer diameter), with one end bent to 30 degrees. The flexible drill set was inserted into the shoul-der joint through the posterior portal of the joint. The guide pipe component was placed onto the medial wall of the glenoid so that the pipe was placed 5 mm posterior to the margin of the anterior glenoid rim. The flexible drill was driven through the glenoid by the power drill so that holes were made in the gle-noid. A non- absorbable suture was passed through the hole. Tying of a sliding knot tying was accom-plished over the capsule and labrum after making a stitch through the capsule and labrum with a suture hook loaded with suture passer. The same procedures were done at the 2 and 4 O’Clock positions of th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. China is {{launching}} the Chang'e project to send automated machine for acquiring the lunar soil {{and returning to}} the earth. Thus, {{we are trying to}} develop a kind of effective mechanism for the exploration mission of lunar soil coring. This paper presents a rotary-percussive coring drill which is a novel scheme for the deep surface soil acquirement. Two degrees of freedom are included in the proposed drill mechanism. Specifically-designed <b>drill</b> <b>unit</b> including auger and drill bit is employed to finish the coring of the simulant of lunar regolith. We have proposed a novel coring concept named soft-bag coring. Since there is no relative motion between the soft-bag and the cut soil core, the soft-bag method may keep the original stratification of lunar soil. A test-bed has been developed to conduct experimental tests under different drilling parameters and circumstances. The related drilling parameters such as rotary speed, penetration ratio, and percussive frequency are adjusted to adapt to different situations in the experiments. The experimental results indicate that the specifically considered drill mechanism with soft-bag inside can get high coring ratio and excellent stratification of the soil...|$|E
