5|$|Pilot error {{resulting}} in controlled flight into terrain was blamed for five fatal Comet 4 accidents: an Aerolíneas Argentinas crash near Asunción, Paraguay on 27 August 1959, Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 322 at Campinas near São Paulo, Brazil on 23 November 1961, United Arab Airlines Flight 869 in Thailand's Khao Yai mountains on 19 July 1962, a Saudi Arabian Government crash in the Italian Alps on 20 March 1963, and United Arab Airlines Flight 844 in Tripoli, Libya on 2 January 1971. The Dan-Air de Havilland Comet crash in Spain's Montseny range on 3 July 1970 {{was attributed to}} navigational errors by air traffic control and pilots. Other fatal Comet 4 accidents include a British European Airways crash in Ankara, Turkey following <b>instrument</b> <b>failure</b> on 21 December 1961, United Arab Airlines Flight 869 during inclement weather near Bombay, India on 28 July 1963, and the terrorist bombing of Cyprus Airways Flight 284 off the Turkish coast on 12 October 1967.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of a symbol for a chord defines {{the root of the}} chord. The root of the chord is always played by one of the {{instruments}} in the ensemble (usually by a bass <b>instrument).</b> <b>Failure</b> to include the root means that the indicated chord may be hard to hear for some listeners. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are below.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Alcock {{wanted to}} {{continue}} his flying career and took up the challenge of attempting {{to be the first}} to fly directly across the Atlantic. [...] Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown took off from St John's, Newfoundland, at 1:45 pm local time on 14 June 1919, and landed in Derrygimla bog near Clifden, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later on 15 June 1919 after flying 1,980 miles (3,186km). [...] The flight had been much affected by bad weather, making accurate navigation difficult; the intrepid duo also had to cope with turbulence, <b>instrument</b> <b>failure</b> and ice on the wings. [...] The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber, and won a £10,000 prize offered by London's Daily Mail newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. His grave in Southern Cemetery, Manchester is marked by a large stone memorial alongside other famous Mancunian figures. He is buried in grave space [...] "Church of England, Section G, Grave Number 966", alongside 4 other individuals: John Alcock, Mary Alcock, Edward Samson Alcock and Elsie Moseley.|$|E

2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} occurred on 4 March 1962. A Douglas DC-7C named Star of Robbie Burns (registration: G-ARUD) operating the Douala—Lisbon sector of Caledonian Airways flight 153 (a Lourenço Marques — Luxembourg charter {{on behalf of}} Trans Africa Air Coach of London) crashed shortly after a night takeoff from Douala Airport's runway 12, killing all 111 occupants (ten crew and 101 passengers). At {{the time of the}} accident, the weather was very hot and humid. After a long takeoff run on the airport's [...] long runway, the aircraft gained insufficient height to clear the trees close to the runway end. The aircraft's port wing struck trees [...] above aerodrome elevation, some [...] from the runway end and [...] from the extended centreline. This resulted in the aircraft crashing into a tidal swamp and exploding on impact. Although this was the only {{fatal accident}} in Caledonian's history, it was the deadliest air disaster in British aviation history at the time. The commission of inquiry probing the accident determined that the evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that a jammed elevator spring tab mechanism prevented the aircraft from attaining sufficient height to clear the obstacles in the runway end's vicinity. This would have resulted in abnormal elevator control forces during takeoff. It was also consistent with tests showing this to prolong takeoff runs that had an attendant risk of losing height during flap retraction when the aircraft became airborne. The commission of inquiry also described a number of adverse features that might have aggravated the circumstances in which the accident occurred. It had furthermore not been able to exclude the possibility of an <b>instrument</b> <b>failure</b> as a probable accident cause as the instruments were either not recovered or too damaged for a valid expert examination.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of 2 different types of Cotrel-Dubousset instrument systems in stabilising thoracolumbar and lumbar spine fractures. METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 1993, 45 fractures in 42 patients with unstable fracture or fracture dislocation of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spines were randomly assigned to 2 surgical treatments with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation-using either a long segment (Group 1) or a short segment (Group 2) -and short posterolateral fusion. RESULTS: Consolidation of the fractured vertebral body and posterolateral fusion were achieved at a mean time of 4. 5 months; fusion rates were 75 % in Group 1 and 83 % in Group 2. The average collapses of anterior vertebral body height in Group 1, in the immediate postoperative period and at the final follow-up, were 15 % and 17 %, respectively; and in Group 2, the figures were 16 % and 24 %, respectively. The correction of vertebral height and kyphosis at the last follow-up were lost more in Group 2 (5. 7 degrees) than in Group 1 (4. 4 degrees). There were neurological recoveries in 6 of the 9 cases of incomplete paraplegics, including complete recovery in 5, and one-Frankel grade increase in one. There were 15 <b>instrument</b> <b>failures</b> in 12 patients, including screw breakage in 3 Group 1 cases and 6 Group 2 cases. The plug dislodged in 3 Group 1 cases, and the hook dislodged in 3 Group 2 cases. In other words, <b>instrument</b> <b>failures</b> were more common in Group 2. CONCLUSION: Cotrel-Dubousset stabilisation of the fractured spine achieves fracture consolidation, but does not maintain the restored height and sagittal curve completely until fusion. The long rod and short fusion construct was more effective for all fracture types than was the short rod and fusion construct, although it leads to wider immobilisation of normal segments...|$|R

With intense short bunches passing near or even into the metal surface, the peak image current density can be very high.
