5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building.

The fallacy is that X and Y might be very strongly correlated. E.g. X might <b>improve</b> performance <b>by</b> causing Y.|$|R
40|$|Modern FPGA {{architectures}} from Altera and Xilinx {{have shifted}} away from allowing multiple drivers to connect to each interconnect wire. This paper advocates the need for this shift to single-driver wiring by investigating the necessary architectural and circuit design changes. When single-driver wiring is used, area <b>improves</b> <b>by</b> 25 %, delay <b>improves</b> <b>by</b> 9 %, and area-delay <b>improves</b> <b>by</b> 32 % compared to bidirectional wiring. Wiring capacitance is reduced by 37 % due to reduced switch loading and physical wire length shrinkage. Furthermore, it is shown that larger circuits tend to realize larger savings. No significant CAD tool changes are needed. 1...|$|R
30|$|We {{see that}} {{including}} the spatial layout features improves the performance significantly: LRC/LRC <b>improves</b> <b>by,</b> respectively, 4.4 % and 8.7 % on MSRC- 9 and MSRC- 21, and LRC/CRF <b>improves</b> <b>by</b> 3.4 % and 6.5 %. Adding the image-level aggregate features provides smaller but still significant gains: LRC/LRC <b>improves,</b> respectively, <b>by</b> 0.9 % and 2.1 % on MSRC- 9 and MSRC- 21, and LRC/CRF <b>improves</b> <b>by</b> 0.6 % and 0.7 %. Regarding the different neighborhood systems, including the first-order neighborhood features improves the MSRC- 9 results by 2.2 % and the MSRC- 21 ones by 0.6 %. Adding additional neighbors beyond this makes little difference. LRC/CRF consistently outperforms LRC/LRC, but the differences become negligible when the spatial layout and global aggregate features are included.|$|R

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
