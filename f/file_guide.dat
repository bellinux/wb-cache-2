Their microstructures were revealed by using powder X- ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The formation mechanisms of these spherulites and their morphology evolution were postulated. It was proposed that spherical particles of an inorganic and biological composite formed first.

40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} element of understanding a software code base is to identify the repetitive patterns of code it contains and how these evolve over time. Some patterns are useful to the software, and may be modularized. Others are detrimental to the software, such as patterns that represent defects. In this case, {{it is useful to}} study the occurrences of such patterns, to identify properties such as when and why they are introduced, how long they persist, and the reasons why they are corrected. To enable studying pattern occurrences over time, we propose a tool, Herodotos, that semi-automatically tracks pattern occurrences over multiple versions of a software project, independent of other changes in the source <b>files.</b> <b>Guided</b> by a user-provided configuration file, Herodotos builds various graphs showing the evolution of the pattern occurrences and computes some statistics. We have evaluated this approach on the history of a representative range of open source projects over the last three years. For each project, we track several kinds of defects that have been found by pattern matching. This tracking is done automatically in 99 % of the occurrences. The results allow us to compare the evolution of the selected projects and defect kinds over time...|$|R

Why this rotation occurs {{is not entirely}} clear yet. Some researchers identified an electrostatic field generated by the two aquaporin half-helices HB and HE as the reason. Others suggested that hydrogen bonds between asparagine amino acids in the two NPA regions and the oxygen in the water cause the rotation. It is still unclear whether the rotation of water molecules has any biological significance. Early studies speculated that the [...] "bipolar" [...] orientation of water molecules blocks the flow of protons via the Grotthuss mechanism. More recent studies question this interpretation and emphasize an electrostatic barrier {{as the reason for}} proton blockage. In the latter view, the rotation of water molecules is only a side-effect of the electrostatic barrier. At present (2008), the origin of the electrostatic field is a matter of debate. While some studies mainly considered the electric field generated by the protein's half-helices HB and HE, others emphasized desolvation effects as the proton enters the narrow aquaporin pore.|$|R

40|$|Organizing the {{information}} that we call personal files such as files in a home directory, web pages found on the Internet, images, emails for later revisiting is currently required by many computer users. Several information retrieval models are proposed to fullfil this requirement. Each model is characterized by the types of personal files, their organization and the searching method used. Traditional file systems let a user organize his files into a directory tree and retrieve them later by browsing the directory tree. Desktop seach tools such as Google Desktop or Beagle automatically index file properties and file content (keywords) to provide the user with file retrieval by querying on file properties or on file content. Semantic file systems propose a searching method that combines querying with browsing to give to the users the advantages of both searching methods. For informations on the Internet, tagging systems are more and more used to facilitate the re-finding of these Internet ressources. Among personal file characteristics (properties, content, context) exploited by the above retrieval models, the working context of the user has been proved to be relevant to help a user to successfully retrieve his personal files. This work proposes a model for personal file retrieval, called context-based model for personal file retrieval. Our model allows a user to associate his personal files with a working context using tags. To retrieve a personal file, the user must describe the working context corresponding to each file. The searching method in our model gives to the users the advantages of both searching methods: browsing and querying. We develop our model by improving traditional tagging models. Based on tag relationships and popularities, we organize tags created by a user into a directed acyclic graph (DAGoT). This DAGoT is used as the basic data model to realize our context-based model for personal file retrieval. We use this graph to recognize working contexts associated to personal <b>files,</b> <b>guide</b> a user to reconstruct his working contexts, refine the searching requests, and retrieve personal files by context.
