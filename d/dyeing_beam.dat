Selective laser excitation of fluorescence from the transverse Zeeman site using a <b>dye</b> laser <b>beam</b> enabled this site to be distinguished from two other magnetically non-equivalent sites in these crystals. Large intensity and energy variations observed for some transverse Zeeman transitions as the crystal was rotated in the magnetic field, were accounted for by a switching of the symmetry labels and by magnetic field mixing between levels. The C₄ᵥ irrep designations of the crystal-field levels were identified by studying the intensity variations, and crystal and magnetic field energy calculations successfully accounted for the energies of the transverse Zeeman levels. In certain cases, the transverse Zeeman effect was analysed in the more complex absorption spectra. Previous undetected C₄ᵥ crystal-field energy levels in CaF₂:Erᶾ⁺ have been located using selective laser excitation spectroscopy, and a few assignments of levels to the C₄ᵥ site by earlier workers, were found to be incorrect. Conventional optical absorption and fluorescence measurements have been made on Ndᶾ⁺ ions in CaF₂ and SrF₂ crystals, and infrared and infrared-Zeeman absorption spectra examined for Ceᶾ⁺ and Ndᶾ⁺ions in both types of crystalline hosts.

40|$|Twelve eyes of 12 {{patients}} with refractory glaucoma {{were treated with}} internal sclerostomy using laser ablation of dyed sclera. The technique involves iontophoretic impregnation of the sclera at the limbal region with 1 % methylene blue and subsequent delivery of a pulsed <b>dye</b> laser <b>beam</b> to the stained area through a goniolens. The red wavelength of 664 nm generated by the laser is maximally absorbed by the stained sclera and creates a through and through sclerostomy. Successful complete sclerostomy was achieved in seven eyes (58. 3 %) but there was some reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in all cases. Mean prelaser IOP (of all 12 eyes) was 36. 6 mm Hg and 1 hour after therapy it was reduced to 20. 0 mm Hg. At {{the end of the}} follow-up period (mean 16 months) the mean IOP was 23. 7 mm Hg; five eyes (41 %) maintained their IOP below 22 mm Hg, and the average number of medications per eye came down from 3. 25 to 2. 25 per eye. Transient corneal burns with Descemet's membrane folds adjacent to the laser impact zone were detected in eight eyes (67 %). No major complications like IOP spike, hyphaema, iridodialysis, or retinal detachment have been detected.

In addition, the line shapes of the 			autoionizing resonances have been studied using various channels 			approached by different intermediate levels and extensive new 			measurements of the highly excited even parity autoionizing 			resonances is presented. Furthermore, the proper line shape of the 			 6 p 2 1 S 0 autoionizing resonance has been reported experimentally for 			the first time. 			In {{the first set of}} experiments, the photoionization cross section 			from the 6 s 6 p 1, 3 P 1 excited states have been measured in the energy 			region from the first ionization threshold up to 1. 69 eV excess 			energy.

The 			absolute values of the photoionization cross section from the 6 s 6 p 			 1 P 1 and 3 P 1 excited states at the first ionization threshold have 			been determined as 90 ± 14 Mb and 102 ± 15 Mb respectively. The 			studies have been extended to determine the measurements of the 			oscillator strengths of the 6 s 6 p 1 P 1 6 snd 1 D 2 (20 n 76) and 			 6 s 6 p 3 P 1 6 snd 3 D 2 (20 n 63) Rydberg transitions.

The oscillator strength densities in the continuum 			corresponding to the 6 s 6 p 3 P 1 excited state have also been 			determined. 			In the next set of experiments, we have investigated how the line 			shape and width of an autoionizing resonance varies by choosing 			different excitation paths and a systematic line shape analysis of 			the 6 p 7 p configuration based 1 P 1, 3 D 1 and 3 P 1 autoionizing 			resonances are presented. These even parity isolated autoionizing 			resonances have been accessed via four different intermediate states 			 6 snp 1 P 1 (6 n 8) and 5 d 6 p 1 P 1. A comparison of the Fano 			parameters of the resonance profiles reveals that the width of an 			autoionizing resonance remains constant while the line profile 			parameter changes with the selection of different intermediate 			states. 			The next studies are devoted to the highly excited even parity 			autoionizing states using the two-step laser excitation via the 5 d 6 p 			 1 P 1 and 6 s 7 p 1 P 1 intermediate levels from the first ionization 			threshold to the 5 d 2 D 5 / 2 limit.

Four channels (one 			open and three closed) MQDT analyses has also been performed to 			extract the line shape parameters for the broad 6 p 2 1 S 0 resonance 			and other J = 0 resonances in this region. The highly excited even 			parity autoionizing states close to 5 d 2 D 3 / 2, 5 / 2 thresholds have 			been recorded using a thermionic diode ion detector. Extensive new 			data for the 5 d 3 / 2, 5 / 2 nd J = 0, 1, 2 series are presented. Besides 			the data for the 5 dng J = 2 autoionizing resonances is extended up 			to n = 44 and n = 51 terminating at the 5 d 3 / 2 and 5 d 5 / 2 threshold 			respectively. The 5 dns J = 2 autoionizing resonances have been 			observed up to n = 38 and n = 35 built on the 5 d 3 / 2 and 5 d 5 / 2 			threshold respectively. The identification of autoionizing states is 			made exploiting the parallel and perpendicular polarizations of the 			two <b>dye</b> laser <b>beams</b> and monitoring the consistency of the quantum 			defects...|$|R
