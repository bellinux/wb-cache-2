40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} {{the relationship between}} plant hosts and root-colonizing fungi recovered from apple orchard soils that had been replanted over multiple generations. Functional relationships of three groups of filamentous fungi (Ceratobasidium sp., Cylindrocarpon-like group and Fusarium acuminatum) with apple rootstocks were evaluated in plant growth bioassays. The Cylindrocarpon-like group and Ceratobasidium sp. showed {{a relationship with the}} host plant varying from pathogenic to commensal through to mutualistic for the latter group, while that of F. acuminatum tended to be mutualistic. Seven fungal isolates of each group, which induced the highest plant growth in bioassays, were evaluated for auxin (IAA) and gibberellin (GA 3 and GA 4) production in culture filtrate. All isolates of F. acuminatum as well as most of those of the Ceratobasidium sp. and ylindrocarpon-like groups produced IAA in culture filtrate. IAA production was evaluated for additional isolates of endophytic fungal species from <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>orchards</b> and the functionality of IAA was confirmed by growing in vitro micropropagated plantlets of apple rootstock on MS medium supplemented with fungal culture filtrate.

40|$|International audienceFruit <b>tree</b> <b>orchards</b> have a {{historical}} and economic importance for Mediterranean agriculture, notably in Spain. <b>Fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>orchards</b> {{have the potential}} to mitigate global warming by sequestrating carbon (C) and providing renewable fuels.

Therefore, we analyzed the greenhouse gas contribution of 42 pairs of organic and conventional perennial cropping systems, including citrus, subtropical <b>trees,</b> other <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> treenuts, vineyards, and olives, using life-cycle assessment (LCA). The assessment was based on management information from interviews and involved the estimation of soil carbon sequestration, specific Mediterranean N 2 O emission factors, and the consideration of coproducts. Results show on average a 56  % decrease of greenhouse gas emissions under organic versus conventional cropping, on an area basis. On a product basis, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 39  % on average. These findings are explained mainly by C sequestration in soils, which is due in turn to higher C inputs by cover cropping and incorporation of pruning residues...|$|R

40|$|Poster presentado en el Workshop: Automated Methods for Continuous Measurements in Agriculture and Forestry. September 9 - 10, 2013 George Evens Family Auditorium, Sede Boqer Campus Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beerseba (Israel). Rational {{irrigation}} {{management is}} required to achieve high water productivity values in <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>orchards.</b> This explains the substantial efforts {{made in the last}} two decades by the scientific community to develop new methods for precise irrigation scheduling. Basically, a reliable and sensitive water stress indicator {{is required to}} apply properly most irrigation strategies, especially those involving deficit irrigation, widely used in <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>orchards.</b> The sensors and related equipment must be inexpensive, easy to install and maintain, and robust enough for working under field conditions for long irrigation seasons. They must also be suitable for automated and continuous data collection and transmission, and the derived indicator must be sensitive and easy to interpret. Measurements of trunk diameter variation (TDV) have proved to meet those requirements to an acceptable extent, although results depend on a variety of factors, including the species, plant age and size, and crop load. In this work we analysed the potential and limitations of several TDV-derived indices as indicators of water stress in olive orchards. Their suitability for irrigation scheduling was also evaluated. Measurements were made in a 40 -year-old ‘Manzanilla’ <b>orchard</b> with 286 <b>trees</b> ha- 1, in a 12 -year-old ‘Arbequina’ <b>orchard</b> with 238 <b>trees</b> ha- 1 and in a 5 -year-old hedgerow ‘Arbequina’ <b>orchard</b> with 1667 <b>trees</b> ha- 1.

40|$|Deciduous <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>orchards</b> {{located in}} the Pacific Northwest were {{surveyed}} over a 3 -year period {{for the presence of}} ice nucleation-active (INA) bacteria. In the Yakima Valley, only about 30 % of the <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> <b>orchards</b> contained INA bacteria (median population ca. 3 × 102 CFU/g [fresh weight]) in contrast to nearly 75 % of the orchards in the Hood River Valley (median population ca. 5 × 103 CFU/g [fresh weight]). These INA populations ranged from less than 10 to over 106 CFU/g (fresh weight) of blossoms and, in Hood River Valley orchards, generally comprised over 10 % of the total bacterial population. Populations of INA bacteria fluctuated during the year with highest levels developing on buds and flowers during the cool, wet spring, followed by a drop in populations during the warmer, drier, summer months and finally a gradual increase in the autumn. The INA bacteria persisted on dormant buds from which they again colonized young developing vegetative tissues. All INA bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas syringae. The frequency of ice nucleation at − 5 °C for these strains ranged from nearly every cell being INA to less than 1 in 107 cells. The median frequency of ice nucleation at − 5 °C was 104 cells per ice nucleus. The INA P. syringae strains from individual orchards were diverse with respect to bacteriocin typing and in ice nucleation frequency. The consistent absence of detectable INA bacteria or presence of low populations in most of the orchards surveyed during periods when critical temperatures (i. e., − 2 to − 5 °C) were common indicated a limited role for INA bacteria in frost susceptibility of most Pacific Northwest orchards...|$|R
