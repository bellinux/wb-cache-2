5|$|A {{study by}} Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing <b>initials</b> with members {{in a group}} can {{increase}} the quality of group work. In a study ofundergraduatestudents they found that groups sharing <b>initials</b> performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had {{a higher proportion of}} shared <b>initials</b> exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared <b>initials.</b>|$|E
5|$|A few {{controversial}} {{studies have}} linked performance to <b>initials.</b> However, McCullough and Williams {{found no evidence}} of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name <b>initials</b> C or D get lower grades than others with <b>initials</b> A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.|$|E
5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or <b>initials</b> are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for <b>initials</b> in Japan, where name <b>initials</b> are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E
50|$|The <b>initial</b> /ʜ/ denotes a voiced {{laryngeal}} onset {{functioning as}} a zero <b>initial.</b> It was almost in complementary distribution with the <b>initial</b> /ŋ/, and the two have merged in most modern dialects as a zero <b>initial,</b> ŋ, ɣ or n.The <b>initial</b> /ʋ/ has also merged with the zero <b>initial</b> and the /w/ medial in the standard language.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Initial</b> Approach Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the <b>initial</b> {{approach}} segment of an instrument approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one <b>Initial</b> approach fix and <b>initial</b> approach segment. The <b>initial</b> approach fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The <b>initial</b> approach fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the approach. When <b>initial</b> approach fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no <b>initial</b> approach segment.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} the dimes were released, {{relations}} with the USSR were deteriorating, and Sinnock's <b>initials,</b> JS, were deemed by some to refer to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, placed there by a communist sympathizer. Once these rumors reached Congress, the Mint sent out press releases debunking this myth. Despite the Mint's denial, there were rumors into the 1950s {{that there had been}} a secret deal at the Yalta Conference to honor Stalin on a U.S. coin. The controversy was given fresh life in 1948 with the posthumous release of Sinnock's Franklin half dollar, which bears his <b>initials</b> JRS.|$|E

5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets.

The effect is most prominent for <b>initials,</b> but even when <b>initials</b> are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected <b>initial</b> positions and velocities compared to random <b>initial</b> positions and velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for <b>initial</b> positions and the use of <b>initial</b> velocities that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R
5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add the <b>initials</b> of the {{designer}} (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the <b>initials</b> were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|E

5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the <b>initials</b> of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable <b>initials</b> but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E

5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only <b>initials</b> were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding <b>initials</b> a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E
50|$|The 疑 <b>initial</b> of Middle Chinese has {{not been}} {{preserved}} by many modern varieties of Chinese.
