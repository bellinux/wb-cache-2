5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not <b>grow</b> <b>up.</b> The editor said his concerns were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.|$|E

5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they <b>grow</b> <b>up.</b> Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E

5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome.

5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} discussed it {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> under a totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997.

5|$|There is {{no single}} treatment, and the {{effectiveness}} of particular interventions is supported by only limited data.

Most children improve as they <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> but social and communication difficulties usually persist.
