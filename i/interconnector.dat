25|$|In {{addition}} to the above steps, Israel and Cyprus are considering implementing the proposed EuroAsia <b>Interconnector</b> project. This consists of laying a 2000MW HVDC undersea power cable between them and between Cyprus and Greece, thus connecting Israel to the greater European power grid.

40|$|In {{commercial}} crystalline silicon PV modules usually {{two parallel}} metallic strings {{are used to}} collect the current from the grid and interconnect the individual cells. Typically, the cross section of these cell <b>interconnectors</b> is rectangular, they are approx. 100 µm high and about 2 - 3 mm wide, resulting in a 4 - 6 % shadow loss. The basic idea {{of this paper is}} to use structured cell <b>interconnectors</b> to increase the short circuit current by taking advantage from multiple internal reflections inside the module compound. A structure on top of the <b>interconnectors</b> has to be designed in a way that light being incident on the <b>interconnectors</b> is reflected under an angel suitable for total internal reflection at the glass/air boundary. A new structuring type called TRITOP has been experimentally and theoretically investigated to check whether a significant enhancement of PV module performance is achievable. An increase of 2 - 3 % relative in module efficiency seems to be cost-effectively transferable to PV module production soon...|$|R

40|$|The EU {{energy system}} is {{becoming}} increasingly integrated, with the pursuit of common energy and climate policies and the progression towards a single energy market. <b>Interconnectors</b> – cross-border power cables over which electricity is exchanged between countries – play {{an important part in}} this integrated energy market and enhance energy security. In 2016, around 7 % of Britain’s energy consumption was met through <b>interconnectors</b> with France and the Netherlands [Ward, 2016]. Moreover, there is substantial power trading between the Republic of Ireland and mainland Britain and between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The vote for Brexit in 2016 has created uncertainty about the future expansion of these <b>interconnectors</b> [Buchan & Keay, 2016] and this has implications for the security and competitiveness of the UK’s power supply, especially {{in the context of the}} phase out of coal power generation and uncertainty over the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant project. In this paper, we address the question of the effect of reduced capacity through <b>interconnectors,</b> as a possible consequence of Brexit, on the British power system. The effect of reduced capacity on aspects including wholesale power prices in Britain and the import-export structures will be analyzed. A sensitivity analysis using the EMME electricity market model, developed in Forschungszentrum Jülich, will be undertaken to model the effects of a reduction of net transfer capacity through <b>interconnectors</b> on these different features of the power system. In particular, the EMME tool will allow the modelling of changes to the structure of the power trading relationships between Britain and other EU countries. The regional breakdown of the EMME model also enables an analysis of the modelled effects on different regions of the UK, namely Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland...|$|R
25|$|In Europe a mixed {{situation}} exists. Considerable {{nuclear power}} capacities have been developed, notably in Belgium, Finland. France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. In many countries development {{of nuclear power}} has been stopped and phased out by legal actions. In Italy {{the use of nuclear}} power was barred by a referendum in 1987, however this is now under revision. Ireland in 2008 also had no plans to change its non-nuclear stance, although since the opening in 2012 of the East-West <b>Interconnector</b> between Ireland and Britain, it has been supported by British nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, {{a nuclear}} power plant was first {{proposed}} in 1968. It was to be built during the 1970s at Carnsore Point in County Wexford. The plan called for first one, then ultimately four plants to be built at the site, but it was dropped after strong opposition from environmental groups, and Ireland has remained without nuclear power since. Despite opposing nuclear power (and nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield), Ireland is to open an <b>interconnector</b> to the mainland UK to buy electricity, which is, in some part, the product of nuclear power.|$|E

40|$|The UK Government has {{developed}} a carefully designed Capacity Mechanism to ensure security of supply in the GB electricity system. This paper criticises the methods {{used to determine the}} amount of capacity to procure, and argues that the amount finally proposed is likely to be excessive, particularly (but not exclusively) in ignoring the contribution from <b>interconnectors.</b> More broadly, there has been too little attention to either the political economy, or the option value aspects. Procuring too little is risky, but fear of'the lights going out' can easily become a catch-all argument for excessive procurement, and associated subsidy. The risk of over-procurement, particularly of new capacity on long-term contracts, is that it drives up the costs to consumers; undermines renewable energy by transferring capped resources from renewable to fossil fuel producers; and impedes the Single Market including by weakening the business case for future <b>interconnectors.</b> The paper argues that the development of technologies and markets, particularly on the demand- side and of potentially available – 'latent' – capacity - further lowers the risks and increases options. This implies greater potential to defer more capacity procurement – and enhances the value of a more appropriate treatment of <b>interconnectors</b> in security assessments...|$|R
