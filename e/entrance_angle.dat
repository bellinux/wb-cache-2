Before The Rock made his <b>entrance,</b> <b>Angle</b> and Triple H fought at ringside, with Triple H delivering a Pedigree on Angle on the commentator's announce table, which broke prematurely, resulting in Angle being Kayfabe injured. After the incident, The Rock made his entrance down to the ring. He wrestled Triple H as Angle was attended by EMTs, who transported Angle backstage. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley then {{came down to the}} ring and attempted to interfere by hitting The Rock with the WWF Championship belt. She accidentally hit Triple H, however, which resulted in Triple H ordering McMahon to the backstage area. Angle returned to the ring midway through the match, alongside McMahon, and attacked Triple H. As Triple H recuperated, Angle called McMahon to give him a sledgehammer, but Angle and Triple H brawled over the sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H accidentally hitting McMahon. This situation allowed The Rock to throw Angle over the top rope onto ringside and deliver a People's Elbow on Triple H into a pinfall to win the match and retain the WWF Championship.|$|E

For example, the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> between an automobile approaching a bicycle at an intersection 90 degrees apart is larger than the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> for a bicycle directly in front of an automobile on a straight road.

Lubrication is added at the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle.</b> The lube can be in powdered soap form. If the lubricant is soap, the friction of the drawing of wire heats the soap to liquid form and coats the wire. The wire should never actually {{come in contact with}} the die.

Another feature is that the range of <b>entrance</b> <b>angles</b> for which bent crystal channeling occurs is also increased in passing through several bent layers.

50|$|As a ray {{of light}} enters the {{transparent}} material, the ray's direction is deflected, based on both the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> (typically measured relative to the perpendicular to the surface) and the material's refractive index, and according to Snell's Law. A beam passing through an object like a prism or water drop is deflected twice: once entering, and again when exiting. The sum of these two deflections is called the deviation angle.|$|E
50|$|The RI {{value is}} also a {{function}} of the spatial geometry between the observer, light source, and reflector. Figures 1 and 2 show the observation angle and <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> between the automobile's headlights, bicycle, and driver. The observation angle is the angle formed by the light beam and the driver's line of sight. Observation angle is {{a function of the}} distance between the headlights and the driver's eye, and the distance to the reflector. Traffic engineers use an observation angle of 0.2 degrees to simulate a reflector target about 800 feet in front of a passenger automobile. As the observation angle increases, the reflector performance decreases. For example, a truck has a large separation between the headlight and the driver's eye compared to a passenger vehicle. A bicycle reflector appears brighter to the passenger car driver than to the truck driver at the same distance from the vehicle to the reflector.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a grouser {{developed for the}} wheels of lunar exploration rovers to measure sinkage. The wheels, which are intended to traverse loose soil such as lunar regolith, contain grousers that transfer thrust to the wheels and thus {{to the body of}} the rover. The interaction between the wheel (with grousers) and the loose soil can be described using a kinematic model. When traversing loose soil, the wheel sinks into the soil, which necessitates knowledge of the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> needed in order to avoid this problem. If the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> is known, the sinkage can be measured in real time before adverse conditions occur. Because of the importance and usefulness of detecting the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> of the wheel, we herein propose a grouser with an embedded tactile sensor.

30|$|The problem is, when a rover with rigid wheels {{traverses}} loose soil, {{there is}} a possibility of extremely bad traction conditions. This means that slipping and sinking behaviors can occur. The wheels of the MER was sinking into the soil and could not move; a situation that is not easily rectified. When the rovers are traversing loose soil, we have to consider the condition of the ground under the wheels. The relation between the wheel and loose soil can be described using Terramechanics [4]. Using terramechanics, the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle,</b> which can indicate the depth that the wheel is sinking into the soil, is used to lead the drawbar pull. Many researchers are studied about Terramechanics [5]–[8]. Ding et al. summarized the most recent work on Terramechanics [9]. It is necessary to understand the range of the contacting angle between the wheel and loose soil for the derivation of drawbar pull. The contacting angle is shown using the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> and the leaving angle. If the <b>entrance</b> <b>angle</b> can be detected while the rovers are traversing, the drawbar pull and the sinkage can be derived “real time”. It is effective to detect sinkage to determine the rovers moving path.|$|E
