5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous <b>hermaphroditism</b> typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential <b>hermaphroditism,</b> individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hermaphroditism</b> {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), although a few species exhibit <b>hermaphroditism.</b> The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E
5|$|Some insects use parthenogenesis, {{a process}} in which the female can {{reproduce}} and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male. Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction. In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction. Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid. More rarely, some insects display <b>hermaphroditism,</b> in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of <b>hermaphroditism</b> in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely <b>hermaphroditism.</b> In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E
5|$|The phylum has a {{wide range}} of body forms, {{including}} the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. Most species are hermaphrodites, and juveniles of at least some species are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. This combination of <b>hermaphroditism</b> and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hermaphroditism</b> {{occurs when}} a given {{individual}} in a species possesses {{both male and female}} reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, and then the other. <b>Hermaphroditism</b> is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with gonochorism, where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but <b>hermaphroditism</b> is known to occur in 14 families of teleost fishes.|$|E
25|$|Money {{introduced}} numerous definitions {{related to}} gender in journal {{articles in the}} 1950s, many {{of them as a}} result of his studies of <b>Hermaphroditism.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are noted}} {{differences}} between different BALB/c substrains, though these {{are thought to}} be due to mutation rather than genetic contamination. The BALB/cWt is unusual in that 3% of progeny display true <b>hermaphroditism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these forms is <b>hermaphroditism,</b> where both the eggs and sperm are produced by the same individual, but is not a type of parthenogenesis. This is seen in three species of Icerya scale insects.|$|E
25|$|Fertility {{has been}} {{documented}} in intersex people. An XY-predominant intersex person with true <b>hermaphroditism</b> (96% mosaic) can give birth. A case of an XY woman has been reported who experienced regular menstruation, two natural pregnancies, and gave birth.|$|E
25|$|Self-incompatibility (SI) is {{a general}} name for several genetic {{mechanisms}} in angiosperms, which prevent self-fertilization and thus encourage outcrossing and allogamy. It {{should not be confused}} with genetically controlled physical or temporal mechanisms that prevent self-pollination, such as heterostyly and sequential <b>hermaphroditism</b> (dichogamy).|$|E
25|$|Affected persons may be {{identified}} by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, ambiguous genitalia and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or eye pigmentation (heterochromia). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, genitals of both sexes may be formed: either ovary and testis, or combined ovotestes, in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as true <b>hermaphroditism.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Dillema a {{forensic}} test on body cells obtained from her clothing {{found that there was}} a Y-chromosome in Dillema's DNA which could mean she was a genetic mosaic. Dillema was probably an 46XX/46XY woman also known as ovotesticular DSD or true <b>hermaphroditism.</b> Most of the other women on the team at the time suspect it was an attempt by Jan and Fanny Blankers to eliminate an opponent, although this has never been confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Many fish change sex {{over the}} course of their lifespan, a {{phenomenon}} called sequential <b>hermaphroditism.</b> In clownfish, smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female. In many wrasses the opposite is trueâ€”most fish are initially female and become male when they reach a certain size. Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes {{over the course}} of their lifetime, but at any given point they are either female or male.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the general <b>hermaphroditism,</b> in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain the same single sex throughout their lives.|$|E
500|$|Ideas about women's {{sexuality}} {{were linked}} to contemporary understanding of female physiology. The vagina was considered an inward version of the penis; where nature's perfection created a man, often nature {{was thought to be}} trying to right itself by prolapsing the vagina to form a penis in some women. These sex changes were later thought to be cases of hermaphrodites, and <b>hermaphroditism</b> became synonymous with female same-sex desire. Medical consideration of <b>hermaphroditism</b> depended upon measurements of the clitoris; a longer, engorged clitoris was thought to be used by women to penetrate other women. Penetration was the focus of concern in all sexual acts, and a woman who was thought to have uncontrollable desires because of her engorged clitoris was called a [...] "tribade" [...] (literally, one who rubs). Not only was an abnormally engorged clitoris thought to create lusts in some women that led them to masturbate, but pamphlets warning women about masturbation leading to such oversized organs were written as cautionary tales. For a while, masturbation and lesbian sex carried the same meaning.|$|E
500|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries, {{travellers}} to Africa provided further {{descriptions of}} the species. Leo Africanus repeated {{some of the old}} concepts on the hyena, with the addition of describing its legs and feet as similar to those of men. In 1551, Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner rejected the belief of the hyena's <b>hermaphroditism,</b> and theorised that it originated from confusion over an androgynous fish bearing the same name. He adds three other animals within the category of hyenas, including an Ethiopian quadruped named [...] "Crocotta", which was thought to be a hybrid between a hyena and a lioness. Sir Thomas Browne also argued against the hyena's supposed <b>hermaphroditism,</b> stating that all animals follow their own [...] "Law of Coition", and that a hermaphrodite would transgress this. Sir Walter Raleigh, in an attempt to rationalise how Noah's Ark could have fitted all extant species of animal, wrote that hyenas were hybrids between foxes and wolves which originated after the Great Flood. References to the spotted hyena's vocalisations are referenced in numerous contemporary examples of English literature, including Shakespeare's As You Like It and George Chapman's Eastward Ho. John Milton, in his Samson Agonistes, compares the species to Delila.|$|E
500|$|The sexes {{are usually}} {{separate}} in bivalves but some <b>hermaphroditism</b> is known. The gonads are located {{close to the}} intestines, and either open into the nephridia, or through a separate pore into the mantle cavity. The ripe gonads of male and females release sperm and eggs into the water column. Spawning may take place continually or be triggered by environmental factors such as day length, water temperature, or the presence of sperm in the water. Some species are [...] "dribble spawners", but others release their gametes in batches or all at once. Mass spawning events sometimes take place when all the bivalves in an area synchronise their release of spawn.|$|E
500|$|Middlesex {{is written}} {{in the form of}} a memoir, and {{switches}} between the first and the thirdperson in several spots. Used as a comedic device, the third person narratives illustrate Cal's estrangement from Calliope: When he refers to her in the third person, he is identifying her as someone other than him. Patricia Chu, a scholar of English literature, noted the effectiveness of this style in the chapter in which the adolescent Callie searches for information on <b>hermaphroditism.</b> As the teenager reads Webster's Dictionary, following the trail of definitions related to her condition, she reaches the entry for hermaphrodite. The narration switches from personal to external, lending poignancy to the character's final discovery as she confronts the word [...] "monster".|$|E
500|$|Callie {{inherited}} the mutation for {{a gene that}} causes 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which impedes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. While the former hormone causes the brain to become masculine, it is the latter that molds male genitals. When Callie reaches puberty, her testosterone levels increase significantly, resulting {{in the formation of}} a larger Adam's apple, the broadening of her muscles, the deepening of her voice, and the augmentation of her clitoris to resemble a penis. Doctors determine that Callie has the XY chromosomes of a male after inspecting Callie's genitalia. Callie's parents bring her to New York City to see Dr. Peter Luce, a foremost expert on <b>hermaphroditism,</b> who believes she should retain her female identity. Luce plans a gender reassignment surgery to make her a female. However, Callie knows that she is sexually attracted to females, and decides to run away to pursue a male identity. When Cal has a sexual relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie {{at the end of the}} book, he is able to love [...] "without the need to penetrate the object of his desire".|$|E
500|$|Like Avicenna, Magnus {{also used}} the word virga for the clitoris, but {{employed}} it for {{the male and female}} genitals; despite his efforts to give equal ground to the clitoris, the cycle of suppression and rediscovery of the organ continued, and a 16th-century justification for clitoridectomy appears to have been confused by <b>hermaphroditism</b> and the imprecision created by the word nymphae substituted for the word clitoris. Nymphotomia was a medical operation to excise an unusually large clitoris, but what was considered [...] "unusually large" [...] was often a matter of perception. The procedure was routinely performed on Egyptian women, due to physicians such as Jacques DalÃ©champs who believed that this version of the clitoris was [...] "an unusual feature that occurred in almost all Egyptian women [...] some of ours, so that when they find themselves in the company of other women, or their clothes rub them while they walk or their husbands wish to approach them, it erects like a male penis and indeed they use it to play with other women, as their husbands would do... Thus the parts are cut".|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} novel a [...] "big-hearted, restless story" [...] and rated it an A minus. Lisa Zeidner of The Washington Post opined that Middlesex [...] "provides not only incest Ã  la Ada and a Lolita-style road trip, but enough dense detail to keep fans of close reading manically busy." [...] Tami Hoag of People concurred, writing that [...] "this feast {{of a novel}} is thrilling in the scope of its {{imagination}} and surprising in its tenderness". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon agreed, praising Middlesex as an [...] "epic and wondrous" [...] novel filled with numerous characters and historical occurrences. Mendelsohn praised Middlesex for its [...] "dense narrative, interwoven with sardonic, fashionably postmodern commentary." [...] However, he criticized the novel as a disjointed hybrid. He wrote Eugenides was successful {{with the story of}} the Greek immigrants, which he described as [...] "authenti", but mishandled the hermaphrodite material, which Mendelsohn characterized as [...] "unpersuasiv". The Economist review stated that a more concise, concentrated depiction of <b>hermaphroditism</b> would have made the book more [...] "fun to read". Jeff Zaleski of Publishers Weekly praised Eugenides' portrayal of the girl, Callie, and the man Cal. Zaleski wrote that [...] "t's difficult to imagine any serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender." [...] Paul Quinn of Contemporary Literary Criticism commended the novel, writing: [...] "That Eugenides manages to move us without sinking into sentiment shows how successfully he has avoided the tentacles of irony which grip so many writers of his generation." [...] Christina McCarroll of The Christian Science Monitor wrote that [...] "Eugenides wrangles with a destiny that mutates and recombines like restless chromosomes, in a novel of extraordinary flexibility, scope, and emotional depth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fossil record}} {{indicates}} an evolutionary divergence of Aulopidae {{dating back to}} the Early Cretaceous or Late Jurassic, with most extant families appearing by the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene. [...] Aulopoids are a small group of benthic fishes that inhabit coral reefs and continental shelves, including lizardfishes (Synodus, Saurida) and flagfin fishes (Aulopus). [...] Integrated studies regarding deep-sea evolutionary adaptations, simultaneous <b>hermaphroditism,</b> and tubular eyes suggest that the stem species of lizardfishes arose in a marine environment with separate sexes, and round eyes that were laterally directed. [...] The study also identified the suborder Alepisauroidei as the largest and oldest known vertebrae clade with the reproductive strategy of simultaneous <b>hermaphroditism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pliny {{notes that}} [...] "there are {{even those who}} are born of both sexes, whom we call hermaphrodites, at one time androgyni" [...] (andr-, [...] "man", and gyn-, [...] "woman", from the Greek). Some {{commentators}} see <b>hermaphroditism</b> as a [...] "violation of social boundaries, especially those as fundamental to daily life as male and female". The era also saw an historical account of a congenital eunuch.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek term [...] "eunuch" [...] {{is usually}} {{used to refer}} {{forcibly}} emasculated men, {{but it is also}} used in the Septuagint to denote certain foreign political officials (resembling the meaning of [...] "eunuch"). This category does not include men who were born without visible testicles (conditions including cryptorchidism), or without a visible penis (conditions including <b>hermaphroditism).</b> There is dispute, even in traditional Judaism, about whether this prohibited group of men should include those who have become, at some point since their birth, emasculated {{as the result of a}} disease ...|$|E
2500|$|Currently, <b>hermaphroditism</b> {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.|$|E
2500|$|Particularly among fishes, <b>hermaphroditism</b> can {{pay off in}} {{situations}} where one sex {{is more likely to}} survive and reproduce, perhaps because it is larger. Anemone fishes are sequential hermaphrodites which are born as males, and become females only when they are mature. Anemone fishes live together monogamously in an anemone, protected by the anemone stings. The males do not have to compete with other males, and female anemone fish are typically larger. When a female dies a juvenile (male) anemone fish moves in, and [...] "the resident male then turns into a female and reproductive advantages of the large femaleâ€“small male combination continue". In other fishes sex changes are reversible. For example, if some gobies are grouped by sex (male or female), some will switch sex.|$|E
2500|$|Like other lanternsharks, {{the brown}} lanternshark is ovoviviparous, meaning the young hatch inside the mother's uterus and are {{sustained}} by a yolk sac. The litter size is 918. Newborns measure [...] in length. Males reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , and females at a length of [...] A study of brown lanternsharks in Suruga Bay by Yano and Tanaka (1989) found a 23% prevalence of <b>hermaphroditism</b> within the population. Of the 16 hermaphrodites examined, 15 were functional females (and some were pregnant) that also possessed well-developed claspers (male intromittent organs), while one was a functional male with ovarian tissue in the left testis. The reason why so many sharks in Suruga Bay are hermaphroditic is unclear, but has been speculated to relate to pollution.|$|E
2500|$|Usually hermaphrodites are sequential, {{meaning they}} can switch sex, usually from female to male (protogyny). This can happen if a {{dominant}} male {{is removed from}} a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male. This is found amongst coral reef fishes such as groupers, parrotfishes and wrasses. It is less common for a male to switch to a female (protandry). As an example, most wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system. <b>Hermaphroditism</b> allows for complex mating systems. [...] Wrasses exhibit three different mating systems: polygynous, lek-like, and promiscuous mating systems. [...] Group spawning and pair spawning occur within mating systems. The type of spawning that occurs depends on male body size. [...] Labroids typically exhibit broadcast spawning, releasing high amounts of planktonic eggs, which are broadcast by tidal currents; adult wrasses have no interaction with offspring. [...] Wrasse of a particular subgroup of the Labridae family Labrini do not exhibit broadcast spawning.|$|E
2500|$|German-Swiss {{pathologist}} Edwin Klebs {{is sometimes}} noted {{for using the}} word [...] "pseudohermaphroditism" [...] in his taxonomy of intersexuality in 1876, although the word is clearly not his invention as is sometimes reported; {{the history of the}} word [...] "pseudohermaphrodite" [...] and the corresponding desire to separate [...] "true" [...] hermaphrodites from [...] "false", [...] "spurious", or [...] "pseudo" [...] hermaphrodites, dates back to at least 1709, when Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch used it in a publication describing a subject with testes and a mostly female phenotype. [...] "Pseudohermaphrodite" [...] also appeared in the Acta Eruditorum later that same year, in a review of Ruysch's work. [...] Also some evidence indicates the word was already being used by the German and French medical community long before Klebs used it; German physiologist Johannes Peter MÃ¼ller equated [...] "pseudohermaphroditism" [...] with a subclass of <b>hermaphroditism</b> from Saint-Hilaire's taxonomy in a publication dated 1834, and by the 1840s [...] "pseudohermaphroditism" [...] was appearing in several French and German publications, including dictionaries.|$|E
