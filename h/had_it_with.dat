25|$|The Santo Niño Doctor de los Enfermos is at a side altar in {{the parish}} of San Francisco de Asís en Tepeaca, Puebla. The image is old but devotion to it is {{relatively}} recent. The image used {{to belong to a}} nun of the Concepción Béistegui Hospital in Mexico City. When the nun was transferred to Tepeaca, she brought the image with her and <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> her as she treated the sick. This image has had its own feast day at this church since 1961 on the 30 of April.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} further {{attention when}} fans noticed the U.S. TV edit {{of the film}} purposely dubbed over foul language, replacing it with nonsense words, for family audiences. An example is Samuel L. Jackson's line {{toward the end of}} the film, [...] "I have <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!", which is replaced with [...] "I have <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane!".|$|E

500|$|She {{said of her}} {{decision}} to finish the show, [...] "I love television, {{and if it was}} possible for me to work in it more, then I would; but because of the position I've put myself in of being the only writer on the show, I can't physically work in it that often. I've just <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> sketch shows for a bit – people have liked it, and I want to stop while they still like it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} race, Kurt Busch drove to victory lane. During the press conference, Busch said, [...] "To be in those positions, {{you have to}} have a good {{drafting}} partner. I had that with Regan Smith , <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> [...] McMurray on Saturday night [...] But you can't be in those positions if you don't build a great race car." [...] Also by winning the race, Kurt Busch would be the leader at the start of the Daytona 500, after Earnhardt was involved in an accident. Second-place finisher Smith stated: [...] "Kurt (Busch) and I worked good all day and we had good cars hooked up together. I hope we find each other and do the same thing on Sunday." [...] The first event took 58 minutes and 12 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.065 seconds.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, however, The Village Voice ran {{reports of}} the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that {{included}} unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: [...] "forces of faggotry", [...] "limp wrists", and [...] "Sunday fag follies". A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of The Village Voice. Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people. The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: [...] "The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> oppression." ...|$|E

500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the Internet buzz for {{what had been a}} minor film in their 2006 line-up, New Line Cinema ordered five days of additional shooting in early March 2006 (principal photography had wrapped in September 2005). While re-shoots normally imply problems with a film, the producers opted to add new scenes to the film to change the MPAA rating from PG-13 to R and bring it in line with growing fan expectations. The most notable addition was a revision of a catchphrase from the film that was parodied on the Internet by fans of the film, capitalizing on Samuel L. Jackson's typically foul-mouthed and violent film persona: [...] "Enough is enough! I have <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!". Subsequently, the public responded favorably to this creative change and marketing strategy, leading some members of the press to speculate that [...] "the movie has grown from something of a joke into a phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|The final {{broadcast}} episode, [...] "Jack or Knave?", which {{aired on}} 28 December 1978, saw an ambiguous ending, {{with the main}} character, Jack Regan, temporarily locked up after being implicated in a corruption scandal, {{of which he is}} finally exonerated. He then announces that he's <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the Squad, and the series ends with him resigning in disgust.|$|E
2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part of it was that I had really <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial {{success of their}} 1997 album OK Computer, the members of Radiohead suffered burnout, and songwriter Thom Yorke suffered a mental breakdown. Drummer Phil Selway said Radiohead worried {{that the success of}} OK Computer had [...] "turned us into a one-trick band". Bassist Colin Greenwood said: [...] "We felt we had to change everything. There were other guitar bands out there trying to do similar things. We had to move on." [...] Guitarist Ed O'Brien had hoped Radiohead's fourth album would comprise [...] "snappy", melodic guitar songs, but Yorke stated: [...] "There was no chance of the album sounding like that. I'd completely <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> melody. I just wanted rhythm. All melodies to me were pure embarrassment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> us {{some time}} before the public {{received}} it," [...] said the future under-secretary, {{with a look at}} once condescending and conceited.|$|E

60|$|What's {{the use of}} {{thinking}} you can stop people drinking merely by cutting off whiskey and brandy? The only effect is to drive them to taking lemon sour and sarsaparilla and cherry pectoral and caroka cordial and things they wouldn't have touched before. So {{in the long run}} they drink more than ever. The point is that you can't prevent people having a good time, no matter how hard you try. If they can't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> lager beer and brandy, they'll <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> plain soda and lemon pop, and so the whole gloomy scheme of the temperance people breaks down, anyway.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I replied, blankly. [...] "The {{last one}} I got was in May--about the middle. I <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> me. You {{certainly}} {{asked me to}} come then. Dick, don't you want me--now?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I do," [...] Burton replied. [...] "If I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> me now, I {{should play}} that tune. I should play others like it.

60|$|Feeling quite {{weak and}} faint, {{as if he}} had really been struck by some evil {{electric}} fluid, he walked on. And as soon as he began to walk, he began to reason.

6000|$|Dor.

6000|$|... "Even now," [...] Bellamy said slowly, {{with his}} eyes fixed upon {{the wall of the}} room, and a dawning light growing {{stronger}} every moment in his face, [...] "even now I believe that Von Behrling made a mistake. An envelope such as this had been arranged for him to show the others or leave at the Austrian Embassy in case of emergency. He <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> him in his pocket-book. He even told me so. God in Heaven, he gave me the wrong one!" ...|$|E
60|$|Christie liked romance, {{and now she}} <b>had</b> <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> a very sombre {{reality to}} give it an added charm. No Juliet ever welcomed her Romeo more joyfully than she welcomed David when he paid her a flying visit unexpectedly; no Bayard ever had a more devoted lady in his tent than David, when his wife came through every {{obstacle}} to bring him comforts or to nurse the few wounds he received. Love-letters, written beside watch-fires and sick-beds, flew to and fro like carrier-doves with wondrous speed; and nowhere in all the brave and busy land was there a fonder pair than this, although their honeymoon was spent apart in camp and hospital, and well they knew that there might never be for them a happy going home together.|$|E
6000|$|Fane kept {{feeling in}} one pocket and then slapped himself {{over the other}} pockets. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "I haven't got it with me. I must have left it in my room. I just {{received}} a letter from Frank--Mr. Gregory, you know, I always call him Frank--and I thought I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> me. He was asking about Middlemount; and I wanted to read you what he said. But I'll find it upstairs. He's out of college, now, and he's begun his studies in the divinity school. He's at Andover. I don't {{know what to make of}} Frank, oftentimes," [...] the clerk continued, confidentially. [...] "I tell him he's a kind of a survival, in religion; he's so aesthetic." [...] It seemed to Fane that he had not meant aesthetic, exactly, but he could not ask Clementina what the word was. He went on to say, [...] "He's a grand good fellow, Frank is, but he don't make enough allowance for human nature. He's more like one of those old fashioned orthodox. I go in for having a good time, so long as you don't do anybody else any hurt." ...|$|E
