5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> {{were not very}} detailed, {{and many of the}} details {{provided}} did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> was videotaped, at the {{beginning}} of the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in the <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his <b>first</b> <b>interview,</b> on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5000|$|The National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women and Mature Women (NLSW) {{comprises}} {{two separate}} surveys. The Young Women's survey includes {{women who were}} ages 14-24 when <b>first</b> <b>interviewed</b> in 1968.

The Older Men's survey, which was discontinued in 1990, includes men who were ages 45-59 when <b>first</b> <b>interviewed</b> in 1966.|$|R

5|$|In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, {{joined by}} several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and, despite {{military}} help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Amin {{was forced to}} flee into exile by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. He escaped first to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for his staying out of politics. Amin lived {{for a number of}} years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania war for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin in 1980, and secured the <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> with him since his deposition.|$|E
5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} between Kane and Gene Snitsky. At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The next night on Raw, Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, {{give him a}} rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, The Highlight Reel. Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice. Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky. During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring. This led to Kane accidentally falling {{on top of her}} after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention. The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week. On the September 27 episode of Raw, in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions. The following week, Lita gave her <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> since the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky. During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was not his fault. Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense. This led Bischoff to announce a Weapon of Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be able to vote on whether a lead pipe, a steel chain, or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.|$|E

30|$|We use {{data from}} the 2006 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a {{longitudinal}} study of U.S. households aged 50 and above, to assess how older-aged households fared during the Great Recession according to their nativity. Since its launch in 1992, the HRS has collected information on {{a broad range of}} topics–including work, income, wealth, retirement and health–every two years from various cohorts. 4 The 2006 wave provides us with a pre-recession baseline, whereas the 2010 wave is ideal for assessing how households’ wealth fared post-recession. Our sample includes information on five cohorts: (1) Initial HRS cohort, born 1931 to 1941. This cohort was <b>first</b> <b>interviewed</b> in 1992 and subsequently every two years; (2) AHEAD cohort, born before 1924, initially a separate study (The Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old). This cohort was <b>first</b> <b>interviewed</b> in 1993, next in 1995 and 1998, and subsequently every two years; (3) Children of Depression (CODA), born 1924 to 1930; 4) War Baby (WB) cohort, born 1942 to 1947 cohort, who were <b>first</b> <b>interviewed</b> in 1998 and subsequently every two years; and the (5) Early Baby Boomer (EBB) cohort, born 1948 to 1953, was <b>first</b> <b>interviewed</b> in 2004 and every two years thereafter. In addition to respondents from eligible birth years, the survey interviewed the spouse (or partner) of the respondent, regardless of their age. All asset and wealth values are expressed in 2010 dollars.|$|R

25|$|Man of Steel also {{illustrated}} significant {{events in}} Superman's relationships, {{such as his}} <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> with Lois Lane and his first encounter with Gotham City's Batman. Lex Luthor was reinvented by Wolfman and portrayed as a corrupt business tycoon who hated Superman for exposing his unethical business practices. Superman's adoptive parents lived into his adulthood, providing hooks that Byrne felt made the character more human.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2010, {{and in part}} in {{recognition}} of Clarke's novel, Alex Kudera {{began a series of}} interviews with novelists on the topic of Exley and his influence on their work.

25|$|Alan Kurdi's father, Abdullah Kurdi, {{has stated}} {{in some of}} his {{interviews}} that the inflatable boat became uncontrollable as its engine had failed, with the 'captain' abandoning it and everyone else.

25|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} year, goaltending was a focus of training camp. After choosing to keep Luongo, the team did not hear from him.

Shortly after the change in representation, his new agents announced that Luongo would attend training camp.
