5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> {{part of me}} / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was {{at the grocery store}} and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

I was depressed because <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> good job, but I just didn't miss it. Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn't miss, but I {{have a lot of}} good memories of doing that strip.|$|E
500|$|According to Bradman, Morris' {{success was}} due to his {{powerful}} wrists and forearms. Bradman interpreted Morris' unorthodox methods—he often defended with his bat not straight—as a sign of genius. Ian Johnson believed that Morris' idiosyncratic technique was a strength, as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition. Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day, Morris had a penchant for lofting his drives, backing his ability to clear the infield. Benaud rated Morris alongside Neil Harvey as having the best footwork against spin bowling among batsmen after the Second World War. Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis {{of the length of}} the ball, and as a result, he quickly and decisively moved forward or back. Morris' productivity declined {{in the latter half of}} his career, something he put down to the break-up of his opening pairing with Barnes. Morris' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs, leading him to remark that [...] "When Siddy [...] went, <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot of support because he'd always get ones." [...] Morris was also known for his unselfishness, often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix-ups while running between wickets, and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish not out to inflate his average.|$|E

500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E

2500|$|Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, this Italianate brick {{row house}} at 1524 Hollins Street {{was the home}} of one of Baltimore’s most famous {{citizens}} – noted Baltimore Sun journalist and author Henry Louis Mencken lived here from 1883 {{until his death in}} 1956. Mencken wrote of his home: “I have lived in one house in Baltimore for nearly 45 years. It has changed in that time, as I have – but somehow it still remains the same.... It {{is as much a part}} of me as my two hands. If I had to leave it I’d be as certainly crippled as if <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> leg.” ...|$|E

[...] Rabbi Mikhailashvili stated, [...] "The Jewish community mourns the sudden loss of Zurab Zhvania. As a Jew, he had a close relationship to the Jewish community in Georgia."

[...] He also believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In 1800 he wrote: “I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part. Thirteen years ago <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> brother, and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit, and see him in my remembrance, in the region of my imagination.

In August 2010 she gave birth to a second son. On 3 November 2011 it was reported that she was pregnant with a third son, and she gave birth in March 2012. When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said [...] "Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough.

He was like a professor to me. What education I have, I owe to him.” [...] Haggard said he was driven by a desire to play guitar and have total knowledge of it. He is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records and many encyclopedias. He said those books describe him as a country singer, balladeer, composer of [...] "Okie from Muskogee" [...] and [...] "the poet of the common man." [...] But Merle Haggard hoped the world would remember him as [...] "the greatest jazz guitar player in the world that loved to play country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing [...] "Run" [...] in 2000. In an interview with Michael Odell, from Q magazine, Lightbody explained the song was not written about [...] "being a child", as he tended to say. He described: [...] "I was on a massive bender and one night I was drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn found me in the stairwell with blood {{coming out of my}} head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." [...] In an interview with Daily Mail in 2009, Lightbody added: [...] "We had nothing. I was in a flat in Glasgow. No doubt it was raining. The song was me writing about an imagined world, projecting myself into better times." [...] Beside Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2005, Helmet {{were dropped}} by Interscope {{following}} lacklustre sales for Size Matters. Helmet then signed with Warcon Enterprises {{and announced that}} a new album was in the works. Helmet performed at the 2006 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, with a temporary lineup consisting of Charlie Walker on drums, Chris Traynor on bass, and Anthony Truglio (formerly of Gandhi) on guitar. The new album, Monochrome, was recorded and co-produced by Wharton Tiers, who recorded Helmet's first two albums, Strap It On and Meantime. For the album, Hamilton and Traynor returned to the studio with newly recruited drummer, Mike Jost (formerly of Adair). Helmet headlined the 2006 Warped Tour in support of Monochrome, with Jeremy Chatelain reprising his role from the 2005 Size Matters tour. The band later split with Warcon due {{to a variety of}} financial disputes between Hamilton and the label's owners. Hamilton stated [...] "Amphetamine Reptile and Interscope were both fantastic experiences for us, and Warcon {{was the first time that}} I’d actually run into any problems with a label. I trusted somebody and got screwed. I’m not bitter about it, but <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot of money. They never paid me tour support that they were contractually obligated to pay. There were a lot of things. I’ve never seen one penny of royalties from them, but I own the record [...] now, so it’s my record." ...|$|E
