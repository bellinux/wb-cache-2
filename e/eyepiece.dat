5|$|The {{fragment}} {{was found}} by itself in the topsoil near Roskilde. Though the larger helmet may have accompanied the <b>eyepiece</b> into the earth and later been destroyed by ploughing, the fragment may instead have been lost or discarded. It could alternatively have been buried by itself, possibly in an invocation of the one-eyed god Odin.|$|E
5|$|The Gevninge helmet {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish helmet from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised eyebrow above an oval with eyelashes, and originally formed the right <b>eyepiece</b> of the helmet.

5000|$|... 3 in. (76.2 mm) - The {{even larger}} barrel size in 3" [...] <b>eyepieces</b> allows for extreme focal lengths and over 120° {{field of view}} <b>eyepieces.</b> The {{disadvantages}} are that these <b>eyepieces</b> are somewhat rare, extremely expensive, up to 5 lbs in weight, and {{that only a few}} telescopes have focusers large enough to accept them. Their huge weight causes balancing issues in Schmidt-Cassegrains under 10 inches, refractors under 5 inches, and reflectors under 16 inches. Also, due to their large field stops, without larger secondary mirrors most reflectors and Schmidt-Cassegrains will have severe vignetting with these <b>eyepieces.</b> Makers of these <b>eyepieces</b> include Explore Scientific and Siebert Optics. Telescopes that can accept these <b>eyepieces</b> are made by Explore Scientific and Orion Telescopes and Binoculars.|$|R
5000|$|Because Huygens <b>eyepieces</b> do {{not contain}} cement to hold the lens elements, {{telescope}} users sometimes use these <b>eyepieces</b> {{in the role of}} [...] "solar projection", i.e. projecting an image of the Sun onto a screen. Other cemented <b>eyepieces</b> can be damaged by the intense, concentrated light of the Sun.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the advent}} of multicoatings and the {{popularity}} of the Plössl, orthoscopics were the most popular design for telescope <b>eyepieces.</b> Even today these <b>eyepieces</b> are considered good <b>eyepieces</b> for planetary and lunar viewing. Due to their low degree of distortion and the corresponding globe effect, they are less suitable for applications which require an excessive panning of the instrument.|$|R
5|$|Titan {{is never}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, but can be {{observed}} through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the <b>eyepiece</b> and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing. Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2, and mean opposition magnitude 8.4. This compares to +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|Eight centimeters {{wide and}} five tall, the Gevninge <b>eyepiece</b> was molded from bronze and then gilded. An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves forming {{individual}} hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The {{top and the}} bottom of the fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three to some form of face protection such as a facemask or camail.|$|E
5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated <b>eyepiece.</b> The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
5000|$|... 2.7 in. (68.58 mm) - 2.7" [...] <b>eyepieces</b> {{are made}} by a few manufacturers. They allow for {{slightly}} larger fields of view. Many high-end focusers now accept these <b>eyepieces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Eyepieces</b> for {{telescopes and}} microscopes are usually interchanged to {{increase}} or decrease the magnification, and to enable the user to select a type with certain performance characteristics. To allow this, <b>eyepieces</b> come in standardized [...] "Barrel diameters".|$|R
5000|$|... 2 in. (50.8 mm) - The larger barrel size in 2" [...] <b>eyepieces</b> helps {{alleviate}} the limit on focal lengths. The upper limit of focal length with 2" [...] <b>eyepieces</b> is about 55 mm. The trade-off {{is that these}} <b>eyepieces</b> are usually more expensive, will not fit in some telescopes, and may be heavy enough to tip the telescope. These barrel sizes are threaded to take 48 mm filters (or rarely 49 mm).|$|R
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} <b>eyepiece</b> is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Depicting the <b>eyepiece</b> of the {{microscope}} is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E

50|$|The {{telescope}} <b>eyepieces</b> for {{the telescope}} provided a range between 60 and 350 times magnification. The telescope was adapted {{to use more}} modern <b>eyepieces.</b> In its day the Airdrie Observatory telescope {{would have been considered}} to be a research grade telescope.|$|R
50|$|Wide-field {{binoculars}} are possible, but require bulkier, heavier, {{and more}} complex <b>eyepieces.</b> The diameter of the objective lenses is unimportant for field of view. The widest-angle <b>eyepieces</b> used in telescopes are so large that two would not fit side-by-side for use in binoculars.|$|R

25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and <b>eyepiece</b> lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an <b>eyepiece</b> of a much smaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the <b>eyepiece,</b> smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|E
25|$|Since {{speculum}} metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors {{greatly reduced}} {{the light that}} reached the <b>eyepiece,</b> several reflecting telescope designers tried {{to do away with}} them. In 1762 Mikhail Lomonosov presented a reflecting telescope before the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an <b>eyepiece</b> mounted {{at the front of the}} telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by William Herschel.|$|E

25|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun {{with the naked eye}} permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope <b>eyepiece</b> can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high optical density) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the <b>eyepiece.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known telescope {{appeared in}} 1608 in the Netherlands when an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey tried {{to obtain a}} patent on one. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early refracting telescopes consisted of a convex objective lens and a concave <b>eyepiece.</b> Galileo improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, Johannes Kepler described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex <b>eyepiece</b> lens and by 1655 astronomers such as Christiaan Huygens were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.|$|E
25|$|Lanci's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} was his invention in 1567 {{of a piece}} of surveying equipment to obtain perspectives with a visual field of 180°. The instrument, which he named distanziometro ("distance meter"), was made of a circular bronze plate placed upon a horizontal tripod the height of which could be adjusted. Semi-cylindrical paper was wound around its edge. A cylindrical <b>eyepiece</b> was placed in the centre with a retracting metal needle or pen underneath. The <b>eyepiece</b> was high enough to overlook the semicircle of paper and sight points of interest while the retracting needle scored on the paper to accurately plot the subject. It could also be used as a quadrant for measuring height {{in much the same way}} as the orizzonte designed by Leon Battista Alberti.|$|E

25|$|Microscopes {{were first}} {{developed}} {{with just two}} lenses: an objective lens and an <b>eyepiece.</b> The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the <b>eyepiece</b> generally has a longer focal length. This {{has the effect of}} producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope, looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.|$|E
25|$|Reticulum is a small, faint {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} sky.
