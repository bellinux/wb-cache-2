5|$|Following the drilling, a hole {{opens up}} in the object's {{interior}} wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> planet habitable five million years ago– Mars.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper {{may have come from}} multiple sources and some of it is said to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and fogging on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E

25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period.

There are several Atlantean civilizations in the DC Universe, the most notable being the recently destroyed Poseidonis (home to Aquaman and other humanoid water breathers) and Tritonis (home to Lemaris and other mer-people). Aquaman is from the royal family of Atlantis.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts {{are one of}} {{many types}} of organelles in the plant cell. They are {{considered}} to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis—when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium that became a permanent resident in the cell. Mitochondria are thought to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> similar event, where an aerobic prokaryote was engulfed. This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905 after Andreas Schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts are only found in plants, algae, and the amoeboid Paulinella chromatophora.|$|E
25|$|According to a confiscated black booklet {{handwritten}} by Walter Meischberger, {{a former}} Freedom Party politician, Austrian authorities {{said they would}} examine a diary that allegedly detailed money transfers from Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. The diary reportedly mentions a US$58.7m transfer from Gaddafi, {{as well as more}} than US$13.3m that unidentified individuals brought back from Iraq. It also references an anonymous confidant who supposedly brought a suitcase filled with $6.6m from Switzerland to Munich for investment purposes; the money was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Swiss account belonging to the deceased Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein.|$|E

25|$|Oppenheimer and Lauritsen {{knew each}} other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war.

All the work done at NOTS {{on behalf of the}} Manhattan Project came under the codename Project Camel.

25|$|The Lady Chapel {{not only}} {{contains}} the Saxon Cross {{but also an}} ancient broken marble slab engraved with a Bishop's pastoral staff and a Greek cross believed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> reliquary containing the relics of St. Richard of Chichester, a 13th century bishop who often visited West Wittering. Part of his story {{is shown in the}} beautiful red, white and gold altar frontal presented by Yvonne Rusbridge in 1976. On the left St Richard is shown feeding the hungry in Cakeham and on the right leading his followers from the church, his candle miraculously alight despite the gust of wind which blew out all the other candles.|$|E
25|$|The fungal endophytes are {{a diverse}} group of organisms forming {{associations}} almost ubiquitously throughout the plant kingdom. The endophytes which provide indirect defense against herbivores may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of origins, including mutualistic root endophyte associations and the evolution of entomopathogenic fungi into plant-associated endophytes. The endomycorrhiza, which live in plant roots, are made up of five groups: arbuscular, arbutoid, ericoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizae. The majority of species are from the phylum Glomeromycota with the ericoid species coming from the Ascomycota, while the arbutoid, monotropoid and orchid mycorrhizae are classified as Basidiomycota. The entomopathogenic view has gained support from observations of increased fungal growth in response to induced plant defenses and colonization of plant tissues.|$|E
