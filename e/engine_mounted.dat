5|$|In its design, the XR-1 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that, flown by Hanna Reitsch, had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe. The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial <b>engine,</b> <b>mounted</b> in a buried installation within the fuselage. The aircraft had two, three-bladed rotors, mounted in a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons. The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in forwards flight, slightly unloading the rotors. The construction of the XR-1 was conventional {{by the standards of}} the time, with the aircraft's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework, which was covered with fabric. The XR-1 had tail surfaces similar to those of a conventional aircraft, and was equipped with a fixed, taildragger landing gear. The aircraft's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>mounted</b> in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>mounting</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} components in a vehicle to isolate noise and vibration generated by the engine from the driver and passenger. There are three main types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> such as passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> semi-active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The price of the mounting in the market range from the cheapest which is passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> to the most expensive type of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> vary with the price of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> with the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the low quality isolation of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the highest quality isolation of NVH. In order to reduce the vibrations, noise and harshness (NVH) level for vehicles, understanding about the vibration characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in detail is crucial. The objective of this project is to analyze the vibration cause by the engine of a Perodua Kenari on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system at different engine revolutions per minute (rpm). The experiment is carried out on a stationary vehicle using DasyLab software. Here, analysis on the vibration obtained from the experiment carried out helps to determine the time response and frequency response of the engine at different rpm. From the results obtained, we can understand the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the fundamental of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> among the three types.

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> influence {{the performance of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The frequency-dependent properties represented the more accurate properties of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> as opposed to the frequency-independent properties model. Impact technique in the past has been used to measure the dynamic driving point stiffness in the axial position which omitted the shear properties. In this research, the impact technique is extended to measure the global {{dynamic properties}} including the dynamic shear stiffness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> [...] When the <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> is oriented in certain angles, the combination effect of dynamic compression stiffness and dynamic shear stiffness altered the global dynamic properties of the <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> A transformation technique is developed to include both of the dynamic stiffnesses and used them to determine the global dynamic properties of <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> Three different types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> are used to validate the application of the developed technique. Finally, optimization was carried out to demonstrate the effect of the global dynamic properties based on the frequency-dependent properties of <b>engine</b> <b>mount.</b> The optimum locations and orientation angles of each individual mount are identified to minimize the mean force transmissibility of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. The reduction of the force transmissibility showed that optimization based on the frequency-independent properties underestimated the peak transmissibility...|$|R

40|$|The vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system, which {{consists}} of several <b>mounts</b> connecting the <b>engine</b> to the vehicle structure, not only supports {{the weight of the}} engine but also isolates the noise, vibration and the transmitted forces to the vehicle structure. At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> systems for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Adaptronic <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system is referred to a mounting system where actuators, sensors and controller are optimally incorporated in the conventional elastomeric mounting system. The developed computational model of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> is implemented in Matlab/ Simulink and used in a 3 D engine model with which vibration dynamics analysis under different engine and realistic road inputs is conducted. Moreover, the possibility and advantages of using active <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> have been studied by incorporating actuators into the above mentioned 3 D engine model with conventional mounting system for heavy trucks. Simulations of the engine vibration dynamics under similar engine and road excitations have been done for the adaptronic mounting system and compared to the results from the conventional <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system.
