500|$|Mark Androvich of Classic Gamer Magazine was {{similarly}} negative, writing [...] "Games by Apollo released {{a couple of}} decent games before going bankrupt, but you never would <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game." [...] Androvich opined that while the game was playable, it was not [...] "a {{step in the right}} direction" [...] for Apollo.|$|E
500|$|On Sunday, 26 May, the USEE team {{caught the}} ferry back to England and Grace {{continued}} by train to London, {{probably in the}} company of Bannerman and Midwinter, as all three were due to take part in another match at Lord's the following day. They could not <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> the match would be remembered as, to quote Grace's biographer Simon Rae, [...] "arguably the most momentous six hours in cricket history".|$|E
2500|$|By now {{the reader}} will <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> this process can be iterated. [...] In this way we get a proof of the Euler–Maclaurin {{summation}} formula which can be formalized by mathematical induction, in which the induction step relies on integration by parts and on the identities for periodic Bernoulli functions.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to federal census data, in 2013 the Arizona Department of Economic Security assessed the town population at 26,870. The town <b>has</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> its 2013 population was 26,870.|$|R
2500|$|The {{idea of an}} equidissection {{seems like}} the kind of {{elementary}} geometric concept that should be quite old. [...] remark of Monsky's theorem, [...] "one could <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> surely the answer must have been {{known for a long time}} (if not to the Greeks)." [...] But the study of equidissections did not begin until 1965, when Fred Richman was preparing a master's degree exam at New Mexico State University.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{a natural}} draftsman, and through long {{experimentation}} developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses {{a great variety of}} color palettes from nearly monochromatic to highly polychromatic. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and grid format compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or musical notation. The later works are distinguished by spidery hieroglyph-like symbols. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921, [...] "Even if you hadn’t told me he plays the violin, I would <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music." ...|$|E
60|$|Reuben looked up, with {{a little}} smile which showed that he understood. He had often, indeed, watched the young officer and Miss Hudson together, and <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> they were more than mere acquaintances.|$|R
60|$|But {{she could}} feel that he was near her, therefore, there was no fear in her. What had guided her {{footsteps}} hither she did not know. Of course he <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> she <b>had</b> been to meet her husband.|$|R
60|$|Ginger Kemp's face darkened. He frowned. Sally, {{watching}} him, {{felt that}} she had been right when she <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> he <b>had</b> a temper. She liked him none the worse for it. Mild men did not appeal to her.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first two}} parts of it, Boborykin opined, {{might as well have}} been {{published}} by Sovremennik; in fact, the latter's envoys visited Pisemsky, with this in mind. [...] "These two parts I've heard recited by the author himself and by them nobody could <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> the novel would turn out to be so unpleasant for the younger generation," [...] Boborykin wrote. Skabichevsky doubted the chronology, though, reminding that in the end of 1862 Pisemsky was already in Moscow. According to his theory, the novel's first two parts might have been ready by the late 1861 when, despite strained relations between the journal and the author the latter still wasn't known as 'an irreconcilable reactionary', the label it given him in early 1862. The second part, written after the break, was extraordinarily vicious in tone. In general, the novel showed Russian society in the most miserable light, as a [...] "sea of grief", harbouring beneath the surface [...] "vile monsters and anemic fishes amongst stinking sea-weed." [...] The novel, where the ugliest characters turned out to be political radicals, naturally received [...] negative reviews, not only in the democratic press (Maxim Antonovich in Sovremennik, Varfolomey Zaitsev in Russkoye Slovo) but also in the centrist magazines like Otechestvennye Zapiski which denounced Troubled Seas as a rude caricature of the new generation.|$|E

6000|$|... "A journalist," [...] she repeated, {{glancing up}} at him. [...] "Yes! I might <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that.</b> Are you {{a friend of}} Sir Julien Portel?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{how well}} did Chauvelin know {{feminine}} nature! How cleverly he had divined her thoughts, her feelings, the impulsive way in which she would act; how easily he <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that,</b> knowing her husband's danger, she, Marguerite, would immediately follow him.|$|R
60|$|Billy shrugged. He'd done {{worse things}} {{than that in}} his life, and off he trudged, whistling. He felt happier than he had for many a day. He never <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> {{the country in the}} morning could be so beautiful.|$|R
60|$|What reason either {{could she}} <b>have</b> to <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> Whitby cliff <b>had</b> once been coral-mud, {{at the bottom}} of the sea?

6000|$|... "You {{deserve to}} have your ears well boxed for not <b>having</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> it was long ago!" [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Blyth. [...] "Have you forgotten how you praised that very drawing, when you saw it begun in the studio? Didn't you tell Madonna--" ...|$|R
60|$|Meriem's trained ears {{heard his}} every move. She {{made no attempt}} to seek closer {{knowledge}} of his identity. Already she <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> he was a messenger from the Hon. Morison. She stooped and picked up the envelope. Tearing it open she easily read the contents by the moon's brilliant light. It was, as she <b>had</b> <b>guessed,</b> from Baynes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he doesn't {{tell you}} everything!" [...] Paul <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> she pretty much {{supposed}} he did. The great man had now resumed his course and come nearer; {{in spite of}} which his more qualified admirer risked a profane observation: [...] "St. George and the Dragon is what the anecdote suggests!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> {{from his}} {{careless}} garb," [...] said Elizabeth. [...] "I have known some poets so thoughtless as to throw their cloaks into gutters." ...|$|E

60|$|Finally, {{when he had}} {{had enough}} of rolling over and over, Pegasus turned himself about, and, indolently, like any other horse, put out his fore legs, in order to rise from the ground; and Bellerophon, who <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> he would do so, darted {{suddenly}} from the thicket, and leaped astride of his back.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Henriette {{had made her}} rounds to the cottage to see what remarks had been made as to the coming of her visitors. She saw <b>that</b> everyone <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> the girls who had been picked up by Pierre were victims of the massacre, but no one supposed {{that it was the}} result of intention.|$|R
60|$|The {{crew of the}} Dragon, who {{had been}} {{watching}} the scene, raised a shout of gladness as they saw Siegbert place Freda's hand in that of Edmund.

60|$|As {{the party}} stood {{laughing}} and chatting together, no one unacquainted with the circumstances would <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> the meeting {{had been so}} embarrassing {{to two of the}} number.|$|E

6000|$|As {{the silence}} became painful I {{concluded}} to hazard a little conversation {{on my own}} part, as I <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> he was making overtures of peace.

50|$|Facertes and Virgilius, {{two young}} men of noble nature, have become trusted friends; Virgilius lets his {{prisoner}} wear a sword and accompany him unguarded.

With that goal in mind, the {{two young men}} go south.|$|R
60|$|In a big {{forest in}} the north of America lived a {{quantity}} of wild animals of all sorts.

But their manners were so good that no one would ever <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
