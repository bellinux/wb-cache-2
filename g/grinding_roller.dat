There are three <b>grinding</b> <b>roller</b> wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{performance}} of {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSC) {{as reported in the}} literature varies even when the materials and/or methods cited are essentially the same. DSC performance even varies significantly within a single lab from researcher to researcher, as has been observed in our lab. To better constrain the sources of the variability and determine which materials and techniques yielded the best DSC performance, various materials and techniques for fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells were evaluated for their effect on DSC performance. Materials investigated included two types of TiO 2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide ® P 25 and a nanoparticle synthesized in our lab) as well as two different electrolytes (Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte and an electrolyte synthesized in our lab). Results in the literature suggest that nanoparticle dispersion during screen printing paste fabrication is important for the dye loading and optical properties of DSCs, so dispersion techniques including mortar <b>grinding,</b> sonication, <b>roller</b> milling, and ball milling were investigated. DSC fabrication and assembly techniques were also suspected to be important. Comparisons were made between doctor bladed and screen printed films, dye loading of the TiO 2 films under ambient pressures and vacuum, and various sealed and unsealed cell testing configurations. Results from the material and assembly technique comparisons showed varying degrees of impact on DSC film quality and performance. Ball milling was found to be an effective method of disaggregating P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles for screen printing pastes, whereas mortar grinding left large TiO 2 clusters and yielded variable cluster size distributions from batch to batch. The presence of TiO 2 clusters increased film cracking, film peeling, and light scattering and consequently reduced DSC performance. Vacuum-assisted dye loading was not found to improve DSC performance. A comparison of gasket-sealed, epoxy-sealed, and unsealed DSCs did not show consistent differences in performance, though unsealed cells showed poor stability over short time periods. Both screen printing and doctor blading of TiO 2 films yielded films of uniform thickness and DSCs of comparable performance. Finally, a lab electrolyte was found to yield DSCs with a higher short circuit current compared to DSCs that used Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte. The electrolyte performance difference is partially due to higher charge transfer resistance at the TiO 2 -electrolyte interface...|$|R

The same corn-soybean meal–based diets containing 30 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and 20 % wheat middlings (midds) were used for all treatments. Diets were fed in four phases. Different processing techniques were used to create the 5 dietary treatments: (1) <b>roller</b> <b>grinding</b> the corn to approximately 650 μ with the diet fed in meal form; (2) hammer-mill grinding the corn to approximately 320 μ with the diet fed in meal form; (3) Treatment 2 but pelleted; (4) corn initially roller-mill ground to approximately 650 μ, then the complete mixed diet reground through a hammer mill to approximately 360 μ with the diet fed in meal form; and (5) Treatment 4 but pelleted.

Retained austenite, residual stress, texture and particle size at the roller surface were measured using X-ray diffraction technique. These parameters along with hardness and microstructure were also studied as a function of load-miles on new rollers, and profiles in addition these same parameters were measured as a function of depth in the case carburized layer of several samples. These characteristics were also studied {{as a function of the}} finish <b>grinding</b> operation, and <b>rollers</b> returned from long service were annealed in order to study the extent to which the changes were related to reversible processes. With all studies, whenever possible, measurements were carried out sequentially and at the same location on the rollers. ^ Results of this research has shown that the retained austenite decreases at the surface with service mileage and load, and the residual stresses in the martensite and austenite phases become more compressive. Texture and particle size measurements along with the annealing behavior of the rollers indicated that the most significant contribution to the residual stress is from the transformation of austenite to martensite, although there is evidence that work hardening of austenite is occurring. There appears to be an early limit for most of the transformation of austenite to martensite which appears to be due to the fact that the austenite has become strengthened which then makes further transformation difficult. The behavior of the retained austenite is further classified according to three stages known as shake down, steady state and unstable. ...|$|R

The first experiment compared five variations of the current approved method to determine geometric mean diameter (d[subscript]gw) and geometric standard deviation (S[subscript]gw) described by ANSI/ASAE S 319. 4 “Method of determining and expressing fineness of feed materials by sieving”. This method controls many variables, including the suggested sample size and the type, number, and size of sieves. However, the method allows for variations in sieving time, sieve agitator inclusion, {{and the use of}} dispersing agent. The variations were tested with three grains (corn, wheat, and sorghum). There was no method × grain (P> 0. 05) interaction for d[subscript]gw, so it was removed. Ten minute sieving time with sieve agitators and dispersing agent resulted in the lowest d[subscript]gw and greatest S[subscript]gw (P< 0. 05). The second experiment evaluated particle size analysis on ground corn using a 3 -sieve method with varying sieving time (30, 60, and 90 s) with the addition of dispersing agent. The sieving time for the 3 -sieve method referred to the time sieves were hand shaken side to side. Ninety seconds sieving time with dispersing agent (0. 25 g) resulted in the lowest d[subscript]gw (P< 0. 05). The 3 -sieve method was not developed to calculate the S[subscript]gw, so means and main effects were not determined. Experiment three evaluated particle size and flow-ability by grinding corn at two moisture (10 and 12 %) with three screenings levels (0, 2. 5, and 5 %). Results suggested cleaning corn prior to <b>grinding</b> with a <b>roller</b> mill does not change particle size or flow-ability. Experiment four continued the evaluation of flow-ability with corn ground to three target particle sizes (400, 500, and 600 µm) and fractionated into fine, medium, and coarse segments. Target particle size impacted d[subscript]gw, S[subscript]gw, and bulk density (P< 0. 05), prior to fractionation. Based on the results of this experiment, flow-ability can be improved if fine particles (< 282 µm) are removed. Results of these experiments indicated that particle size analysis should use sieve agitators, dispersing agent, and 10 or 15 min sieving time for the standard 13 -sieve method and 90 s sieving time with dispersing agent for the 3 -sieve method...|$|R
