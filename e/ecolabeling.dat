In 1996 the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) implemented the first certification program Since then, they have not only made a distinct effort to maintain the health of ecosystems, but they have also contributed to more financial success for producers.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} <b>ecolabeling</b> {{is a tool}} {{to reduce}} overfishing and benefit sustainable fisheries. The sustainable fishery {{is defined as the}} fishery which produces products within legal framework of the local government over generations with minimizing the harmful effect on the marine ecosystem. This seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> can be a tool to encourage the fisheries to run a sustainable management. ^ Seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> has a possibility to improve the fishery resource problem in the world from the consumer side. If consumers preferred the ecolabeled seafood, the preference would generate a price premium for ecolabeled seafood or increase in the market share of ecolabeled seafood. Consequently, profit maximizing fisheries would be motivated to obtain the certification. In order to qualify for the ecolabel, the fishery is required to run a sustainable management because the product must have originated from a sustainable fishery. In this sense, seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> brings a benefit not only {{to the health of the}} ecosystem, but also to the certified fisheries. ^ In the market development of sustainable seafood the Japanese market is one of the most important markets if measured by size: it is the largest seafood importer and the second largest consumer in the world, after China. However, little research has been done on the ecolabeled seafood in the Japanese market. Does seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> have a possibility to function in the Japanese seafood market? This dissertation tries to answer the question. ^ This dissertation investigates the consumer preference for sustainable seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> and its possibility of functioning in the Japanese seafood market. Since the premise of the <b>ecolabeling</b> is that the consumers prefer ecolabeled products, the Japanese consumers 2 ̆ 7 preference for the ecolabeled products should be revealed. ^ The dissertation found the Japanese consumers prefer ecolabeled seafood and are willing to pay extra money on the labeled seafood only when they recognize the ecolabeled seafood and its necessity. They are not supportive for ecolabeled seafood when they are not aware of the seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> and the world fishery issues. This suggests that the Japanese seafood market has a foundation for seafood <b>ecolabeling,</b> but needs to promote ecolabeled seafood with educational campaigns. ^ The preferences of the Japanese consumers were found to be diverse and to be categorized into three characteristics: the high premium group, the low premium group and the negligible premium group. Although the premiums differ across the groups, no significant relationship between the preference and demographic characteristics is found. ^ The dissertation also investigates whether an MSC certified fishery in Japan enjoys the benefit from the certification. Although there are some benefits from the MSC certification, anecdotal evidence from the fishery showed a financial difficulty to afford all the expenses on the MSC certification. This is especially problematic for small scale fisheries because they have a lower capability of production and cannot respond to the increased demand due to new customers of the MSC products. Thus financial supports are necessary for sustainable fisheries to qualify for the MSC and maintain the certification. The consumer preferences for ecolabeled seafood from the first three manuscripts endorse the fact that the groundwork of seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> is laid in the Japanese seafood market. However, the educational campaigns are necessary to compensate the lack of knowledge of the seafood <b>ecolabeling</b> and its necessity. The last manuscript shows the necessity of financial support and effective marketing for the certified fisheries. In order for the MSC ecolabeled products to penetrate into the Japanese market, both consumer and producer sides have some challenges to overcome. ...|$|E

We study the implication of <b>ecolabeling</b> a supposedly green good for a consumer's allocation of income between a dirty and the supposedly green good. In the model, the role of the ecolabel is to help product differentiation, to give reliable information and to reduce informational asymmetries. We show that a conscious consumer (someone with a stronger green attitude or quality concerns) demands more ecolabeled goods; price-oriented consumers demand fewer ecolabeled goods; a subsidy (resp. tax) on the price of the ecolabeled (resp. dirty) good leads to a larger consumption of the ecolabeled (resp. dirty) good whereas it may increase or decrease the demand for the dirty (resp. ecolabeled) good, depending on whether the consumer views both goods as gross substitutes or complements. We then use a cross-individual dataset of 22, 568 consumers and show that the demand for ecolabeled goods increases strongly with the consciousness of the consumer but decreases for price-oriented consumers. Ecolabel-oriented consumers feel more informed; more conscious consumers prefer a subsidy on green goods and a tax on dirty goods; price-oriented consumers do not care about the green subsidy but would vote against a tax on the dirty goods. <b>Ecolabeling</b> Taxation Consumer choice...|$|E

By contrast, local food movements and civil society initiatives point to {{the emergence of}} alternative, participatory forms of <b>ecolabeling.</b> These local organizations have come up with new ways of constructing collective quality seals and assurances for products. They have spurred debates on the technologies, power structures and risks associated with corporate agriculture, large-scale pesticide use and chemically grown produce As an alternative, <b>ecolabeling</b> requires a multi-level articulation of smallholder farming, food cooperatives and farmer markets, in order to create a local certification system for eco-sustainable produce and maintain the sustainability of traditional modes of existence of small farmers.

Under binary labeling, firms' abatement technologies are not directly observable by consumers but are certified if they satisfy preset ecological standards. Given this asymmetry, I set up the regulator's problem as one of choosing a technology standard, or "cutoff," in emissions per unit of output, below which all abatement efficiency levels are certified. The regulatory authority faces a trade-off in choosing the socially optimal cutoff: The regulator would like to raise the standard to reduce emissions but needs to lower {{it in order to}} induce technology adoption. There are three important findings: (1) <b>ecolabeling</b> is the second-best instrument in that choosing the optimal cutoff per se can never achieve the first-best outcome; (2) efficiency loss in terms of the difference between the first-best and the second-best total surpluses {{may or may not be}} large, depending on the extent of the certification barriers; and (3) setting too high or too low a standard is not only inefficient, but can also lead to an increase in total emissions relative to the status quo.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Historically, {{researchers}} have used surveys, focus groups, and anecdotal evidence to evaluate consumer response to environmentally certified, <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products. These methods generally measure consumer attitudes toward certified forest products. Since {{the strength of}} the correlation between attitudes and behavior has long been questioned, consumer response to certified forest products is not fully understood. Therefore, a major goal of this research was to better understand consumer response to environmentally certified, <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products by directly observing purchase behavior. This was accomplished by designing an experiment in which consumers were presented with a choice between virtually identical forest products, the only differences being the presence/absence of an environmental certification <b>ecolabel,</b> and in some cases, a price premium on the <b>ecolabeled</b> product. During this experiment, the presence of the <b>ecolabel</b> was associated with increased sales, so long as there was no price premium on the <b>ecolabeled</b> product. The strength of this association was weakened when the <b>ecolabeled</b> product cost 2 percent more than the non-ecolabeled product. In other words, these results suggest that price is a more compelling product attribute than the <b>ecolabel.</b> This experiment was the first to empirically demonstrate that forest certification <b>ecolabels</b> do have an effect on consumer behavior. In addition to the experiment, two surveys were conducted to better understand how consumers form their preferences for forest products, and to determine which values, attitudes, and beliefs are held by those most likely to purchase <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products. The surveys revealed that respondents who: were younger, willing to pay extra for <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products, exhibited past environmentally friendly purchase behavior, believe environmental claims on product packaging, and were more politically liberal were most likely to buy <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products. It {{is important to note that}} no associations were found between any of the measured values and those most likely to purchase <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products. This finding suggests that in order to for <b>ecolabels</b> to be successful in the long term, marketing efforts are needed, which explicitly link the <b>ecolabel</b> symbol to values. Such a linkage will allow consumers to express their values through the purchase of <b>ecolabeled</b> products. This practice of linking values to a product is widely believed to be a powerful influence on consumer behavior. The surveys also revealed that <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products are preferred to non-ecolabeled forest products for most consumers. However, the strength of this preference pattern varies significantly among consumers. This finding suggests that a market segmentation strategy is required to effectively market environmentally certified, <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products. Therefore, the associations between attitudes, values, and beliefs with those most likely to purchase <b>ecolabeled</b> forest products is practically significant for forest certification agencies and environmentally certified forest landowners and manufacturers because it can be used for market segmentation, and to begin building brand recognition, awareness, and identity for forest certification <b>ecolabels.</b> Finally, the research questions posed in the experiment and survey were carefully designed to be nearly identical. This "duality' allowed a comparison of the results obtained by each method. Such a comparison revealed, as has long been suspected, that the results differed by method.

At least for food, the <b>ecolabel</b> is nearly identical with the common NGO definition of the rules for <b>ecolabelling.</b> Label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up [...] "rubber stamp" [...] labels to greenwash their products with fake <b>ecolabels.</b> High trust levels can be created when <b>ecolabels</b> apply for Governmental recognition as formal Certification Marks by logos or names with 'CTM', CM or 'CertTM'. Typically this means schemes approved as a Certification Mark, have had the Government Department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are 'Competent to Certify'. The highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key ISO standards especially ISO 14024- Type 1 <b>Ecolabels</b> that undertake ISO 14040 compliant life cycle analysis {{as part of their}} assessment.Type I <b>ecolabels</b> are voluntary labels that signify overall environmental preference of a product or services based on life-cycle considerations that address multiple environmental criteria, which are based on transparent standards for environmental preferability, verified by a qualified organization.|$|R
