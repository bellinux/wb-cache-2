500|$|A {{provision}} of the original Civil Aviation Act allows designated airports to be required to provide facilities for consultation with affected parties, where local environmental concerns can be raised, and some 51 airports have been so designated. A 2000 consultation by the government re-iterated its policy that generally, local issues arising from airport operations are best addressed locally. To support this the Civil Aviation Act was extended in 2006 to give all airports the authority to mandate measures to address noise and air quality issues beyond their boundaries, and to impose financial penalties on aircraft which fail or are unable to adhere to such measures. The Civil Aviation Act 2006 also extends the provisions of section 78 of the original act, augmenting {{the powers of the}} Secretary of State to intervene directly in operations at designated airports; currently Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, [...] "…for the purpose of avoiding, limiting or mitigating the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and vibration connected with aircraft landing or taking off." [...] The largest airports also implement voluntary schemes to assist local communities in coping with the local impacts of airport operations. Birmingham International Airport, for example, has been operating a sound insulation scheme since 1978, in which 7,600 properties are eligible for sound proof glazing paid for by the airport. Schemes are also available to residents most affected by noise around Heathrow, designed to protect property prices ahead of any development of a third runway, assist with relocation costs for people who wish to move, and provide sound insulation for private and communal property currently affected by noise. In both cases local residents have also set up campaign groups; Birmingham Airport anti-Noise Group, and HACAN Clearskies at Heathrow, to represent themselves over local environmental issues arising from airport operations. Even the smallest of airports engaged in air transport operations; Gloucestershire Airport, has attracted organised opposition to its plans to extend the main runway there, and the umbrella group AirportWatch lists over 20 local airport campaign groups.|$|E

40|$|Noise is a {{ubiquitous}} {{feature in}} natural {{as well as}} in urban habitats. The presence <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> can have multiple direct and indirect effects on communication. Noise can directly mask signals leading to reduced detection and recognition. Noise also affects internal physiological processes which can influence attention and decision rules and, thus, indirectly affect communication. Also community <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> leading to lower densities or different community composition with respect to copying style or personality will affect communication through different communication distances and different daily behavioural routines. All these direct and indirect <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> on communication have been well documented but often are treated separately. This review focusses on some <b>of</b> the indirect <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> on animal communication, considering spatial responses, attentional effects and differential <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> depending on an animal’s characteristics, its personality. It evaluates how noise can indirectly influence communication and, thus, social network structure and processes of sexual and natural selection...|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> {{is to make}} a person's speech less easy to hear. The {{human brain}} compensates for background noise during speech production in a process called the Lombard effect in which speech becomes louder with more distinct syllables. However, this cannot fully remove the problems of communication intelligibility made in noise.|$|E
50|$|The {{best choice}} of k {{depends upon the}} data; generally, larger values of k reduce the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> on the classification, but make {{boundaries}} between classes less distinct.

This differs somewhat from a 2004 study that gave a period of 6.354 hours, but this difference {{may be explained by}} the small magnitude variation which tends to increase the randomizing <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> in the data.|$|E
50|$|By {{using an}} LNA {{close to the}} signal source, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> from {{subsequent}} stages of the receive chain in the circuit is reduced by the signal gain created by the LNA, while the noise created by the LNA itself is injected directly into the received signal. The LNA boosts the desired signals' power while adding as little noise and distortion as possible. The work done by the LNA enables optimum retrieval of the desired signal in the later stages of the system.|$|E
50|$|Noise {{pollution}} control in residences is not {{funded by the}} federal government {{in part because of the}} disagreements in establishing causal links between sounds and health risks, since the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> is often psychological and also, because it leaves no singular tangible trace of damage on the human body.

50|$|To {{increase}} {{the precision of}} edge detection, several subpixel techniques had been proposed, including curve-fitting, moment-based, reconstructive, and partial area effect methods. These methods have different characteristics. Curve fitting methods are computationally simple but are easily affected by noise. Moment-based methods use an integral-based approach to reduce the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise,</b> but may require more computations in some cases. Reconstructive methods use horizontal gradients or vertical gradients to build a curve and find {{the peak of the}} curve as the sub-pixel edge. Partial area effect methods are based on the hypothesis that each pixel value depends on the area at both sides of the edge inside that pixel, producing accurate individual estimation for every edge pixel. Certain variants of the moment-based technique {{have been shown to be}} the most accurate for isolated edges.|$|E
