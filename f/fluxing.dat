Experiments were carried out on a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treated municipal wastewater. Three of the five critical <b>flux</b> determination methods, such as <b>flux</b> linearity, 90 % permeability and <b>flux</b> cycling conducted in this study, indicated a decline in critical <b>flux</b> values as the step height of incremental <b>flux</b> increased.

40|$|Metabolic <b>fluxes</b> {{in cells}} {{are governed by}} physical, biochemical, physiological, and {{economic}} principles. Cells may show "economical" behaviour, trading metabolic performance against the costly side-effects of high enzyme or metabolite concentrations. Some constraint-based <b>flux</b> prediction methods score <b>fluxes</b> by heuristic <b>flux</b> costs as proxies of enzyme investments. However, linear cost functions ignore enzyme kinetics and the tight coupling between <b>fluxes,</b> metabolite levels and enzyme levels. To derive more realistic cost functions, I define an apparent "enzymatic <b>flux</b> cost" as the minimal enzyme cost at which the <b>fluxes</b> can be realised in a given kinetic model, and a "kinetic <b>flux</b> cost", which includes metabolite cost. I discuss the mathematical properties of such <b>flux</b> cost functions, their usage for <b>flux</b> prediction, and their importance for cells' metabolic strategies. The enzymatic <b>flux</b> cost scales linearly with the <b>fluxes</b> and is a concave function on the <b>flux</b> polytope. The costs of two flows are usually not additive, due to an additional "compromise cost". Between <b>flux</b> polytopes, where <b>fluxes</b> change their directions, the enzymatic cost shows a jump. With strictly concave <b>flux</b> cost functions, cells can reduce their enzymatic cost by running different <b>fluxes</b> in different cell compartments or at different moments in time. The enzymactic <b>flux</b> cost can be translated into an approximated cell growth rate, a convex function on the <b>flux</b> polytope. Growth-maximising metabolic states can be predicted by <b>Flux</b> Cost Minimisation (FCM), a variant of FBA based on general <b>flux</b> cost functions. The solutions are <b>flux</b> distributions in corners of the <b>flux</b> polytope, i. e. typically elementary <b>flux</b> modes. Enzymatic <b>flux</b> costs can be linearly or nonlinearly approximated, providing model parameters for linear FBA based on kinetic parameters and extracellular concentrations, and justified by a kinetic model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Surface <b>fluxes,</b> {{originating}} from forest patches, are commonly calculated from atmospheric <b>flux</b> measurements at some height above that patch using a cor-rection for <b>flux</b> arising from upwind surfaces. Footprint {{models have been}} developed to calculate such a correction. These models commonly assume homogeneous tur-bulence, resulting in a simulated atmospheric <b>flux</b> equal to the average surface <b>flux</b> in the footprint area. However, atmospheric scalar <b>fluxes</b> downwind of a forest edge have been observed to exceed surface <b>fluxes</b> in the footprint area. Variations in atmo-spheric turbulence downwind of the forest edge, as simulated with an E – ε model, can explain enhanced atmospheric scalar <b>fluxes.</b> This E – ε model is used to calculate the footprint of atmospheric measurements downwind of a forest edge. Atmospheric <b>fluxes</b> appear mainly enhanced {{as a result of a}} stronger sensitivity to <b>fluxes</b> from the upwind surface. A sensitivity analysis shows that the fetch over forest, necessary to reach equilibrium between atmospheric <b>fluxes</b> and surface <b>fluxes,</b> tends to be longer for scalar <b>fluxes</b> as compared to momentum <b>fluxes.</b> With increasing forest density, atmospheric <b>fluxes</b> deviate even more strongly from surface <b>fluxes,</b> but over shorter fetches. It is concluded that scalar <b>fluxes</b> over forests are commonly affected by inho-mogeneous turbulence over large fetches downwind of an edge. It is recommended to take horizontal variations in turbulence into account when the footprint is calcu-lated for atmospheric <b>flux</b> measurements downwind of a forest edge.

Because of its {{ubiquitous}} {{release on}} land and wellcharacterized atmospheric loss, radon- 222 has been very useful for deducing <b>fluxes</b> of greenhouse gases such as CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O. It is shown here that the radon-tracer method, used in previous studies to calculate regional-scale greenhouse gas <b>fluxes,</b> returns a weighted-average <b>flux</b> (the <b>flux</b> field F weighted by {{the sensitivity of the}} measurements to that <b>flux</b> field, f) rather than an evenly-weighted spatial average <b>flux.</b> A synthetic data study using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and modeled CO 2 <b>fluxes</b> suggests that the discrepancy between the sensitivity-weighted average <b>flux</b> and evenly-weighted spatial average <b>flux</b> can be significant in the case of CO 2, due to covariance between F and f for biospheric CO 2 <b>fluxes</b> during the growing season and also for anthropogenic CO 2 <b>fluxes</b> in general.
