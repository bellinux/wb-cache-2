40|$|In the 1920 s, Chief Buffalo Child <b>Long</b> <b>Lance,</b> reputedly a Blood (or Blackfoot) Indian, was {{the talk}} of New York City. A {{graduate}} of Carlisle Indian School, a cadet at West Point, a war hero, and a sparring mate for Jack Dempsey, <b>Long</b> <b>Lance</b> was the American Indian made good. He was a journalist of some renown, an eloquent speaker, and a self ordained 2 ̆ 2 spokesman for the Indians of America. 2 ̆ 2 Before the decade was finished he had written a highly popular autobiography of {{his life on the}} Canadian Plains, actually chased off wolves and speared a moose for his role as an Ojibwa warrior in a silent movie, and attended New York social functions regularly, sometimes in buckskin, sometimes in full dress tuxedo. He was the authentic Indian hero come to the metropolis. Or was he? As the Great Depression hit full force, various investigations revealed that <b>Long</b> <b>Lance</b> was living a lie. Instead of being a chief of the Blood, he was, in fact, Sylvester Long, originally of Winston, North Carolina. Rumors that he was half-black circulated, with the inevitable result that friends spurned him and he plunged into near-obscurity. Despondent, abusive, drunken, suicidal, and broke, <b>Long</b> <b>Lance</b> finally blew his brains out at his patroness 2 ̆ 7 home in 1 932. He was only forty-two years of age...|$|R

50|$|There {{is similar}} {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether}} cavalryman carried shields (not generally used by Greek cavalry until after ca. 250 BC) and the related question of whether they carried <b>long</b> <b>lances</b> (which normally precluded shields, as they would often be held double-handed) or shorter spears, the doru mentioned by Polybius. Most representations show cavalrymen with the small parma equestris type of shield, but the Ahenobarbus monument of 122 BC and the coin of 136 BC both show cavalrymen without shields. Sidnell suggests that, since equites were expected to provide their own equipment, they may have chosen their own type and combination of armour and weapons e.g. <b>long</b> <b>lance</b> with no shield or short spear with shield. But the evidence is too scant to draw any firm conclusions.|$|R
