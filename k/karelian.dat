5|$|With the Soviet forces cut in half, {{the attack}} on the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus could commence. The Finnish army {{attempted}} to encircle large Soviet formations at Sortavala and Hiitola by advancing to the western shores of Lake-Ladoga. By mid-August the encirclement succeeded and both towns were taken but many Soviet formations were able to evacuate by sea. Further west, {{the attack on}} Viborg was launched. With Soviet resistance breaking down, the Finns were able to encircle Vyborg by advancing to the Vuoksi River. The city itself was taken on 30 August, along with a broad advance {{on the rest of the}} <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus. By the beginning of September, Finland had restored its pre-winter war borders.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{were less}} prepared. While they {{anticipated}} a German invasion, with possible Finnish support, Stalin {{did not expect}} an attack along the entire border so early. The border was heavily fortified, but Soviet leadership was unprepared for the German attack. The formation opposing Silver Fox was the Northern Front, consisting of the 7th and 14th Armies. They were commanded by Lieutenant-General Markian Popov. On 23 August 1941, the Northern Front was split up into the <b>Karelian</b> Front and the Leningrad Front, commanded by Valerian Frolov and Popov. Frolov remained {{in command of the}} <b>Karelian</b> Front until 1 September, when he was promoted and replaced by Roman Panin. During the first weeks the Axis would have a numerical superiority, as the Soviets only had 150,000 men north of Lake Ladoga along the border.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Russian <b>Karelians</b> are Eastern Orthodox Christians. The {{majority of}} Finnish <b>Karelians</b> are Lutherans.|$|R
50|$|A {{branch of}} <b>Karelians,</b> known as Tver <b>Karelians</b> {{live in the}} oblast. They {{numbered}} 140,567 in 1926. Due to heavy casualties suffered during the World War II, they vanished as a separate ethnic group from {{most parts of the}} oblast. The Tver <b>Karelians</b> numbered 14,633 according to the 2002 Census.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Karelians</b> mostly {{identified}} {{themselves with the}} Russians, and not with the Finns. <b>Karelians</b> rather called the Finns [...] "ruotsalaiset," [...] which is the Finnish word for Swedes.|$|R
5|$|In December 2010, <b>Karelian</b> Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
5|$|The Axis had {{air superiority}} as Soviet <b>Karelian</b> was {{protected}} by the 1st and 55th Mixed Air Divisions, totaling 273 aircraft, many outclassed by their enemy. This situation was partly alleviated by the reinforcement of No. 151 Wing RAF on September 7, 1941 at Vaenga airfield. The Wing was tasked with providing Hawker Hurricane aircraft and training for the Russians, but also flew 365 sorties over the Murmansk area, accounting for 14 German aircraft kills.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Russian {{soldiers}} {{active in the}} Civil War declined markedly once Germany attacked Russia on 18 February 1918. The German-Russian Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of 3 March, restricted the Bolsheviks' support for the Finnish Reds to weapons and supplies. The Russians remained active on the south-eastern front, mainly in the Battle of Rautu, <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, between 21 February and 6 April 1918. They defended the approaches to Petrograd.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{enclaves}} of <b>Karelians</b> {{exist in}} the Tver oblast of Russia, resettled after Russia's defeat in 1617 against Sweden — in order to escape the peril of forced conversion to Lutheranism in Swedish Karelia. The Russians also promised tax deductions if the Orthodox <b>Karelians</b> migrated there. Olonets (Aunus) is the only city in Russia where the <b>Karelians</b> form a majority (60% of the population).|$|R
50|$|In 1251 the Finnish <b>Karelians</b> again {{fought against}} the Norwegians, and in 1271 the two Finnish peoples, the Kvens and the <b>Karelians,</b> cooperated in wars and battles against the Norwegians in Hålogaland (Haalogaland).|$|R
5000|$|Many of the <b>Karelians</b> who {{remained}} Orthodox by 1658 AD {{were unwilling to}} remain in Sweden refusing to convert to Lutheranism, which triggered a mass migration of many Orthodox <b>Karelians</b> from these areas into other parts of Russia, with some migrating to the region of Tver and forming the Tver <b>Karelians</b> minority, while others moving to the region of Valdai in Novgorod region and yet others moving to White Karelia by the White Sea.|$|R
5|$|The treaty {{led to a}} {{short period}} of peace, but the armed {{conflicts}} resumed soon thereafter. Chronicles document attacks by the Novgorodians and the Karelians on Finnmark and northern Norway as early as 1271, and continuing well into the 14th century. The official border between the Novgorod lands and the lands of Sweden and Norway was established by the Treaty of Nöteborg on August12, 1323. The treaty primarily focused on the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus border and the border north of Lake Ladoga.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which Eastern European {{countries}} {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest. In October 1939, Stalin gained control of the Baltic states and turned his sights on Finland, confident that control could be gained without great effort. The Soviet Union demanded territories on the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government for the Finnish Democratic Republic, headed by the Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{revolutions}} split {{also the}} Russian army officers politically and {{their attitude toward}} the Finnish civil war varied; Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev the Russian forces in the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary underlings and co-operated with the former colleague General Mannerheim, assisting the Whites in the disarmament of the Russian garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White army did not fight against Russia: {{the goal of the}} White campaign was to beat the Finnish Red rebels and the Russian troops supporting them.|$|E
5000|$|As Finland gained its {{independence}} in 1917 {{the process of}} [...] "finnisation" [...] continued yet even eastern <b>Karelians</b> were now viewed {{as part of the}} Finnish nation. In 1918-22 eastern <b>Karelians</b> have made several attempts to gain their own independence from Russia with a common notion to cede to Finland which was met with warm welcome in Finland. Yet intervention of Antanta and first White Russian government and later Soviet government into the process led to bloodshed among eastern <b>Karelians</b> as the Uhta Republic and Olonets gevernment were crushed and destroyed by the Soviet forces. Several thousands of eastern <b>Karelians</b> have migrated to Finland by 1922 from different parts of Eastern Karelia.|$|R
25|$|Then <b>Karelians</b> (Kereliar) and Kvens (Kvænir) pillaged {{widely in}} Hålogaland (Hálogaland).|$|R
50|$|According to Eric Chronicles, Swedes conquered 14 {{hundreds}} {{from the}} <b>Karelians.</b>|$|R
5|$|In September 1944, Soviet troops {{advanced}} into Yugoslavia {{and forced}} the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off. By this point, the Communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of {{the capital city of}} Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945. Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former allies.|$|E
5|$|In {{foreign policy}} Red Finland leaned on Bolshevist Russia. A Finnish-Russian Red treaty and peace {{agreement}} was signed on 1 March 1918. The negotiations for the treaty revealed, that, as in World War I in general, nationalism {{was more important}} for both sides than the principles of international socialism. The Red Finns did not accept alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared e.g. over demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The bargaining sides exchanged land areas; an artillery base, Ino, located in the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, was transferred to Russia, while Finland received Petsamo in north-eastern Lapland. The significance of the Russian-Finnish Treaty evaporated soon, due to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolsheviks and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces' {{military}} operation plan against the Soviet Union was named Venäjän keskitys ("Russian Concentration"; VK) in the 1920s. In the latest 1934 plan, the Finns saw two possible scenarios. In the VK1 scenario, the Soviets would mobilize all along their western border, and would deploy only limited forces against Finland. In {{this case the}} Finns would make counterattacks across the border. The VK2 scenario envisaged a much more unfavourable situation for the Finns. The main defense line {{would be on the}} <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, the Finnish forces would repel Soviet attacks in favourable positions, and destroy the enemy by counterattacks. In the Winter War, the VK2 scenario was flexible and its basis proved correct, but the Finnish General staff badly underestimated the numerical superiority of the Red Army.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{complementary}} theories as to {{the origin}} of the Tver <b>Karelians.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Karelians,</b> Russia (Karelia and Leningrad Oblast) and Finland (South Karelia and North Karelia) ...|$|R
50|$|According to some sources, the <b>Karelians</b> {{destroyed}} the Swedish town of Sigtuna in 1187.|$|R
5|$|The Finnish plan in {{the south}} in Karelia was to advance as swiftly as {{possible}} to Lake Ladoga, cutting the Soviet forces in half. Then the Finnish territories east of Lake Ladoga were to be recaptured before the advance along the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus, including the recapture of Vyborg, commenced. The Finnish attack was launched on 10 July. The Army of Karelia held a numerical advantage versus the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army and 23rd Army, so it could advance swiftly. The important road junction at Loimola was captured on 14 July. By 16 July, the first Finnish units reached Lake Ladoga at Koirinoja, achieving the goal of splitting the Soviet forces. During the rest of July, the Army of Karelia advanced further southeast into Karelia, coming to a halt at the former Finnish-Soviet border at Mansila.|$|E
5|$|The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, {{refused to}} {{recognise}} the Whites Guard's power status, {{and decided to}} establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall. The large scale mobilization of the Reds {{began in the late}} evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä in the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus on 27 January 1918.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had started}} an {{intensive}} rearmament near the Finnish border in 1938–1939. Finnish students and volunteers {{had spent the}} late summer 1939 improving the defensive structures across the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus. On the Soviet side of the border, penal labour worked hard in order to add some density to sparse road and rail networks. In summer 1939 was an important phase of Soviet planning, told by Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Kirill Meretskov in their memoirs. The Supreme Council of War ordered the Commander of Leningrad Military District Merestkov to draft an invasion plan, instead of Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov. The plan was adopted in July. Necessary assault troop deployments and commands were not initiated until October 1939, though operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November. Stalin however was certain that the Finns would change their opinion under Soviet pressure and cede the demanded territories.|$|E
50|$|Tver Karelia {{denotes the}} {{villages in the}} Tver Oblast that are {{inhabited}} by Tver <b>Karelians.</b>|$|R
25|$|The term Finns is {{also used}} for other Finnic peoples, {{including}} Izhorians in Ingria, <b>Karelians</b> in Karelia and Veps in the former Veps National Volost, all in Russia. Among these groups, the <b>Karelians</b> is the most populous one, followed by the Ingrians. According to a 2002 census, {{it was found that}} Ingrians also identify with Finnish ethnic identity, referring to themselves as Ingrian Finns.|$|R

5|$|The main factor {{behind the}} Finnish Civil War was World War I; the Russian Empire {{collapsed}} under {{the pressures of}} the war, leading to the February and October Revolutions in 1917. The breakdown caused a large power vacuum and subsequent power struggle in Eastern Europe. The Grand Duchy of Finland, a part of the Russian Empire since 1809, became embroiled in the struggle for power. Geopolitically less important than the continental Moscow-Warsaw gateway, the northerly Finnish ground, isolated by the Baltic sea was a peaceful sidefront until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had indirect effects on the Finns. Since the end of 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of raw materials, industrial products, food and labor for the growing Imperial Russian capital Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasized the role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less marked northern section of the Estonian–Finnish gateway and buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the Narva area, the Gulf of Finland and the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the {{military}} focus to Viipuri; 18,500 Whites raided against 15,000 Red defending troopers. General Mannerheim's Vyborg plan {{was affected by}} the battle for Tampere, the civilian industrial town. He aimed to avoid a new bloody city combat, in Viipuri - the old border ground military fortress. The Jäger detachments tried to destroy and bind the Red force outside Viipuri, and conquer the lamed town area in a mild battle. The Whites were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops, in the fierce combats, in the <b>Karelian</b> Isthmus on 20–26 April, but the decisive blow remained in besieged Viipuri. The final attack to the city began on late 27 April with a heavy, concentrated Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' tough defence in the street combat collapsed gradually and eventually the Whites conquered Patterinmäki - the symbolic Last Stand-hill of the Finnish Red 1918 Uprising - {{in the center of}} Viipuri, on early hours of 29 April 1918. In total 400 Whites and 500–600 Reds died and 12,000–15,000 were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{pursued a}} foreign policy that was active in all {{directions}} (although foremost {{to the west and}} south-east). In the north-east, the relationship with Novgorod had been tense due to a dispute over the right to tax the Sami people, as well as raiding from both Norwegian and <b>Karelian</b> sides. Eventually, the Mongol threat drove Prince Alexander Nevsky to negotiations with Haakon that likely strengthened Norwegian control of Troms and Finnmark. An embassy from Novgorod one time asked for Haakon's daughter Christina for a marriage, but Haakon refused due to the Mongol threat. Due to the Elven-based Norwegian presence in the seas around the south of Sweden and into the Baltic Sea, Norway increasingly relied on Baltic grain from Lübeck. The import was however halted in the late 1240s due to the plundering of Norwegian ships in Danish seas by ships from Lübeck. In 1250, Haakon made a peace and trade agreement with Lübeck, which eventually also opened the city of Bergen to the Hanseatic League. During the conflict, Haakon had reportedly been offered control over the city by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In any case, Haakon's policy regarding Northern German ports largely derived from his strategy of attempting to exploit the internal turmoil that had erupted in Denmark following the death of King Valdemar II in 1241.|$|E
