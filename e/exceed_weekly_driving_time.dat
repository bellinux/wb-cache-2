40|$|ABSTRACT- Comfort is an {{attribute}} that today’s drivers demand more and more. Seat {{is one of}} the important features of vehicle and there is the place where the professional driver spends most of their time. According to ‘European Union Legislation for Drivers and Promote’, the <b>weekly</b> <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> for truck drivers shall not exceed 56 hours. Assuming eight week vacation and one more for holiday, the truck driver is spending around 2408 hours <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> per year. Truck seat, which are in contact with truck occupants, {{play an important role in}} improving the comfort and work environment of a driver. The perceived comfort of humans in a given environment can be classified as a subjective assessment, because it is possible to find a considerable variation in responses of different people to the same situation. Nevertheless, the factors on which the opinions of people on (dis) comfort level are physical variables such as pressure, temperature and heart rate. The main research objective is to investigate “How to improve the truck seat comfort objectively? ” The paper describes the state-of-the-art objective measurement techniques in seat development and an intelligent system is proposed for the next generation truck driver’s seat...|$|R
25|$|The daily <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> {{shall not}} exceed 9 hours. The daily <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> may be {{extended}} to at most 10 hours not more than twice during the week. The <b>weekly</b> <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> may not <b>exceed</b> 56 hours. In addition to this, a driver cannot exceed 90 hours driving in a fortnight. Within each period of 24 hours {{after the end of}} the previous daily rest period or weekly rest period a driver must take a new daily rest period. An 11-hour (or more) daily rest is called a regular daily rest period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily rest period into two periods. The first period must be at least 3 hours of uninterrupted rest and can be taken at any time during the day. The second must be at least 9 hours of uninterrupted rest, giving a total minimum rest of 12 hours. A driver may reduce his daily rest period to no less than 9 continuous hours, but this can be done no more than three times between any two weekly rest periods; no compensation for the reduction is required. A daily rest that is less than 11 hours but at least 9 hours long is called a reduced daily rest period. When a daily rest is taken, this may be taken in a vehicle, as long as it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|R

The optimization objective of every electric vehicle (EV) is {{to maximize the}} charging amount of renewable energy by choosing smart charging (SC) times with the highest relative share of renewable generation. We observe that for every sociodemographic group the share of renewable energy in the charging demand can be increased by at least 83 %.

30|$|As expected, {{a driver}} {{should be allowed}} to drive only as long as his/her ability to drive is not {{impaired}} (Zaranka et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015). Therefore, the government and responsible departments should launch corresponding law enforcement programs to regulate driver’s max <b>weekly</b> and fortnightly <b>driving</b> hours, maximum continuous <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> in 24  h, and standard minimum rest hours after maximum continuous driving, to reduce fatigue-related crashes. Thus, state-of-the-art technology should be developed to evaluate the drivers’ driving performance, provide the warning or alerting messages and assess crash risk, if necessary (Jung and Shin 2014). Specially, drivers are strongly recommended to own vehicles with automatic in-vehicle safety equipment, to alarm drivers of their fatigue or physical impairment, etc.|$|R

40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) need access to specialized care. We hypothesized that access to the transplant center after HSCT may be challenging for patients living in geographically distant areas, and that this would have an adverse effect on their outcome. We analyzed 1912 adult patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) between 1996 and 2009 and who resided within 6 hours <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> of the institution. Driving time from primary residence to DF/BWCC based on zipcode was determined using geographic information systems. The median <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> (range) to DF/BWCC was 72 (2 - 358) minutes. When patients were stratified by <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> quartile, overall survival (OS) after HSCT was similar {{in the first year}} but worse after 1  year in patients in the top quartile (≥ 160 minutes <b>driving</b> <b>time).</b> In a landmark analysis of the 909 patients alive and free of disease at 1 year, 5 -year OS was 76 % and 65 % for patients in the first (≤ 40 minutes) and fourth (≥ 160 minutes) quartiles, respectively (P =. 027). This was confirmed in a multivariable analysis. The difference appeared to be mostly because of an increase in nonrelapse mortality. The number of visits to the transplant center between day 100 and 365 after HSCT declined significantly with increasing <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> to the transplant center, which was independently associated with worse survival. Long <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> to the transplant center is associated with worse OS in patients alive and disease-free 1 year after HSCT, independently of other patient-, disease-, and HSCT-related variables. This may be in part related to the lower frequency of post-HSCT visits in patients living farther away...|$|R

40|$|Study Objectives: Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) is {{associated}} with driving impairment and road crashes. However, daytime function varies widely between patients presenting a clinical challenge when assessing crash risk. This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients showing "normal" versus "abnormal" driving simulator performance and examine whether anthropometric, clinical, and neurobehavioral measures predict abnormal driving. Methods: Thirty-eight OSA patients performed a 90 -min simulated driving task under 3 conditions: normal sleep, restricted sleep (4 h in bed), and normal sleep + alcohol (BAC∼ 0. 05 g/dL). Patients were classified as "resilient" drivers if, under all 3 experimental conditions their mean steering deviation fell within 2 standard deviations of the mean steering deviation of 20 controls driving under baseline normal sleep conditions, or a "vulnerable" driver if mean steering deviation was outside this range {{in at least one}} experimental condition. Potentially predictive baseline anthropometric, clinical, neurocognitive, and cortical activation measures were examined. Results: Of the 38 OSA patients examined, 23 (61 %) and 15 (39 %) were classified as resilient and vulnerable drivers, respectively. There were no differences in baseline measures between the groups, although the proportion of females was greater and self-reported <b>weekly</b> <b>driving</b> exposure was less among vulnerable drivers (p < 0. 05). On univariate analysis gender, <b>weekly</b> <b>driving</b> hours, and auditory event related potential P 2 amplitude were weakly associated with group status. Multivariate analysis showed <b>weekly</b> <b>driving</b> hours (OR 0. 69, 95 %CI, 0. 51 - 0. 94, p = 0. 02) and P 2 amplitude (OR 1. 34, 95 %CI 1. 02 - 1. 76, p = 0. 035) independently predicted vulnerable drivers. Conclusions: Most OSA patients demonstrated normal simulated driving performance despite exposure to further sleep loss or alcohol. Most baseline measures did not differentiate between resilient and vulnerable drivers, although prior driving experience and cortical function were predictive. Novel measures to assist identification of OSA patients at risk of driving impairment and possibly accidents are needed.
