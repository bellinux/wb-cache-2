40|$|Based upon {{interview}} data from 60 officers in four county jails, this paper examines {{the differences in}} the institutional work orientations and experiences of deputy sheriffs and career line correctional officers. We found that both deputy sheriffs and corrections officers felt they received little support from administrators and were treated as second-class employees. Corrections officers were more likely to emphasize the professionalism of <b>corrections</b> <b>work,</b> to reduce social distance with inmates, and to stress the importance of human relations skills in effective work performance. In contrast, deputies were more likely to emphasize the futility of <b>corrections</b> <b>work,</b> to view inmates with suspicion and distrust, and stress coercive control and order maintenance duties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} scenario, women have more {{responsibility}} {{since they are}} maintaining a balance between work and life. With particular reference to women lecturers they {{have a feeling that}} sometime their life is balanced and in other instances it is unbalanced. Since women lecturers are playing dual roles especially the personal and professional roles {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a balanced life. In the working environment women lecturers have to effectively manage the problems and maintain a cordial relationship with the staff members. An optimum level of balance is needed between personal and college work. When women lecturers experience more stress it affects their work life balance. Married women lecturers have more responsibilities as they have to take care of family members and meet their requirements as and when needed. But it is comparatively low with unmarried women lecturers. Lecturers do their paper <b>correction</b> <b>work</b> at home. It indirectly affects the work life balance. Children‘s education is also affected due to paper <b>correction</b> <b>work</b> at home. At the same time women lecturers work for long hours but are not able to accomplish more goals. Women lecturers also experience role conflict and ultimately the concentration power is also reduced due to family problems. Therefore personal problems affect the involvement of women lecturers in work...|$|R

In this paper, we compare female and male jail staff perceptions regarding the stress associated with work in jails, the job satisfaction to be derived from jail work, the job environment experienced in jails and the level of commitment to jail facilities across five jail settings. Our findings show important gender-based similarities and differences that need to be understood to maximize the benefits of the work force diversity that women bring to the corrections profession.

40|$|If supersymmetric {{partners}} {{of the known}} particles have masses at the multi-TeV scale, {{they will not be}} directly discovered at planned future colliders and decouple from most observables. However, such superpartners also induce non-decoupling effects that break the supersymmetric equivalence of gauge boson couplings $g_i$ and gaugino couplings $h_i$ through supersymmetric analogues of the oblique <b>corrections.</b> <b>Working</b> within well-motivated theoretical frameworks, we find that multi-TeV scale supersymmetric particles produce deviations at the 1 - 10 % level in the ratios $h_i/g_i$. Such effects allow one to bound the scale of kinematically inaccessible superpartners through precision measurements of processes involving the accessible superparticles. Alternatively, if all superpartners are found, significant deviations imply the existence of highly split exotic supermultiplets. Comment: 18 pages, REVTeX, no figur...|$|R

40|$|Economists {{often use}} matched samples, {{especially}} {{when dealing with}} earnings data where a number of missing observations need to be imputed. In this paper, we demonstrate that the ordinary least squares estimator of the linear regression model using matched samples is inconsistent and has a non-standard convergence rate to its probability limit. If only a few variables are used to impute the missing data then {{it is possible to}} correct for the bias. We propose two semi-parametric bias-corrected estimators and explore their asymptotic properties. The estimators have an indirectinference interpretation and their convergence rates depend on the number of variables used in matching. We can attain the parametric convergence rate if that number is no greater than three. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the bias <b>correction</b> <b>works</b> very well in such cases...|$|R

40|$|This Qualitative {{research}} {{hopes to}} understand the underlying processes of subtle discrimination in the graduate workplace.

We argue that subtle discrimination within a graduate workplace manifests itself through 4 key processes of power. These processes include; Installation, the process of introducing racial difference into the office setting and commencing the judging of minorities. Normalisation, the process of setting this difference as the status quo, usually through introducing racial discussion into group contexts. Thirdly acceptance, a process novel to graduate workplaces, in which minorities rationalise their prospects to accept discrimination and finally the process of correction which as well as acceptance works to solidify the status quo but instead, <b>correction</b> <b>works</b> through shunning and complimenting ethnic minorities...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} four-dimensional Z_ 2 random-plaquette lattice gauge theory {{as a model}} of topological quantum memory, the toric code in particular. In this model, the {{procedure}} of quantum error <b>correction</b> <b>works</b> properly in the ordered (Higgs) phase, and phase boundary between the ordered (Higgs) and disordered (confinement) phases gives the accuracy threshold of error correction. Using self-duality of the model in conjunction with the replica method, we show that this model has exactly the same mathematical structure as that of the two dimensional random-bond Ising model, which has been studied very extensively. This observation enables us to derive a conjecture on the exact location of the multicritical point (accuracy threshold) of the model, p_c= 0. 889972 [...] ., and leads to several nontrivial results including bounds on the accuracy threshold in three dimensions.

30|$|Starting {{from the}} Patlak equation, we first derive the {{correction}} formulas for SUR and SUV, respectively. The correction procedure is then evaluated {{in a group}} of nine patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer, for which 15 dynamical investigations are available. These data enable assessment of the full dynamic AIF as well as comparison of the actually observed tumor SUV changes over time with the correction factors derived for two time frames selected from the dynamic data. Furthermore, we apply the correction procedure to an independent group of ten dual time point (DTP) whole body studies, where the full AIF is not known. Here, the correction is used to map SUR (and SUV) from the second to the first time point to investigate whether the corrected SURs and SUVs are concordant with those determined at the first time point as should be the case if the <b>correction</b> <b>works</b> well.|$|R
40|$|Non-thermal {{pressure}} in galaxy clusters leads to underestimation {{of the mass}} of galaxy clusters based on hydrostatic equilibrium with thermal gas pressure. This occurs even for dynamically relaxed clusters that are used for calibrating the mass-observable scaling relations. We show that the analytical model for non-thermal pressure developed in Shi & Komatsu 2014 can correct for this so-called 'hydrostatic mass bias', if most of the non-thermal pressure comes from bulk and turbulent motions of gas in the intracluster medium. Our <b>correction</b> <b>works</b> for the sample average irrespective of the mass estimation method, or the dynamical state of the clusters. This makes it possible to correct for the bias in the hydrostatic mass estimates from X-ray surface brightness and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations that will be available for clusters {{in a wide range of}} redshifts and dynamical states.
