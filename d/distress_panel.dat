40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present two {{different}} approaches of financial distress pre-warning models appropriate for risk supervisors, investors and policy makers. We examine a sample of the financial institutions and electronic companies of Taiwan Security Exchange (TSE) market from 2002 through 2008. We present a binary logistic regression with paned data analysis. With the pooled binary logistic regression we build a model including more variables in the regression than with random effects, while the in-sample and out-sample forecasting performance is higher in random effects estimation than in pooled regression. On the other hand we estimate an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with Gaussian and Generalized Bell (Gbell) functions and we find that ANFIS outperforms significant Logit regressions in both in-sample and out-of-sample periods, indicating that ANFIS is a more appropriate tool for financial risk managers and for the economic policy makers in central banks and national statistical services.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general model that {{combines}} the Mixture Hazard Model with the Stochastic Frontier Model {{for the purposes}} of investigating the main determinants of the failures and performances of a panel of U. S. commercial banks during the 8 ̆ 5 nancial crisis that began in 2007. The combined model provides measures of the probability and time to failure conditional on a banks performance and vice versa. Both continuous-time and discrete-time speci 8 ̆ 5 cations of the model are considered in the paper. The estimation is carried out via the expectation-maximization algorithm due to incomplete information regarding the identity of at-risk banks. In- and out-of-sample predictive accuracy of the proposed models is investigated in order to assess their potential to serve as early warning tools.

40|$|The precast channel bridge (PCB) {{is a short}} span {{bridge that}} was {{commonly}} used on Iowa’s secondary roads approximately forty years ago. Each PCB consists of eight to ten simply supported precast panels ranging in length from 5. 8 m to 11. 0 m. The panels resemble a steel channel in cross-section; the web is orientated horizontally and forms the roadway deck and the legs act as shallow beams. Bundled reinforcing bars in each leg act as the primary flexural reinforcement. Many of the approximately 600 PCBs in Iowa show signs of significant deterioration. Typical deterioration consists of spalled concrete cover and corrosion of the bundled primary reinforcement. The objective {{of this research was}} to access the structural sufficiency of the deteriorated PCBs through field and laboratory testing. Four deteriorated PCBs were instrumented with strain gages to measure strains in both the concrete and reinforcing steel and transducers to measure vertical deflections. Response from loaded trucks was recorded and analyzed. Test results revealed that all measured strains and corresponding stresses were well within acceptable limits. Likewise, measured deflections were much less than the recommended AASHTO value. Laboratory testing consisted of loading twelve deteriorated panels to failure in a four point bending arrangement. Although all panels exhibited significant deflection prior to failure, the experimental capacity of eleven panels exceeded their theoretical capacity. The experimental capacity of the twelfth <b>panel,</b> an extremely <b>distressed</b> <b>panel,</b> was only slightly below its theoretical capacity.

40|$|The precast {{concrete}} deck bridge (PCDB) {{is a short}} span bridge that was commonly used on Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s secondary roads approximately forty years ago. Each PCDB span consists of eight to ten simply supported precast panels ranging in length from 19 ft to 36 ft. The panels resemble a steel channel in cross-section; the web is orientated horizontally and forms the roadway deck and the legs act as shallow beams. Bundled reinforcing bars in each leg act as the primary flexural reinforcement. Many of the approximately 600 PCDBs in Iowa show signs of significant deterioration. Typical deterioration consists of spalled concrete cover and corrosion of the bundled primary reinforcement. The objective {{of this research was}} to access the structural sufficiency of the deteriorated PCDBs through field and laboratory testing. Four deteriorated PCDBs were instrumented with strain gages to measure strains in both the concrete and reinforcing steel and transducers to measure vertical deflections. Response from loaded trucks was recorded and analyzed. Test results revealed that all measured strains and corresponding stresses were well within acceptable limits. Likewise, measured deflections were much less than the recommended AASHTO value. Load fractions, a measure of live load distribution, were calculated from the deflection data and compared for the four PCDBS. The two PCDBs tested without shear connectors were found to have load fractions considerably higher than those with shear connectors. Laboratory testing consisted of loading twelve deteriorated panels to failure in a four point bending arrangement. Although all panels exhibited significant deflection prior to failure, the experimental capacity of eleven panels exceeded their theoretical capacity. The experimental capacity of the twelfth <b>panel,</b> an extremely <b>distressed</b> <b>panel,</b> was only slightly below its theoretical capacity. Additional laboratory testing consisted of service tests performed on a four panel laboratory PCDB to determine the effect of various shear connection configurations on transverse load distribution. The laboratory PCDB was also utilized in an investigation into the behavior of an overloaded PCDB. Finally, a strengthening retrofit was applied to several panels and tested for its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|By {{utilizing}} the extreme dependence {{structure and the}} conditional probability of joint failure (CPJF) among risk factors, this paper characterizes a risk-stability index (RSI) that quantifies (i) common distress of risk factors, (ii) distress between specific risk factors, and (iii) distress to a portfolio related to a specific risk factor. The results show that financial stability is a continuum; that U. S. banks tend to cause the most stress to the global financial system (as defined herein); and that Asian banks show the most persistence of <b>distress.</b> Further, the <b>panel</b> VAR indicates that "leaning against the wind" reduces the (potential) instability of a financial system. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} bank concentration on bank financial distress using a balanced panel of commercial banks belonging to EU 25 over the sample period running from 2003 to 2007. Financial distress is proxied by the observations falling below a given threshold of the empirical distribution of a risk adjusted indicator of bank performance: the Shareholder Value ratio. We employ a panel probit regression estimated by GMM {{in order to obtain}} consistent and efficient estimates following the suggestion of Bertschek and Lechner (1998). Our findings suggest, after controlling for a number of enviroment variables, a positive effect of bank concentration on financial <b>distress.</b> EVA; Banking; <b>Panel</b> Probit; GMM...|$|R
5000|$|The {{floorplan}} of the Price Tower centers upon an inlaid cast bronze plaque, {{bearing the}} logo of the Price Company and marking {{the origin of}} a parallelogram grid upon which all exterior walls, interior partitions and doors, and built-in furniture are placed. The resulting design is a quadrant plan—one quadrant dedicated for double-height apartments, and three for offices. The materials for the Price Tower are equally innovative for a mid-twentieth-century skyscraper: cast concrete walls, pigmented concrete floors, aluminum-trimmed windows and doors, and patinated embossed and <b>distressed</b> copper <b>panels.</b> The general geometric element is the equilateral triangle, and all lighting fixtures and ventilation grilles are based upon that form while the angled walls and built-in furniture are based on fractions or multiples of the triangular module. The lobby contains two inscriptions by Walt Whitman. One is from the concluding stanza of Salut au Monde, and the other from Song of the Broad-Axe. Inside the Price Tower there are decoration paintings on the walls which consist of solid gold. People with claustrophobia may find it uncomfortable, due to the very tight spaces towards the upper floors and the very small elevators.|$|R
40|$|This study investigates whether {{transitions}} {{into and}} out of unpaid caregiving are associated with increased risk for onset of or delayed recovery from psychological distress, and traces the prevalence of distress across successive years of caring activity and after caregiving has ceased. The analysis is based on data from the British Household Panel Survey covering 3000 would-be carers, 2900 former carers, and 11, 100 non-carers during the 1990 s; their psychological well-being was assessed at annual intervals using the General Health Questionnaire. Carers providing long hours of care over extended spells present raised levels of distress, women more so than men. Compared with non-carers, risk for onset of distress increases progressively with the amount of time devoted to caregiving each week. Adverse effects on the psychological well-being of heavily involved carers are most pronounced around the start of their care episodes and when caregiving ends. Ongoing care increases their susceptibility to recurring distress, and adverse health effects are evident beyond the end of their caregiving episodes. Several groups of carers experience psychological health inequalities compared with non-carers, especially those looking after a spouse or partner, and mothers caring for a sick or disabled child. The findings underline the importance for effective carer support and health promotion of early identification of carers, monitoring high risk groups, timing appropriate interventions, and targeting resources.
