40|$|One {{of the key}} {{risks to}} {{financial}} stability is widespread default by UK companies. This article discusses an approach to quantifying the risk of default in <b>individual</b> <b>companies</b> using up-to-date market-based information. It finds that this Merton approach provides a reliable, ordinal, ranking of companies {{on the basis of}} their likelihood of going into liquidation. This is likely to prove to be a useful tool in regular surveillance. THE BANK MONITORS the likelihood of corporate default because of its impact on lenders and possibly therefore on systemic stability. Although some loan losses are to be expected, and so should be allowed for in loan pricing, unexpected default can erode capital to a potentially dangerous degree. Recent research at the Bank has been aimed at quantifying the risk of default by <b>individual</b> <b>companies</b> 1. There are a number of separate ways in which this can be assessed. First, by informal judgement based on <b>company</b> <b>visits</b> and accountin...|$|R

40|$|Technology-oriented <b>company</b> <b>visits</b> could {{potentially}} provide {{children with a}} stimulating ‘real-world’ setting to develop more broad and positive images of and attitudes toward technology and technical professions. The present study {{was the first to}} explore whether children’s images of and attitudes toward technology, technical competencies and technical professions could be affected by technology-oriented <b>company</b> <b>visits,</b> as they are presently carried out in the Netherlands. A previously validated measurement instrument was used to measure children’s images and attitudes prior to and after the visits and results were compared to similar measurements among children who did not take part in the visits. In addition, based on recent review studies about school visits to science centers, we derived several key theoretical guidelines for organizing effective school visits. Based on these guidelines, structured interviews were carried out with all teachers prior to the <b>company</b> <b>visits.</b> Results indicated that children’s images and attitudes remained mostly unaffected by the <b>company</b> <b>visits,</b> a finding that could be {{explained by the fact that}} the level of in-school preparation, follow-up activities and teachers’ level of involvement during the visits was generally low. In addition, observations during the visits showed that the activities at the technical companies were mostly ‘hands-on’ and stereotypical (e. g., working with machines). Based on these findings, we formulate a set of new guidelines for technology-oriented <b>company</b> <b>visits</b> that could improve the desired attitudinal effects...|$|R

40|$|We test {{a sample}} of 205 Canadian and 938 US equity funds during the period 2008 through 2011. Specifically, we look at whether manager {{characteristics}} and actions have any bearing on the performance, management fees and systematic risk of the funds with a special focus {{on the impact of}} <b>company</b> <b>visits.</b> We find that <b>company</b> <b>visits</b> consistently positively and significantly affect performance, portfolio turnover and fees leading us to conclude {{that in the case of}} the US sample, <b>company</b> <b>visits</b> have a value added effect while we are inconclusive on its effects on the Canadian sample. Other findings using the three stage least square methodology show that for the Canadian sample, investment experience and employee equity ownership positively affect the fund’s beta and team size has a positive impact on fees while <b>company</b> <b>visits</b> have a positive impact only in the system with the Sharpe ratio as the performance measure. The US results show that investment experience has a positive and significant impact on the fund’s beta while a negative impact on both portfolio turnover and fees. Finally, employee equity ownership also has a positive impact on systematic risk while team size has a positive impact on fees...|$|R
