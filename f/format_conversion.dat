40|$|Abstract Background When {{processing}} microarray data sets, {{we recently}} noticed that some gene names were being changed inadvertently to non-gene names. Results A little detective work traced {{the problem to}} default date <b>format</b> <b>conversions</b> and floating-point <b>format</b> <b>conversions</b> in the very useful Excel program package. The date conversions affect at least 30 gene names; the floating-point conversions affect at least 2, 000 if Riken identifiers are included. These conversions are irreversible; the original gene names cannot be recovered. Conclusions Users of Excel for analyses involving gene names {{should be aware of}} this problem, which can cause genes, including medically important ones, to be lost from view and which has contaminated even carefully curated public databases. We provide work-arounds and scripts for circumventing the problem. </p...|$|R
