40|$|The overall {{structure}} of the island of Mallorca consists {{of a set of}} <b>horsts</b> and grabens which are bounded by Upper Miocene-Quaternary listric normal faults. <b>Horsts</b> are segments of a Lower Miocene thrusted and folded belt and constitutes the Sierras. The basins developed at the grabens, which are filled by Upper Miocene-Quaternary sediments. Groundwater flows from the <b>horsts</b> to the grabens. At the <b>horsts</b> adjacent aquifers exists because of its geological structure (imbricate thrust system), whereas at the grabens aquifers are superposed due to the horizontal sedimentary infilling. Major springs, very important for water supply to Palma, are located at the listric normal fault...|$|R
25|$|The Spratly Islands {{consist of}} islands, reefs, banks and shoals that consist of {{biogenic}} carbonate. These accumulations of biogenic carbonate lie upon the higher crests of major submarine ridges that are uplifted fault blocks known by geologists as <b>horsts.</b> These <b>horsts</b> {{are part of}} a series of parallel and en echelon, half-grabens and rotated fault-blocks. The long axes of the <b>horsts,</b> rotated fault blocks and half-grabens form well-defined linear trends that lie parallel to magnetic anomalies exhibited by the oceanic crust of the adjacent South China Sea. The <b>horsts,</b> rotated fault blocks, and the rock forming the bottoms of associated grabens consist of stretched and subsided continental crust that is composed of Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous strata that include calc-alkalic extrusive igneous rocks, intermediate to acid intrusive igneous rocks, sandstones, siltstones, dark-green claystones, and metamorphic rocks that include biotitemuscovitefeldsparquartz migmatites and garnetmica schists.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, C.W. <b>Horsting</b> of the RCA Corporation {{published}} a paper which reported test {{results on the}} reliability of semiconductor devices in which the connections were made using aluminium wires bonded ultrasonically to gold plated posts. His paper demonstrated {{the importance of the}} Kirkendall effect in wire bonding technology, but also showed the significant contribution of any impurities present to the rate at which precipitation occurred at the wire bonds. Two of the important contaminants that have this effect, known as <b>Horsting</b> effect (<b>Horsting</b> voids) are fluorine and chlorine. Both Kirkendall voids and <b>Horsting</b> voids are known causes of wire bond fractures, though historically this cause is often confused with the purple colored appearance of one of the five different gold-aluminium intermetallics, commonly referred to as [...] "purple plague" [...] and less often [...] "white plague".|$|R
5|$|The club {{also has}} {{quite a number of}} {{high-profile}} supporters, among them Pope Benedict XVI, Boris Becker, retired German tennis player, Wladimir Klitschko, Ukrainian boxer, <b>Horst</b> Seehofer and Edmund Stoiber, former Minister-President of Bavaria, to name just a few.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, the {{violence}} between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader <b>Horst</b> Wessel being shot by {{two members of}} the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the NSDAP anthem.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{commissioned}} a three-masted training ship and named her the <b>Horst</b> Wessel. The ship {{was taken as}} a war prize by the United States after World War II. After repairs and modifications, she was commissioned on 15 May 1946 into the United States Coast Guard as the USCGC Eagle (WIX-327). She remains in service to this day.|$|E

5|$|Koht's first {{travel abroad}} was in 1890, when he {{accompanied}} {{his father as}} well as Hans Jacob <b>Horst</b> and John Theodor Lund to an interparliamentary peace conference in London. In 1895 he was a founding member and {{board member of the}} Norwegian Peace Association, serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902. From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named Fredstidende ("Peace Times").|$|E
5|$|Lansdale {{accompanied}} the Alsos Mission on Operation Harborage, which began on 22 April 1945. A special Allied force called T-Force went deep behind enemy lines, seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured {{a number of}} scientists, including Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, Karl Wirtz, <b>Horst</b> Korsching and Erich Bagge and Otto Hahn.|$|E
5000|$|On June 22, rector magnificus Gispen {{responded to}} the {{controversy}} {{in an interview with}} NRC Handelsblad, another Dutch daily. Gispen maintained that neither [...] "Islamophobia" [...] nor censorship was at issue, but rather the quality of van der <b>Horst's</b> work. He attributed van der <b>Horst's</b> response to resentment over having to retire and the [...] "marginalization" [...] of his academic department.|$|R

5|$|At Euro 1972, Belgium {{finished}} third after losing 1–2 against West Germany and beating Hungary 2–1. The team's best continental result is their second place at Euro 1980 in Italy. By finishing as group winners, Belgium reached the final, to face West Germany. The West German <b>Horst</b> Hrubesch scored first, but René Vandereycken equalised {{courtesy of a}} penalty. Two minutes before the regular playing time ended, Hrubesch scored again denying Belgium a first European title.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, Groves sent Lansdale to Europe, {{where he}} worked with the Alsos Mission to secure 1,000 tons of uranium ore from the German Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt. He also participated in the {{planning}} and execution of Operation Harborage, in which a special Allied force went deep behind enemy lines, seized 1.5 tons of uranium ingots, and captured a number of German nuclear energy project scientists, including Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, Karl Wirtz, <b>Horst</b> Korsching and Erich Bagge and Otto Hahn.|$|E
5|$|Instruments and checklists were {{developed}} to structure the processes and decisions of companies for successful corporate development. In this period the main contributors to design management were Michael Farr, <b>Horst</b> Rittel, HfG Ulm, Christopher Alexander, the London Business School, Peter Gorb, the Design Management Institute, and the Royal Society of Arts. Debates in design disciplines were focusing on design science, design methodology, wicked problems, Ulm methodology, new German design, and semiotic and scenario technique.|$|E

50|$|<b>Horsts</b> and grabens {{are very}} well {{documented}} throughout this region. Although <b>horsts</b> and grabens do show and produce crustal extension, for a sufficient ocean basin to form, {{there needs to be}} extension that can accommodate for the extensive down fall of the grabens. Listric faults produce the correct model for this sufficient crustal extension. These faults have been documented by Chorowicz, J. 2005 and aid in further verification of the future of this region and the potential for continued extension and subsidence.|$|R

5|$|Interested {{in using}} sources other than archaeology, Grinsell {{made use of}} documents, place-names, folklore, and the {{accounts}} of antiquarians {{as part of his}} research. According to later archaeologists Amy Gazin-Schwartz and Cornelius Holtfdorf, Grinsell {{was one of the few}} archaeologists of his generation who was interested in the relationship between folklore and archaeology, comparing him in this way to continental European scholars Paul Saintyves, <b>Horst</b> Ohlhaver, and Karel C. Peeters.|$|E
5|$|Kühn {{joined the}} {{national}} team in 2009, while in Stuttgart, where she now lives. On 11 July 2009 during the International Paralympic Day celebration in Berlin, the team {{showed up at the}} Brandenburg Gate before 58,000 visitors, and Kühn gave President <b>Horst</b> Köhler a demonstration of the sport. The team won gold at the European Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Stoke Mandeville, England, in 2009, and silver at the Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Birmingham, England the following year. In 2011, they again won the European Championship, which this time was held in Nazareth, Israel.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Airlanding Brigade {{moved quickly}} to secure the landing zones. The 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment moved into Wolfheze, the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment secured DZ 'X', {{deploying}} its companies around the DZ and in Renkum, and the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers moved to secure DZ 'Y'. Here, they ambushed the Dutch SS Wach Battalion as it headed toward Arnhem from Ede. Units of the Airlanding Artillery and Divisional HQ headed into Wolfheze and Oosterbeek where medical officers set up a Regimental Aid Post {{at the home of}} Kate ter <b>Horst.</b>|$|E
50|$|Geologically, Eastern California {{is mostly}} {{part of the}} Basin and Range Province, marked by crustal extension, with <b>horsts</b> and grabens. Volcanism is also very evident in this region.|$|R
50|$|The name core {{mountains}} {{is derived}} from the structural element, resistant crystalline basement rocks, preserved in the core of <b>horsts,</b> often forming the highest peaks of the mountains.|$|R
50|$|The {{geography}} of Scania {{was shaped by}} the last ice age, the Weichsel glaciation, {{a time when it}} was totally covered with ice. The relief of Scania's south-western landscape was formed by thick Quaternary deposits from sediment accumulation during the glaciations. Hallandsåsen and Söderåsen are major landmarks but, contrary to popular belief, they are not ridges left behind by the retreating ice but <b>horsts</b> formed by inversion tectonic activity along the Tornquist Tectonic zone in the late Cretaceous. The Scanian <b>horsts</b> run in a north-west to south-east direction, marking the southwest border of Fennoscandia.|$|R
5|$|The final of the 2007 Women's World Cup {{was seen}} by 9.05million {{television}} viewers (a 50.5 percent market share). After the team returned to Germany, they were celebrated by a crowd of 20,000 in Frankfurt. In December 2007, all players of the World Cup squad received the Silberne Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), the highest state decoration for athletes in Germany. National coach Silvia Neid was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit on ribbon by German president <b>Horst</b> Köhler.|$|E

5|$|Having {{previously}} represented Germany at U18 level, Holtby {{made his}} debut for the U19's in September 2008 and earned 12 caps overall. He scored {{the first of}} his four international goals for the German U19 team on 11 October 2008, netting in a 5–0 victory over Lithuania. The following year, Germany youth coach <b>Horst</b> Hrubesch named Holtby in his squad for the U20 World Cup in Egypt. Holtby scored two goals at the tournament, one of which was against eventual runners-up Brazil in the quarter-finals. In 2013, he captained Germany at the European Under-21 Championship in Israel and was named in as the nation's only representative in the Team of the Tournament.|$|E
