5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the lowest level, four <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the next level up, and two <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
5|$|In some {{specimens}} of S.luteus, the partial veil separates from the stipe (rather than the cap margin), leaving cottony patches of veil {{hanging from the}} cap margin. In this state, fruit bodies can be confused with those of S.albidipes. Unlike S.luteus, however, S.albidipes does not have glandular <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> its stipe.|$|E

5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the stipe.|$|E
5|$|Good field {{characteristics}} for Suillus luteus {{include the}} slimy brown cap, glandular <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the upper stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is Suillus granulatus, {{which is another}} common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat. Suillus granulatus is yellow fleshed and exudes latex droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, Suillus luteus {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related Suillus grevillei is found under larch and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of Gomphidius glutinosus may look comparable from above but have gills rather than pores underneath. In North America, Suillus borealis and S.pseudobrevipes also have partials veils, but lack the distinctive ring of S.luteus. S.cothurnatus forms a band-like ring on the stipe that tends to be brownish rather than purplish.|$|E
5|$|Suillus intermedius, {{found in}} northeastern and {{northern}} North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to S.salmonicolor. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as S.salmonicolor. It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although {{it has not been}} definitively established whether S.cothurnatus is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from S.salmonicolor: a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the stem that consist of bundles of multiseptate hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other Suillus species with which S.salmonicolor might be confused include S.acidus and S.subalutaceus. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.|$|E

5|$|The Congo serpent eagle (Circaetus spectabilis) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, and is {{sometimes}} placed in the monotypic genus Dryotriorchis by some taxonomic authorities. This species is found in western and central Africa, with its range stretching from Sierra Leone south to Angola and west to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It occurs in upper and lower Guinean forests, which are dense rainforests. This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests’ dark understories. It has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and Dryotriorchis spectabilis batesi. Though monotypic, {{it appears to be}} very closely related to Circaetus. This hawk is a medium-sized bird with distinctive short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is varying shades of brown on its back and has a slight crest. Its breast is white with variable amounts of a rufous wash and, in the nominate subspecies, is covered in round, blackish spots. The subspecies D. s. batesi only has these <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> its flanks. The Congo serpent eagle closely resembles Cassin's hawk-eagle, and some ornithologists believe that this likeness is a rare example of avian mimicry. It is a very vocal raptor, and often {{is one of the most}} heard species in its habitat.|$|E
5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} among the subspecies. For T. l. ludovicianus, the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and uppertail-coverts. Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown, {{with a series of}} small white <b>dots</b> <b>on</b> the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible. The legs are flesh-colored.|$|E

5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or <b>dots,</b> <b>on</b> a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E
