40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a pricing and production-distribution model for a deteriorating item in a two-echelon supply chain. The profit {{function}} for the manufacturer and retailer in the integrated supply chain is derived. The manufacturer's production batch size is regulated to an integer multiple of the discrete <b>delivery</b> <b>lot</b> quantity to the retailer. The objective is to maximize the total profit per unit time by finding the optimal selling price, production lot size, total cycle time, number of deliveries, and <b>delivery</b> <b>lot</b> size, simultaneously. Based {{on the notion of}} optimal interval, we outline an effective algorithm for finding the optimal solution. Finally, the authors present a numerical example to illustrate the theoretical results of the model. Sensitivity analysis for the optimal solution with respect to major parameters is also carried out. The results show that, when the deterioration rate increases, both the optimal production lot size and cycle time decrease. It {{is interesting to note that}} an increase in the deterioration rate also tends to reduce the <b>delivery</b> <b>lot</b> size without affecting the number of deliveries per production batch. Also, the optimal interval for N does not change when deterioration rate changes. Reductions in the inventory cycle times for both parties demonstrate the negative effects of deterioration on the supply chain. ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{supply chain}} {{policies}} are increasingly {{influenced by the}} lean philosophy, which calls for increased synchronization and smaller but more frequent shipments between the supply chain partners. One of the strategies used in this respect is lot splitting, i. e. the splitting of a single order quantity among multiple <b>deliveries.</b> <b>Lot</b> splitting is known to offer numerous advantages over a lot-for-lot policy, such as decreasing flow times and lower congestion levels. In this paper, we prove analytically that lot splitting improves the delivery reliability of the supplier, and hence the production schedule stability of the buyer. We also propose an approximation to estimate the delivery reliability {{in terms of the}} lot splitting policy and the system characteristics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract — Considerable {{attention}} {{to coordinate the}} system between buyer and vendor has become an interesting issue to efficiently increase the performance of supply chain activities. Joint economic lot size model (JELS) has been introduced by many researchers as the spirit of coordinating the flow of material from the vendor to its downstream. As an inventory replenishment technique, JELS model is centered on reducing joint total cost of vendor and buyer by simultaneously deciding optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>lot</b> size, number of deliveries, and batch production lot. It is appropriate {{to take into account}} transportation costs as the function shipping weight and distance since <b>delivery</b> <b>lot</b> size has interrelated with shipping weight. Hence, this study constitutes an effort to develop the model of JELS by incorporating transportation cost. The solution procedure of the model is developed for solving two problems which are incapacitated and capacitated model. In addition, numerical examples were provided to illustrate the feasibility of the solution procedure in deriving optimal solution. The result presents central decision making which is useful for coordination and collaboration between vendor and buyer. Index Terms—Supply chain, Joint economic lot size...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a multi supplier single buyer integrated production system model. Several suppliers transform raw materials into semi-finished goods or components with constant production rates {{in order to}} supply a single buyer. The buyer processes components from the suppliers into finished products with a constant production rate. Non-conforming item and product warranty are also considered in this study. There are non-conforming items in the supplier production lot, in which the number of non-conforming items for each lot is probabilistic and the non-conforming items are reprocessed before they are delivered to the buyer. The result is that a buyer does not bear the cost of non-conforming item. Supplier provides component warranty to the buyer while finished product warranty to the customer {{is provided by the}} buyer. Component warranty period from the supplier (Wi) is shorter than finished product warranty period from the buyer (W), which is given and fixed. If a finished product is experiencing a failure in the end customer within the warranty period, a minimal repair will be done. If failure occurs after Wi, the supplier does not bear any warranty cost, but the buyer does, which covers the customer transportation cost and the repair cost. If failure occurs before Wi, the supplier should pay the repair cost and the transportation cost to the buyer while buyer only pays the customer transportation cost. A mathematical model is proposed to determine optimal number of <b>delivery</b> <b>lots</b> in order to minimize the integrated total relevant costs of both buyer and supplier. The cost of the supplier covers the setup cost, holding cost, rework cost, and the product warranty cost, while the buyer cost covers order cost, holding cost and product warranty cost.

The analytical result shows that the more flexible the delivery capacity is, the smaller the optimal production size is, {{which is consistent with}} short order lead time and small lot size that claimed by the wholesaler. Therefore, the manufacturer can quickly respond to demand of the wholesaler under the condition that the total cost is invariable. Moreover, when the delivery capacity isn’t absolute flexibility, the manufacturer may motivate the wholesaler to undertake product delivery through reducing the transfer price so that the wholesaler’s optimal order size under decentralized supply chain is closer to both the manufacturer’s optimal production size and the entire supply chain’s optimal size under centralized supply chain, which may benefit the entire supply chain since both can obtain a win-win solution...|$|R

Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud, 1990 The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LOAS) {{method was}} {{developed}} in industry to determine at reasonable cost whether each lot of a shipment is acceptable, based on samples of a few elements from the lot. Acting as inspectors of quality control, the field supervisors of the Costa Rican primary health care programme used the LOAS technique to assess performance {{in all of the}} programme's 758 <b>delivery</b> points (<b>lots).</b> They selected probability samples of 20 households and classified the lot as unacceptable when the sample contained more than four unserved households. This 20 - 4 LOAS rule was aimed to identify lots with less than 70 % coverage. Forty-three percent of lots were found unacceptable in their home visit schedule, and 25 % unacceptable in vaccination coverage. The probability of accepting defective lots, or consumer risk, was estimated at 4 %, and the probability of rejecting acceptable lots, or provider rik, was at 17 %. As side results, it was found that 84 % of children aged 1 – 2 years were fully vaccinated, and an estimated 58 % of households had been visited in the last six months. A household survey showed that clinic records, which serve as both a sampling frame and source of information for the LOAS assessment, produce accurate estimates of vaccination coverage but contain biased information about home visit dates. Given the chronic lack of timely and accurate information from service statistics, and the high costs of conventional sampling surveys, the LOAS technique appears to be a cost-efficient alternative for monitoring delivery points of primary health care in some circumstances.

40|$|Single capacitated {{production}} facilities where multiple products are produced pose particularly challenging scheduling problems. The traditional {{economic lot size}} calculation reflects the optimum production batch size {{in the light of}} the tradeoff between inventory carrying costs and order preparation/setup costs. However, these calculations are straightforward only when applied to a single product. When multiple products are produced on the same facility, the production quantities must be translated into a schedule which is within the capacity of the facility and results in the timely satisfaction of demand for each product. Previously published solution procedures directly address the capacity issue. A far less tractable issue is the stockout concern. This issue has previously been addressed by either (1) imposing (often overly restrictive) constraints a priori to guarantee feasibility from the outset possibly eliminating more economic schedule alternatives from consideration or (2) heuristic enumeration procedures where trial solutions are evaluated for feasibility a posteriori but the escape from infeasibility often poses algorithmic difficulties. In this paper, the focus is on providing a workable production sequence through a posteriori tests. Mathematical programming approaches are defined which include alternative formulations to better address the stockout concern.

40|$|Background The {{third stage}} of labour {{is defined as}} the {{interval}} between birth of the baby and complete expulsion of the placenta. Some degree of blood loss occurs after the birth of the baby due to separation of the placenta. This period is a risky period because the uterus may not contract well after birth and heavy blood loss can endanger the life of the mother. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL) reduces the occurrence of severe postpartum haemorrhage by approximately 60 – 70 %. Active management consists of three interventions packages or steps. These are administration of oxytocin within one minute after delivery of the baby, controlled cord traction and uterine massage. Objective: To evaluate the performance of health care providers on AMTSL in Dar e s salaam municipal hospitals. Methodology: This was an observational cross sectional study in three municipal hospitals of Dar es Salaam. It was a prospective direct observation of child birth, particularly in the third stage of labour. A total of 400 deliveries were observed. Study design. Results: The active management of the third stage of labour was correctly done for 46 % of observed deliveries. Oxytocin administration within one minute of the birth of the baby was done in 54. 3 %, controlled cord traction in 85. 2 % and uterine massage in 93 % of observed deliveries. Conclusion Active management of the third stage of labour is an important skill to be acquired by every health care provider. Early preparation of oxytocin before <b>delivery</b> contributes a <b>lot</b> in provision of oxytocin within one minute of the delivery of the baby and therefore this practice should be highly addressed to every health care provider...|$|R

The result showed that selenium is more concentrated in placentas of women affected by GDM (average median value (a. m. v.) : 0. 708 μg/g d. w.) than in the control group (a. m. v. : 0. 661 μg/g d. w.) (p< 0. 001) while cadmium is more concentrated in the control group (a. m. v. : 0. 051 μg/g d. w.) than in the diabetic group (a. m. v. : 0. 035 μg/g d. w.) (p< 0. 001). From the analysis of blood emerged that selenium is more concentrated in the diabetic group (a. m. v. : 0. 063 μg/g) (p< 0. 001) than in the control group (a. m. v. : 0. 045 μg/g) while aluminium is more concentrated in the control group (median: 1. 123 μg/g) than in the diabetic group (median: 1. 065 μg/g) (p< 0. 001). We concluded that GDM is associated to higher level of selenium in both placenta and blood and lower level of cadmium and aluminium respectively in placenta and blood. In the future we suggest to wash placentas to diminish the contribute of blood, to analyze more samples and always the same peace of placenta to diminish the contribute of the variation in the concentration of the elements between different samples and within the single one. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{building}} large buildings, such as compartment buildings, {{there is}} a number of deliveries arriving on the construction site daily. In order to receive these deliveries without disturbing {{the rest of the}} work going on JM often books a fixed unloading time. When doing that they can be prepared when the delivery arrives. Making sure {{there is a}} suitable unloading area, someone to meet the delivery and when needed proper machines, such as a tractor or a crane, to help unload bigger deliveries. The person receiving the delivery is supposed to make an acceptance control where they check the delivered goods making sure nothing has been damaged in transport and that they have received what they were supposed to receive. Also noting whether the delivery arrived on time or not.   In 2010 JM introduced structured production as their take on lean, and thus working more effectively. Structured production at JM means that everyone in the company performs the same task in the same way according to a predetermined assembly instruction. It also includes a certain way to make time plans for the whole project {{as well as for the}} next 5 weeks. As for deliveries JM tries to order these as close to just in time as possible. That reduces keeping material in stock at the construction site and also handling this material more than necessary. Handling material in stock is a big source of accidents and takes time away from other work. However, it is very vulnerable to have essential supplies arrive to the construction site just when they are needed as a delay can ruin the whole timeline of the production.   This report aims, through qualitative studies, to find out how widespread the problem of late deliveries is at JM'S three construction sites in Uppsala and what JM is able to do to avoid it.   The study showed that if deliveries are delayed, it refers almost exclusively to 1 - 5 h on the desired delivery date. Deliveries being delayed so that they do not arrive on the right day were very unusual. One of the questions in the interviews was also whether JM themselves could have a negative effect on deliveries arriving on time by making changes in their orders, but this seems to have no significance when changes are made only after approval by the supplier and that the vast majority of deliveries after all still arrives on the right day. It rather seems that some providers take the order of a fixed unloading time less seriously. Something that does not make things better is that the procedure for handling delayed <b>deliveries</b> varies a <b>lot</b> just between the three construction sites in Uppsala and also between supervisors on the same construction site. It is not even always the case that the supplier is notified that the delivery was late, and then they do not know that they need to improve. Most suppliers buy in the transport of a shipping company and order a fixed unloading time from them. The suppliers interviewed all said that they wanted to know if the delivery was late so that they can contact the shipping company...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. When the new South African Government {{was elected}} to power in 1994 it had a special mandate to provide {{appropriate}} services {{to all the people}} of the country. This was, still is {{and will continue to be}} a massive responsibility of government and one that requires total commitment by people at all levels of government. However, the negative effects of the legacy of the past apartheid education and training system cannot be over emphasised in this regard. The need for redress and re-skilling of public servants as a result of the changing and ever-increasing demands for quality service <b>delivery</b> puts a <b>lot</b> of emphasis on further development and underscores and further supports the issue of lifelong learning in the Public Service. However, far more complex are the people leadership and shifts in management mind-set that must happen. Yet, unless people in the government sector change how they think and work, service delivery outcomes will fall short of what the poorest and most vulnerable citizens need. The legislative frameworks seek to transform a culture of Public Service delivery from prescribing service packages to citizens, to putting citizens at the centre of service delivery through the Batho Pele (“meaning” the People First) Principles. In giving credence to the above and the enormity of the challenge of quality service delivery, the researcher of this research report narrowed down the scope of the research to the Provincial Government Western Cape. The “new” Provincial Government Western Cape (PGWC), after the 2009 national democratic elections, has embarked on a process termed “modernisation” The modernisation project spans across all activities that are under the control of the PGWC. The human resource development function of the province is one such function that is being repositioned in terms of the modernisation project objectives. This, therefore, means by implication that the training and development aspects of the human resources development were reassessed. This was re-enforced by the following statement from a provincial document titled blueprint- provincial training (2010) – “One of the major causes of poor service delivery is the fact that employees are not adequately skilled or that skills have become out-dated”. This brings into focus the rational for the topic of this research report: Exploring the need and use for management coaching to develop senior management competencies within The Provincial Government Western Cape, v and the stated aim of this research report: Exploring the need and use of management coaching to develop the management competencies of the Senior Management Service (SMS) employee component within the Provincial Government Western Cape (PGWC) and furthermore, make recommendations based on the findings of the study as to the need and application of management coaching within the PGWC. This research is exploratory and used qualitative research techniques. The study is undertaken as not much actual literature is available on the topic that is being researched. This in essence justifies why the research is exploratory as qualitative methods are particularly well suited to studies which canvas a variety of opinions and stakeholders (Ebrahim, 2008). The data analysis method used is content analysis which is defined as a systematic, research method for analysing textual information in a standardised way that allows evaluators to make inferences about that information. The research followed the steps in using content analysis as the method to analyse the results from semi-structured, open-ended interviews conducted with 14 individuals identified as the stakeholder group. To assert that the research result based on content analysis is valid is to assert that the results do not depend upon or are generalisable beyond the specific data, method or measure of a particular study...|$|R
