500|$|Although many of {{his works}} are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his [...] "style", as he feels that the term boxes him into only {{creating}} one type of music. He prefers to call himself a [...] "music practitioner", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as {{he is capable of}} many styles, such as Japanese pop, which he has written along with Jeff Miyahara. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if you understand the structure. He does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for [...] "ambitious" [...] games by people with [...] "new ideas".|$|E
500|$|There are 250 {{tracks in}} the game's sound player. Itoi did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of Sakai's work. He noted that the final track, [...] "Love Theme", was added {{towards the end of}} the {{development}} cycle. While the ending was incomplete, Itoi planned to use the Pigmask theme, but they decided to add a new song to better reflect their intentions in December 2005. The game's soundtrack was released on compact disc on November 2, 2006. Kyle Miller of RPGFan wrote that the game retained the quirkiness of the previous sound{{tracks in the}} series despite the change in composers. He found the second half of the album, which included reinterpreted [...] "classics" [...] from the series, to be its strongest.|$|E
500|$|Boon {{said that}} there was a focus on {{including}} characters from the first three Mortal Kombat games and that [...] "if you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> character from those games, you're probably going to see him or her in the game." [...] The game's developers stated that the characters had been designed with the intent to make each character unique – each having his or her own individual stance, victory pose and Fatality with no shared animations. Lead designer John Edwards said that characters are differentiated by features such as power and speed. Producer Shaun Himmerick said that the internal and external character design required [...] "two months or ten weeks". Boon said that an exclusive character was planned for the Xbox 360 version, but [...] "unfortunately, the circumstances didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive." [...] Ed Boon mentioned that Marcus Fenix of the Gears of War franchise was considered for the Xbox 360 version as the console guest fighter. He also said they were in talks to include Sweet Tooth from Sony's Twisted Metal franchise.|$|E

2500|$|Almost all Draka {{citizens}} own {{at least}} a few slaves. The Draka are heavily outnumbered, meaning that a slave rebellion is a constant threat. In response, the Draka are utterly ruthless in their discipline of serfs. Impalement is the favored Draka method of executing rebellious serfs. Nonetheless, many Draka, especially those who are central characters in the novels, aim to create an idealized, [...] "rural community under a lord" [...] feel on their lands. Most Draka are quite fond of several of their serfs, as a European or American might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> horse. Such an idealistic image is often spoiled, however, when punishment — always severe — has to be enacted. Killing a serf is never a crime, though it is a possible tort when the serf is the property of another Draka.|$|E

"Well, when I was a boy, I read Chaucer, {{and liked}} him very much; {{and the other}} day when I was looking over Leigh Hunt's essays, I found a number of them about Chaucer with long, well-chosen extracts; and I don't know when I've found greater {{pleasure}} in poetry.

6000|$|And {{while she}} fanned {{she thought of}} Derek as a little, black-haired, blazing-gray-eyed slip of a sallow boy, all little thin legs and arms moving funnily like a foal's. He {{had been such a}} dear, gentlemanlike little chap. It was dreadful he should be forgetting himself so, and getting into such trouble. And her {{thoughts}} passed back beyond him to her own four little sons, among whom she had been so careful not to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite,</b> but to love them all equally. And she thought of how their holland suits wore out, especially in the elastic, and got green behind, almost before they were put on; and of how she used to cut their hairs, spending at least three-quarters of an hour on each, because she had never been quick at it, while they sat so good--except Stanley, and darling Tod, who WOULD move just as she had got into the comb particularly nice bits of his hair, always so crisp and difficult! And of how she had cut off Felix's long golden curls when he was four, and would have cried over it, if crying hadn't always been silly! And of how beautifully they had all had their measles together, so that she had been up with them day and night for about a fortnight. And of how it was a terrible risk with Derek and darling Nedda, not at all a wise match, she was afraid. And yet, if they really were attached, of course one must put the best face on it! And how lovely it would be to see another little baby some day; and what a charming little mother Nedda would make--if only the dear child would do her hair just a little differently! And she perceived that Derek was asleep--and one of her own legs, from the knee down. She would certainly have bad pins and needles if she did not get up; but, since she would not wake him for the world, she must do something else to cure it. And she hit upon this plan. She had only to say, 'Nonsense, you haven't anything of the sort!' and it was sure to go away. She said this to her leg, but, being a realist, she only made it feel like a pin-cushion. She knew, however, that she had only to persevere, because it would never do to give in. She persevered, and her leg felt as if red-hot needles were being stuck in it. Then, for the life of her, she could not help saying a little psalm. The sensation went away and left her leg quite dead. She would have no strength in it at all when she got up. But that would be easily cured, when she could get to her bag, with three globules of nux vomica--and darling Derek must not be waked up for anything! She waited thus till Nedda came back, and then said, [...] "Sssh!" ...|$|E
