40|$|The {{impulsive}} {{phase of}} a flare is characterized by impulsive bursts of X-ray and microwave radiation, related to impulsive footpoint heating up to 50 or 60 MK, by upward gas velocities (150 to 400 km/sec) and by a gradual increase of the flare's thermal energy content. These phenomena, as well as non-thermal effects, are all related to the impulsive energy injection into the flare. The available observations are also quantitatively consistent with a model in which energy is injected into the <b>flare</b> by <b>beams</b> of energetic electrons, causing ablation of chromospheric gas, followed by convective rise of gas. Thus, a hole is burned into the chromosphere; {{at the end of}} impulsive {{phase of a}}n average flare the lower part of that hole is situated about 1800 km above the photosphere. H alpha and other optical and UV line emission is radiated by a thin layer (approx. 20 km) {{at the bottom of the}} flare kernel. The upward rising and outward streaming gas cools down by conduction in about 45 s. The non-thermal effects in the initial phase are due to curtailing of the energy distribution function by escape of energetic electrons. The single flux tube model of a flare does not fit with these observations; instead we propose the spaghetti-bundle model. Microwave and gamma-ray observations suggest the occurrence of dense flare knots of approx. 800 km diameter, and of high temperature.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{several aspects of}} the {{interaction}} of 1 -D neutral beams with plasmas are considered. In order to clearly understand the dual rôles of a background plasma in collisionally decelerating the beam and its response to the consequently generated E-field, we examine two cases: an artificial unresponsive background plasma, that corresponds closely {{to the case of}} an unionized gas; and a realistic background plasma, whose charges respond to the presence of any E-field. In the former case, the electric field results solely in extremely small scale oscillation of the beam electrons about the protons as both decelerate collisionally and, although electron runaway is possible, the numbers involved are found to be negligibly small. However, collisional separation of the beam electrons and protons does occur {{in the case of a}} realistic background plasma, since E easily drives a neutralising dense plasma electron current. Despite the charge separation, runaway is found to be impossible in this case because of the masking effect that the background plasma electrons have on the separated charges unless the plasma is extremely tenuous compared to the beam, where the plasma behaviour is close to that of a near-neutral gas. These effects are shown by approximate analytic mean particle solutions and confirmed by simulations from an electrostatic particle code, which can deal with collective effects. Additional numerical simulations are also performed to investigate the generation of Langmuir waves by a neutral beam. The consequences of these results are discussed for <b>flare</b> neutral <b>beams</b> and corresponding radiation signatures. As regards hard X-ray production by runaways, although some very high energy electrons may result, the number is far too small to be relevant to solar flare HXR burst production. The beam and plasma oscillations may however be relevant to radio bursts...|$|R
40|$|Type III radio bursts are intense radio {{emissions}} {{triggered by}} beams of energetic electrons {{often associated with}} solar <b>flares.</b> These exciter <b>beams</b> propagate outwards from the Sun along an open magnetic field line in the corona and in the interplanetary (IP) medium. We performed a statistical survey of 29 simple and isolated IP type III bursts observed by STEREO/Waves instruments between January 2013 and September 2014. We investigated their time-frequency profiles in order to derive the speed and acceleration of exciter electron beams. We show these beams noticeably decelerate in the IP medium. Obtained speeds range from ∼ 0. 02 c up to ∼ 0. 35 c depending on initial assumptions. It corresponds to electron energies between tens of eV and hundreds of keV, {{and in order to}} explain the characteristic energies or speeds of type III electrons (∼ 0. 1 c) observed simultaneously with Langmuir waves at 1 au, the emission of type III bursts near the peak should be predominately at double plasma frequency.

This results in an enhanced opacity near the Ni i line and an upward shift of its formation height, as well as an increased line source function. We find that the Ni i line may appear in emission {{in the presence of a}} fairly strong electron beam and preferentially in a cool atmosphere (i. e., sunspot umbrae/penumbrae). On the other hand, if there is no bombarding electron beam, the profile can hardly turn to emission even though the atmosphere may be heated to higher temperatures through other ways. This result implies that the sign reversal of the longitudinal magnetic field observed in some flare events may not be a true reversal but just an artifact associated with the production of an emission profile...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{impulsive}} {{phase of}} solar flares {{is a time}} of rapid energy deposition and heating in the lower solar atmosphere, leading to changes in the temperature, density, ionisation and velocity structure of this region. Aims: We aim to study the lower atmosphere during the impulsive phase of a flare using imaging and spectroscopic data from Hinode/EIS, RHESSI and TRACE. We place these observations in context by using a wide range of temperature observations from each instrument. Methods: We analyse sparse raster data from the Hinode/EIS spectrometer to derive the density and line-of-sight velocity in flare footpoints, in a GOES C 6. 6 flare observed on 05 -June- 2007. The raster duration was 150 s across the centre of a small active region, allowing multiple exposures of the flare ribbons and footpoints. Using RHESSI and Hinode/XRT we test both non-thermal and thermal models for the HXR emission. Results: During the flare impulsive phase, we find evidence from XRT for flare footpoints at temperatures exceeding 7 MK. We measure the electron number density increasing up to a few × 10 ¹⁰ cm⁻³ in the footpoints, at temperatures of 1 ̃. 5 - 2 MK, accompanied by small downflows at temperatures below Fe XIII and upflows of up to 1 ̃ 40 km s⁻¹ at temperatures above. This is reasonable in the context of HXR diagnostics of the <b>flare</b> electron <b>beam.</b> The electrons inferred have sufficient energy to affect the chromospheric ionisation structure. Conclusions: EIS sparse raster data coupled with RHESSI imaging and spectroscopy prove useful here in studying the lower atmosphere of solar flares, and in this event suggest heat deposition relatively high in the chromosphere drives chromospheric evaporation while increasing the observed electron densities at footpoints. However, from RHESSI spectral fitting {{it is not possible to}} say whether the data are more consistent with a model including a non-thermal beam, or purely thermal model...|$|R

The rate at which plasma waves are induced by an unstable electron beam is reduced by background density fluctuations, most acutely when fluctuations have large amplitudes or small wavelengths.

Assuming a 5 / 3 Kolmogorov-type power density spectrum of fluctuations often observed near the Earth, we investigate the corresponding energy spectrum of the electron beam after it has propagated 1 AU.

We find a direct correlation between the spectra of the double power-law below the break energy and the turbulent intensity of the background plasma. Solar flares are believed to accelerate both upward and downward propagating electron beams which can radiate emission at radio and X-ray wavelengths correspondingly.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the near-ultraviolet and optical {{continuum}} radiation in flares is critical for understanding particle acceleration and impulsive heating in stellar atmospheres. Radiative-hydrodynamic simulations in 1 D have shown that high energy deposition rates from electron <b>beams</b> produce two <b>flaring</b> layers at T~ 10 ^ 4 K that develop in the chromosphere: a cooling condensation (downflowing compression) and heated non-moving (stationary) flare layers just below the condensation. These atmospheres reproduce several observed phenomena in flare spectra, such as the red wing asymmetry of the emission lines in solar flares and a small Balmer jump ratio in M dwarf <b>flares.</b> The high <b>beam</b> flux simulations are computationally expensive in 1 D, and the (human) timescales for completing NLTE models with adaptive grids in 3 D will likely be unwieldy for a time to come. We have developed a prescription for predicting the approximate evolved states, continuum optical depth, and the emergent continuum flux spectra of radiative-hydrodynamic model flare atmospheres. These approximate prescriptions are based on an important atmospheric parameter: the column mass (m_ref) at which hydrogen becomes nearly completely ionized at the depths that are approximately in steady state with the electron beam heating. Using this new modeling approach, we find that high energy flux density (>F 11) electron beams are needed to reproduce the brightest observed continuum intensity in IRIS data of the 2014 -Mar- 29 X 1 solar flare and that variation in m_ref from 0. 001 to 0. 02 g/cm 2 reproduces most of the observed range of the optical continuum flux ratios at the peaks of M dwarf flares.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} study of fast electron beams attracts {{a lot of attention}} in the astrophysics and laboratory. In the case of solar flares the problem of reliable beam detection and diagnostics is of exceptional importance. This paper explores the fact that the electron beams moving oblique to the magnetic field or along the field with some angular scatter around the beam propagation direction can generate microwave continuum bursts via gyrosynchrotron mechanism. The characteristics of the microwave bursts produced by beams differ from those in case of isotropic or loss-cone distributions, which suggests a new tool for quantitative diagnostics of the beams in the solar corona. To demonstrate the potentiality of this tool, we analyze here a radio burst occurred during an impulsive flare 1 B/M 6. 7 on 10 March 2001 (AR 9368, N 27 W 42). Based on detailed analysis of the spectral, temporal, and spatial relationships, we obtained firm evidence that the microwave continuum burst is produced by electron beams. For the first time we developed and applied a new forward fitting algorithm based on exact gyrosynchrotron formulae and employing both the total power and polarization measurements to solve the inverse problem of the beam diagnostics. We found that the burst is generated by a oblique beam in a region of reasonably strong magnetic field (∼ 200 - 300 G) and the burst is observed at a quasi-transverse viewing angle. We found that the life time of the emitting electrons in the radio source is relatively short, τ_l ≈ 0. 5 s, consistent with a single reflection of the electrons from a magnetic mirror at the foot point with the stronger magnetic field. We discuss the implications of these findings for the electron acceleration in <b>flares</b> and for <b>beam</b> diagnostics. Comment: Astrophysical Journal, accepted: 26 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

We show that {{all kinds of}} stellar or neutron star flares would be too weak for the observed energy input at Earth in AD 774 / 5. Even though Maehara et al. (2012) present two super-flares with 10 e 35 erg of presumably solar-type stars, {{we would like to}} caution: These two stars are poorly studied and may well be close binaries, and/or having a M-type dwarf companion, and/or may be much younger and/or much more magnetic than the Sun - in any such case, they might not be true solar analog stars. From the frequency of large stellar flares averaged over all stellar activity phases (maybe obtained only during grand activity maxima), one can derive (a limit of) the probability for a large solar flare at a random time of normal activity: We find the probability for one flare within 3000 years to be possibly as low as 0. 3 to 0. 008 considering the full 1 sigma error range. Given the energy estimate in Miyake et al. (2012) for the AD 774 / 5 event, it would need to be ∼ 2000 stronger than the Carrington event as solar super-flare.

We also find that whilst on average type III bursts increase in flux with decreasing frequency, the rate of this increase varies from event to event...|$|R

The report of this action, is submitted herewith in accordance with references (c) and (d). All times given are local, minus eleven zone time.2) In accordance with reference (a) and (b) Task Group 38.4 (Captain Rodger F. Simpson, U.S.N., Commander Destroyer Squadron TWELVE) composed of the U.S.S. FARENHOLT (CDS-12), U.S.S. BUCHANAN, U.S.S. LANSDOWNE (CDD-24), and U.S.S. LARDNER was directed to proceed from vicinity of Hathorn Sound, British Solomon Islands on the 17th of February 1944 in time to pass through a point 15 miles due west of Lat. 6°-28' Long. 154°-26' (Point Scrappy) at 1600, proceed at high speed to a point Lat. 5°-00' Long. 152°-42' (Point Rodger) to arrive at 2100, then up through St. George's Channel, around the west of Duke of York Island, pass into Blanche Bay, out south of Duke of York Island, down St. George's Channel to Point Rodger by 0330, then retire to Hathorn Sound. The principal assumption was that harassing the enemy would disrupt any of his aggressive plans and generally hasten his evacuation of that area. The U.S.S. WOODWORTH, at Purvis Bay {{in the early morning}} of 17 February, requested and obtained permission to rejoin the Squadron, which she did at about 1930, 17 February 1944.3) Intelligence reports indicated that the most probable points of enemy concentrations as first, the township of Rabaul, second, encampment area between Kokopo and Ulaved, north coast of Gazelle Peninsula, and third, shipping at anchor in Karavia Bay. Shore batteries were indicated at Praed Point, Raluana Point and Cape Gazelle. There was no information on probable mine fields except at the entrance to Simpson-Karavia Harbors. Intelligence could not furnish any navigational information in addition to that contained in H.O. chart 2970, edition of 1925. Information on probable size and location of shore batteries and radar detection units was obtained prior to the bombardment, but it is estimated, from the volume of fire delivered by the shore batteries, that they are actually of larger caliber and more numerous than reported.4) The state of the weather was definitely overcast enough for concealment of own forces. During the approach up St. George's Channel and until prior to commencing Phase I, surface visibility to approximately six miles, with a very low overcast. Sea calm; wind WNW, force 2. Moonrise was at 0050 the 18th of February 1944.Part 21) The approach was made with divisions in line of bearing, and was uneventful up to St. George's Channel (course 315° (T), speed 30 knots). At 2129 course was changed to 350° (T) at a point 5 miles north of Lat. 5°-00' S. Long. 152°-42' E. (Point Rodger). At 2207 course was changed to 345° (T). The intention was to stay about 5 miles {{to the west of the}} New Ireland coast. At 2230 course was changed to 005° (T). At 2240 the Squadron was brought into column. At 2304 changed course to 355° (T). Lights were sighted near Duke of York Island. They were identified as lighted sono buoy. At 2309 changed course to 315° (T). At 2345 course was changed to 270° (T) for anti-shipping sweep. The sweep proved negative. At 0017 course was changed to 120° (T) to return to the area of the Duke of York Islands. At 0046 course was changed to 160° (T) until leading ship reached Point Rooster (Lat. 4°-00' S. Long. 152°-21' E.) then at 0054 course was changed to 240° (T), ships in line of bearing 160° (T). Commenced making black (funnel) smoke on the approach. At 0104 Squadron was brought into column on course 160° (T) and speed was slowed to 20 knots. Several flashing sono buoys were observed around the approach to Karavia Bay. This ship was directed to fire counter battery. Opened fire on Praed Point shore batteries at 0107. At 0115 shifted counter battery fire to Raluana point to silence the shore battery there, the shore battery on Praed Point having been silenced with 141 rounds of ammunition. At 0116 changed course to 225° (T). At 0117 changed to 235° (T) and CIC commenced torpedo problem. At 0122 unmasked the starboard torpedo battery on course 180° (T). Checked gun fire at Raluana Point to fire torpedoes. Raluana Point battery silenced after this ship fired 56 rounds of ammunition at this battery. Heavy gunfire was observed inside Simpson Harbor-Karavia Bay, which was taken under fire by U.S.S. WOODWORTH and U.S.S. BUCHANAN on order of Commander Destroyer Squadron Twelve. It was determined later that this gunfire was from two enemy destroyers inside the bay. At 0124 fired low speed torpedoes on course 262° (T) into Karavia Bay, range 12,200 yards. The torpedoes were fired with a track to take them through the center of the mine field across the entrance to Karavia Bay (assumed to be the channel through the field) and directed to the spot reported as the most frequented anchorages inside Karavia Bay. At 0124 turned to 090° (T) to commence phase III shore bombardment. As the course was changed to the left, a salvo of what appeared to be 3" [...] or larger landed about 50 yards off the starboard bow. At the same time several torpedo tracks were observed running down the starboard side at a distance of about 50 yards. Opened fore at 0126 to the south into Vunapopo bivouac and supply area, range 7660 yards. At 0132 changed to 100° (T) to clear Credner Island. At 0134 changed course to 120° (T). At 0136 came to 090° (T). At 1136 our observation plane dropped a stick of bombs on Cape Gazelle shore batteries. At 0137 ceased firing Vunapopo area, having expended 244 rounds of ammunition, to shift to Cape Gazelle shore battery which at that time opened fire on the formation. Commenced laying FS smoke in addition to black smoke. At 0140 opened fire on Cape Gazelle shore batteries. At this time a salvo of heavy caliber was heard to pass overhead and succeeding salvos continued to go over intermittently until the shore battery was finally silenced. At 0145 changed course to 070° (T) in order to pass through the 200 fathom spot at the center of channel between Duke of York Island and Cape Gazelle, this force having previously been directed to stay in water of depth over 200 fathoms. At 0150 changed course to 090° (T). Salvos were observed to be landing in the water off Cape Gazelle from the fire of ships astern. Firing only with the after 5" [...] guns at 0152. At 0155, Cape Gazelle, approximately abeam to starboard, changed course to 120° (T), increased speed to 25 knots. At 0159 ceased firing, having expended 284 rounds of ammunition on the Cape Gazelle shore batteries. At 0200 a fire was reported on the fantail. The bloomer on the #4 gun had caught fire but was quickly extinguished. At 0200 increased speed to 30 knots. At 0202 ceased smoking on order from the Squadron Commander. Changed course to 165° (T). At 0205 a hang-fire was reported on gun #1. Gun #1 unloaded through the muzzle at 0210. At 0230 first unidentified plane reported. Until 0515, “bogies” were reported at intervals, singly and in groups (about four) (one dropped <b>flares</b> on starboard <b>beam</b> at about 0310). One “bogie” approached as close as 3 miles. Due to heavy overcast and rain squalls, the Squadron Commander felt reluctant to allow the ship to open fire and reveal our presence. At 0335 changed course to 135° (T) having cleared St. George's Channel." ...|$|R
