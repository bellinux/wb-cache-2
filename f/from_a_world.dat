The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E
5|$|Most of Final Fantasy IV {{takes place}} on Earth, {{also known as the}} Blue Planet, which {{consists}} of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

In their opening match in Nantes on 9 September the Canadians lost 42–17 to Wales. They followed this with a 29–16 loss to Fiji, whom they had needed to beat to have realistic hopes of progressing to the Quarter Finals. They drew 12–12 with Japan in Bordeaux, conceding an injury-time try by Koji Taira. In their final game they lost 37–6 to an Australian side consisting mostly of second-string players.

25|$|The {{club has}} been {{featured}} in several documentary and semi-documentary films such as Guadalajara 70, Uma história de futebol, Dogão calabresa, and Boleiros. Former players have also been published, most notably Pelé, but others have appeared in films such as Ginga. Santos was the featured club in the film Asa Branca:Um Sonho Brasileiro, {{a story of a}} modest but talented soccer player for Santos and reaches stardom. Pelé appeared, alongside other footballers of the 1960s and 1970s, with Michael Caine, and Sylvester Stallone, in the 1981 film Escape to Victory, about an attempted escape <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>World</b> War II German POW Camp. The club has become a symbol of Joga Bonito (English: The Beautiful Game) in football culture. This was largely thanks to the Peixe's golden generation of the 1960s, the Santasticos, considered by some the best club team of all times.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{an article}} in The Sunday Times claimed that a diary, film and {{photographic}} evidence proving {{the existence of the}} Angels of Mons <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>World</b> War I soldier named William Doidge had been found. The article discussed a long involved story in which Doidge was involved with an American GI and an angel seen years later in Woodchester Mansion. It was claimed Marlon Brando and Tony Kaye were going to spend £350,000 to buy the evidence to make a film. Other papers like Variety and the Los Angeles Times and television programmes soon followed up the story and a website connected to the mystery became very popular. The footage was supposedly found in a trunk in an antique shop by Danny Sullivan in Monmouth, close to Machen's birthplace of Caerleon. In 2002, in a BBC Radio documentary; The Making of an Urban Myth, Sullivan admitted the story was a complete hoax to drum up interest in Woodchester Mansion; the footage and soldier never existed.|$|E
