25|$|During {{the second}} era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the Britannica was {{managed by the}} Edinburgh {{publishing}} firm A & C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the Britannica's reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A <b>general</b> <b>index</b> of all articles was included {{for the first time}} in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.|$|E
25|$|This 15th edition had no <b>general</b> <b>index,</b> {{which had}} been {{a feature of the}} Britannica since its 7th edition; even in the 2nd edition, {{individual}} long articles had their own indices. The idea of Mortimer J. Adler was that the Propædia and the Micropædia could serve the role of an index. More generally, Dr. Adler felt that the Britannica should not merely serve as a reference work, but also aspire to be a categorization of omne scibile (everything knowable), to fulfill Francis Bacon's grand conception of epistemology. Thus, the Propædia was intended to be the road-map of all knowledge, within which every fact, technique, and theory could be organized.|$|E

25|$|The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) <b>general</b> <b>index,</b> {{which reached}} {{a peak of}} 10,000 points briefly in April 2007, fell to 1,987 points—a 14-year low—on 24 February 2009 (the last time it was under 2,000 being mid-1995). In September 2008, the Irish government—a Fianna Fáil-Green coalition—officially {{acknowledged}} the country's descent into recession; a massive jump in unemployment occurred in the following months. Ireland was the first state in the eurozone to enter recession, as declared by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). By January 2009, {{the number of people}} living on unemployment benefits had risen to 326,000—the highest monthly level since records began in 1967—and the unemployment rate rose from 6.5% in July 2008 to 14.8% in July 2012. The slumping economy drew 100,000 demonstrators onto the streets of Dublin on 21 February 2009, amid further talk of protests and industrial action.|$|E
25|$|From 1994 through 1998, {{under the}} {{government}} of Alberto Fujimori, the economy recorded robust growth driven by foreign direct investment, almost 46% of which {{was related to the}} privatization program. The government invested heavily on the country's infrastructure, which became a solid foundation {{for the future of the}} Peruvian economy. The economy stagnated from 1998 through 2001, the result of the century's strongest El Niño weather phenomenon, global financial turmoil, political instability, a stalled privatization program, increased government intervention in markets, and worsening terms of trade. President Alejandro Toledo implemented a recovery program after taking office, maintained largely orthodox economic policies, and took measures to attract investment, including restarting the privatization program. Nonetheless, political uncertainty led to GDP growth of 0.2% in 2001. The Lima Stock Exchange <b>general</b> <b>index</b> fell 34.5% in 2000 and 0.2% in 2001. Inflation remained at record lows, registering 3.7% in 2000.|$|E
25|$|It was {{edited by}} Macvey Napier, who was {{assisted}} by James Browne, LLD. It consisted of 21 numbered volumes with 17,101 pages and 506 plates. It {{was the first}} edition to include a <b>general</b> <b>index</b> for all articles, a practice that was maintained until 1974. The index was 187 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered thin volume, or was bound together with volume I. Many illustrious contributors were recruited to this edition, including Sir David Brewster, Thomas de Quincey, Antonio Panizzi and Robert Stephenson. James Wilson did all of Zoology, Dr. Hampden did all of Greek philosophy, and William Hosking contributed the excellent article Architecture. Thomas Thomson, who wrote Chemistry for the 3rd edition supplement 40 years earlier, was recruited to write that article again for the 7th edition. Mathematical diagrams and illustrations were made from woodcuts, {{and for the first}} time in Britannica's history, were printed on the same pages as the text, in addition to the copperplates.|$|E

30|$|Let G be a {{connected}} graph. The {{degree of}} a vertex x of G, denoted by d_G(x), {{is the number}} of edges adjacent to x. The <b>general</b> sum-connectivity <b>index</b> is the sum of the weights (d_G(x)+d_G(y))^α for all edges xy of G, where α is a real number. The <b>general</b> Randić <b>index</b> is the sum of weights of (d_G(x)d_G(y))^α for all edges xy of G, where α is a real number. The graph G is a cactus if each block of G is either a cycle or an edge. In this paper, we find sharp lower bounds on the <b>general</b> sum-connectivity <b>index</b> and <b>general</b> Randić <b>index</b> of cacti.|$|R
