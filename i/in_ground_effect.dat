5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude <b>in</b> <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E
25|$|The XV-1 began {{tethered}} hovering {{flight tests}} on 11 February 1954, with test pilot John R. Noll. The tether was lead weights {{intended to keep}} the aircraft <b>in</b> <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> until issues with the rotor's tip-jet propulsion system were solved. On 14 July 1954, the lead weights were removed and the XV-1 conducted its first free hovering flight. As flight testing continued, McDonnell completed the second machine (s/n 53-4017).|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to fly the}} Cygnet II at Baddeck, Nova Scotia between 22 and 24 February 1909, {{met with}} failure. When the AEA Silver Dart was ready for flight testing, the engine {{was removed from the}} Cygnet II, and then returned. Rebuilt again as the Cygnet III with a more {{powerful}} 70hp Gnome Gamma engine, its final flight was on 19 March 1912, at Bras d'Or Lake, Nova Scotia, piloted by John McCurdy. The results were highly unsatisfactory with the Cygnet III only able to lift off the ground for a foot or two, typically considered remaining <b>in</b> <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> After a final trial on 17 March, the tetrahedral cell bank failed structurally, leaving the aircraft irreparably damaged. The Cygnet II and III were abandoned following this flight attempt.|$|E

25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings <b>in</b> <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E
