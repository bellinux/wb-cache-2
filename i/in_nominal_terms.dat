25|$|As a {{response}} to the 2001 economic crisis, electricity tariffs were converted to the Argentine peso and frozen in January 2002 through the Public Emergency and Exchange Regime Law. Together with high inflation (see Economy of Argentina) and the devaluation of the peso, many companies in the sector had to deal with high levels of debt in foreign currency under a scenario in which their revenues remained stable while their costs increased. This situation has led to severe underinvestment and unavailability to keep up with an increasing demand, factors that contributed to the 2003-2004 energy crisis. Since 2003, the government has been in the process of introducing modifications that allow for tariff increases. Industrial and commercial consumers' tariffs have already been raised (near 100% <b>in</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>terms</b> and 50% in real terms), but residential tariffs still remain the same.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} a novel, fiscal hedging motive {{that helps to}} explain why governments issue more expensive, long-term debt. We analyze optimal fiscal policy in an economy with distortionary labor income taxes, nominal rigidities and nominal debt of various maturities. The government in our model can smooth labor tax rates by changing the real return it pays on its outstanding liabilities. These changes require state contingent inflation or adjustments <b>in</b> the <b>nominal</b> <b>term</b> structure. <b>In</b> the presence of nominal pricing rigidities and a cash in advance constraint, these changes are themselves distortionary. We show that long <b>term</b> <b>nominal</b> debt can help a government hedge fiscal shocks by spreading out and delaying the distortions associated with increases <b>in</b> <b>nominal</b> interest rates over the maturity of the outstanding long-term debt. After a positive spending shock, the government raises the yield curve and steepens it. ...|$|R

Since the exit from the ERM this has fallen to 70 basis points, showing greater policy credibility.
