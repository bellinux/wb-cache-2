40|$|Plastic intake by marine {{vertebrates}} {{has been}} widely reported, but information about its presence in continental waterfowl is scarce. Here we analyzed faeces of waterbirds species (<b>European</b> <b>coot,</b> Fulica atra, mallard, Anas platyrhynchos and shelduck, Tadorna tadorna) for plastic debris in five wetlands in Central Spain. We collected 89 faeces of shelduck distributed in four lakes, 43. 8 % of them presented plastic remnants. Sixty percent of 10 faeces of <b>European</b> <b>coot</b> and 45 % of 40 faeces of mallard contained plastic debris. Plastic debris found was of two types, threads and fragments, and were identified as remnants of plastic objects used in agricultural fields surrounding the lakes. Differences in prevalence of plastic in faeces, number of plastic pieces per excrement {{and size of the}} plastic pieces were not statistically significant between waterfowl species. Thus, our results suggest that plastic may also be frequently ingested by waterfowl in continental waters, at least in our study area. Future studies should address this potential problem for waterbird conservation in other wetlands to evaluate the real impact of this pollutant on waterbirds living in inland water. This work was performed within the framework of Project ECOLAKE 00 Ecological patterns in endorheic lakes: the keys to their conservation, CGL 2012 - 3890900, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and by the European Union through the European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER) “One way to make Europe”...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} experimentally {{the seasonal}} role of food supply in brood {{survival of the}} <b>European</b> <b>coot</b> Fulica atra. For two breeding seasons, individual pairs were offered supplemental food the first ten days after their young hatched. Under natural conditions this period was {{largely responsible for the}} seasonal variation in brood survival. Our experiment tested three hypotheses: (1) food supply is not involved in breeding success at any date (other factors hypothesis), (2) food supply limits success independently of date (elevation hypothesis), and (3) food supply affects success seasonally and is responsible for the natural seasonal trend in success (date hypothesis). Experimental pairs with supplemental food raised heavier, larger and more chicks than control pairs. Consistent with the date hypothesis, food supplementation abolished seasonal variation in chick survival. Chick growth under supplemental food was in agreement with the elevation hypothesis. This discrepancy was probably due to the limited supply of additional food. We conclude that seasonal variation in offspring production was in essence the result of seasonal variation in food availability.

40|$|Chick {{survival}} in the <b>European</b> <b>Coot</b> typically shows a convex seasonal pattern. Previous experiments revealed that this pattern is directly linked to hatching date and that food supply within the first ten days after hatching is a causal factor in this relationship. However, the precise mechanism through which food affects survival seasonally under natural conditions remained so far unclear. The present study therefore investigates the natural seasonal variation in food abundance during brood care, and compares this variation in food supply with the seasonal variation in chick survival for different years. Annual and seasonal variation in chick survival was explained by Variation in the insect biomass delivered to the brood within the first ten days after hatching. The variation in insect supply to the chicks was not {{due to differences in}} the time spent by early and late pairs in feeding young, but directly related to seasonal variation in the insect biomass available. Seasonal variation in insect abundance was thereby identified as the critical factor in the causal relationship between hatching date, food supply and chick survival.

40|$|Life-history theory {{suggests}} that the variation in the seasonal timing of reproduction within populations may be explained {{on the basis of}} individual optimization. Optimal breeding times would vary between individuals as a result of trade-offs between fitness components. The existence of such trade-offs has seldom been tested empirically. We experimentally investigated the consequences of altered timing of current reproduction for future reproductive output in the <b>European</b> <b>coot</b> (Fulica atra). First clutches of different laying date were cross-fostered between nests, and parents thereby experienced a delay or an advance in the hatching date. The probability and success of a second brood, adult survival until and reproduction in the next season were then compared to the natural variation among control pairs. Among control pairs the probability of a second brood declined with the progress of season. Delayed pairs were less likely and advanced pairs were more likely to produce a second brood. These changes were quantitatively as predicted from the natural seasonal decline. The number of eggs in the second clutch was positively related to egg number in the first clutch and negatively related to laying date. Compared to the natural variation, delayed females had more and advanced females had fewer eggs in their second clutch. The size of the second brood declined with season, but there was no significant effect of delay or advance. Local adult survival was higher following a delay and reduced following an advance. The effect of the experiment on adult survival was independent of sex. Laying date and clutch size of females breeding in the next year were not affected by treatment. The study demonstrates the existence of a trade-off between increased probability of a second brood and decreased parental survival for early breeding. Timing-dependent effects of current reproduction on future reproductive output may thus {{play an important role in}} the evolution of the seasonal timing of reproduction. ...|$|E
