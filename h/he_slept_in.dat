5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{then had}} stints working for KDNT in Denton, Texas, KCUL and KCNC in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted The Western Express, taught Sunday school {{and he played}} in nightclubs. He then {{decided to move to}} San Diego. He was unable to find a job, and decided to go to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived. Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody picked him up, <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a ditch. He then found a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver then drove Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>slept</b> soundly <b>in</b> the {{cupboard}} bed {{and made an}} excuse for staying at the farm next day, but as he stood outside {{the house in the}} afternoon his host came up.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> {{the woods}} where night overtook him, {{and at the}} first faint light of day was making a frugal breakfast of the bread and cheese sent by his mother.|$|R
25|$|He had a {{dysfunctional}} {{relationship with his}} mother; <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> her bed until he was a teenager, and resented her multiple short-term boyfriends. He married his high school girlfriend in 1974, {{with whom he had}} two children before she filed for divorce in 1980.|$|E
25|$|He {{had a great}} {{appreciation}} of sacred music and was a great reader of works about art, but he detested physical activity. He appeared to have suffered periodic crises of depression. An aversion to changes in his routine extended to his clothing: he wore the same coat until it tore, forcing his chamberlains to sew it on his body while <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> it. He suffered from panic attacks when he heard thunder, staying in his rooms with the windows shut and receiving no one.|$|E
25|$|Before Thirumalai Nayaka came to power, {{the court}} of Madurai was being held at Trichy for some ten to twelve years. Thirumalai Nayaka would have {{continued}} to rule from Trichy but for a dream. Thirumalai was suffering from Catarrah which the royal physicians were unable to cure. While he was once marching towards Madurai, Thirumalai's sickness worsened and he halted near Dindigul. When <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> his tent, God Sundareshwara and Goddess Meenakshi appeared {{to him in a}} dream, and mentioned that they would cure him if he would make Madurai his capital.|$|E
60|$|She {{interrupted}} him, without ceremony. The places <b>he</b> had <b>slept</b> <b>in,</b> at sea, were of no earthly importance. The {{one question}} to consider, {{was the place}} he was to sleep in that night.|$|R
60|$|She did not reply, {{and they}} stood looking musingly at Clym as <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> on <b>in</b> that {{profound}} sleep {{which is the}} result of physical labour carried on in circumstances that wake no nervous fear.|$|R
50|$|According to {{evidence}} put before the jury, the trigger-point for the violence came when Causer's attackers found sexually explicit images {{of him on}} his mobile phone as <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> upstairs <b>in</b> a house where a party had been held. This prompted a sustained and brutal attack as <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> leaving him with a fractured skull and a swollen brain.|$|R
25|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Leigh Fermor {{decided to}} walk the length of Europe, from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (Istanbul). He set off on 8 December 1933, {{less than a year}} after Hitler had come to power in Germany, with a few clothes, several letters of introduction, the Oxford Book of English Verse and a Loeb volume of Horace's Odes. <b>He</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> barns and shepherds' huts, but also was invited by landed gentry and {{aristocracy}} into the country houses of Central Europe. He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way. Two of his later travel books, A Time of Gifts (1977) and Between the Woods and the Water (1986), were about this journey. A book on the final part of his journey was unfinished at the time of Leigh Fermor's death, but was published as The Broken Road: Travels from Bulgaria to Mount Athos in September 2013 by John Murray. The book draws on Leigh Fermor's diary at the time and on an early draft he wrote in the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|Wark {{was born}} on 4 August 1957, in Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother Alex and younger brother Andrew. [...] The family lived in a four-storey {{tenement}} block in Partick. The family was impoverished: Wark's parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a drawer from a sideboard. [...] Although christened John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a diminutive that stuck throughout his footballing career.|$|E
500|$|Krueger's {{retirement}} was {{marred by}} family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman after a drunken incident. Grace's health deteriorated, and she suffered from heart disease and high blood pressure. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} in 1955, and died on 13 May 1956. Most dramatically, on 3 October 1952, a lonely and depressed Dorothy fatally stabbed her husband, Colonel Aubrey D. Smith, with a hunting knife while <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> their Army quarters in Japan. Dorothy, who felt that her husband now regarded her no more than [...] "a clinging handicap to his professional career", had turned to alcohol and drugs.|$|E

500|$|Hartman {{had been}} {{divorced}} twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987; {{the couple had}} two children together. However, their marriage was fractured, {{due in part to}} her drug use. On May 28, 1998, Brynn Hartman shot and killed Hartman while <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> their Encino, Los Angeles home, then committed suicide several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper [...] a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with". Hartman was posthumously inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2012 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.|$|E
500|$|On May 28, 1998, Phil Hartman, voice actor of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz, {{was shot}} and killed by his wife while <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> their Encino, Los Angeles, home. His wife, Brynn Omdahl, then {{committed}} suicide several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper...a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with". After Hartman's death in 1998, rather than replace him with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure and Hutz from the show. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode [...] "Bart the Mother", which was dedicated to Hartman.|$|E
500|$|Some biographers of James {{argue that}} the {{relationships}} were not sexual. James's Basilikon Doron lists sodomy among crimes [...] "ye are bound in conscience never to forgive", and James's wife Anne gave birth to seven live children, as well as suffering two stillbirths and {{at least three other}} miscarriages. Contemporary Huguenot poet Théophile de Viau observed that [...] "it is well known that the king of England / has union with the Duke of Buckingham". Buckingham himself provides evidence that <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> the same bed as the King, writing to James many years later that he had pondered [...] "whether you loved me now... better than at the time which I shall never forget at Farnham, where the bed's head could not be found between the master and his dog". Buckingham's words may be interpreted as non-sexual, in the context of seventeenth-century court life, and remain ambiguous.|$|E

500|$|Dong {{rented a}} small room in western Beijing above a store selling soy sauce. [...] Jiang intervened to give Dong time and space to create the painting; the artist needed three months to {{complete}} his work. [...] The room was smaller than the painting, which is four meters wide, and Dong would affix part of the canvas to the ceiling, working on his back. [...] To save commuting time, <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a chair. [...] He smoked cigarettes constantly as he worked. [...] His daughter brought meals, but he was often unable to eat. [...] Once the painting was under way, several of Dong's colleagues, including oil painter , came to visit. [...] They decided that the figure of Mao, the central one of the painting, was not tall enough. [...] Dong removed the figure of Mao from the canvas, and painted him again, increasing his height by just under an inch (2.54cm).|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{became the}} subject of {{increasingly}} sensational reports. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying in a glass box. Although the claim was untrue, according to tabloid reports that are widely cited, Jackson disseminated the fabricated story himself. When Jackson bought a chimpanzee named Bubbles from a laboratory, he was reported to be increasingly detached from reality. It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the [...] "Elephant Man") and, although untrue, Jackson did not deny the story. Although he initially saw these stories as opportunities for publicity, he stopped leaking untruths to the press as they became more sensational. Consequently, the media began fabricating stories. These reports became embedded in the public consciousness, inspiring the nickname [...] "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson came to despise. Responding to the gossip, Jackson remarked to Taraborrelli: ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 January 1915, {{the ship}} became iced in. Within a few days, it was {{apparent}} that the Endurance was held fast and was likely to remain so for the upcoming winter. [...] Trapped, the ship slowly drifted westwards with the ice, and the expedition settled in for the winter. The original plan had been to leave a shore party on the Antarctic mainland while Worsley took the Endurance northwards. There had been no expectation that the entire expedition would live aboard the ship in the long term. [...] Worsley relished the challenge; <b>he</b> <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> the passageway rather than the cabins, and even in the depths of winter, would shock the rest of those aboard the ship by taking snow baths on the ice. With little to do since the Endurance became trapped, he occupied himself taking soundings of the ocean and collecting specimens. He later wrote a report entitled Biological, Soundings and Magnetic Record, Weddell Sea, 1914–1916.|$|E
6000|$|They {{turned the}} handle gently, {{and found that}} the door opened without an effort. Both men looked at one another in the dim light incredulously.

60|$|By night <b>he</b> had <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> trees.

But at last he had come {{within sight of the}} palisade behind which were his fierce companions.|$|R
60|$|The {{ornaments}} were, however, removed {{sooner than}} anyone had anticipated. The next trip that the captain made was for his hammock (<b>he</b> always <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> one), which was a long unwieldy bundle, like a gigantic bolster. He carried it into the parlour on his shoulder, and Minnie followed him.|$|R
500|$|According to {{the origin}} story of The Urantia Book, {{sometime}} between 1906 and 1911, a woman consulted Sadler about her husband's deep sleeping, prompting Sadler to observe {{him while he}} slept. He noticed that the sleeping man made unusual movements; the man then purportedly spoke to Sadler in an unusual voice and {{claimed to be a}} [...] "visitor ... from another planet". Observers related that the man later claimed to carry messages from several celestial beings. Sadler suspected that the man's words were drawn from his mind and sought a scientific explanation for the phenomenon. Although he examined the man for psychiatric problems, he was unable to make a satisfactory diagnosis. Sadler and five others subsequently visited the man on a regular basis, speaking with him as <b>he</b> <b>slept.</b> <b>In</b> 1925, a large handwritten document was discovered in the patient's house; papers were said to appear in the house for years afterwards. Sadler brought the papers to his house and did not allow anyone to take them away, although some were allowed to read them on site. Sadler presumed that the documents were the product of automatic handwriting from the man's subconscious, but changed his mind after further analysis. He made no public statements about their authenticity for years.|$|E
