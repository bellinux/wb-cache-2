500|$|The song {{opens with}} a single crash cymbal {{followed}} by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound of}} thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. He is saying he will always wait for her, but he does not think that she should stay where she is any longer. The lyrics emphasize: [...] "But I wait for you/if you <b>go,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you." [...] The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship {{in a state of}} tension and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's really about the ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where it can go, you gotta let it <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are not going to commit." [...] He viewed that his falsetto vocals and the song's tone give the song a sexual feel with music that works as a [...] "double entendre".|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was}} going to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs' club?"' ...|$|E

2500|$|Clough's time at Forest {{saw him at}} {{odds with}} Justin Fashanu, whose goals and then {{confidence}} dried up as he failed {{to fit in with}} Clough's playing and lifestyle demands after signing for them in 1981. When Clough learned of Fashanu's homosexuality (which was not made public until 1990), he barred Fashanu from training with the side. In his autobiography, Clough recounted a dressing down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going to}} gay bars. [...] "'Where do you <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs' club?'" [...] It was also in this book that he admitted his one regret was leaving Derby County.|$|E
2500|$|Justin Fashanu, {{the first}} black £1 million footballer, was the first footballer to be openly gay. In his autobiography, Brian Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going}} to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs' club?"' Fashanu committed suicide in 1998 after he was questioned by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault, and it has been suggested that the tragedy and hostility that struck his life after publicly coming out persuaded other gay footballers that coming out would not be a good idea. The coroner said the prejudices he experienced, plus the sexual assault charge he was facing at the time of his death, probably overwhelmed him.|$|E

[...] "It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to <b>go</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Ruth the Moabitess": In {{modern style}} one would not, in referring, {{at this stage}} of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree {{necessary}} or advantageous to repeat the designation [...] "the Moabitess." [...] The repetition is antique, and calls to mind the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - [...] "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." [...] She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see Leviticus 19:9; Leviticus 23:22: Deuteronomy 24:19). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather than to get. But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves in their little handmill or quern. She said, with beautiful courtesy. [...] "Let me go I, pray, thee;" [...] or, [...] "I wish to <b>go,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will please to allow me." [...] Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom.|$|E
