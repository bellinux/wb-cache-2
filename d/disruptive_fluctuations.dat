40|$|This article {{reflects}} on Canada's experience with inflation targeting in the 1990 s. The discussion {{opens with a}} synopsis {{of the evolution of}} inflation targets against a backdrop of other monetary policy approaches. The author then proceeds to outline the main advantages of explicit inflation targets - advantages that go beyond the well-known benefits of low inflation. Increased transparency and accountability, and an improvement in the Bank's internal decision making, are highlighted in particular. It is also argued that inflation targets provide a useful mechanism for dealing with demand and supply shocks in a way that reduces <b>disruptive</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> The major criticisms of targeting low rates of inflation (related to wage rigidity, a zero floor on nominal interest rates, and concerns about deflation) are also examined. Although it is too early for definitive conclusions, the author's view is that inflation targets lead to better policy decisions, better economic performance over time, and greater accountability for autonomous central banks. ...|$|E

In contrast, bulk metals {{are characterized by}} delocalized bonds, where {{a large number of}} resonance structures ensure their high stability. However, reduced to atomic dimensions, metallic arrangements become increasingly vulnerable to <b>disruptive</b> entropic <b>fluctuations.</b> Using the smallest possible device, namely, a single atom held between two atomically sharp probes, force to rupture single-atom bridges was measured with pico-level resolution, using gold and silver. Remarkably, measured forces are found to be a precise vector sum (directional bonding) of cohesive forces between the central and adjacently coordinated atoms. Over three to four times stronger than bulk, the directional bonds provide high configurational stability to atomic-sized metallic devices, just as delocalization-induced resonance stabilization is the emergent response of bulk metals. Results open new opportunity for molecular electronics without complications arising from metal/molecule interfaces...|$|R
