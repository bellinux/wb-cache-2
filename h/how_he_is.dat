5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

5|$|Parallels {{have been}} pointed out between Njörðr and the figure of Hadingus, attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' 13th century work Gesta Danorum. Some of these {{similarities}} include that, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál, Hadingus is chosen by his wife Regnhild after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs, and, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning, Hadingus complains in verse of his displeasure at his life away from the sea and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> disturbed by the howls of wolves, while his wife Regnhild complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds. Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis, before ending as an Odinic hero, paralleling Njörðr's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir-Vanir War.|$|E

25|$|Ovid's {{version of}} this story (Heroides 9) has Heracles under the erotic control of Iole. She {{specifically}} has Heracles wear women's clothing and perform women's work. Heracles at this time all the while is bragging about his heroic deeds. However, Deianira reminds him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> dressed in feminine attire and Iole is wearing his clothing while carrying his club. Deianira ultimately urges silence from him. The same version shows the disgrace and shame of Heracles, who was once a strong warrior fighter, outwitted by Iole in being made to do effeminate acts. In this skillful crafty manner, she had avenged her father's death.|$|E
25|$|Modern Hindu {{scholars}} {{assert that}} he made Akbar make bold decisions and the orthodox Muslims in the court despised him, since he made Akbar renounce Islam. But no evidence is present that he influenced Akbar's beliefs. Though sources suggest he influenced Akbar's policies to some extent. It was Akbar's affection for him, his religious tolerance and social liberalism which {{was the reason for}} this and Birbal was not the cause. Historically, he was more of a supporter of Akbar's religious policy and his religion, Din-i-Ilahi. Ain-i-Akbari mentions an incident involving prostitutes, where Akbar wanted to punish him, contrary to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as a deeply religious man.|$|E

He fabricates an entire story based on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> distressed for being responsible for killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes a statement saying {{that there should be a}} law banning tele-o-vision forever.

Then a storm causes a shipwreck and a survivor seeks refuge in Dan’s hut. As he comes in and out of consciousness, the man tells Dan the story of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a priest from Ireland come to help stop the “sweating sickness” which grips the island.

Maruyama admits that he is disappointed, but not infuriated as Paifu saved his life. The four are praised as they returned to the village. One month later, Paifu, Jose and everyone else from the village meet Maruyama out at sea with a ghost boat that all fixed up together.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Lullaby, Streator is the reader's only narrator. True to his {{journalist}} occupation, he is {{detailed in}} many of his descriptions of the events going on around him. At the same time, Streator tends to be philosophical and cynical about {{the world around him}} and the people he meets, probably because of the tragedies that have haunted him for many years. In regards to the actual sequence and happenings of events, he seems to be a reliable narrator. But often his philosophical asides seem to overshadow his duty as a balanced narrator. At times, it is frustrating not knowing the true motives of Helen, Mona, or Oyster and, by the end, it is apparent that Streator could not always be trusted. But the nature of the story insists that we only get one perspective; one man retelling the past that has resulted in the present. Streator himself knows the issues with <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> telling the story, but in his recognition of the potential problems of a first person perspective, he becomes a more reliable narrator.|$|E

25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

Owen called this moment the crystallization of the game's gray areas. Anthony Brock of Gamers Hell noted how it led to him passionately arguing with a game character, complimenting Obsidian for how involved he felt. Cobbett similarly highlighted the moment when praising the character. Buecheler, however, criticized the scene for using an unlikely chance event to make its point.|$|E
