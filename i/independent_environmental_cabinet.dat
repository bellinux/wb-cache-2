5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: In {{order to}} {{increase}} the theoretical understanding {{of the concept of}} accessibility, this paper reports the results from an exploration of methodological difficulties inherent in systematic accessibility assessments of single persons' travel chains in urban public bus transport. In addition, Special Transport Service (STS) travellers' perception of environmental demands in public transport are reported. METHODS: This study was designed to explore the environmental component in accessibility problems systematically. Twenty persons entitled to STS were recruited in order to travel by low-floor bus, Service Route Traffic (SRT) or STS. Two different methods were chosen. Critical incidents were collected during participant observation, and by means of a pilot instrument based on the Enabler Concept <b>independent</b> <b>environmental</b> assessments were performed. RESULTS: Not all environmental details registered during the participant observations were in agreement with the <b>independent</b> <b>environmental</b> assessment, and different reasons for the disagreements were reported. In addition, participants travelling by STS gave information about what hindered them from using conventional public transport. CONCLUSIONS: The theoretical understanding behind accessibility assessments has benefited from the methodological challenges mapped out in this study. In order to interpret accessibility, the individual perspective as well as the population perspective are necessary, which means that complementary methods are needed...|$|R
