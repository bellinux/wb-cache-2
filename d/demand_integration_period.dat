Technology enabling on <b>demand</b> <b>integration</b> of business partners handling peak load at short notice may help. We model a three-stage supply chain with a service provider receiving demand from its customers usually executed by an in-house unit. Alternatively the demand can be routed to external business partners if these offer capacity and a preferable execution. Then the capacity planning problem of the service provider is examined: In what way does this “on <b>demand</b> <b>integration</b> capability” affect the optimal level of in-house capacity? The model consists of two separate queuing systems (in-house unit and external business partners) along with their relevant cost functions. Furthermore a routing algorithm is developed. It evaluates both systems for every incoming order and decides about routing to the preferable one. To derive results a discrete-event simulation is necessary performed within {{a case study of}} the securities trading and settlement process. Three insights are gained: There are situations where on <b>demand</b> <b>integration</b> leads to reduced optimal capacity. Furthermore the risk of allocating an inappropriate amount of capacity can be reduced as well as the total operating costs of the business process...|$|R

In temperature integration, plants are supposed to compensate effects of temporarily deviations of the average temperature some time later by deviations in the opposite direction. However, little is still known on the effects of <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> exceeding 1 day. In this study, effects of temperature integration on growth and development of single-stemmed cut rose plants were determined. Pruned rose shoots were placed in climate chambers in which light levels switched daily (2 days <b>integration</b> <b>period)</b> or weekly (14 days <b>integration</b> <b>period)</b> from high light intensity (300 ¿mol m¿ 2 s¿ 1) to low light (150 ¿mol m¿ 2 s¿ 1). Temperatures were kept continuously at 20 °C (control) or changed with the light intensity (phase, high temperature at high light intensity, low temperature at low light intensity) or changed opposite to the light intensity (counter phase). Bandwidths of temperature integration were 0, 6 or 10 °C. Under these conditions, buds grew out to harvestable shoots in approximately 45 days. At both <b>integration</b> <b>periods,</b> shoot length was significantly reduced with increasing bandwidths of temperature integration. Shoot dry weights were reduced when a bandwidth of 10 °C was applied. At both <b>integration</b> <b>periods,</b> rates of photosynthesis were primarily determined by light intensity. However, in the counter phase treatments, photosynthesis rate at high light and low temperature was reduced compared to the high light condition of the control. Under these conditions, starch content increased to approximately 10 %, suggesting a feedback inhibition of the rate of photosynthesis. However, this did not (yet) affect plant growth or development...|$|R

40|$|Dutch {{horticulture}} aims at {{a reduction}} of the energy use in greenhouses by 65 % in 2010 compared to 1980. When temperature integration is applied, temperatures may be reduced, {{as long as they}} are compensated by higher temperatures within a pre-set time span. Applying temperature integration without adverse effects on plant growth requires knowledge about critical temperatures. In this study, effects of temperature integration with bandwidths of 0, 6 and 10 °C (average temperature of 20 °C) and <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> of 2 and 14 days on rose plants were investigated. Shoot lengths at the harvestable stage were reduced with increasing bandwidths. This reduction in shoot length became stronger as the <b>integration</b> <b>period</b> increased. The developmental rate of rose shoots to the harvestable stage was not affected by temperature integration. Shoot fresh weight decreased at a bandwidth of 10 °C, but not at a bandwidth of 6 °C. For the application of temperature integration in the practice of cut rose growing, shoot length development is the most critical process, since it partly determines the price of rose stems. If a certain reduction in stem length is acceptable to commercial rose growing, temperature integration with a bandwidth of 6 °C can be applied even at longer <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> without affecting the developmental rate and shoot weight...|$|R

Here, we investigate theoretical aspects of this issue {{in a search for}} the cause(s) of the need for re-parameterisations. Based on Taylor series expansion, we present a mathematical approach for temporal up-scaling that involves covariance-based corrections. We apply the theory using a unique database of half-hourly pan evaporation measurements (comprising 237 days) and examine how the model parameters change when integrating from half-hour to daily and then monthly <b>integration</b> <b>periods.</b> We show that the model parameters change over different <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> because of changes in the covariance between the model variables. In our model system, we find that the covariance-based correction is highly variable from day to day but settles down to a reasonably constant value over periods longer than about 15 days. The 15 days timescale is likely to be specific to our model system, nonetheless the underlying principle that there is a characteristic timescale for the covariance-based scaling correction of a particular hydrologic process might be general.
