40|$|IF : 5, 52 International audienceThe cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl(-) channel physiologically important in fluid-transporting epithelia and pathologically relevant in several human diseases. Here, {{we show that}} mutations in the C terminus of the first nucleotide binding domain comprising the latest beta strands (beta(c) 5 and beta(c) 6) influence the trafficking, channel activity, and pharmacology of CFTR. We mutated CFTR amino acids located in the beta(c) 5 -beta(c) 6 hairpin, within the beta(c) 5 strand (H 620 Q), within the beta-turn linking the two beta strands (<b>E</b> <b>621</b> G, G 622 D), as well as within (S 623 A, S 624 A) and at the extremity (G 628 R) of the beta(c) 6 strand. Functional analysis reveals that the current density was largely reduced for G 622 D and G 628 R channels compared with wt CFTR, similar for <b>E</b> <b>621</b> G and S 624 A, but increased for H 620 Q and S 623 A. For G 622 D and G 628 R, the abnormal activity is likely due to a defective maturation process, as assessed by the augmented activity and mature C-band observed {{in the presence of}} the trafficking corrector miglustat.

A checklist of EU labelling requirements was drawn up and nine labels of Döner kebab marketed in the province of Modena were collected to evaluate the mandatory information laid down in article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1169 / 2011 together with the mandatory requirements of Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 for meat preparations. The study showed that different additives are commonly used in Döner kebabs, including <b>E</b> <b>621</b> (monosodium glutamate). This additive is not included among the ingredients authorized for the meat preparation food category. Eight frozen Döner kebab samples were taken and a visual assessment and a histologic examination were performed to verify potential changes in the meat’s inner muscle fibre structure that could allow the product to be considered among meat preparations or meat products. The Döner kebab labels showed several systematically deficient regulatory requirements in both extrinsic defects (not related to food composition) and aspects concerning the protection of consumers’ health. Histological examination showed that the tissue was moderately swollen, but the muscle fibre structure was intact. Kebab can be reasonably classified as a meat preparation thereby precluding the use monosodium glutamate (<b>E</b> <b>621)</b> as an ingredient...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the establishment of}} a Staphylococcus aureus laboratory strain, 10 * 3 d 1, having reduced susceptibility to daptomycin and heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) phenotype. The strain was generated in vitro by serial daptomycin selection (Camargo, I. L., H. M. Neoh, L. Cui, and K. Hiramatsu, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 52 : 4289 - 4299, 2008). Here we explored the genetic mechanism of resistance in the strain by whole-genome sequencing and by producing gene-replaced strains. By genome comparison between 10 * 3 d 1 and its parent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain N 315 ΔIP, we identified five nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One of the five mutations was found in the rpoB gene encoding the RNA polymerase β subunit. The mutation at nucleotide position 1862 substituted the 621 st alanine by glutamic acid. The replacement of the intact rpoB with the mutated rpoB, designated rpoB(A <b>621</b> <b>E),</b> conferred N 315 ΔIP with the phenotypes of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin and hetero-VISA. The rpoB(A <b>621</b> <b>E)</b> -mediated resistance conversion was accompanied by a thickened cell wall and reduction of the cell surface negative charge. Being consistent with these phenotypic changes, microarray data showed that the expression of the dlt operon, which increases the cell surface positive charge, was enhanced in the rpoB(A <b>621</b> <b>E)</b> mutant. Other remarkable findings of microarray analysis of the rpoB(A <b>621</b> <b>E)</b> mutant included repression of metabolic pathways of purine, pyrimidine, arginine, the urea cycle, and the lac operon, enhancement of the biosynthetic pathway of vitamin B 2, K 1, and K 2, and cell wall metabolism.

The L-glutamic acid is produced by the genetically modified Corynebacterium glutamicum EA- 12 strain. The recipient strain Corynebacterium glutamicum  strain 2256  has been recommended for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) status. No antibiotic resistance genes were left in the genome and neither the production strain nor its recombinant DNA were detected in the final product. The Panel considered there were no safety concerns for consumers from the genetic modification. The proposed uses or use levels of L-glutamic acid and its salt derivatives produced with the current strain and the new genetically modified microorganism (GMM) strain will be identical and thus the Panel considered that the exposure to the food additive will remain unaffected. Provided that the L-glutamic acid and its salts both produced with the current strain and with the GMM strain are equal in the specifications and physicochemical characteristics, the biological and toxicological data for the L-glutamic acid and its salts produced with the current strain are considered by the Panel to support the safety of the food additives produced with the GMM strain.

40|$|John B ChristoforidisCollege of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USABackground: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the volume of the kinetic visual field with a single unit that accounts for visual field area and differential luminance sensitivity. Methods: Kinetic visual field perimetry was performed with a Goldmann perimeter using I 4 e, I 3 e, I 2 e, and I 1 e targets. The visual fields of 25 normal volunteers (17 women, eight men) of mean age 33. 9 &plusmn; 10. 1 (range 17 &ndash; 64) years were obtained and digitized. Isopter areas were measured with a method devised to correct cartographic distortion due to polar projection inherent in perimetry and are expressed in steradians. The third dimension of each isopter represents sensitivity to target luminance and was calculated as log (target luminance- 1). If luminance is expressed in cd/m 2, the values for the third dimension are 0. 5 for I 4 e, 1. 0 for I 3 e, 1. 5 for I 2 e, and 2. 0 for I 1 e. The resulting unit is a steradian (log 103 (cd/m 2) - 1 which is referred to as a Goldmann. In addition, the visual fields of four patients with representative visual defect patterns were examined and compared with normal subjects. Results: Mean isopter areas for normal subjects were 3. 092 &plusmn; 0. 242 steradians for I 4 e, 2. 349 &plusmn; 0. 280 steradians for I 3 e, 1. 242 &plusmn; 0. 263 steradians for I 2 e, and 0. 251 &plusmn; 0. 114 steradians for the I 1 e target. Isopter volumes were 1. 546 &plusmn; 0. 121 Goldmanns for the I 4 e target, 1. 174 &plusmn; 0. 140 Goldmanns for I 3 <b>e,</b> 0. <b>621</b> &plusmn; 0. 131 Goldmanns for I 2 e, and 0. 126 &plusmn; 0. 057 Goldmanns for I 1 e.

40|$|Research into Australian elapid venoms has {{mainly focused}} on the seven genera of {{greatest}} clinical significance: Acanthophis, Hoplocephalus, Notechis, Oxyuranus, Pseudechis, Pseudonaja and Tropidechis. However, even small species represent a potential for causing severe clinical envenoming. Further, owing to taxonomic distinctiveness, these species are a potential source of novel toxins for use in drug design and development. This is the first study to characterize the venoms of Cryptophis boschmai, Denisonia devisi, Echiopsis curta, Hemiaspis signata and Vermicella annulata. MALDI analysis of each venom, over the range of 4 – 40 kDa, indicated components in the weight range for three finger toxins (6 – 8 kDa) and phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂; 12 – 14 kDA). Interestingly, C. boschmai venom was the only venom, which contained components > 25 kDa. All venoms (10 μg/ml) demonstrated in vitro neurotoxicity in the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation, with a relative rank order of: H. signata ≥ D. devisi ≥ V. annulata = E. curta > C. boschmai. CSL polyvalent antivenom neutralized the inhibitory effects of C. boschmai venom but only delayed the inhibitory effect of the other venoms. All venoms displayed PLA 2 activity but {{over a wide range}} (i. <b>e.</b> 1 – <b>621</b> μmol/min. /mg).

40|$|AbstractSTIM 1 {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), {{and therefore}} a mediator of Ca 2 + entry-dependent cellular events. Phosphorylation of STIM 1 at ERK 1 / 2 target sites {{has been described as}} enhancing STIM 1 activation during intracellular Ca 2 + emptying triggered by the inhibition of the sarco(endo) plasmic Ca 2 +-ATPase with thapsigargin. However, no physiological function is known for this specific phosphorylation. The present study examined the role of STIM 1 phosphorylation in cell signaling triggered by EGF. Using a human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line (Ishikawa cells) EGF or H-Ras(G 12 V), an active mutant of H-Ras, was found to trigger STIM 1 phosphorylation at residues Ser 575, Ser 608, and Ser 621, and this process was sensitive to PD 0325901, an inhibitor of ERK 1 / 2. Both, ERK 1 / 2 activation and STIM 1 phosphorylation took place in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, indicating that both events are upstream steps for Ca 2 + entry activation. Also, EGF triggered the dissociation of STIM 1 from EB 1 (a regulator of microtubule plus-ends) {{in a manner similar to}} that reported for the activation of STIM 1 by thapsigargin. Migration of the Ishikawa cells was impaired when STIM 1 phosphorylation was targeted by Ser-to-Ala substitution mutation of ERK 1 / 2 target sites. This effect was also observed with the Ca 2 + channel blocker SKF 96365. Phosphomimetic mutation of STIM 1 restored the migration to levels similar to that found for STIM 1 -wild type. Finally, the increased vimentin expression and relocalization of E-cadherin triggered by EGF were largely inhibited by targeting STIM 1 phosphorylation, while STIM 1 -S 575 E/S 608 E/S <b>621</b> <b>E</b> normalized the profiles of these two EMT markers...|$|R

40|$|DNA binding {{as well as}} {{ligand binding}} by nuclear receptors has been studied extensively. Both binding {{functions}} are attributed to isolated domains of which the structure is known. The crystal structure of a complete receptor in complex with its ligand and DNA-response element, however, has been solved only for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. This structure provided the first indication of direct interactions between the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). In this study, we investigated {{whether there is a}} similar interface between the DNA- and ligand-binding domains for the androgen receptor (AR). Despite the structural differences between the AR- and PPAR-LBD, a combination of in silicomodeling and docking pointed out a putative interface between AR-DBD and AR-LBD. The surfaces were subjected to a point mutation analysis, which was inspired by known ARmutations described in androgen insensitivity syndromes and prostate cancer. Surprisingly, AR-LBDmutations D 695 N, R 710 A, F 754 S, and P 766 A induced a de-crease in DNA binding but left ligand binding unaffected, while the DBD-residing mutations K 590 A, K 592 A, and <b>E</b> <b>621</b> A lowered the ligand-binding but not the DNA-binding affinity.

The objective of this research was to determine the effect of sowing date on some physiological characteristics, dry matter and grain yield of three sunflower cultivars sowed in twelve consecutive sowing dates ranging from January to December, 1989. The study was carried out in a field experiment, in the IAC Experimental Station of Monte Alegre do Sul (Latitude: 22 ° 41 ’S; Longitude: 46 ° 43 ’W; Altitude: 777 m), Brazil. The genotypes used were the varieties IAC-Anhandy and VNIIMK 8931, and the hybrid Contisol 621, in a split-plot design with sowing dates and cultivars, with four replications. The evaluations were done at phenostage R 5. 5, corresponding to 50 % of flowering for leaf area index (LAI) and at physiological maturity (R 5. 9) for the remaining data. There was a significant interaction between sowing date and cultivar for all the studied characteristics, pointing out the importance of the knowledge of cultivar response to different behaviour. The highest total dry matter(TDM) and grain yield(GDM) were observed in the sowing date of January for IAC-Anhandy; June for Contisol 621, and in July for dry matter and August for grain yield in the case of VNIIMK. Contisol 621 presented less dry matter yield but with a better efficiency due to a slightly higher harvest index in comparison with the two populations...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Monosodium glutamate, {{the salt}} of glutamic acid, is largely {{used as a}} flavour {{enhancer}} (<b>E</b> <b>621).</b> In this study, we determine if monosodium glutamate, after repeated oral administration, can induce any degree of anxiety. Taking into account the interdependence between glutamate and GABA neurotransmissions, we studied the possible interactions of monosodium glutamate with some representatives belonging to benzodiazepines therapeutical class, diazepam and alprazolam, used as first line therapy {{for the treatment of}} anxiety. Methods: For determining the degree of anxiety, the specific cross-labyrinth test was used. The medium time spent in the closed-arms of the crosslabyrinth is correlated with increased anxiety and the medium time spent in the opened arms is correlated with a low degree anxiety. NMRI adult mice received 300 mg/kg monosodium glutamate for 21 days, dose representing 1 / 50 from mice LD 50 (15000 mg/kg) and twice the maximum admitted dose/ day for human. Results: When compared to control group, the group receiving monosodium glutamate, showed a not statistically significant slight increase in the degree of anxiety. The groups receiving benzodiazepines presented a significant reduction of the degree of anxiety, proving their anxiolytic effect. The groups receiving glutamate and diazepam or alprazolam, showed a lower reduction of the degree of anxiety, than group receiving only benzodiazepines, phenomenon which proves an antagonism between glutamate and the anxiolytics used in this study. Conclusions: The oral administration of monosodium glutamate increases slightly, not statistically significant, the degree of anxiety in mice and significantly alters the response to the benzodiazepines therapy, reducing the effect for both alprazolam and diazepam...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine, on the animal model, the effect of modifi cation of diet {{composition}} and administration of selected food additives on water balance in the body. Material and methods. The study was conducted with 48 males and 48 females (separately for each sex) of Wistar strain rats divided into four groups. For drinking, the animals from groups I and III were receiving water, whereas the animals from groups II and IV were administered 5 ml of a solution of selected food additives (potassium nitrate &ndash; E 252, sodium nitrite &ndash; E 250, benzoic acid &ndash; E 210, sorbic acid &ndash; E 200, and monosodium glutamate &ndash; <b>E</b> <b>621).</b> Doses of the administered food additives were computed taking into account the average intake by men, expressed per body mass unit. Having drunk the solution, the animals were provided water for drinking. Results. The mixture of selected food additives applied in the experiment was found to facilitate water retention in the body both in the case of both male and female rats, and differences observed between the volume of ingested fl uids and the volume of excreted urine were statistically signifi cant in the animals fed the basal diet. The type of feed mixture provided to the animals affected the site of water retention &ndash; in the case of animals receiving the basal diet analyses demonstrated a signifi cant increase in water content in the liver tissue, whereas in the animals fed the modifi ed diet water was observed to accumulate in the vascular bed. Conclusion. Taking into account the fact of water retention in the vascular bed, the effects of food additives intake may be more adverse in the case of females...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To provide {{evidence}} of septic system failure by comparing two faecal indicator bacteria, enterococci and Escherichia coli, from defective septic tanks and adjacent creeks. METHODS AND RESULTS: A biochemical fingerprinting method was used to type and compare enterococci and E. coli strains from 39 septic tanks with creek water samples. Phenotypic diversity of enterococci (0. 5 +/- 0. 3) and E. coli (0. 5 +/- 0. 3) in septic tanks were significantly lower than those found in water samples (0. 8 +/- 0. 1, P < 0. 0001 for enterococci and 0. 9 +/- 0. 1, P < 0. 0001 for E. coli). Among 1072 enterococci isolates tested from septic tanks, 203 biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) were found of which 98 BPTs from 33 septic tanks were identical to several water samples. Similarly, among <b>621</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates tested from septic tanks, 159 BPTs were found of which 53 BPTs from 26 septic tanks were also identical to water samples. The number of the latter bacteria was significantly (P = 0. 01) higher in water samples collected from downstream {{compared with that of}} upstream in the study area. A high similarity between the populations of both indicator bacteria was also found between defective septic tanks and downstream water samples further indicating the contamination of both creeks by defective septic systems. CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical fingerprinting of faecal indicator bacteria is a useful and rapid method to provide direct evidence for septic system failure. Combination of both faecal indicator bacteria (enterococci and E. coli) provides a better judgement of the performance of a septic system. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study is the first to provide direct evidence of septic system failure by identifying the presence of specific bacterial types in septic tanks and surface waters. Based on our findings, we suggest that the performance evaluation of a septic system should be accompanied by direct analysis of faecal indicator bacteria...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: O Running Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) tem sido considerado um teste válido para avaliação anaeróbia. Entretanto, como a superfície e o calçado podem afetar alguns parâmetros mensurados durante o exercício, isso pode modificar os parâmetros do RAST. OBJETIVO: Comparar as variáveis do RAST mensuradas utilizando chuteiras na grama (RAST CG) e tênis na pista (RAST TP). MÉTODOS: Oito jogadores de futebol (da categoria sub- 17) participaram do estudo. Os participantes realizaram dois RAST (intervalo > 24 h). O RAST consistiu em seis corridas máximas de 35 m com 10 s de intervalo passivo entre cada corrida. O tempo de cada esforço foi registrado para determinação da potência pico (PP), potência média (PM) e índice de fadiga (IF). Após o sexto esforço, amostras sanguíneas foram coletadas para determinação da lactacidemia ([Lac]). RESULTADOS: Durante o RAST TP, a PP (763, 1 ± 87, 2 W) <b>e</b> PM (<b>621,</b> 6 ± 68, 1 W) foram significativamente superiores às PP e PM mensuradas em RAST CG (PP = 667, 3 ± 67, 0 W e PM = 555, 9 ± 74, 7 W), enquanto que as [Lac] observadas em RAST TP (7, 3 ± 1, 8 mmol. L- 1) foram significativamente inferiores às mensuradas em RAST CG (9, 9 ± 3, 2 mmol. L- 1). No entanto, o IF não foi significativamente diferente (RAST TP = 32, 5 ± 8, 3 %; RAST CG = 34, 1 ± 6, 6 %). Significativas correlações foram observadas entre as PM (r = 0, 90) e as [Lac] (r = 0, 72). CONCLUSÃO: Podemos concluir que as variáveis do RAST são influenciadas pela superfície e calçado utilizados, com valores superiores observados em RAST TP. INTRODUCTION: Running Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST) {{has been}} {{considered}} a valid test for anaerobic evaluation. However, since the floor surfaces and footwear can affect some outcomes measured during exercise, this also can modify the RAST outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Was to compare the RAST outcomes measured using soccer cleats on grass (RAST SCG) and using shoes on the track (RAST ST). METHODS: Eight young male soccer players (under- 17 category; 16 ± 1 years) participated in the study. The subjects performed two RAST on different days (recovery > 24 h). The RAST test consisted of six 35 -meter maximal running performance with a 10 -second recovery between each run. Running time during each effort was recorded to determine peak power (PP), mean power (MP) and fatigue index (FI); and blood samples were collected after each test to determine lactatemia ([Lac]). RESULTS: PP (763. 1 ± 87. 2 W) and MP (621. 6 ± 68. 1 W) were higher in RAST ST than RAST SCG (PP = 667. 3 ± 67. 0 W e PM = 555. 9 ± 74. 7 W), while [Lac] measured during RAST ST (7. 3 ± 1. 8 mmol. L- 1) was lower than the one measured in RAST SCG (9. 9 ± 3. 2 mmol. L- 1). However, the FI did not statistically differ (RAST ST = 32. 5 ± 8. 3 %; RAST SCG = 34. 1 ± 6. 6 %). Significant correlations were observed between MP values (r = 0. 90) and [Lac] values (r = 0. 72). CONCLUSION: We can conclude that the RAST variables are affected by floor surface and footwear, with higher values being observed during RAST ST conditio...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which undergraduate students‟ personal and institutional experiences influence their capacity to change and develop as lifelong learners in Tanzania. My interest in the topic grew out of my recognition of the need to maintain a critical eye on the purpose of higher education in Tanzania and to establish whether or not the recent education reforms introduced in higher education had had a robust impact on lifelong learning. The core question in {{this study was to determine}} whether or not university education in Tanzania develops students as lifelong learners and what the underlying factors influencing such development might be. The students‟ lifelong learning attributes in this thesis were operationalised using four major constructs, namely, „learning to learn‟ skills, „personal agency‟, „information skills‟ and „entrepreneurial skills‟. This study adopted a case study longitudinal research design that involved two waves of data collection with the use of a mixed methods approach for triangulation purposes. It involved following a sample first-year cohort of students at one of the public universities in Tanzania (n= 839, i. <b>e.</b> <b>621</b> males and 218 females) through Year 2. A small number of participants (n= 59) [i. e. students (n= 23), lecturers (n= 26), librarians (n= 4), policy elites (n= 3) and school deans & college principals (n= 4) ] took part in semi-structured interviews. The sample of students and lecturers was drawn from four distinct academic disciplines, namely, Accounting, Engineering, Science and Sociology. The results with respect to the longitudinal study showed that there were significant changes in the ILS sub-scales of „stepwise processing‟ strategies and „certificate-directed‟ and the ‘self-test‟ learning orientations. Significant changes were also noted in the ISS sub-scales of ‘ethical use of information‟, „accessing information‟ and „evaluating information‟. These changes, however, seemed to occur relatively slowly. No improvements were found with regard to „entrepreneurial skills‟. The slow rate and the absence of changes, however, seemed to be partly the results of the unclear, limited and somewhat slow implementation of policies related to the integration of higher education with lifelong learning. iv The findings also indicated that there were effects from personal and contextual factors on „processing‟ and „regulation‟ learning strategies for some of the constructs. The correlation results indicated that the students‟ personal beliefs were associated with their choice of processing and regulation strategies, suggesting that learning orientations were important predictors of students‟ processing and regulation learning strategies. In addition, the results showed that the contextual variables, such as lecturers, the teaching objectives and assessment procedures, as well as the social environments, such as friends, constituted significant predictors for student development of lifelong learning attributes. These findings suggest that the undergraduate students‟ development of lifelong learning attributes is influenced by a variety of individual and contextual variables. In the light of the findings from the present study, a number of recommendations are made both for future studies and for policy...|$|E
40|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone, are {{the male}} sex hormones {{that are responsible}} for the early development of the male reproductive organs but also for the secondary sexual characteristics that come up at puberty and for maintaining the reproductive function in adult life. Androgens exert their effects by binding to an intracellular receptor, named the androgen receptor (AR). The AR is in fact a ligand-dependent transcription factor that can switch genes on or off by binding as a homodimer to certain elements in the DNA. It {{is a member of the}} nuclear receptor superfamily that share structural and functional characteristics. All nuclear receptors consist of the same building blocks or domains. From N- to C-terminus, there is the aminoterminal domain, the DNA-binding domain, the hinge region and the ligand-binding domain. The DBD and the LBD have the highest sequence conservation between nuclear receptors and are structurally similar. Despite the existence of independent domains, each with their own, intrinsic function, the domains also interact or communicate with each other. The N/C-interaction between NTD and LBD and the DNA-dependent dimerization via the DBD in the homodimer are well documented. Via in silico models and mutational analysis we have provided evidence for communication between the DBD and the LBD of the AR. Communication between the LBD of PPAR and the DBD of RXR was found earlier to be important for DNA binding by the PPAR-RXR heterodimer (Chandra et al. 2008). The first in silico model for the AR was therefore based on the crystal structure of the PPAR-RXR heterodimer bound to DNA. Due to the high sequence and structural conservation of DBD and LBD between nuclear receptors we were able to align the protein structure of the DBD and the LBD of the AR onto the PPAR-LBD and RXR-DBD. The second in silico model of DBD-LBD communication in the AR was obtained after a docking analysis that calculates the most optimal interaction modes between AR-DBD and AR-LBD based on the energy-lowering contacts made at the surface of DBD and LBD. We selected residues that were important for interaction based on the in silico models and on mutations that were reported to be involved in the androgen insensitivity syndrome. We thus created mutant ARs with a mutation on the surface of the DBD or on the surface of the LBD and compared their ligand-binding and DNA-binding ability together with their transactivation capacity to the properties of the wild-type AR. We found three mutations in the DBD (K 590 A, K 592 A and <b>E</b> <b>621</b> A) that do not affect DNA binding, but reduce ligand-binding and transactivation of the AR. In the LBD, we found four mutations (D 695 N, R 710 A, F 754 S and P 766 A) that did not affect ligand binding but reduce DNA binding and transactivation. We suggest that these residues are involved in DBD-LBD communications as they can affect the function of a domain they are not situated in. The AR-signaling pathway is an important therapeutic target in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer since prostate tissue is very hormone-responsive. For small and localized prostate tumors, surgery and radiotherapy remain the preferred treatments. Initially prostate cancer cells respond very well to androgen deprivation or androgen blockage. Androgen deprivation is achieved by preventing testosterone production in the testis with GnRH analogues or by inhibiting the androgen biosynthesis. Androgen blockage, on the other hand, is achieved by directly inhibiting the activity of the AR with AR-antagonists or antiandrogens. Current, clinically used antiandrogens such as Bic and HOFl, are relatively weak and many patients have developed therapy-resistance. During androgen deprivation and blockage, the tumor can adapt to the low levels of androgens and the presence of antiandrogens by several, often AR-related mechanisms and become resistant to the applied treatment. This stage of the disease can still be treated with AR-targeted therapeutics, but these need to be more effective or have a distinct mechanism of action compared to the previous treatments. A promising candidate which is now investigated in clinical trials is the second-generation AR-antagonist MDV 3100. In order to expand the options for androgen blockade we have set up a screening to detect AR-antagonists in a compound library. To detect AR-antagonists we created stable cell lines that express the human AR and contain an ARE-driven luciferase reporter. The hit-rate of the screening was 1. 3 % with a false positive rate of only 0. 1 %. Three compounds (MEL- 3, MEL- 4 and MEL- 6) were selected based on their binding affinity for the AR, their drug-likeliness and patentability of their structure. These compounds were thoroughly characterized for their antagonistic effects on expression of androgen-regulated genes and on proliferation of AR-positive and AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines. MEL- 3, MEL- 4 and MEL- 6 all performed better than Bic in our in vitro tests, but not always better than MDV 3100. With RNA-seq we confirmed that MEL- 3, MEL- 4 and MEL- 6 indeed target the AR. The MEL-compounds have a distinct mechanism of action compared to Bic and MDV 3100 since each compound demonstrated a distinct pattern of repressive effects on the proliferation of a set of AR-positive cell lines: LNCaP, LAPC 4 and VCaP. MEL- 6 was selected as the overall best-performing and most specific compound and will now be further developed. To investigate whether the MEL-compounds are suitable as second- or third-line antiandrogens we determined their antagonistic effects in models of resistance to Bic, HOFl and MDV 3100. As model for Bic- and HOFl-resistance we used mutant ARs reported to convert the antagonists into agonists: AR W 741 C for Bic and AR T 877 A for HOFl. While MEL- 6 is a full antagonist on AR wt, AR T 877 A and AR W 741 C; MEL- 3 and MEL- 4 are partial agonists on AR T 877 A. MEL- 6 can thus be used as second-line antiandrogen to treat prostate tumors expressing AR T 877 A and AR W 741 C which escaped therapy with HOFl and Bic, respectively. Prostate tumors expressing AR T 877 A should not be treated with MEL- 3 andMEL- 4 since they act as agonists in absence of androgens. Since MDV 3100 was not yet FDA-approved at the time of writing, little information on therapy-resistance was available. We therefore created a MDV 3100 -resistant LNCaP-subline by long-term growth in the presence of RD 162 /MDV 3100 as a model of resistance for MDV 3100. After 12 months of therapy with RD 162, the LNCaP-Rr cell line demonstrated a 2 - to 3 -fold increase of AR protein level with no detected mutations. The transcriptional activity of the AR in LNCaP-Rr has become hypersensitive to the presence of serum, but not to androgens. Proliferation of LNCaP-Rr is still androgen-responsive but surprisingly both androgens and serum demonstrate growth-suppressive effects. The resistant cells thus proliferate best in absence of androgens and serum. MEL- 3, MEL- 4 and MEL- 6 can, however, still suppress proliferation of this MDV 3100 -resistant cell line which underlines the crucial role of the AR in the mechanism of resistance. Additional, resistant, AR-positive cell lines are now being developed, and studies are planned to verify the effects of MEL- 6 in xenotransplant and explant models. However, our current data indicate already that third-generation antiandrogens like MEL- 6 could be viable candidates for the treatment of MDV 3100 -resistant PrCa. status: publishe...|$|E
