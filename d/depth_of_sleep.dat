We collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data from five subjects {{during the early}} part of the night, comparing the changes in the BIS with the conventional EEG stages of sleep.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intensive {{care unit}} (ICU) {{patients}} {{are known to}} experience severely disturbed sleep, with possible detrimental effects on short- and long- term outcomes. Investigation into the exact causes and effects of disturbed sleep has been hampered by cumbersome and time consuming methods of measuring and staging sleep. We introduce a novel method for ICU <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> analysis, the ICU <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> index (IDOS index), using single channel electroencephalography (EEG) {{and apply it to}} outpatient recordings. A proof of concept is shown in non-sedated ICU patients. METHODS: Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of five ICU patients and 15 healthy outpatients were analyzed using the IDOS index, based on the ratio between gamma and delta band power. Manual selection of thresholds was used to classify data as either wake, sleep or slow wave sleep (SWS). This classification was compared to visual sleep scoring by Rechtschaffen & Kales criteria in normal outpatient recordings and ICU recordings to illustrate face validity of the IDOS index. RESULTS: When reduced to two or three classes, the scoring of sleep by IDOS index and manual scoring show high agreement for normal sleep recordings. The obtained overall agreements, as quantified by the kappa coefficient, were 0. 84 for sleep/wake classification and 0. 82 for classification into three classes (wake, non-SWS and SWS). Sensitivity and specificity were highest for the wake state (93 % and 93 %, respectively) and lowest for SWS (82 % and 76 %, respectively). For ICU recordings, agreement was similar to agreement between visual scorers previously reported in literature. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the most satisfying visual resemblance with manually scored normal PSG recordings, the established face-validity of the IDOS index as an estimator of <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> was excellent. This technique enables real-time, automated, single channel visualization of <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> facilitating the monitoring of sleep in the ICU...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that sleep bruxism is caused by mechanisms related to the central nervous system, involving sleep arousal and neurotransmitter abnormalities.

Recent development of a novel ambulatory telemetric capsule system, {{which can be used}} in conjunction with polysomnography, offers a solution to this problem. The 3 D-Transit system consists of ingestible electromagnetic capsules traceable through a portable extracorporeal receiver while traversing the gut. During sleep monitored by polysomnography, gastrointestinal motility was concurrently investigated using 3 D-Transit in nine healthy subjects. Overall, the amplitude of gastric contractions decreased with <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> (light sleep, N 2 versus deep sleep, N 3; P< 0. 05). Progression through the small intestine did not change with <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> (Kruskal–Wallis probability = 0. 1), and there was no association between nocturnal awakenings or arousals and the occurrence of colonic or small intestinal propagating movements. Basal colonic activity was suppressed during both deep sleep (P< 0. 05) and light sleep (P< 0. 05) when compared with nocturnal wake periods. In conclusion, the novel ambulatory 3 D-Transit system combined with polysomnography allows minimally invasive and completely ambulatory investigation of associations between sleep patterns and gastrointestinal motility.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a new technique in the sleep analysis domain. Sleep is defined as a periodic physiological state during which vigilance is suspended and reactivity to external stimulations diminished. We sleep on average between six and nine hours per night and our <b>sleep</b> is composed <b>of</b> four to six cycles of about 90 min each. Each of these cycles is composed of a succession of several stages <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> that vary in <b>depth.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> is usually done via polysomnography. This examination consists of recording, among other things, electrical cerebral activity by electroencephalography (EEG), ocular movements by electrooculography (EOG), and chin muscle tone by electromyography (EMG). Recordings are made mostly in a hospital, more specifically in a service for monitoring the pathologies related to sleep. The readings are then interpreted manually by an expert to generate a hypnogram, a curve showing the succession <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> stages during the night in 30 s epochs. The proposed method is based on the follow-up of the thermal signature that makes it possible to classify the activity into three classes: “awakening,” “calm sleep,” and “restless sleep”. The contribution of this non-invasive method is part of the screening <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disorders, to be validated by a more complete analysis <b>of</b> the <b>sleep.</b> The measure provided by this new system, based on temperature monitoring (patient and ambient), aims to be integrated into the tele-medicine platform developed within the framework of the Smart-EEG project by the SYEL–SYstèmes ELectroniques team. Analysis of the data collected during the first surveys carried out with this method showed a correlation between thermal signature and activity during <b>sleep.</b> The advantage <b>of</b> this method lies in its simplicity and the possibility of carrying out measurements <b>of</b> activity during <b>sleep</b> and without direct contact with the patient at home or hospitals...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of critical levels of sleepiness in humans performing monotonous work activities {{is the cause}} of numerous transportation and factory accidents. The appearance of conditions for this is currently regarded as associated with the development of drowsiness, a process supporting the transition from waking to sleep.

The concept of “consciousness ” [15] helps to provide a theoretical basis for the relationship and between selective attention and sleep and the transition between them, as well as between subjective and objective factors inducing impairments to activity during falling asleep. The presence of selective attention provides the sub-ject with conscious perception only of significant stimuli and, at the same time, unconsciously inhibits responses to insignificant stimuli.

It is, therefore, important to understand why infants die of SIDS and the effects of prone sleeping position on prematurely born infants. Possible mechanisms of SIDS include failure to arouse, infection and genetic predisposition. Impaired arousal has been described during prone sleeping and in infants exposed to maternal smoking.

The few data on convalescent babies demonstrate prone posture has an advantage in improving oxygenation in infants with BPD, but is associated with less spontaneous arousals and more central apnoeas.

Such a relationship was reported by Aserinsky and Kleitman (1) who observed periods of rapid, conjugate eye movements during sleep and found a high incidence of dream recall in Ss awakened during these periods and a low incidence when awakened at other times.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sleep {{undergoes}} {{major changes}} during development. Its {{relationship to the}} complex process of maturation in health and disease has recently received increased attention. This review aims to highlight the recent literature examining the interplay of altered sleep, brain development and emerging psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to a temporal relationship of sleep disturbances preceding the onset of psychiatric illnesses, a bi-directional interaction of altered sleep and symptom severity has increasingly been shown. Sleep architecture shows drastic age-dependent alterations on a structural level during the first 2 decades of life. However, findings regarding disease-specific patterns have remained inconsistent. On a functional level, recent evidence about sleep electroencephalographic characteristics points to a close relationship between slow waves, reflecting the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> and cortical plasticity. SUMMARY: Sleep provides {{a rich source of}} information to gain insight into both the healthy and disturbed processes of brain function and maturation. Emerging data suggest that the investigation of slow wave activity is a novel and promising tool for monitoring both of these processes. It is important to understand when and how deviations from typical developmental sleep alterations occur in order to improve prevention and early treatment of disorders affecting a substantial number of children and adolescents...|$|E
