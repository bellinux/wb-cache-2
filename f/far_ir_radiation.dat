40|$|In a {{synchrotron}} radiation source coherent infrared (IR) radiation is emitted when the bunch length {{is comparable to}} the wavelength of the emitted radiation. To generate coher-ent THz (<b>far</b> <b>IR)</b> <b>radiation,</b> the ANKA storage ring is op-erated regularly in a dedicated low-alpha optics. Different bunch lengths, corresponding to different spectral ranges of the THz spectrum and various electron beam energies can be offered, depending on user demand. The radiation emitted in the fringe field of a dipole magnet, the so-called edge radiation, is detected at the ANKA-IR beam line. This paper presents radiation properties like THz beam profiles and power measurements in the framework of characteris-ing the coherent THz radiation to optimise the power, fre-quency and spatial output of the ANKA storage ring. First experiments showed a time averaged power of up to 0. 2 mW suggesting a THz pulse peak power above 1 W...|$|E
40|$|The two nearby starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC 253 were {{observed}} for ∼ 100 ksec over a 10 -month period in 1997. An {{increase of the}} M 82 flux by a factor ∼ 2 was measured during the period July-November, {{when compared with the}} flux measured earlier in 1997. The flux measured in the field centered on M 82 includes ∼ 38 % of the emission from the Seyfert 1 galaxy M 81. The best-fitting model for the earlier emission from M 82 is thermal with kT ≃ 6. 7 ± 0. 1 keV. In the high flux state, the emission additionally includes either an absorbed second thermal component or absorbed power-law component, with the former providing a much better fit. A likely origin for the temporal variability is a single source in M 82. The flux of NGC 253, which did not vary significantly during the period of observations, can be well fit by either a thermal spectrum with kT ≃ 3. 8 ± 0. 3 keV, or by a power law with photon index of 2. 7 ± 0. 10. We have also attempted fitting the measurements to more realistic composite models with thermal and power-law components, such as would be expected from a dominant contribution from binary systems, or Compton scattering of (<b>far)</b> <b>IR</b> <b>radiation</b> by radio emitting electrons. However, the addition of any amount of a power-law component, even with cutoff at 20 keV, only increases chi-square. The 90 % confidence upper limit for power law emission with (photon) index 1. 5 is only 2. 4 % of the 2 — 10 keV flux of M 82; the corresponding limit for NGC 253, with index 2. 0, is 48 %...|$|E
40|$|We present CO {{observations}} {{of a large}} sample of ultraluminous IR galaxies out to z = 0. 3. Most of the galaxies are interacting, but not completed mergers. All but one have high CO(1 - 0) luminosities, log(Lco [K-km/s-pc^ 2]) = 9. 92 +/- 0. 12. The dispersion in Lco is only 30 %, less than that in the FIR luminosity. The integrated CO intensity correlates Strongly with the 100 micron flux density, as expected for a black body model in which the mid and <b>far</b> <b>IR</b> <b>radiation</b> are optically thick. We use this model to derive sizes of the FIR and CO emitting regions and the enclosed dynamical masses. Both the IR and CO emission originate in regions a few hundred parsecs in radius. The median value of Lfir/Lco = 160 Lsun/(K-km/s-pc^ 2), within a factor {{of two of the}} black body limit for the observed FIR temperatures. The entire ISM is a scaled up version of a normal galactic disk with densities a factor of 100 higher, making even the intercloud medium a molecular region. Using three different techniques of H 2 mass estimation, we conclude that the ratio of gas mass to Lco is about a factor of four lower than for Galactic molecular clouds, but that the gas mass is a large fraction of the dynamical mass. Our analysis of CO emission reduces the H 2 mass from previous estimates of 2 - 5 e 10 Msun to 0. 4 - 1. 5 e 10 Msun, which is in the range found for molecular gas rich spiral galaxies. A collision involving a molecular gas rich spiral could lead to an ultraluminous galaxy powered by central starbursts triggered by the compression of infalling preexisting GMC's.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{rigidity}} of a peptide {{chain in}} its equilibrium dynamics is investigated within a realistic model with stringent microscopically derived coupling interaction potential and effective on-site potential. The coupling interaction characterizing the chain rigidity and the effective on-site potentials are calculated for three main types of protein secondary structure. The coupling interaction {{is found to be}} surprisingly weak for all of them but different in character: repulsive for alpha-helix and anti-parallel beta-sheet structures and attractive for parallel beta-sheet structure. The effective on-site potential is found to be a hard one for alpha-helix and anti-parallel beta-sheet and a soft one for parallel beta-sheet. In all three types of protein secondary structures a stable zig-zag shape discrete breather (DB) associated with the oscillations of torsional (dihedral) angles can exist due to weakness of the coupling interaction. However, since the absorption of <b>far</b> infrared <b>radiation</b> (<b>IR)</b> by proteins is known to require the existence of rather long chains of hydrogen bonds that takes place only in alpha-helicies, then one can conclude that the excitation of a DB in such a way is possible in alpha-helix and seems to be hardly possible in beta-sheet structures. The interpretation of the recent experiments of Xie et al. on <b>far</b> <b>IR</b> laser pulse spectroscopy of proteins is suggested. The frequency of a DB in an the alpha-helix is obtained in the region of 115 cm^{- 1 } in accordance with these experiments. Comment: LaTeX, 20 pages, 5 eps figures. Revised version.
