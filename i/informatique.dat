The resulting Manual for the Encoding of Hieroglyphic Texts for Computer-input (Jan Buurman, Nicolas Grimal, Jochen Hallof, Michael Hainsworth and Dirk van der Plas, <b>Informatique</b> et Egyptologie 2, Paris 1988) is generally shortened to Manuel de Codage.

The encoding system of the Manuel de Codage has since been adopted by international Egyptology as the official common standard for registering hieroglyphic texts on the computer.|$|E

INTRODUCTION The study of quantitative models for workloadarchitecture (in) adequacy is of central importance in the context of parallel and distributed programming. It is a very active field in the modeling community (Gelenbe 1989). New models, that generalize the classical Queuing Network approach, are developed in order to include both concurrency and synchronization primitives. These models exhibit a very rich dynamic and scarcely lead to an easy analysis, such as Product Form results.
