2500|$|During Saddam Hussein's rule, the {{construction}} of the Mosul Dam began in 1981 by a German-Italian consortium that was led by Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft. Because the dam was constructed on a foundation of soluble gypsum, the engineers recommended thorough grouting within the foundation before the superstructure was built. Instead, to speed construction of the dam, engineers blanket-grouted [...] deep around the foundation and a curtain [...] directly below the dam. A <b>grouting</b> <b>gallery</b> that would allow continuous grouting of the dam's foundation in order to promote stability was also installed. Construction was complete in 1984 and in the spring of 1985, the Mosul Dam began to inundate the Tigris River, filling the reservoir which submerged many archaeological sites in the region. The power station began generating power on 7 July 1986. Because of significant structural stability issues associated with the Mosul Dam, ongoing grouting and additional construction and repairs are necessary. In 1988, Iraq began construction on the Badush Dam downstream which would serve the primary purpose of absorbing and releasing a Mosul Dam flood wave {{in the event of a}} breach. Works were halted in 1991 though due chiefly to UN sanctions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geological}} features at the {{dam site}} were evaluated for possibilities of displacement. The treatment measures implemented {{to address this}} condition involved excavation of a trench of 15 m width and 2 m depth below the toe slab which is meant {{to function as a}} concrete [...] "socle". A grout curtain was also created through the [...] "lineament" [...] (fault line) and a <b>grouting</b> <b>gallery</b> was provided for the purpose that covered the downstream part of the embankment up to the toe-slab area near the lineament. Both the [...] "socle" [...] and the toe-slab incorporate movement joints consisting of 20 mm compressible materials and a PVC water stop. A layer of earth fill is also laid on the upstream part of the toe slab over a width of 70 m, and on the downstream side protection includes a geo-textile and [...] "reverse filters of 2D and 2E material". The concrete facing on the upstream face of the dam was constructed concurrently at two levels. The lower part of the concrete slab was laid up to two thirds height of the dam from the bottom while the top one third face was also concurrently laid. This special construction method facilitated early completion of the dam. The dam is said {{to be one of the}} top ten concrete faced embankment dams in the world. The project's reservoir submergence involved some of the most fertile agricultural land in the area. The project affected 390 households and some 1700 people.|$|E
50|$|The John H. Kerr Dam Project {{consisted}} of a dam, powerhouse and switchyard. The dam was built in 53 sections called monoliths. A <b>grouting</b> tunnel or <b>gallery</b> was built in order to fill gaps between the dam and foundation with concrete. The spillway consists of 22-tainter gates for overflow and {{at the base of}} the dam, 6-sluice gates were installed to maintain downstream flows. Construction was completed and the dam was opened in 1953.|$|R
