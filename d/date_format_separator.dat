40|$|In our work, {{we often}} receive {{administrative}} and research data in Microsoft Excel workbooks. This data {{is used for}} developing standardized approaches to administrative reporting and for research projects. A lot of it contains dates that don’t conform to either Excel or SAS ® <b>date</b> <b>formats,</b> and are rarely entered consistently in the Excel workbook. In the past, a secretary would spend hours going through these workbooks reformatting dates so {{they were in a}} form that SAS could understand. In SAS® 9, SAS introduced the ANYDATE INFORMAT that can read data in a variety of <b>date</b> <b>formats.</b> This has its limitations, too. To accommodate these limitations, we developed a SAS macro. With our SAS macro, we have converted reading dirty date data from non-SAS sources from a labor-intensive process into an easy routine task, saving hours of time and reducing data entry errors resulting from the manual re-entry of dates. This macro is robust and expandable {{to a wide variety of}} <b>date</b> <b>formats</b> that SAS programmers might encounter...|$|R
