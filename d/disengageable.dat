6000|$|I {{should have}} liked just here to re-examine with the reader {{some of the}} {{positively}} most artful passages I have in mind--such as the hour of Mr. Longdon's beautiful and, as it were, mystic attempt at a compact with Vanderbank, late at night, in the billiard-room of the country-house at which they are staying; such as the other nocturnal passage, under Mr. Longdon's roof, between Vanderbank and Mitchy, where the conduct of so much fine meaning, so many flares of the exhibitory torch through the labyrinth of mere immediate appearances, mere familiar allusions, is successfully and safely effected; such as the whole array {{of the terms of}} presentation that are made to serve, all systematically, yet without a gap anywhere, for the presentation, throughout, of a Mitchy [...] "subtle" [...] no less than concrete and concrete no less than deprived of that officious explanation which we know as [...] "going behind"; such as, briefly, the general service of co-ordination and vivification rendered, on lines of ferocious, of really quite heroic compression, by the picture of the assembled group at Mrs. Grendon's, where the [...] "cross-references" [...] of the action are as thick as the green leaves of a garden, but none the less, as they have scenically to be, counted and disposed, weighted with responsibility. Were I minded to use in this connexion a [...] "loud" [...] word--and the critic in general hates loud words as a man of taste may hate loud colours--I should speak of the composition of the chapters entitled [...] "Tishy Grendon," [...] with all the pieces of the game on the table together and each unconfusedly and contributively placed, as triumphantly scientific. I must properly remind myself, rather, that the better lesson of my retrospect would seem to be really a supreme revision of the question of what it may be for a subject to suffer, to call it suffering, by over-treatment. Bowed down so long by the inference that its product had in this case proved such a betrayal, my artistic conscience meets the relief of having to recognise truly here no traces of suffering. The thing carries itself to my maturer and gratified sense as with every symptom of soundness, an insolence of health and joy. And from this precisely I deduce my moral; which is to the effect that, since our only way, in general, of knowing that we have had too much of anything is by FEELING that too much: so, by the same token, when we don't feel the excess (and I am contending, mind, that in [...] "The Awkward Age" [...] the multiplicity yields to the order) {{how do we know that}} the measure not recorded, the notch not reached, does represent adequacy or satiety? The mere feeling helps us for certain degrees of congestion, but for exact science, that is for the criticism of [...] "fine" [...] art, we want the notation. The notation, however, is what we lack, and the verdict of the mere feeling is liable to fluctuate. In other words an imputed defect is never, at the worst, <b>disengageable,</b> or other than matter for appreciation--to come back to my claim for that felicity of the dramatist's case that his synthetic [...] "whole" [...] IS his form, the only one we have to do with. I like to profit in his company by the fact that if our art has certainly, for the impression it produces, to defer to the rise and fall, in the critical temperature, of the telltale mercury, it still hasn't to reckon with the engraved thermometer-face.|$|E
40|$|A {{vacuum system}} (20) {{includes}} an enclosure (22) having a vacuum-tight wall (26) and an internally threaded aperture (66) {{through the wall}} (26). A tip-off fitting (24) has a base (50) with a bore (52) therethrough, a hollow tube (62) fixed to the base (50) with a vacuum-tight seal, such that an interior (64) of the tube (62) is in communication with the bore (52) in the base (50), and an external thread (58) on {{the exterior of the}} base (50). The external thread (58) on the exterior of the base (50) is dimensioned to threadably engage the internal thread (68) on the aperture (66). There is a <b>disengageable</b> vacuum sealant (70) such as a layer of indium metal between the external thread (58) of the base (50) and the internal thread (68) of the aperture (66). The vacuum system (20) is evacuated through the tip-off fitting (24) and sealed by closing off the hollow tube (62). At a later time, the vacuum system can be brought to atmospheric pressure and then reseated by replacing the tip-off fitting with another tip-off fitting and repeating the evacuation and sealing...|$|E
