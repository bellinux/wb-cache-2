30|$|A {{comparison}} of diffusion coefficients {{of natural gas}} <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil,</b> saturated oil, and dead oil {{at the same pressure}} indicates that diffusion coefficients of natural gas <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil</b> are lower than that of gas <b>in</b> saturated <b>oil</b> and dead oil. For example, the diffusion coefficients of natural gas <b>in</b> dead <b>oil</b> are 3.02 and 4.02 times than that of gas <b>in</b> saturated <b>oil</b> and foamy oil when the pressure is 20  MPa. This is the reason why the cumulative diffusion volume of gas <b>in</b> dead <b>oil</b> is larger than that of gas <b>in</b> saturated <b>oil</b> and foamy oil.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the downward slide <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> prices in the 1980s.

30|$|Pressure had an {{important}} effect on gas diffusion <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil,</b> saturated oil, and dead oil. The cumulative diffusion volumes and gas contents of {{the three types of}} oil increased with an increase in pressure. For gas diffusion <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil,</b> the cumulative diffusion volume at 20  MPa was 4.8 times of that at 8.65  MPa when the diffusion time was 35.22  h. The cumulative diffusion volumes of gas <b>in</b> dead <b>oil</b> were larger than that <b>in</b> saturated <b>oil</b> and foamy oil at the same pressure and time. When the dissolution time was 35.22  h, the cumulative dissolution volume of gas <b>in</b> dead <b>oil</b> was 1.43 times larger than that <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil,</b> indicating that natural gas has a better diffusion capacity <b>in</b> dead <b>oil</b> than <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil.</b> However, the gas content <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil</b> was higher than that <b>in</b> saturated <b>oil</b> and dead oil. For example, when the dissolution time and pressure were 35.22  h and 20  MPa, the gas content <b>in</b> foamy <b>oil</b> was 1.11 and 16.93 times higher than that <b>in</b> saturated <b>oil</b> and dead oil. This increase is because of the foamy oil system which is a non-equilibrium system and has an amount of trapped gas and solution gas. For this reason, it is harder for natural gas to diffuse into foamy oil.|$|R

5|$|The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, {{formed in}} 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, {{operated}} in the copper market as OPEC does <b>in</b> <b>oil,</b> though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, {{was never a}} member; it was dissolved in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> production led to a dramatic rise <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
