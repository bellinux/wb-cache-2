5|$|Meanwhile, Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon) discovers a {{communication}} burst {{coming from the}} North Sea, believing a Russian submarine is entering British waters unannounced {{to carry out a}} mission. After learning that Alexander Beletsky (Georg Nikoloff), a man with connections to Kachimov, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> down his company's servers, Malcolm confirms his suspicions; the Russians are planning a cyber attack against Britain by breaking into a submarine communications cable and shutting down every computer system in the country. Harry urges Dolby to temporarily shut down the Internet, but is once again denied. Later, Ros breaks into Lucas' flat while he is away, and discovers Lucas is a double agent, feeding the Russians news that MI5 know about their planned attack. Ros tasers Lucas and brings him back to Thames House. Lucas admits he is spying for the Russians because Kachimov promised he would be released from prison sooner if he would, but also reveals he intends to bring Kachimov down by making him trust Lucas.|$|E
2500|$|Carey {{attributed}} his subdued {{reaction to}} the perfect bid by saying, [...] "Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. ... I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show {{was never going to}} air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I thought they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> us down, and I thought I was {{going to be out of}} a job." [...] Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the CBS 1980s game show Press Your Luck, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2013, the Yakima Herald {{reported}} that the Yakima Research Station was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shut</b> down at some unspecified {{time in the future}} with its function moving to a facility in Colorado. The office of Congressman Doc Hastings, in whose district the facility is located, was notified by the NSA in summer 2012 that the facility was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shut</b> down. This was subsequently confirmed, with the Navy posting an OPNAV notice of closure. The functions of the facilities will be moved to the Aerospace Data Facility at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado and result in the loss of 100 or more jobs from the Yakima area. According to James Bamford, the facility's focus on satellite communications led to its closure. [...] "That’s history now", said Bamford in 2013. [...] "Cyberspace and supercomputers are the frontier." ...|$|R

50|$|Memory-disk {{synchronisation}} is {{a process}} used in computers that immediately writes to disk any data queued for writing in volatile memory. Data is often held in this way for efficiency's sake, since writing to disk is a much slower process than writing to RAM. Disk synchronization is needed when the computer is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shut</b> down, or occasionally if a particularly important bit of data has just been written.|$|R

50|$|In 1962, at {{the height}} of {{television}} popularity and decline in moviegoing, DePatie was informed that the cartoon studio was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shut</b> down. Shortly afterwards when Warner Bros. Cartoons closed down in 1963, significant production changes occurred for new Warner Bros. cartoons produced by the newly formed DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. DePatie received on-screen production credit and music composer/cartoon director Friz Freleng was promoted to producer. Chuck Jones left for Tom and Jerry theatricals and television adaptations. Character appearances were limited to Granny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Sylvester, Speedy Gonzales, Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, The Goofy Gophers, and Witch Hazel. Production was subcontracted to Format Films.|$|R
