40|$|The resource-based view of {{the firm}} (which was {{launched}} decades ago) betted on resources, capabilities and competencies {{in order to obtain}} sustainable competitive advantage. Firm management had to identify the core competencies that defined the entity and then to manage them efficiently and with efficiency. Recently, some major challenges occur, bringing with them a whole series of opportunities and threats. On one hand is the process of continuous globalization – which forces firms to globally search and compete for global competitiveness. On the other hand, is the process of transition to a knowledge-based economy – which forces firms to think differently about their intangible assets and human resources related competencies. So, at least two major shifts have to take place: form the resource-based management to competency-based management, and from cultural specific competencies to global competencies. These changes ask for a completely new strategic management approach. By this paper, we would like to revise the existing literature in the field (which is very <b>fragmentary),</b> in <b>order</b> to draw and launch after that a unique discussion framework, able to bring together all the above-mentioned aspects...|$|R

50|$|On 12 February 1935, {{the repair}} process was still {{incomplete}} when, returning to Sunnyvale from fleet maneuvers, the Macon {{ran into a}} storm off Point Sur, California. During the storm, the ship {{was caught in a}} wind shear which caused structural failure of the unstrengthened ring (17.5) to which the upper tailfin was attached. The fin failed to the side and was carried away. Pieces of structure punctured the rear gas cells and caused gas leakage. The commander, acting rapidly and on <b>fragmentary</b> information, <b>ordered</b> an immediate and massive discharge of ballast. Control was lost and, tail heavy and with engines running full speed ahead, the Macon rose past the pressure height of 2800 ft, and kept rising until enough helium was vented to cancel the lift, reaching an altitude of 4850 ft. It took 20 minutes to descend and, settling gently into the sea, the Macon sank off Monterey Bay. Only two crew members were lost thanks to the warm conditions and the introduction of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the Akron tragedy. Radioman 1st Class Ernest Edwin Dailey jumped ship while still too high above the ocean surface to survive the fall and Mess Attendant 1st Class Florentino Edquiba drowned while swimming back into the wreckage to try to retrieve personal belongings. An officer was rescued when Commander Wiley swam to his aid, an action for which he was later decorated.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{important}} and admirable {{characteristic of the}} FDG framework is that it takes very seriously the fact that utterances are produced and understood in context. Given this fact, {{the aim of the}} present paper is to articulate, in more detail than hitherto, how context may be treated and described within FDG, and to provide FDG with a more comprehensive contextual framework than has previously been available. At the beginning of the paper some general principles of context are established. It is then shown how context may be internally categorised, to reveal a complex multidimensional structure. In the light of this, {{a modified version of the}} FDG framework is proposed. The proposed model is then applied to the functional description of some aspects of Modern English, with a view to showing how the application of the framework enables a more analytical and perspicuous description of the pragmatics involved. The areas illustrated are constituent <b>order,</b> <b>fragmentary</b> text, clauses with unexpressed elements, and the inferencing of information. It is concluded that the framework makes possible a more exact and detailed treatment of the role played by context in language-use than would otherwise be feasible...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} tension and compression for softwood along grain direction shows the linear influence of wood density on the tensile and compression failure stress. For other directions determined by grain angles 25 °, 45 °, 90 ° for compression and 30 °, 45 ° and 90 ° for tension {{the influence of}} density on failure stress was not shown. The investigation into the damaged structure of wood allows identification of {{the correlation between the}} tensile and compression failure stress and various failure mechanisms occurring for these grain angles. In the work the author proposed a new approach to description of failure stresses of the anisotropic materials. Usually this problem is solved {{on the basis of the}} formulated criteria for plane or complex stress states. Nonetheless the description of failure stresses may be formed by mutually compatible <b>fragmentary</b> descriptions. In <b>order</b> to describe the tensile and compression failure stress the objects formed on the basis of the unit objects of second and fourth rank tensors were used. The four models based on these objects or field of these objects in the form of the second degree monomials were used to determine the failure surface of normal stresses versus grain angle and density. The density was introduced to descriptions by dependence of model parameters on density using the least square estimation...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} the big {{challenges}} of modern medicine. The manifestations of cancer are manifold, and the knowledge of the etiology of cancer is still <b>fragmentary.</b> In <b>order</b> to understand the disease, the complete molecular apparatus and the whole signal transduction network of the cell must be analysed. Tumor invasion is one specific topic in the vast field of cancer research. It investigates the intra- and extracellular mechanisms that define the migratory properties of a cancer cell and lead to invasion and destruction of the surrounding tissue. In a healthy human tissue, cells are connected one to another by adhesive molecules. Loss of the adhesion results in the migration of single cells and the infiltration of neighboring tissues. This {{is part of a larger}} phenomenon known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), during which cells lose their epithelial markers and start to act as if they were mesenchymal cells. The cellular program that determines this transition is similar to that active during developmental processes such as gastrulation or neurulation. Alternatively, cells can maintain contact with their neighbors and invade as a cell sheet. This so-called collective cell invasion is characterized by a specialization of the cells of the invasive margin. This invasion pattern usuall yis independent from EMT. In this study, we investigated both EMT-dependent single cell invasion and EMT-independent collective cell invasion. We show that the loss of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin induces single cell invasion, which is accompanied by the upregulation of p 120 -catenin, an adaptor molecule, and the C-terminal fragment of N-cadherin, another cell adhesion molecule. In contrast, the expression of podoplanin, a small mucin-like transmembrane protein, promotes collective cell invasion. E-cadherin is maintained at the cell membrane, and ezrin, another adaptor protein, is phosphorylated. In addition, members of the small GTPase family, including RhoA, Rac and Cdc 42, are downregulated. A second major topic in cancer research is the herapy of cancer. the aim is to develop drugs that selectively trrget cancer cells. this is either done by targeting drugs to a specific marker that is only expressed on cancer and not on healthy cells, or by developing compounds that selectively inhibit molecular pathways active in cancer cells. In the second part of this study we show that the glucagon-like-peptide- 1 (GLP 1) receptor is selectively upregulated by malignant [beta]-cells of tha Langerhans islets. With the help of a specific ligand, radionuclides can be targeted to the transformed [beta]-cells. We labeled the ligand with " 111 -Indium," a [gamma]- and Auger-emitter. Using the [gamma]-component, we performed single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), combined with conventional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Through this technique, we could detect tumors of 1 mm in diameter. The Auger-component has a therapeutic effect, and after the injection of 29 MBq in a mouse model of human insulinoma, the tumer mass was reduced by more than 94...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} and {{dynamics of the}} last British–Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) have hitherto largely been reconstructed from onshore and shallow marine glacial geological and geomorphological data. This reconstruction has been problematic because these sequences and data are spatially and temporally incomplete and <b>fragmentary.</b> In <b>order</b> to enhance BIIS reconstruction, we present a compilation of new and previously published ice-rafted detritus (IRD) flux and concentration data from high-resolution sediment cores recovered from the NE Atlantic deep-sea continental slope adjacent to the last BIIS. These cores are situated adjacent to the full latitudinal extent of the last BIIS and cover Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 2 and 3. Age models are based on radiocarbon dating and graphical tuning of abundances of the polar planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral (% Nps) to the Greenland GISP 2 ice core record. Multiple IRD fingerprinting techniques indicate that, at the selected locations, most IRD are sourced from adjacent BIIS ice streams except in the centre of Heinrich (H) layers in which IRD shows a prominent Laurentide Ice Sheet provenance. IRD flux data are interpreted with reference to a conceptual model explaining the relations between flux, North Atlantic hydrography and ice dynamics. Both positive and rapid negative mass balance can cause increases, and prominent peaks, in IRD flux. First-order interpretation of the IRD record indicates {{the timing of the}} presence of the BIIS with an actively calving marine margin. The records show a coherent latitudinal, but partly phased, signal during MIS 3 and 2. Published data indicate that the last BIIS initiated during the MIS 5 / 4 cooling transition; renewed growth just before H 5 (46 ka) was succeeded by very strong millennial-scale variability apparently corresponding with Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) cycles closely coupled to millennial-scale climate variability in the North Atlantic region involving latitudinal migration of the North Atlantic Polar Front. This indicates that the previously defined “precursor events” are not uniquely associated with H events but are part of the millennial-scale variability. Major growth of the ice sheet occurred after 29 ka with the Barra Ice Stream attaining a shelf-edge position and generating turbiditic flows on the Barra–Donegal Fan at ∼ 27 ka. The ice sheet reached its maximum extent at H 2 (24 ka), earlier than interpreted in previous studies. Rapid retreat, initially characterised by peak IRD flux, during Greenland Interstadial 2 (23 ka) was followed by readvance between 22 and 16 ka. Readvance during H 1 was only characterised by BIIS ice streams draining central dome(s) of the ice sheet, and was followed by rapid deglaciation and ice exhaustion. The evidence for a calving margin and IRD supply from the BIIS during Greenland Stadial 1 (Younger Dryas event) is equivocal. The timing of the initiation, maximum extent, deglacial and readvance phases of the BIIS interpreted from the IRD flux record is strongly supported by recent independent data from both the Irish Sea and North Sea sectors of the ice sheet...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} is {{an important}} feature of COPD. This inflammatory response is not restricted to the local compartment - including airways, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature - but is also present in the circulation. However, {{the origin of the}} systemic inflammation present in COPD patients remains still to be elucidated. In Chapter 3 and 4, we investigated the relationship between the local inflammatory response in the respiratory organ and systemic inflammation in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD. We assessed airway inflammation using induction of sputum by inhalation of hypertonic saline, which is a safe, non-invasive, and reproducible method to determine cell counts and protein concentrations in the airway compartment of subjects. In Chapter 3, levels of sTNF-receptors, TNF-a, and IL- 8 in induced sputum and plasma were compared between COPD patients and healthy smokers. COPD patients appeared to have significantly higher percentages of neutrophils and levels of sTNF-receptors and IL- 8 in induced sputum as compared to healthy smokers. These parameters highly correlated {{with each other and with}} the degree of airflow limitation. In contrast, sputum TNF-a levels were similar in both groups. When comparing levels of inflammatory mediators in sputum and plasma, no direct correlations were found. In addition, sputum levels of sTNF-receptors were related with degree of airflow limitation in the COPD group, whereas plasma levels were not. These observations suggests that the systemic inflammatory response in COPD is not due to an overflow of inflammatory mediators from the local compartment, but that the inflammatory processes in the local and systemic compartment are differently regulated. In Chapter 4, levels of three major acute-phase reactants -AGP, CRP, and LBP- were assessed in induced sputum and plasma of COPD patients and healthy smokers. Sputum levels of AGP and LBP were significantly increased in COPD patients versus healthy smokers, and inversely correlated with the FEV 1 values in COPD. In contrast, sputum CRP was not different between the study groups. In plasma, LBP was markedly elevated in COPD patients versus healthy smokers, whereas circulating levels of AGP and CRP tended to be increased in COPD. In contrast to sputum, AGP and LBP in plasma were positively related to the FEV 1 values. Exploring the relationship between local and systemic acute-phase response, no direct relations, which suggests that acute-phase reactants in sputum may be due to local production rather than leakage from the systemic compartment. FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION THE LOCAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN COPD PATIENTS Increased levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been found in association with COPD. However, overall fundamental questions regarding the specific role inflammatory mediators and mechanisms of inflammatory cell recruitment in COPD are still remaining because our knowledge about chronic inflammation is still <b>fragmentary.</b> In <b>order</b> to get insight in the underlying mechanisms of the chronic inflammation in COPD, we further characterized the local inflammatory response. As indicated above, COPD patients had levels of sTNF-receptors, in particular sTNF-R 55, in induced sputum as compared to healthy smokers (Chapter 3). In addition, increased levels of AGP and LBP were demonstrated in COPD sputum as compared to controls (Chapter 4). Our data on smoking cessation (Chapter 3) suggest an ongoing inflammation in airways and circulation of COPD patients after smoking cessation. Leptin, initially discovered as a regulator of food intake and energy expenditure, is emerging as a pleiotropic cytokine involved in immune and inflammatory responses. In Chapter 5, we focused on the role of leptin as proinflammatory mediator in the local inflammatory response in COPD. Leptin was detectable in induced sputum of male COPD patients. Sputum leptin showed a strong positive correlation with sputum levels of CRP and TNF-a, whereas leptin was inversely related to sTNF-receptors in sputum. These correlations may indicate that leptin is involved in the local inflammatory response in COPD. In Chapter 6, we paid attention to on another aspect of the local inflammatory response, that is the proteinase-anti-proteinase imbalance in COPD. MMPs are suggested to play a critical role in the development and progression of COPD, but quantitative data on MMP activity in airways are lacking. Using specific immuno-capture assays that allow determination of both active and potentially activatable (total) MMPs, we compared activity of MMP- 1, MMP- 8, and MMP- 9 in sputum of COPD patients and healthy smokers. COPD patients appeared to have increased sputum activity of MMP- 8 and MMP- 9, whereas MMP- 1 activity was not increased. MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 (active and total) were strongly correlated, and were related to the absolute number of neutrophils in both study groups. In addition, an inverse correlation between MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 activity in sputum and airflow obstruction (FEV 1) was found in the combined study groups. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong positive staining for MMP- 9 in both alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, whereas specific staining for MMP- 8 was exclusively observed in neutrophils. The presence of increased MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 activity in the airways of COPD patients supports the concept of an impaired proteinase-anti-proteinase imbalance in COPD. THE EFFECTS OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC LPS EXPOSURE TO THE LUNG IN MICE Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is ubiquitously present as contaminant on airborne particles, including air pollution and organic dusts. Chronic exposure to significant levels of LPS was reported to be associated with the development and/or progression of many types of lung diseases, including COPD. Recently, bioactive LPS was demonstrated to be present at high levels in cigarette smoke. Since long-term cigarette smoking is the major environmental factor that predisposes patients to COPD, LPS present in cigarette smoke may be a candidate to trigger smoking-induced accumulation of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli in susceptible cigarette smokers. Therefore, we performed animal studies to investigate the effects of acute and long-term LPS exposure to the lung in vivo in more detail. To study the effects of acute LPS on inflammation and tissue injury, we made use of a well-characterized murine model. Single intratracheal instillation of 5 µg LPS resulted in a rapid but transient inflammatory response, characterized by elevated TNF-a expression and a profound infiltration of neutrophils from the pulmonary vascular bed into the respiratory air spaces (Chapter 7). In addition, local LPS exposure appeared to result in early apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells independent of infiltrating neutrophils and TNF-a. This indicates that exposure of the lung to LPS not only induces pulmonary inflammation, but may also be directly involved in rapid airway injury. 	Expression of acute-phase reactants (APRs) at the site of LPS exposure may enhance the early innate immune response to injury and infection. Therefore, the effects of local LPS exposure on both pulmonary and hepatic expression of four major acute-phase proteins - SAP, AGP, LBP, and a 1 -AT - were assessed (Chapter 8). Local LPS exposure in mice resulted in a rapid increase of mRNA expression for three major APRs (a 1 -AT, AGP, and LBP) in the lung. In addition, exposure to LPS in the pulmonary compartment resulted in elevated levels of AGP, LBP, and SAP in the circulation, which was consistent with the APR expression pattern in the liver. Furthermore, the increased plasma IL- 6 levels after local LPS exposure suggest that IL- 6 acts as mediator between the pulmonary and hepatic system. As local production of APRs results in higher concentrations in the intra-alveolar compartment and shortens the time path, pulmonary expression of APRs may be more efficient than extravasation of serum APRs to control the early phase of innate immunity to injury and infection. 	In Chapter 9, the inflammatory and pathological effects of long-term LPS exposure to the lung were investigated in detail. To this end, a novel murine model in which mice were exposed to repeated intratracheal instillation of E. coli LPS was developed. Long-term LPS exposure was shown to result in chronic inflammation, characterized by peribronchial and perivascular lymphocytic aggregates (CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 19 +), parenchymal accumulation of macrophages and CD 8 + T cells, and altered cytokine expression (TNF-a, IL- 18 and IFN-g). The absence of neutrophils indicates that neutrophil infiltration is rather a transient process triggered by each LPS exposure instead of being a chronic factor. In addition, long-term LPS exposure resulted in significant airway and alveolar alterations such as increased mucus cell metaplasia in larger airways, thickening of the airway smooth muscle layer, and irreversible alveolar enlargement without proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells. Interestingly, the observed inflammatory and pathological changes in mice exposed to repeated local LPS exposure mimic important features observed in human subjects with chronic pulmonary inflammatory disorders, especially COPD. Therefore, this murine model could be applicable to dissect the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of these disease conditions. Chapter 10 comprises the general discussion of the thesis and gives implications for future investigations...|$|R
