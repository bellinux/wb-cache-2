5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue,</b> but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|Search {{teams were}} sent {{from the lower}} floors and searched the 30th floor, but did not find the missing firefighters. The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor {{and ran out of}} air in their {{self-contained}} breathing apparatus (SCBA). That team was rescued by a search team that had been placed on the roof by a <b>helicopter.</b> <b>Rescue</b> attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze.|$|E

25|$|Kippur (כיפור) is a 2000 Israeli drama war film {{directed}} by Amos Gitai. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Gitai and Marie-Jose Sanselme; based on Gitai's own {{experiences as a}} member of a <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue</b> crew during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The film stars actors Liron Levo, Tomer Russo and Uri Klauzner in principal roles.|$|E

25|$|The film {{is largely}} autobiographical, based on Gitai's own {{experiences}} {{as a member of}} a <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue</b> crew during the war. Scenes were shot with the assistance of the Israeli Defense Forces which provided much of the military equipment used in the film. Most of the characters are named after the actors who play them, with the exception of the title character, who is given only the last name Weinraub, which was Amos Gitai's family name until his father changed it to the Hebrew name Gitai.|$|E
25|$|Before leaving Camp 4 Jon Krakauer heard Weathers {{calling for}} help from his tent. Weathers' {{condition}} had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential. A <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue</b> was considered but {{was out of the}} question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter and in any case would be extraordinarily dangerous. Eventually a rescue was organised thanks to a lieutenant colonel of the Nepalese Army who conducted the second-highest known helicopter medical evacuation up to that time.|$|E
25|$|After {{flashing}} over in {{the ballroom}} (which witnesses confused with an explosion), the super-heated gases swept up the grand staircase into {{the lobby of the}} hotel. From there, the fire was drawn through the open doors of the casino by the smoke-eaters (devices in the ceiling that sucked the smoke from cigarettes out of the room) present throughout the casino. With more than 150 guests estimated to be in the casino when the fire broke out, most of the deaths occurred in that area. Several months before the fire, hotel management had had the emergency exit doors locked to prevent theft, and the only other way out was through a pair of inward-opening doors. Some people pressed against the doors to no avail. Others leaped from the second-story casino through plate-glass windows to the pool deck below; many were injured. Others died of smoke inhalation on upper floors of the casino. Still others were killed as they rode the elevators to the lobby, only to discover their path blocked by the fire when the doors opened. Those who were able to do so climbed to the hotel's roof, where an improvised <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue,</b> including civilian, Commonwealth Police, Puerto Rico National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Navy helicopters from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station, transported people to safety.|$|E

500|$|Sydneys second patrol {{began on}} 18 October, with her {{aircraft}} involved in strikes against North Korean units, coastal shipping, railway bridges, and other supply routes. They also performed their first {{close air support}} mission on 21 October, providing cover for the 1st Commonwealth Division. Two Sea Furies were shot down on 25 October; both pilots escaped unharmed. The next day, during a moderately successful strike involving five RAN aircraft against a railway tunnel, a Firefly was shot down [...] inland, deep inside North Korean territory. There were doubts that a rescue helicopter could reach the crash site and return safely, as {{it was at the}} extreme limit of helicopter range and some of the return flight would occur after dark. Despite this, Uncle Peter's USN aircrew volunteered to try, and after the observer was quickly taught how to use an Owen submachine gun, the helicopter launched at 1622 hours. The four RAN aircraft provided cover for the two downed personnel until they were ordered to return to the carrier; two of the Fireflies met Uncle Peter at 1715 hours, and turned around to escort the helicopter. At 1733 hours, Uncle Peter arrived at the crash site and collected the RAN aircrew, with covering fire provided by the escorting Fireflies and the helicopter's observer. All three aircraft were at extreme fuel limits on their return: the two Fireflies barely made it back to Sydney, while Uncle Peter arrived at Kimpo airfield at 1830 hours and had to land with the aid of truck headlights. The rescue was the longest <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue</b> transit over North Korean territory during the war, and Sikorsky pilot received both the British Distinguished Service Medal and the United States Navy Cross: the only instance of these two medals being awarded to the same person for the same action. Sydney was relieved by USS Rendova on 27 October and returned to Kure.|$|E

The <b>helicopter,</b> <b>Rescue</b> 111, was destroyed by fire and all four crew were killed. The AAIU's report blamed {{the lack of an}} air traffic controller in Waterford at the time, inadequate weather reports, faulty approach lighting to the airport runway, the fact that the Air Corps crew undertook the rescue mission even though they had never flown in similar conditions (and had already completed 15 hours flying that day) and an unnecessary delay at the rescue scene, caused by the use of an inadequate lifeboat although a fully equipped one was available.|$|E
2500|$|MRCC Turku {{handed over}} the {{operational}} responsibility to MRCC Göteborg at 21:58 and shortly afterwards Herakles-Bulk requested the evacuation of the remaining crew.

When OH-HVG arrived on the scene at 22:45, it was decided to lift the remaining crew members, the chief officer, the second officer and the second engineer, from the sea due to the large motions of the drifting combination. Herakles-Bulk was just two cable lengths (...) from the Grundkallen lighthouse when the captain left the ship. As he and the Finnish rescue swimmer were engulfed by a wave, the cable was severed and both men had to be rescued by the Swedish helicopter.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the return}} flight, Risner's wingman, 1st Lt. Joseph Logan, was struck in his fuel tanks by {{anti-aircraft}} fire over Antung. In {{an effort to}} help him reach Kimpo, Risner attempted to push Logan's aircraft by having him shut down his engine and inserting the nose of his own jet into the tailpipe of Logan's, an unprecedented and untried maneuver. The object of the maneuver was to push Logan's aircraft to the island of Cho Do off the North Korean coast, where the Air Force maintained a <b>helicopter</b> <b>rescue</b> detachment. Jet fuel and hydraulic fluid spewed out from the damaged Sabre onto Risner's canopy, obscuring his vision, and turbulence kept separating the two jets. Risner was able to re-establish contact and guide the powerless plane out over the sea until fluids threatened to stall his own engine. Near Cho Do, Logan bailed out after calling to Risner, [...] "I'll see you at the base tonight." [...] Although Logan came down close to shore and was a strong swimmer, he became entangled in his parachute shrouds and drowned. Risner shut down his own engine in an attempt to save fuel, but eventually his engine flamed out and he glided to a deadstick landing at Kimpo.|$|E
