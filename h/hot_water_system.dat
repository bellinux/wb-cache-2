Leamington became a popular spa resort attracting the wealthy and famous, and construction began of numerous Georgian townhouses to accommodate visitors, and a town hall was built in 1830.

40|$|Water heating {{accounts}} for 23 % of residential energy consumption in Australia, and, as over half {{is provided by}} electric water heaters, is {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Due to inclusion in rebate schemes heat pump <b>water</b> heating <b>systems</b> are becoming increasingly popular, but do they result in lower greenhouse gas emissions? This study follows on from a previous life cycle assessment study of domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> to include heat pump systems. The streamlined life cycle assessment approach used focused on the use phase of the life cycle, which was found in the previous study to be where the majority of global warming potential (GWP) impacts occurred. Data was collected from an Australian heat pump manufacturer and was modelled assuming installation within Australian climate zone 3 (AS/NZS 4234 : 2011). Several scenarios were investigated for the heat pumps including different sources of electricity (grid, photovoltaic solar modules, and batteries) and the use of solar thermal panels. It was found that due to their higher efficiency heat pump <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> can result in significantly lower GWP than electric storage <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems.</b> Further, solar thermal heat pump systems can have lower GWP than solar electric <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> that use conventional electric boosting. Additionally, the contributions of HFC refrigerants to GWP can be significant so the use of alternative refrigerants is recommended. Heat pumps combined with PV and battery technology can achieve the lowest GWP of all domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The options suggested for restoration of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply <b>systems</b> in cities and settlements of Ukraine are the following: complete replacement of failed networks with new pre-insulated plastic pipelines; refusal from external networks of centralized <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply <b>systems</b> and a central heat point with the installation of individual heat points in each house; decentralization of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply <b>systems</b> by installing electric water heaters. A technical and economic comparison of these options is carried out, and the advantages and disadvantages of each option are considered. The arrangement of a set of individual heat points instead of one central point cannot be considered as the recommended method, because of the need for large additional costs for the reconstruction of heating, water supply and electricity supply systems.
