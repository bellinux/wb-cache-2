5000|$|Associative {{economics}} {{is a term}} used variously by different people around the world. For some of these the work of Austrian philosopher and social thinker Rudolf Steiner is a reference. Steiner gave a course of lectures in 1922 in which he set out his view that {{with the advent of}} global economy, the science of economics would need to take a further step, which included an elaboration of the economic process, a more precise monetary analysis, and a clearer understanding of how, through the division of labour, the associative basis of economic life becomes apparent. Associative economics emphasizes the development of conscious coordination of producers, <b>distributors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers.</b> It understands the global economy as a single unified domain, through which human beings meet one another's needs. It is called [...] "associative economics" [...] because its goal is an economic sector which is managed by associations of business corporations (industry associations) and consumer associations instead of by the Invisible Hand of the blind market (capitalist economics) and instead of by the government (socialist economics).|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the keyboard, processing, computer graphics and interactive pen borrowed from Furse's synthesizer, a QWERTY keyboard {{was added to the}} design and a large one-by-1.5-by-three foot box stored the central processing unit. According to a magazine feature about the Fairlight company, the short length of each sample, which commonly lasted from a half of to an entire second, was the computer's biggest problem; it could only handle a sample rate of 24 kilohertz and a frequency response of ten kilohertz at most, so a sample rate had to be as low as eight kilohertz and a bandwidth of 3,500 hertz for sounds of longer length to be used. However, Vogel has said that the low quality of the sounds was what gave them their own character. Its Music Composition Language feature was also frequently criticized, with reviewers calling it too difficult for empirical users. Other primitive aspects included its limited amount of RAM (208 kilobytes) and its green and black graphics. Nonetheless, the CMI garnered significant attention from Australian <b>distributors</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> for being able to emulate sounds of acoustic instruments, as well as for its light pen and three-dimensional sound visualization. Still, Vogel was unsure if there would be enough interest in the product. The CMI's ability to emulate real instruments made some refer to it as an [...] "orchestra-in-a-box", and each unit came with eight-inch, 500-kilobyte floppy disks that each stored twenty-two samples of orchestral instruments. The Fairlight CMI also garnered publicity in the science industry, being featured on the BBC science and technology series Tomorrow's World; given that futuristic theories of poor-sounding digital orchestras were also being made, Musicians' Union railed against the CMI who called it a [...] "lethal threat" [...] towards its members.|$|E

Given this context, in this study the authors present tools to analyze an overview of the TV networks in Brazil, in a broad and critical manner, using Ecosystem Analysis to compare the reactions of these firms and of adjacent industries to technological progress over two different time frames: the 1980 s and the present. Thus, using metrics drawn from the concepts of Iyer, Lee and Venkatraman (2006) and the complementary metrics that they proposed (Relative Density, the Number of Pathways between Content <b>and</b> <b>Consumer,</b> <b>and</b> Distance between Content <b>Distributor</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumer),</b> the authors outline and analyze the ecosystem to which the Brazilian open-signal TV networks belong. This survey shows that the Brazilian TV networks have been losing influence not only in their own industry, but also in related sectors. This might jeopardize their competitiveness and their capacity to react to a constantly changing world in a relatively near future...|$|R
