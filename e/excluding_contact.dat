They occur in about 2 % of treatment courses and are commoner in women, the elderly and in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syn-drome (AIDS), especially from sulphonamides such as in co-trimoxa-zole 1. Drugs most often incriminated are listed in Table 1. The prevalence of a history of penicillin allergy has been estimated as up to 10 %, and reactions to sulphonamides may affect 5 % of those treated.

The distribution of orbital periods in turn results in many of these planets being the occupants of the Habitable Zone of their host stars. Here we show that a conclusion of prevalent life in the universe presents a serious danger due to the risk of spreading Spontaneous Necro-Animation Psychosis (SNAP), or Zombie-ism. We quantify the extent of the danger posed to Earth through the use of the Zombie Drake Equation and show how this serves as a possible explanation for the Fermi Paradox.

40|$|The {{incremental}} {{acceptance of}} laparoscopic surgery by today’s surgeons has paralleled {{in many ways}} the grudging acceptance of antisepsis first proposed by Joseph Lister a century ago. Lister had been interested in wound infection, or “hospital gangrene ” as it was known then, for many years. When operating on tuberculous changes in the wrist, he noted good results when the wound did not become infected. On the other hand, when infection set in, he encountered a high incidence of gangrene and blood poisoning. 1 In Lister’s time, wound infection was generally thought to arise from a chemical reaction between oxygen in the atmosphere and exposed tissues. Others of his day believed, with even less scientific basis, that infection was due to a “miasma ” in the air. Wounds, consequently, were very tightly bandaged in order to <b>exclude</b> <b>contact</b> with air. Of course, this warm, sequestered area was an ideal environment for bacterial growth. Puzzled by the seemingly capricious occurrences of gangrene, Lister experimented with frogs and concluded that the process of rotting and gangrene were linked. In some way, both involved “decomposition ” of organic matter. In 1865, Thomas Anderson, a chemistry professor and friend of Lister’s, advised him to read a paper by Louis Pasteur.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} medial longitudinal arch (MLA) posture and dynamic plantar contact area following {{the application of}} augmented low-Dye (ALD) tape during walking and running. Methods: Eighteen asymptomatic subjects (mean age 27 ± 7. 8 years) with a navicular drop greater than 10 mm were studied. MLA height standardised to foot length was measured {{before and after the}} application of tape. Subjects then walked and jogged taped and non-taped over an EMED-SF floor mounted force platform. The plantar surface of the foot was divided into six regions with the toes <b>excluded.</b> <b>Contact</b> area (CA) and Lateral-Medial Area Indices (LMAI) were calculated for each region. Results: Compared to the no-tape control condition, the MLA increased significantly after the application of tape (p = 0. 000). Contact area was reduced in the medial and lateral rearfoot during jogging (p = 0. 001 and 0. 005, respectively) and the medial rearfoot during walking (p = 0. 004) following tape. There was no significant mean difference between the taped and control conditions for mean Lateral-Medial Area Indices. Conclusion: Whilst the ALD tape changed foot posture by providing an anti-pronation effect, minimal changes were noted in CA or LMAI after tape application.

We cut out scenes from a real match, including corner kicks, kick-offs, free kicks, and throw-ins. In Experiment 1, we conceptually replicated the design of Strickland and Keil (2011) and presented the participants with (1) the complete sequences (i.e., including the contact moment), (2) an incomplete causal sequence (i.e., <b>excluding</b> the ball <b>contact),</b> or (3) an incomplete non-causal sequence (i.e., <b>excluding</b> the ball <b>contact</b> with a non-logical follow-up; example sequence: player about {{to throw the ball}} in – cut – a different player being fouled). However, note that our restricted sample of experts did not allow us to run a between-subject design as was done in the original study. To ensure that our design would not alert the participants to the purpose of the event, we left out one condition: a visible ball contact that was followed by a non-causal scene. In Experiment 2, we further controlled the design by showing video clips that either included or <b>excluded</b> a ball <b>contact.</b> Participants were fully informed about the probabilities of each clip type occurring (50 %) and were given a forced choice of the two alternatives (ball contact seen: yes or no). The latter inevitably brought in the aspect of attentional control by “knowing what to look for”; however, it helped us to understand further at which point of information processing the bias has its origin. We are aware, however, that our (or any) design {{may not be able to}} grasp the fine line between perception, memory, and post-perceptual judgment.
