50|$|In many models, the inflationary {{phase of}} the Universe's {{expansion}} lasts forever {{in at least some}} regions of the Universe.

5|$|Amanita exitialis {{is similar}} to A.bisporigera, a species {{originally}} described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States. In comparison to A.exitialis, A.bisporigera differs by its lower placement of the ring on the stem, smaller spores (typically 8–9.5 by 7–8.5µm), and different structure of the volva. American specimens of A.bisporigera have more abundant <b>inflated</b> cells than that of A.exitialis. Two other white Asian species, A.oberwinklerana and A.subjunquillea var. alba also resemble A.exitialis, but are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs <b>inflated</b> by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are <b>inflated.</b> The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E

They nevertheless leave a distinct imprint on the mixed state. Analytic continuation allows us, in principle, to recover a large amount of nonperturbatively defined information about the <b>inflating</b> regime.

40|$|In many anuran species, males vocalize {{to attract}} females but will grasp any female that comes within reach and retain their hold unless {{displaced}} by a rival male. Thus, female anurans may face strong selection to repel unwanted suitors, but no mechanism {{is known for}} doing so. We suggest that a defensive trait (the ability to <b>inflate</b> the body to ward off attack) has been coopted for this role: by <b>inflating</b> their bodies, females are more difficult for males to grasp and hence, {{it is easier for}} another male to displace an already amplexed rival. <b>Inflating</b> a model female cane toad (Bufo marinus) strongly reduced a male's ability to maintain amplexus; and females who were experimentally prevented from <b>inflating</b> their bodies experienced no successful takeovers from rival males, in contrast to control females. Thus, the ability of a female cane toad to <b>inflate</b> her body may allow her to manipulate the outcome of male-male competition. This overlooked mechanism of anuran mate choice may reflect a common evolutionary pattern, whereby females co-opt defensive traits for use in sexual selection. © 2010 The Royal Society...|$|R
5|$|In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly {{increased}} government purchases of silver. The government pledged {{to stand behind}} the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold. Pursuant to this promise, government gold reserves dwindled over the following three years. Although the economic Panic of 1893 {{had a number of}} causes, President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act to be a major factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an <b>inflated</b> currency—the gold standard was deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in <b>inflated</b> currency.|$|E
