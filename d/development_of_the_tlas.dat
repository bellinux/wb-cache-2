30|$|Domain {{decomposition}} {{techniques are}} widely used to solve PDEs since 1980 ’s. This kind of techniques attracts much attention, since it is portable and easy to be parallelized on parallel machines. It {{has been applied to}} solve various linear and nonlinear variational inequality problems, and the numerical results show that it is efficient, see, for example, [4 – 6]. It contains many algorithms, such as classical additive Schwarz method (AS), multiplicative Schwarz method (MS), restricted additive Schwarz method (RAS), and so on. In [7], a variant of Schwarz algorithm, called two-level additive Schwarz algorithm (TLAS), was proposed for <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> a kind of linear obstacle problem. This method can divide the original problem into subproblems in an ‘efficient’ way. In other words, the domain is decomposed in different way at each step and <b>the</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subproblems we deal with are lower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original problem. The numerical results show that <b>the</b> <b>TLAS</b> is significant. In [8], <b>the</b> <b>TLAS</b> is extended for the nonlinear complementarity problem with an M-function. The algorithm offers a possibility of making use of fast nonlinear solvers to the subproblems, and <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial is much easier than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>TLAS.</b> Another efficient way to solve problem (1.1) is given by semismooth Newton methods (e.g., see [9, 10]). This method is attractive, because it converges rapidly from any sufficiently good initial iterate, and the subproblems are also systems of equation. An active set strategy is also an efficient way to solve discrete obstacle problems, see, for example, [11 – 13]. Based on some kind of active set strategy, the discrete obstacle problem can be reduced to a sequence of linear problems, which are then solved by some efficient methods. In this paper, we combine <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active set strategy with <b>the</b> thought <b>of</b> <b>TLAS,</b> i.e., constructing inner and outer approximation sequences to <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> LCP, and present a two-level domain decomposition algorithm. As we will see in the sequel, the main difference between the two-level domain decomposition algorithm (TLDD) and TLAS discussed in [7] lies in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> constructing <b>the</b> outer approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution. What’s more, with <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> an active set strategy, the TLDD may be easier extended to other problems, such as bilateral obstacle problem.|$|R

Method: The Comprehensive Early Childhood Parenting Questionnaire (CECPAQ) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-SE) were completed by 264 mothers <b>of</b> children between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> two and three and a half years. The children were administered <b>the</b> Bayley Scales <b>Of</b> Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley III-NL). Results: Outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pearsons product-moment correlation and multiple regression analysis showed a positive relationship between the mothers’ warmth towards the child and <b>the</b> social-emotional <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child.

Conclusion: The warmth and support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother is related to <b>the</b> emotional <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. <b>The</b> motor <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child is not related to <b>the</b> social-emotional <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child.
