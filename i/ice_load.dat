A model based on data-driven is presented here to predict the <b>icing</b> <b>load</b> of transmission line, which is available to forecast the icing disaster of it. The fitfulness, which influencing the prediction results of <b>icing</b> <b>load,</b> is analyzed and discussed in this paper. According {{to the results of}} simulation, this model has a good accuracy of prediction if the training data and prediction data are in the same icing process. If the icing process is not same but contiguous, it also can predict the degree of <b>icing</b> <b>load</b> qualitatively...|$|R

The Poisson distribution is used for the events of the propeller-ice interactions and the cumulative density function for extreme <b>ice</b> <b>loads</b> is modeled by a double exponential form (Gumbel Type). Propeller-ice interaction experiments were conducted in the ice tank at the National Research Council of Canada Institute for Ocean Technology (NRC/IOT). A model podded propeller was used for the experiments and <b>ice</b> <b>loads</b> were measured with a sixcomponent dynamometer attached to the root of the propeller blade inside the hub. Based on the experimental results, extreme values are plotted with an exceedance probability.
