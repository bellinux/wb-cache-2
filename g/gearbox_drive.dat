50|$|Electric {{drive is}} almost {{universal}} because a railroad locomotive {{is a difficult}} environment for a mechanical gearbox, as the loads vary widely from second to second as the slack action runs in and out.

Using the power split differencial drive system, the objective function of speed up Gearbox optimal design is built adopting the nonlinear constrant minimum function Fmincon from Matlab, the constraints are settled and the relevant parameters of the gearbox with the minimum volume while satisfying the transmission ratio are finally obtained. Then the optimised results is verified with single factor method. The results show that the overall volume of the gearbox is reduced by 9. 13 % after optimization...|$|E
40|$|To prevent {{failures}} of a rolling bearing in the <b>gearbox</b> <b>drive</b> system, acceleration sensors {{are used to}} detect fault-related signals of the bearing. It is a big challenge to observe and identify signals caused by bearing defects in the time domain or the frequency spectrum by a conventional Fourier analysis. The time-frequency representation of the fault-related signals implemented by the windowed Fourier transform is studied in this work. It is shown that the fault characteristic frequencies can be clearly identified in the time-frequency spectrum if a fault occurs in the bearing of the gearbox at different speeds. Otherwise, the shaft frequency and its multiples are the main harmonics in the spectrum...|$|E
40|$|A {{wind turbine}} rotor {{achieves}} optimal aerodynamic efficiency {{at a single}} tip-speed ratio (TSR). To maintain that optimal TSR and maximize energy capture in the stochastic wind environment, {{it is necessary to}} employ variable-speed operation. Conventional constant-speed wind turbines have, in the past, been converted into variable-speed turbines by attaching power electronics to the conventional induction generator and <b>gearbox</b> <b>drive</b> train. Such turbines have shown marginal, if any, improvement in energy capture over their constant-speed counterparts. These discrepancies {{have been shown to be}} the result of drive train components that are not optimized for variable-speed operation. Traditional drive trains and power electronic converters are designed to achieve maximum efficiency at full load and speed. However, the main energy producing winds operate the turbine at light load for long periods of time. Because of this, significant losses to efficiency occur. This investigation employs a quasi-static model to demonstrate the dramatic effect that component efficiency curves can have on overall annual energy capture...|$|E

40|$|While {{tremendous}} improvements {{have been}} made in the performance of modern engineered systems due to increased design cycle accuracy and testing capabilities, traditional time/use maintenance practices have not changed much. While wear longevity of many subsystem components has increased with a beneficial decrease in weight and size the margins of safety have also decreased because of greater accuracy in design analysis and improved testing techniques. In an effort to increase efficiency in use of high performance and heavy-duty systems, especially in power generation and transmission subsystems, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) has emerged as an improvement over more costly time/use maintenance practices. CBM is being enabled by the same technological (testing, modeling, analysis) improvements that have spawned increased system performance. As part of a combined experimental-theoretical analysis investigation effort related to CBM diagnostics and prognostics, an experimental gearbox failure test bed was constructed. The primary interest is the study of mechanical fault evolution in damaged rotating components that involve mechanical power transmission. As part of that same research effort a dynamics model of the system is being developed for response simulations and study of in situ mechanical dynamic fault models. Simulations of system vibratory responses will allow physical insights to be gained in vibratory measurement sensor placement and specification, dynamic system response to a fault, and fault detection signal processing algorithms. In this paper, the dynamics modeling of the <b>gearbox</b> <b>drive</b> rotor/bearing-foundation system using the Finite Element method is outlined and it’s relevance to diagnostics and prognostics is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|A {{possibility}} of applying {{the theory of}} semi-Markov (semimarkovian) processes to {{the description of the}} reliability of an automotive vehicle has been presented, with taking a passenger car as an example. In the car considered, such constructional systems (functional components) as engine with fuel, lube oil, and coolant feeding systems, clutch, <b>gearbox,</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, driving axle, steering and suspension system, braking system, electrical system, body with chassis, and measuring and monitoring equipment have been distinguished. A reliability model of the car has been developed {{in the form of a}} semi-Markov process, which is a single-state model. The set of reliability states has been built as consisting of one state of car serviceability and ten states of the functional components as specified above. A graph of changes in these states has been shown and an initial distribution and a functional matrix representing changes in the said reliability states of the car have been defined. Formulas have been derived that define the boundary distribution of the process of changes in the technical states of such a car. This distribution represents the probability of the car being serviceable and unserviceable due to a failure of any of the functional components mentioned above. The {{possibility of}} using statistics to estimate the probabilities of changes in the said car reliability states has been presented. A possibility of applying the theory of semi-Markov processes to the investigation of car reliability in the case of defining the instantaneous distribution of the process of changes in the car reliability states has also been mentioned.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research has been to develop an advanced high-speed, high performance centrifugal compressor research facility and obtain the baseline performance map. This facility utilizes a Rolls-Royce production model C 28 centrifugal compressor from the Rolls-Royce 250 turboshaft engine used on helicopters. The compressor {{is powered by a}} 1400 hp AC motor and a variable frequency drive. The high operational speed is achieved through a 30. 46 : 1 speed increasing gearbox. ^ The drive system has been designed, manufactured, and assembled into the facility, and includes a driveshaft which interfaces the gearbox to the compressor, a drive housing which encloses the driveshaft and holds two sets of oil jets used to lubricate and cool the compressor rear bearing and driveshaft splines. The drive housing also aligns the compressor to the gearbox through the use of two pilots. The lubrication and cooling system has also been designed and installed and includes a boost pump, a scavenge pump, an oil reservoir, two air-over-oil heat exchangers, and a series of regulating and relief valves to control the oil pressure throughout the system. The inlet and exhaust piping have also been designed, which includes flow conditioning at the inlet of the compressor as well as an inlet bellmouth. A throttle has also been designed to control the flow of air through the compressor as well as provide a backpressure to simulate the operating conditions in a gas turbine engine. ^ All of the instrumentation has also been designed, calibrated, and installed into the facility. Some of the measurements integrated into the facility include mass flow measurements of the inlet and bleed flows of the compressor using Venturi and orifice flow meters, respectively. Inlet and exit rakes provide total temperature and total pressure data. Oil pressure and temperature measurements are also acquired throughout the system, as well as vibration measurements through the <b>gearbox,</b> <b>drive</b> housing, and compressor to monitor the health of the facility. The data acquisition of the facility is conducted through a health monitoring and performance computer through the use of LabVIEW software. ^ Speed lines have been measured from choke to stall at corrected speeds of 30, 000 rpm to 50, 000 rpm in increments of 5, 000 rpm. Results are repeatable, and the uncertainty in all of the measurements has been established. ...|$|E
