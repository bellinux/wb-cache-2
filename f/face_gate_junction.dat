40|$|<b>Gate</b> <b>junction</b> {{temperature}} {{is presented as}} the crucial parameter for modeling thermal degradation in GaAs device reliability studies, and sufficient for modeling the impact of temperature on device terminal characteristics. Gate metal resistance thermometry (GMRT) is applied to a GaAs pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistor to measure its <b>gate</b> <b>junction</b> temperature. It is found that gate leakage current due to impact ionization can interfere with dc GMRT measurements. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, for the first time it is demonstrated that this can be largely avoided by instead applying an ac version of GMRT. However, the dynamic resistance of the gate leakage current path can interfere with ac GMRT. Measurements and thermal finite element method simulations of devices at constant power dissipation conclude that the bias dependence of the channel heat source profile affects the <b>gate</b> <b>junction</b> temperature. A parameter extraction technique is presented and used in device lifetime calculations to demonstrate MTTF variations of more than an order of magnitude (despite fixed power) due to bias-dependent self-heating. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} from the {{literature}} published on Si devices that junction field effect transistors (JFETs) can be either operated in a unipolar mode (when the <b>gate</b> <b>junction</b> bias is less than 0. 4 V) or in a bipolar mode (when the <b>gate</b> <b>junction</b> inject minority carriers into the channel/drift region to modulate its resistance) - The latter mode of operation is typically used to improve the on-state performance of normally-off JFETs. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the bipolar mode of operation of 4 H-SiC normally-on vertical JFETs. Both numerical and experimental results will be used to conclude whether the bipolar mode of operation offers any clear advantages to SiC normally-on JFETs. The influence of high temperature operation (up to 300 °C) on the on-state characteristics will also be considere...|$|R

5000|$|Junctionless {{nanowire}} transistor (JNT), {{developed at}} Tyndall National Institute in Ireland, is a nanowire-based transistor {{that has no}} <b>gate</b> <b>junction.</b> (Even MOSFET has a <b>gate</b> <b>junction,</b> although its <b>gate</b> is electrically insulated from the controlled region.) Junctions are difficult to fabricate, and, because they are {{a significant source of}} current leakage, they waste significant power and heat. Eliminating them held the promise of cheaper and denser microchips. The JNT uses a simple nanowire of silicon surrounded by an electrically isolated [...] "wedding ring" [...] that acts to gate the flow of electrons through the wire. This method has been described as akin to squeezing a garden hose to gate the flow of water through the hose. The nanowire is heavily n-doped, making it an excellent conductor. Crucially the gate, comprising silicon, is heavily p-doped; and its presence depletes the underlying silicon nanowire thereby preventing carrier flow past the gate.|$|R
