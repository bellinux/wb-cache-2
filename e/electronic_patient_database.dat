Such risk can be diminished through guideline recommend optimal medical therapy (OMT), defined as adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, blood pressure < 140 / 90 mmHg (< 130 / 80 mmHg in diabetics and renal disease patients), LDL < 2 mg/dl, smoking cessation and aerobic physical activity of 30 min a day for 3 days a week, and (in diabetics) Hemoglobin A 1 c < 7 %. AimTo estimate the rate of achieving OMT in CAD patients in Qassim Province. MethodsThis observational study enrolled 207 consecutive CAD patients seen in cardiology clinic in Prince Sultan Cardiac Center in Qassim between April 1, 2012 to May 30, 2012. Eligible participants were all documented CAD patients agreed to participate. We collected the demographic, medication, laboratory, and clinical data through in-person interviews,medical records, and an <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database.</b> ResultsOMT was achieved in only 10. 4 % of CAD patients.

Fifty two out of 129 (40. 3 %) patients had positive radiological findings while 77 (59. 7 %) did not. Eighty point seven percent (n =  42) of the radiological findings were a sexual intercourse-associated pathology and 19. 2 % (n =  10) were considered to be incidental findings. Age and male sex positively correlated with radiological imaging workup (p< 0. 001, respectively p< 0. 037). The most common sexual intercourse-associated pathology was headache attributed to cerebrovascular insult (n =  21, 40. 3 %) followed by epididymitis (n =  7, 16. 6 %) and obstructive uropathy (n =  5, 11. 6 %).

However, for ileal CD, existing data are conflicting. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the biomarker profile in CD patients with varying severity and location of mucosal ulceration. An <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database</b> search identified CD patients in whom ileocolonoscopy, fecal calprotectin (CALPRO), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood leukocyte counts (LEU) were measured within a 4 -week interval without changes in medication. Ileocolonoscopies were scored for the presence of ulcers in each segment as defined by the SES-CD and the sum of segmental ulcer scores resulted in a partial SES-CD (pSES-CD). Fourty-four patients were identified, of whom 9 / 44 had ileal CD, 20 / 44 colonic and 15 / 44 ileocolonic CD based on the Montreal classification. In the total study population CALPRO correlated best with pSES-CD (r = 0. 76, p < 0. 0001), followed by LEU (r = 0. 54, p = 0. 0004) and CRP (r = 0. 45, p = 0. 0026).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is {{the pioneer}} in trauma {{care in the}} country, being the first to create a {{dedicated}} Trauma Service in 1989. The service has not conducted a review of its admissions and mortalities since 1992. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the mortality patterns of this service. METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective 3 -year review, covering January 2004 June 2007, was conducted using an <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database.</b> Review of patient records included: population demographics, mechanism of injury, length of stay prior to death, and the cause of death. RESULTS: Of the 4947 patients admitted to the Division of Trauma during the study period, there were 231 (4. 7 %) deaths. The most common mechanisms of injuries were stab wounds (32. 9 %), vehicular crashes (28. 6 %), and gunshot wounds (25. 5 %). Multiple organ failure/Sepsis (37. 7 %) was the most frequent causes of death, followed by Exsanguinations (27. 7 %), Central Nervous System failure (18. 6 %) and other causes (10. 8 %). Forty four (66. 7 %) of the 66 patients who died within the first 24 hours died from Exsanguinations, while 66 (61. 1 %) of the 8 patients who died after 72 hours died from Multiple organ failure/Sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Intentional causes of injury (i. e. penetrating interpersonal violence) caused the majority of trauma deaths in this series from the Philippine General Hospital. This highlights the need for prioritizing a public health approach to violence prevention in the Philippines. Further research must be conducted to identify risk factors for interpersonal violence. Early identification of lethal injuries that may cause exsanguinations and definitive control of hemorrhage should be the primary focus to prevent acute deaths, within 24 hours of admission. Further adjuncts to the definitive treatment of hemorrhage, the critical care of TBI and MOF/Sepsis are needed to reduce deaths occurring more than 72 hours after admission...|$|E

Among the remaining 5, 407 patients observed, IPT had been initiated for 39 % of eligible patients. Children, male sex, advanced disease, and those in Pre-ART {{were less likely to be}} initiated on IPT. The overall TB incidence was 2. 6 per 100 person-years. As compared to those with no intervention, use of "IPT-only" (aHR = 0. 36, 95 % CI = 0. 19 - 0. 66) and "ART-only" (aHR = 0. 32, 95 % CI = 0. 24 - 0. 43) were associated with significant reduction in TB incidence rate. Combining ART and IPT had a more profound effect. Starting IPT-before-ART (aHR = 0. 18, 95 % CI = 0. 08 - 0. 42) or simultaneously with ART (aHR = 0. 20, 95 % CI = 0. 10 - 0. 42) provided further reduction of TB at ∼ 80 %. IPT was found to be effective in reducing TB incidence, independently and with concomitant ART, under programme conditions in resource-limited settings.

30|$|Our {{research}} {{attempts to}} create a computational framework for the discovery of co-occurring diseases, medications, and symptoms in COPD patients. COPD was chosen because it is tangential to many lung diseases. Clinical notes are used as the primary data source due to a potentially high yield of information.

With the emergence of <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> record <b>databases,</b> many large systems containing big data are now available. Examples of these are the Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital system and England’s National Health Service (NHS). Our methodology uses a big data approach to finding co-occurring evidence and is validated using a dataset containing approximately 64, 000 instances. Due to rarity of access to databases as large as the VA system, this dataset was the largest available to our research group. However, the methodology was designed with big data techniques as the foundation. It can be employed by organizations such as the VA hospital system without scalability issues. Although an increasing number of researchers are using NLP with clinical notes as a data source [18, 19], few have explored COPD clinical notes [14] and there is no documented evidence in Google Scholar of this methodology applied to big data.|$|R

40|$|Background. The present {{retrospective}} study {{was intended to}} investigate whether working out and other low-speed sports can provoke cardiovascular, neurological, or traumatic damage. Material and Methods. Patient data from 2007 to 2013 was collected and saved at the university department of emergency medicine in an <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> record <b>database.</b> Results. Of the 138 patients included in this study, 83. 3 % (n = 115) were male and 16. 7 % female (n = 23). Most admissions were due to musculoskeletal accidents (n = 77; 55. 8 %), followed by neurological incidents (n = 23; 16. 7 %), cardiovascular incidents (n = 19; 13. 8 %), soft tissue injuries (n = 3; 2. 2 %), and others (n = 16; 11. 6 %). The {{mean age of the}} allover injured people was 36. 7 years. The majority of the patients (n = 113; 81. 9 %) were treated as outpatients; 24 (17. 4 %) were inpatients. Discussion. In Switzerland, this is the first study that describes emergency department admissions after workout and examines trauma and neurological and cardiovascular incidents. As specific injuries, such as brain haemorrhages, STEMIs, and epileptic seizures, were relatively frequent, it was hypothesised that workout with its physiological changes may be an actual trigger for these injuries, at least for a specific population.

40|$|Objective: This is a {{descriptive}} study {{of patients who}} underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring (IVEM) at Ghent University Hospital. The aim {{of the study is}} to identify predictive factors for outcome of IVEM and resective surgery (RS). These factors may optimize the patient flow following the non-invasive presurgical evaluation towards IVEM and RS or other treatments. Patients and methods: Over the past 16 years, 68 / 710 refractory epilepsy patients included in the presurgical evaluation protocol (M/F 41 / 27, mean age 33 years) underwent IVEM at Ghent University Hospital. Patient features and follow-up data were collected from the patients’ medical files and the <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database</b> at the neurology and neurosurgery department. Predictive factors for IVEM outcome were identified by comparing features of patients with a positive IVEM outcome (i. e. ictal onset zone identification) and patients with a negative IVEM outcome. Predictive factors for RS outcome were identified by comparing features of patients with Engel class I and patients with Engel class II-IV outcome. Results: In 56 / 68 patients (82 %) IVEM outcome was positive. The occurrence of a seizure-free interval in the patient's history and a non-localizing ictal scalp EEG in patients with a structural abnormality on MRI (p < 0. 05) were predictive factors for a negative IVEM outcome. 32 / 68 patients underwent RS. In 22 / 32 (70 %) patients RS resulted in an Engel class I outcome. A structural abnormality on MRI was a predictive factor for a positive RS outcome in patients in whom a focal or regional focus was resected (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: This study shows that IVEM identifies one or more ictal onset zone(s) in up to 80 % of patients. The potential of IVEM to identify the ictal onset zone is unlikely in patients with a seizure-free interval in their medical history and a non-localizing ictal scalp EEG during the non-invasive presurgical evaluation. Half of these patients underwent RS with long-term seizure freedom in 70 %. Patients with structural MRI lesions have the highest chance of seizure freedom. These findings may contribute to the optimization of patient management during both the invasive and non-invasive presurgical work-up...|$|E
40|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database</b> linking prescribes with a Dutch {{community}} pharmacy consortium was evaluated in {{a subset of}} the population of Noordwijk (11, 760 patients {{out of a total of}} 25, 600). The pharmacy database (a file of 41 disease contra-indications representing {{a subset of the}} prescribers' medical diagnosis) was studied in order to assess its value for the accurate discrimination of target patient groups within the community and for support to the pharmaceutical care of individual patients. The aim was to examine the application of the pharmacy records to pharmaceutical care, tested by measuring the accuracy of the pharmacy database to predict the community public health profile; and, more specifically, the accuracy to identify three potential target groups for pharmaceutical care. The records of patients with angina, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes (n= 1116), representing 65 % of the total pharmacy morbidity records, were studied in detail and verified by the files and texts of the prescriber's individual patient records. From samples of patients (n= 273) from the three patient groups, the extent and nature of co-morbidity, polypharmacy (drug entities prescribed annually) and drug therapy instability (prescription changes to dose or dose form annually) were characterised. Angina patients showed the most comorbidity, 46 % having three or more additional diseases; chronic respiratory disease patients showed most drug therapy instability; and insulin-dependent diabetic patients received most polypharmacy per disease. The pharmacy database predicted the prevalence of 10 of 23 relevant disease categories (representing 51 % of the total morbidity on the medical records). However, the prevalences of eight categories were underestimated and of five categories overestimated. Of the three patient groups, 73 % of patients appeared on both the pharmacy and the medical database. Of the total co-morbidity recorded for these patients, 68 % of records were common to both databases. The database discrepancies (32 %) were due to morbidity omitted (12 %) and morbidity unverified (10 %) on the pharmacy database, together with morbidity omitted from the medical database (10 %). The current pharmacy database provides a limited view of morbidity. A strategic approach to pharmaceutical care requires pharmacists and prescribers to verify and share patient information if patient groups and individuals within a group are to be usefully targeted...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} Previous {{investigation}} into antiretroviral (ARV) therapy switches in our HIV cohort suggested an annual switch rate of 20 % in 2006 with 60 % of switches being secondary to toxicity [1]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether this switch rate has changed in recent years, determine reasons why patients change regimens, and identify which ARVs are most likely to be switched for toxicity concerns. Methods The <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database</b> was reviewed to identify all patients within our HIV cohort who switched ARV therapy between 1 st December 2009 and 31 st May 2011. Details of which ARVs were switched and the reasons why were recorded. Any switches due to toxicity were investigated further to identify the actual or perceived adverse effect. Summary of results Nine hundred and twenty-three regimens were switched over 18 months affecting 12 % (n = 722) of patients on treatment during this time. The most common reason for switching medication was due to toxicity, occurring in 452 (49 %) cases. Other reasons included simplification (15 %), clinical trials (8 %), virological failure (8 %) and drug interactions (4 %). The remaining 16 % switched for various reasons including pregnancy and co-morbidities. Of 452 switches for toxicity (or perceived toxicity), 122 (27 %) were due to CNS side effects (89 out of a total of 122 were related to efavirenz), 64 (14 %) gastrointestinal disturbances (38 / 64 related to protease inhibitors), 54 (12 %) actual/perceived cardiovascular risk (21 / 54 related to abacavir and 21 / 54 related to saquinavir), 54 (12 %) hepatotoxicity (21 / 54 related to atazanavir and 14 / 54 related to efavirenz), 42 (9 %) metabolic concerns (24 / 42 related to protease inhibitors) and 38 (8 %) renal toxicity (28 / 38 related to tenofovir). Other toxicities accounted for 78 (18 %) switches. An observed toxicity switch rate (OTSR) per 1000 patient years (95 % CI) was calculated for each ARV. Conclusions 12 % of patients switched therapy in 18 months, predicting an annual switch rate of 8 %. Toxicity remained an important reason for switching. Saquinavir and lopinavir have a significantly higher OTSR than other PIs as does zidovudine compared with other NRTIs. Nevirapine has a significantly lower OTSR than other NNRTIs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes and increased duration of parenteral therapy in patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) managed with outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT). A retrospective cohort study interrogating variables recorded prospectively in an <b>electronic</b> OPAT <b>patient</b> <b>database</b> was performed. 'OPAT failure' was defined as hospitalisation following initiation of OPAT, or adverse event or progression of infection necessitating a change in antibiotic therapy. Variables associated with failure or increased duration of therapy were identified via univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. In total, 963 first patient episodes of OPAT-treated SSTIs were observed; 84 % were treated with daily ceftriaxone and 15 % with teicoplanin (three daily loading doses then three times per week). Progression of infection was observed in 2. 8 % of cases, inpatient management was required in 6 % and significant adverse events occurred in 7. 1 %. Overall OPAT success was 87. 1 %. Female sex, diabetes and treatment with teicoplanin were independently associated with OPAT failure. A significant reduction in duration of OPAT therapy was observed over time. A longer duration of intravenous therapy was associated with meticillin-resistant (MRSA), older age, vascular disease, a diagnosis of bursitis, and treatment with teicoplanin. Non-inpatient referrals, management via a nurse-led patient group direction, and treatment with ceftriaxone were associated with reduced duration of OPAT. For selected patients with SSTIs, OPAT was generally safe and effective, but specific patient groups were identified with more complex management pathways and poorer outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and evaluate methods for conducting cluster randomised trials in a primary care <b>database</b> that contains <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> records for large numbers of family practices. Cluster randomised trials are trials in which the units allocated represent groups of individuals, in this case family practices and their registered patients. Cluster randomised trials often suffer from the limitation that they include too few clusters, leading to problems of insufficient power and only imprecise estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient, a key design parameter. This difficulty might be overcome by utilising databases that already hold <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> records for large numbers of practices. The protocol describes one application: a study of antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infection; a second protocol outlines an intervention in a less frequent chronic condition of public health importance, stroke. Methods/Design The objective of the study is to implement a cluster randomised trial to test the effectiveness of an electronic record-based intervention at achieving a reduction in antibiotic prescribing at consultations for respiratory illness in patients aged 18 and 59 years old in intervention family practices as compared with controls. Family practices will be recruited from the practices that presently contribute data to the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Following randomisation, electronic prompts will be installed remotely at intervention practices to promote adherence with evidence-based standards of medical practice. The intervention was developed through qualitative research at non-intervention practices. Data for outcome assessment will be obtained from anonymised <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> records that are routinely collected into GPRD. This protocol outlines the proposed study designs, data sources, sample size requirements, analysis methods and dissemination plans. Ethical issues are also discussed.

40|$|Theme of this {{bachelor}} theses is {{the role}} of radio-diagnostic department in investigation of polytraumas. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with the characteristics of multiple traumas and trauma care that is provided in a specialized departments for the facility of multiple trauma, in traumacentres. Obligatory conditions that the traumacenters must meet to be granted the status of traumacanter are in this thesis mentioned. Another part of the theoretical part is focused to diagnostic imaging methods, specifically mentioned examination by X-ray, computer tomography, magnetic resonance, ultrasound and angiography examination. The aim of the thesis is to analyze the number of patients with polytrauma and see what radiodiagnostic examinations for these patients was performed in the hospital České Budějovice, a. s. The hypotheses of this bachelor thesis are formulated as follows: Number of patients with polytrauma is growing. Most were done CT examinations during investigation of polytrauma. The practical part provides information of the number of polytrauma, the division of patients by gender, age rating in three designated groups and radiodiagnostic tests that these patients was performed in a hospital České Budějovice, a. s. in 2011 - 2013. Data collection was performed at the radiology department at the hospital in České Budějovice from the <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database.</b> In the chapter "Results" was acquired data processed in graphs. These graphs are described in the next section "Discussion". They were completed by my own beliefs, thoughts and opinions. The results mentioned in the practical part of the thesis show that the objective has been achieved. From the polytrauma database implies that the first set hypothesis the number of patients with polytrauma is growing, wasn´t confirmed because in 2013 it was registered less patients with polytrauma than in 2011 and 2012. On the other hand, the investigation revealed that the second set hypothesis, assuming that in multiple injuries examination was used computer tomography mostly was confirmed. Computed tomography was used during examination of all patients with polytrauma registered in Hospital České Budějovice, a. s. in the mentioned period. In the chapter "Conclusion" the results are summarized. The purpose of this thesis was to prepare clear text dealing with the use of radiodiagnostic imaging methods in the examination of patients with polytrauma. Results of this work can serve as a statistical material of radiodiagnostic examination of multiple traumas to the radiology department at the hospital in České Budějovice. The theoretical part of the thesis can be used as teaching or informational materials for professionals...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Antipsychotic {{polypharmacy}} (APP) {{appears to}} be a common practice worldwide despite treatment guidelines advising against the practice for most patients in view of lack of evidence and possible risk of harm. Our study aimed to address deficiencies in local and international research by examining the current prevalence of APP in a South African context and investigating a broad range of patient, illness and treatment characteristics that may be associated with the practice. In doing so, we aimed to provide an indication of possible areas to be addressed in order to improve local mental health care practice. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of discharge records using Valkenberg Hospital's <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> <b>database.</b> We collected data on patient, illness and treatment characteristics for patients discharged on one or more antipsychotic agent from January to June 2014. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between APP and demographic and clinical variables and prescription patterns were analysed. Results: Discharge records of 565 patients were examined. The prevalence of APP in our study population was 29. 03 % (95 % CI= 25. 31 %- 32. 96 %). Analysis of demographic and clinical characteristics revealed that age> 29, male sex, diagnosis of schizophrenia compared to bipolar and substance-induced disorders, co-morbid intellectual disability, co-morbid substance use, greater number of hospital admissions and high-dose prescribing were significantly associated with APP. While highest rates of APP in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders occurred, APP was also observed in a number of patients with bipolar and substance-induced disorders. Prescription patterns demonstrated the prominent use of first-generation antipsychotics and long acting injectables in APP combinations. Patients receiving APP {{were significantly more likely to}} have anticholinergic agents and sodium valproate co-prescribed in their treatment regimen. Discussion: The prevalence of APP found in our study is fairly high in comparison with international rates. Antipsychotic prescription patterns reflect a complex interplay among patient, illness and treatment characteristics of our population. Our findings indicate that patients receiving APP may be those with greater illness severity, complexity, chronicity and treatment resistance, with complicating factors including co-morbid substance use involved. While APP is most common in patients with schizophrenia, antipsychotics may also be used in combination to manage mood and psychotic symptoms in patients with schizoaffective, bipolar and substance-induced disorders. The frequent use of long acting injectables in combinations may suggest concern over compliance in our population. The positive associations of APP with high-dose prescribing and co-prescription of anticholinergic medication contributes to concern over the safety of APP. Conclusion Our study suggests concern over current local practice in that combination antipsychotic agents were prescribed for a number of patients with a range of psychiatric diagnoses without sufficient evidence for efficacy of this practice and at possible cost of increased adverse effects. Additional research is needed examining the practice of APP across diagnoses, focusing on the multiple aspects affecting local practice and various contributing factors that could be targeted for intervention. This would be a positive step towards improving the quality of our service and providing optimal patient management in a resource-limited setting...|$|E
40|$|Air {{ambulance}} service in Norway has been upgraded {{during the last}} years. European regulations concerning pilots’ working time and new treatment guidelines/strategies have called for more resources. The objective was to describe and analyse the two supplementary air ambulance [fixed wing (FW) and rotor wing (RW) ] alternatives’ activity {{during the study period}} (2002 - 2008). Furthermore we aimed to compare our findings with reports from other north European regions. This is a retrospective analysis. The air ambulance fleet’s activity according to the <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> record <b>database</b> of “Luftambulansetjenesten ANS” (LABAS) was analysed. The subject was the fleet’s operations in northern Norway, logistics, and patients handled. Type of flight, distances, frequency, and patients served were the main outcome measures. A significant increase (45 %) in the use of RW and a shift in FW operations (less primary and more secondary) were revealed. The shift in FW operations reflected the centralisation of several health care services [i. e. percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI), trauma, and cancer surgery] during the study period. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and injuries were the main diagnoses and constituted half of all operations. CVD was {{the most common cause of}} FW operations and injuries of the RW ones. The number of air ambulance operations was 16 per 1, 000 inhabitants. This was more frequent than in other north European regions. The use of air ambulances and especially RW was significantly increased during the study period. The change in secondary FW operations reflected centralisation of medical care. When health care services are centralised, air {{ambulance service}}s must be adjusted to the new settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{meta-analysis}} was {{to explore}} whether mental representations, derived from the common-sense model of illness representations (CSM), were able to predict adherence in chronically ill <b>patients.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>databases</b> were searched for studies that used the CSM and measured adherence behaviour in chronically ill patients. Correlations from the included articles were meta-analysed using a random-size effect model. A moderation analysis was conducted {{for the type of}} adherence behaviour. The effect sizes for the different mental representations and adherence constructs ranged from − 0. 02 to 0. 12. Further analyses showed that the relationship between the mental representations and adherence did not differ by the type of adherence behaviour. The low-effect sizes indicate that the relationships between the different mental representations of the CSM and adherence are very weak. Therefore, the CSM {{may not be the most}} appropriate model to use in predictive studies of adherence...|$|R

The present article provides a systematic overview and meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing efavirenz and other active drugs currently rec-ommended for treatment of HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive <b>patients.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>databases</b> (Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Trip Database) were searched up till 23 Decem-ber 2013 for randomized controlled clinical trials published as a peer-reviewed papers, and concerning efavirenz-based regimens used as initial treatment for HIV infection. Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review, while twenty-six trials were suitable for the meta-analysis. Efavirenz was compared with drugs from four different classes: NNRTIs other than efavirenz (nevirapine or rilpivirine), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (bPI) and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR 5) antagonists (maraviroc), all of them were added to the background regimen.

40|$|PRINCIPALS: Most people enjoy sexual {{intercourse}} without complications, but a significant, if small, number need to seek emergency medical help for related health problems. The true incidence {{of these problems}} is not known. We therefore assessed all admissions to our emergency department (ED) in direct relation to {{sexual intercourse}}. METHODS: All data were collected prospectively and entered into the ED's centralised <b>electronic</b> <b>patient</b> record <b>database</b> (Qualicare, Switzerland) and retrospectively analysed. The database was scanned for the standardised key words: 'sexual intercourse' (German 'Geschlechtsverkehr') or 'coitus' (German 'Koitus'). RESULTS: A total of 445 patients were available for further evaluation; 308 (69. 0 %) were male, 137 (31. 0 %) were female. The median age was 32 years (range 16 - 71) for male subjects and 30 years (range 16 - 70) for female subjects. Two men had cardiovascular emergencies. 46 (10. 3 %) of our patients suffered from trauma. Neurological emergencies occurred in 55 (12. 4 %) patients: the most frequent were headaches in 27 (49. 0 %), followed by subarachnoid haemorrhage (12, 22. 0 %) and transient global amnesia (11, 20. 0 %). 154 (97. 0 %) of the patients presenting with presumed infection actually had infections of the urogenital tract. The most common infection was urethritis (64, 41. 0 %), followed by cystitis (21, 13. 0 %) and epididymitis (19, 12. 0 %). A sexually transmitted disease (STD) was diagnosed in 43 (16. 0 %) of all patients presenting with a presumed infection. 118 (43. 0 %) of the patients with a possible infection requested testing for an STD because of unsafe sexual activity without underlying symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual activity is mechanically dangerous, potentially infectious and stressful for the cardiovascular system. Because information on ED presentation related to sexual intercourse is scarce, more efforts should be undertaken to document all such complications to improve treatment and preventative strategies...|$|R
