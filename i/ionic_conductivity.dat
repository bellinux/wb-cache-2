5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivity</b> is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivity.</b> When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E
25|$|Ionic {{relaxation}} comprises <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivity</b> and interfacial {{and space}} charge relaxation. <b>Ionic</b> <b>conductivity</b> predominates at low frequencies and introduces only losses to the system. Interfacial relaxation occurs when charge carriers are trapped at interfaces of heterogeneous systems. A related effect is Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, where charge carriers blocked at inner dielectric boundary layers (on the mesoscopic scale) or external electrodes (on a macroscopic scale) {{lead to a}} separation of charges. The charges may be separated by a considerable distance and therefore make contributions to the dielectric loss that are orders of magnitude larger than the response due to molecular fluctuations.|$|E

25|$|As {{electrolyte}} materials, {{the inclusion}} of MOFs seems at first counter-intuitive. Fuel cell membranes generally have low porosity to prevent fuel crossover and loss of voltage between the anode and cathode. Additionally, membranes tend to have low crystallinity because the transport of ions is more favorable in disordered materials. On the other hand, pores can be filled with additional ion carriers that ultimately enhance the <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivity</b> {{of the system and}} high crystallinity makes the design process less complex.|$|E
25|$|The high {{operating}} temperature is {{largely due to}} the physical properties of the YSZ electrolyte. As temperature decreases, so does the <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivity</b> of YSZ. Therefore, to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell, a high {{operating temperature}} is required. According to their website, Ceres Power, a UK SOFC fuel cell manufacturer, has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their SOFC system to 500â€“600 degrees Celsius. They replaced the commonly used YSZ electrolyte with a CGO (cerium gadolinium oxide) electrolyte. The lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate, which reduces cost and start-up time of the system.|$|E
25|$|A {{electrode}} typically {{consists of}} carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion ionomer, and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the ionomer provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order {{to enable the}} electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must {{gain access to the}} surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (ionomer) and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles. Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivity,</b> while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low platinum metal loading. The electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.|$|E

The impedance of PDBNP and PANP films coated onto glassy carbon electrodes measured in 0. 1 M TBAP {{shows that the}} <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivities</b> of these two films increase with increasing electrode potential (oxidation level) as ClO 4 - ions are incorporated. It is concluded that anion transport is primarily responsible for the <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivities.</b> PANP has a 45 Â° Warburg region at all electrode potentials. However, for PDBNP, the 45 Â° Warburg region is seen only at low electrode potentials.

The apparent electrochemical reversibility was seen to be higher for PDBNP than for PANP from cyclic voltammetry. Evidence for this interpretation is that the <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivities</b> increase dramatically with electrode potentials for PDBNP, indicating that the counterion ClO 4 - moves more easily in PDBNP than PANP.

These SPEs are extensively compared with the corresponding NaTFSI(PEO) (n) system in terms of <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivities,</b> thermal properties, and charge carriers - to in detail outline both {{the role of the}} different anions used and the salt concentrations employed. While for the most dilute systems (n = 20) the two SPE families show similar <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivities</b> in the entire temperature range investigated (273 - 343 K), for n = 6 and n = 9 they differ significantly; at room temperature, the NaFSI based SPEs show lower <b>ionic</b> <b>conductivities</b> than the NaTFSI based analogues. This difference is mainly ascribed to differences in the morphology; while the NaTFSI salt, possibly by virtue of its large TFSI anion, acts to inhibit crystallization, NaFSI rather seems to favor crystallization. Furthermore, careful Raman spectroscopy analysis of the charge carrier speciation reveal higher aggregates to be present in the most concentrated SPE, NaFSI(PEO) (6), and the NaFSI based SPEs in general to result in less "free" anions than the NaTFSI based SPEs. Moreover, as both NaTFSI(PEO) (n) and NaFSI(PEO) (n) for n = 20 and n = 9 exhibit very similar glass transition temperatures, the FSI ion seem to be equally plasticizing as the TFSI ion, but for n = 6 the different speciation in terms of charge carriers also affects the relative dynamics of the polymer chains...|$|R
