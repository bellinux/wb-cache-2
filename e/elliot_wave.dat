50|$|Dr. George Lane, a {{financial}} analyst, {{is one of}} the first to publish on the use of stochastic oscillators to forecast prices. According to Lane, the Stochastics indicator is to be used with cycles, <b>Elliot</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory and Fibonacci retracement for timing. In low margin, calendar futures spreads, one might use Wilders parabolic as a trailing stop after a stochastics entry. A centerpiece of his teaching is the divergence and convergence of trendlines drawn on stochastics, as diverging/converging to trendlines drawn on price cycles. Stochastics predicts tops and bottoms.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In his {{presentation}} of the Efficient Market Eugene F. Fama wished to create a coherent picture of the main lines of the work on efficient markets, along with an accurate picture of {{the current state of}} the arts. The objective of this dissertation is to present a 360 degree perspective of Efficient Markets, whilst using Fama's original work as a skeletal frame. This dissertation has been divided into two parts. Part I is reserved for an in-depth qualitative discussion of Efficient Markets. The Efficiency of Markets is assumed throughout the discussion, and though any attack on this established fact would be futile, an attempt has been made to highlight and discuss the most notable cases of Inefficiency. Based on the arguments against efficiency, we also look at further implications of Efficient Markets on Investment Professionals, the impact Market Efficiency had on them and how they use it in today's world for their own benefit. Based on the fact that Markets are Efficient, we move onto Part II. Here a new concept is introduced which may seem either brilliant or ludicrous. The <b>Elliot</b> <b>Wave</b> Analysis is a technical trend following tool that has been termed as one of the few challenges to Market Efficiency, along with the Dow Theory. This obscure and long forgotten theory is based on human psychology and (to some extent) the chaos theory, which states that there is a pattern within randomness. Part II features an exhaustive review of this concept along with the main characteristics underlying this theory. After an introduction to the basic tenants of this theory, the author tries to create a model based on the <b>Elliot</b> <b>Wave.</b> Once a Model has been constructed, first a naive test is carried out employing the use of Microsoft Excel, and then a more formal approach is implemented using the statistical prowess of SPSS...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop one simple {{nonlinear}} model of time series generation that can reproduce some technical behaviours like <b>Elliot</b> <b>Waves</b> and lateral trends. Our model can forecast some technical movements {{as a consequence}} of “motion driver” at some time moments. Changing the “amplitude ” of emotion stated in the “motion driver ” parameter can alter technical figures. Our model is important because, to our knowledge, is the first model that can explain why there are <b>Elliot</b> <b>Waves</b> with Fibonacci ratios precisely. However, future research and development is needed since our model is only the first step...|$|R

40|$|Technical {{analysis}} (TA) {{is a form}} {{of analyzing}} market encompassing supply and demand of securities according to the study of their prices and trading volume. Using the appropriate methods, TA aims to identify price movements in the stock market, futures or currencies. In short, TA analysis is the process by which "future price movements are formulated according to the price history". TA originates from the work of Charles Dow and his conclusions about the global behavior of the market, as well as from <b>Elliot</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory. Dow did not regard its theory as a tool for stock market movement prediction, nor as a guide for investors, but as a kind of barometer of general market movements. The term TA methods encompasses all the methods used in tracking prices aiming to clearly predict future events. Many different methods, mainly statistical, are used in technical analysis, the most popular ones being: establishing and following trends using moving average, recognizing price momentum, calculating indicators and oscillators, as well as cycle analysis (structure indicators). It is also necessary to point out that TA is not a science in the true meaning of the term, and that methods it uses frequently deviate from the conventional manner of their use. The main advantage of these methods is their relative ease of use, aiming to give as clear picture as possible of price movements, {{while at the same time}} avoiding the use of complicated and complex mathematical methods. The reason for this is simple and is reflected in the dynamics of financial markets, where changes occur during short periods of time and where prompt decision-making is of vital importance...|$|E

The special accent is placed on forecasting the trend by means of artificial neural network especially on the optimalization of variables in the training process. <b>Elliot's</b> <b>wave</b> theory is applied {{in the second part}} of the thesis, particularly on prediction of future share quotation progress. Buying or selling signal generated by these two methods is consequently compared with ex-post signal yielding a profit.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a stock market forecasting model based on artificial neural network architecture. A baseline neural network model was developed using GFF architecture. The performance of the baseline model was evaluated by using representative large-cap stocks in six critical industrial sectors. Key performance measures, which included correlation coefficient and mean square error, were identified and used to compare the different models. A self-organising map network was developed to reduce the set of 56 stock market indicators into a final set of 11 indicators that covered market momentum, market volatility, market trend, broad market indictors and general momentum indicators. The model still required additional developments to better forecast turning points in the market. Based on <b>Elliot's</b> <b>Wave</b> Theory, two additional indicators were introduced to improve the forecast accuracy for turning points. artificial neural networks; ANNs; stock market forecasting; self organising maps; fuzzy set theory; technical indicators; generalised feed forward networks; turning points; stock markets; performance measures; market momentum; market volatility; market trends; broad market indictors; general momentum indicators; forecast accuracy. ...|$|R
