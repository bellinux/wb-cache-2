500|$|Was it his ambitious poetry, {{which was}} written to win you, that stopped my ability to think? Did it cause all of my ideas to die {{as soon as they}} were born? Was it his heaven given ability, writing [...] which was blessed by the gods, that stopped me in my tracks? Neither he nor his companions who helped him were able to stop my poetic ability. Neither he nor the Muse which aids him each night can claim to have silenced me. For <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid.</b> However, when your beauty was gifted to him then I was lost and destroyed.|$|E
500|$|During the First World War Read {{served with}} the Green Howards, {{fighting}} in the trenches of France. He was awarded the Military Cross, promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant, and became [...] "obsessively determined not to betray his own men through cowardice". The novel's development of the [...] "clearly autobiographical hero" [...] of Olivero owes a great deal to Read's wartime experiences and the [...] "resolute self-possession" [...] they instilled in him. The irony of Olivero overthrowing a dictator only to become one himself is perhaps consistent with a view Read expressed in the mid-1930s: [...] "From certain points of view, therefore, I can welcome the notion of the totalitarian state, whether in its Fascist or Communist form. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> of the totalitarian state as an economic fact, an economic machine to facilitate the complex business of living in a community." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of Disraeli's condition, the doctors concocted optimistic bulletins, for public consumption. The Prime Minister, Gladstone, called several times to enquire about his rival's condition, and wrote in his diary, [...] "May the Almighty be near his pillow." [...] There was intense public {{interest}} in the former Prime Minister's struggles for life. [...] Disraeli had customarily taken the sacrament at Easter; when this day was observed on 17 April, there was discussion among {{his friends and family}} if he should be given the opportunity, but those against, fearing that he would lose hope, prevailed. On the morning of the following day, Easter Monday, he became incoherent, then comatose. Disraeli's last confirmed words before dying in the early morning of 19 April were [...] "I had rather live but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> to die". The anniversary of Disraeli's death is now commemorated in the United Kingdom as Primrose Day.|$|E

500|$|On May 4, Cooper, in {{his last}} public statement, said, [...] "I know that what is {{happening}} is God's will. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> of the future." [...] He received the last rites on May 12. Cooper died quietly the following day, Saturday, May 13, 1961, at 12:47 pm, six days after his sixtieth birthday. A requiem mass was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, attended by many of Cooper's friends, including James Stewart, Henry Hathaway, Joel McCrea, Audrey Hepburn, Jack L. Warner, John Ford, John Wayne, Edward G. Robinson, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Randolph Scott, Walter Pidgeon, Bob Hope and Marlene Dietrich. Cooper was buried in the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. In May 1974, after his family relocated to New York, Cooper's remains were exhumed and reburied in Sacred Hearts Cemetery in Southampton. His grave is marked by a three-ton boulder from a Montauk quarry.|$|E
500|$|Opinion swiftly {{turned against}} Blaine; the June 3 New York Times carried the {{headline}} [...] "Blaine's Nomination Now Out of the Question." [...] Blaine took {{his case to}} the House floor on June 5, theatrically proclaiming his innocence and calling the investigation a partisan attack by Southern Democrats, revenge for his exclusion of Jefferson Davis from the amnesty bill of the previous year. [...] He read selected passages from the letters aloud, saying [...] "Thank God Almighty, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> to show them!" [...] Blaine even succeeded in extracting an apology from the committee chairman. [...] The political tide turned anew in Blaine's favor. [...] But now the pressure had begun to affect Blaine’s health, and he collapsed while leaving church services on June 14. [...] His opponents called the collapse a political stunt, with one Democratic newspaper reporting the event as [...] "Blaine Feigns a Faint." [...] Rumors of Blaine’s ill health combined {{with the lack of}} hard evidence against him garnered him sympathy among Republicans, and when the Republican convention began in Cincinnati later that month, he was again seen as the front-runner.|$|E
500|$|Rachid Chouhal was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 37. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Chouhal qualified for the Games via a wildcard because his fastest time of 10.83 seconds, set at the Marsa Sports Complex on 2 June 2012, was 0.59 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 100 metres. Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I want something, I go for it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid.</b> I am confident in my training and am careful not to get hurt. I know that the level of the athletes competing in the 100 metre sprint is very high. My aim is to do a personal best or season's best." [...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) but behind the Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds).

But the king can do wrong....If someone offers criticisms suggesting that the king is wrong, then I would like to be informed of their opinion. If I am not, that could be problematic...

[...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E
