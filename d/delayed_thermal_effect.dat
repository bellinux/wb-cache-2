40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis has}} been undertaken of the steady state transverse mode selection in Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) subject to optical feedback in an external cavity configuration. Proper account is taken of multiple reflections {{in the external}} cavity. The influence of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> on the mode selection is also treated and noise properties of the configuration are discussed. The analysis pays specific attention to the competition between the two lowest order modes (LP 01 and LP 11 degenerate modes) appropriate to the chosen circularly symmetric VCSEL structure. It is shown that preferential excitation of either mode can be effected by appropriate choice of optical feedback delay. It is also shown that multiple reflec 1 tions in the external cavity can affect the mode selection depending on the optical feedback <b>delay.</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>effects</b> are shown to be detrimental for transverse mode selection. Strategies to obtain a minimum impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> on mode selection are also discussed. Finally, relative intensity noise spectrum for each transverse mode is shown to maintain its double peak structure and low mode partition noise {{in the presence of}} optical feedback. A change from a twin peak to a single peak structure of this spectrum is also observed when changing the optical feedback delay. OCIS key terms: 140. 2020, 140. 3300, 250. 7260 1...|$|R
40|$|Large {{pressure}} shifts {{are a part}} of {{the emerging}} high-pressure food treatments. Pressure treatments count among their advantages vs. thermal processes the lack of the undesirable effects associated with temperature changes and a better cost-efficient ratio. Nevertheless, any pressure variation has with it an associated temperature change, whose effect, if not conveniently considered, can alter the product, increase costs by introducing the need of thermoregulation or, at the very least, become an error source in hydrostatic pressure treatment studies. In this article, water and fatty foods are used as models and the thermal changes originated by pressure variations are studied. The range 20 - 65 °C and 0. 1 - 350 MPa was considered, as it is the most interesting for food applications. Results were compared, where possible, to theoretically calculated values and a sufficiently good agreement with them was found. The fatty foods studied (milk fat and cream) yielded negative temperature changes, much higher than that of water, upon quasi-adiabatic expansions of the same magnitude. The absolute value of this temperature change decreased with increasing temperatures and pressures, in opposite sense to the water case. A <b>delay</b> of the <b>thermal</b> <b>effect</b> over its causing pressure shift was consistently found. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Various studies have demonstrated the potential performance improvement of 3 DICs by eliminating long interconnects, repeaters, and clock buffers. Though 3 DICs are attractive, there are significant challenges associated with this topic. The most fundamental issue in 3 DIC is heat dissipation. The <b>thermal</b> <b>effect</b> has impacted the conventional high-performance 2 DICs in deep sub-micron technology nodes.

The existing 2 D physical design methodology cannot be simply extended to a 3 D case because of the huge obstacles in the z-direction and thermal constraints.
