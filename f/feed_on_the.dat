5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scalp, while body lice live on clothing and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of}} the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Many seabirds <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ocean's surface, as {{the action}} of marine {{currents}} often concentrates food such as krill, forage fish, squid or other prey items within reach of a dipped head.|$|E

50|$|The {{ladybird}} Scymnodes lividigaster <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aphid Aphis eugeniae, which <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cheese tree.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> canola. First <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaves, {{but later}} also <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pods. Full-grown larvae {{drop to the}} ground in mid to late August to pupate.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Veronica chamaedrys and Veronica officinalis. They start <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seeds. Later, {{they build}} a {{portable}} case from fragments {{of plant and}} start <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaves close to the ground.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|By chewing the tap {{and lateral}} roots of trees, {{caterpillars}} <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cambium growth, {{produced by the}} tree {{at the site of}} the injury. The larvae may girdle a root, thereby causing its death, or the lesions may be only partial, allowing the root to continue functioning, albeit with some deformity.|$|E
5|$|Foraging workers often visit Pisonia {{flowers and}} will <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nectar. Other flowers they will visit include Canavalia, Commicarpus, Ipomoea, Melanthera, Plumbago and Scaevola. Ochetellus flavipes {{regularly}} attends the mealybug Prorsococcus acanthodus and protects it by building shelters. They also attend {{a number of}} butterfly larvae, including Anthene lycaenoides (Pale Ciliate Blue), Ogyris amaryllis (Satin Azure), Ogyris olane (Olane Azure) and Ogyris oroetes (Silky Azure).|$|E
50|$|Like most American sparrows, the yellow-browed sparrow {{is largely}} granivorous, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seeds of native grasses and various {{introduced}} plants. It also eats insects, including larvae. It typically <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larva <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> {{a variety}} of {{herbaceous}} plants (see list below). <b>The</b> young larva <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaves of the food plant, later <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roots. It overwinters as a full-grown larva in a cavity in the soil before pupating in the spring.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Pyrus (including Pyrus serotina), Larix (including Larix leptolepis) and Angelica species. They {{have been}} {{recorded}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fruit of pear, but are also recorded living in the gall of Ceratovacuna nekoashi <b>on</b> Styrax japonicus, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inner walls of the gall.|$|R
5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry them away to their burrows to <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> egg's capitulum, while leaving {{the rest of}} the egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{is known to}} also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations {{in the mouth of}} the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
50|$|Microlarinus lareynii <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{seeds of}} the puncturevine, Tribulus terrestris. Together with Microlarinus lypriformis, which <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stems of the puncturevine, it has been {{introduced}} as a biological control agent in the United States of America and Canada.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> a {{wide range}} of plants, {{including}} Artemisia campestris, Matricaria, Aster, Anthemis, Solidago, Chrysanthemum, Alchemilla, Helichrysum and Tanacetum species. The larvae have been recorded <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flowers and seeds of their host plant, but may also live in the stems and shoots, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pith.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Pouteria sandwicensis. <b>The</b> larvae {{were found}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> under {{surface of the}} leaf {{protected}} by a frass-covered web.|$|R
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> algae growing {{on the surface of}} the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. Bivalve molluscs include the edible common cockle, although it is not harvested here.|$|E
5|$|This bird feeds at night, eating various {{invertebrates}} {{and small}} vertebrates. While in mangroves, it commonly feeds on crabs. Otherwise, it will generally feed on molluscs, arthropods, frogs, seeds, berries, palm fruits, {{and the occasional}} water snake. Maize, rice, and bananas are also viable food items for the grey-necked wood rail. It is also known to <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> feces of giant otters at latrines.|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
50|$|<b>Feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hydroid Hydractinia echinata.|$|R
50|$|Doriprismatica atromarginata <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> sponges and {{has been}} seen <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> species Hyatella intestinalis.|$|R

5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that {{the pattern of}} male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a}} number of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
50|$|Polycera atra <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bryozoan Bugula.|$|R
50|$|This species <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hydroid Aglaophenia.|$|R

5|$|Animals that <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so {{to escape from}} predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
