50|$|Static load {{capacity}} {{can be added}} to a linear screw actuator using an electromagnetic brake system, which applies friction to the spinning <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b> For example, a spring may be used to apply brake pads to the <b>drive</b> <b>nut,</b> holding it in position when power is turned off. When the actuator needs to be moved, an electromagnet counteracts the spring and releases the braking force on the <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R

40|$|A drive {{mechanism}} enables a socket-type wrench to rotate a shaft and prevents accidental {{rotation of the}} shaft when the wrench is not coupled to the shaft. In the original intended application, the shaft {{would be part of}} an attachment mechanism on a spacecraft, and the purpose to be served by the drive is to prevent back-driving of the shaft by launch vibrations while enabling an astronaut equipped with the appropriate wrench to actuate the shaft while in orbit. The design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which it is necessary to prevent rotational back-driving. The mechanism includes a gear near the tip of the shaft, and a <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> that constitutes the tip of the shaft. The gear and <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> are positioned in a recess in a housing. The recess is sized to receive the wrench socket that mates with the <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b> Also contained in the housing are four linkages that include pins that are spring-loaded into engagement with the gear to prevent rotation of the shaft. When the wrench socket is inserted in the recess, it pushes on the linkages in such a manner as to disengage the pins from the gear...|$|R

40|$|Linear back-drive {{differentials}} {{have been}} proposed as alternatives to conventional gear differentials for applications {{in which there is}} only limited rotational motion (e. g., oscillation). The finite nature of the rotation makes it possible to optimize a linear back-drive differential in ways that would not be possible for gear differentials or other differentials that are required to be capable of unlimited rotation. As a result, relative to gear differentials, linear back-drive differentials could be more compact and less massive, could contain fewer complex parts, and could be less sensitive to variations in the viscosities of lubricants. Linear back-drive differentials would operate according to established principles of power ball screws and linear-motion drives, but would utilize these principles in an innovative way. One major characteristic of such mechanisms that would be exploited in linear back-drive differentials is the possibility of designing them to drive or back-drive with similar efficiency and energy input: in other words, such a mechanism can be designed so that a rotating screw can <b>drive</b> a <b>nut</b> linearly or the linear motion of the nut can cause the screw to rotate. A linear back-drive differential (see figure) would include two collinear shafts connected to two parts that are intended to engage in limited opposing rotations. The linear back-drive differential would also include a nut that would be free to translate along its axis but not to rotate. The inner surface of the nut would be right-hand threaded at one end and left-hand threaded at the opposite end to engage corresponding right- and left-handed threads on the shafts. A rotation and torque introduced into the system via one shaft would <b>drive</b> the <b>nut</b> in linear motion. The nut, in turn, would back-drive the other shaft, creating a reaction torque. Balls would reduce friction, making it possible for the shaft/nut coupling on each side to operate with 90 percent efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring loaded rack and pinion. This spring loading arrangement consists of <b>yoke</b> <b>nut,</b> spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and <b>yoke</b> <b>nut.</b> The spring loading arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the spring loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R
