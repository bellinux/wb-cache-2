40|$|Objective. Nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) are {{two main}} {{components}} of intervertebral disc (IVD). We aimed {{to figure out whether}} NP and AF also contain stem cells and whether these stem cells share common properties with chondrocytes and/or fibroblasts in their phenotypes or whether they are completely different types of cells with different characteristics. Design. The <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated from AF and NP tissues of the same lumbar spine of the rabbits. The properties of these <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> were characterized by their morphology, population doubling time (PDT), stem cell marker expression, and multidifferentiation potential using tissue culture techniques, immunocytochemistry, and RT-PCR.

This study indicated that IVD contains stem cells and the characteristics of AFSCs and NPSCs are intrinsically different. The findings of this study may provide basic scientific data for understanding the properties of IVD cells and the mechanisms of lower back pain...|$|R
50|$|Cannabis {{plants are}} broadly covered with sessile glands, and other hairs {{throughout}} above-ground {{portions of the}} plant. There is a particularly high concentration of glands on the bracts of the female plant. After flower formation begins, some of the glands, especially on bracts near the flowers, develop stalks projecting them outward from the plant surface. The glands consist of a layer of <b>disk</b> <b>cells,</b> whose outer surface splits to create a large secretory cavity lined by cell wall and cuticle components. Together the <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> and secretory cavity form a round head atop the narrow stalk. These cavities come to contain large amounts of cannabidiol in hemp-producing strains, or tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in marijuana-producing strains. These compounds appear to be produced beginning in specialized plastids called lipoplasts. These produce spheres of oily secretions, including terpenes, which pass through the cell membrane and wall to accumulate as vesicles in the secretory cavity. Final reaction to cannabinoids appears to occur outside the <b>disk</b> <b>cell</b> cyctoplasm. The glands gradually darken as they mature, with loss of cannabinoids over time (perhaps to evaporation) and eventually undergo abscission from the plant.|$|R

40|$|The Hedgehog (Hh) {{family of}} {{secreted}} signaling proteins has a broad variety of functions during metazoan development and implications in human disease. Despite Hh being modified by two lipophilic adducts, Hh migrates far from its site of synthesis and programs cellular outcomes depending on its local concentrations. Recently, lipoproteins were suggested {{to act as}} carriers to mediate Hh transport in Drosophila. Here, we examine the role of lipophorins (Lp), the Drosophila lipoproteins, in Hh signaling in the wing imaginal disk, a tissue that does not express Lp but obtains it through the hemolymph. We use the up-regulation of the Lp receptor 2 (LpR 2), the main Lp receptor expressed in the imaginal <b>disk</b> <b>cells,</b> to increase Lp endocytosis and locally {{reduce the amount of}} available free extracellular Lp in the wing disk epithelium. Under this condition, secreted Hh is not stabilized in the extracellular matrix. We obtain similar results after a generalized knock-down of hemolymph Lp levels. These data suggest that Hh must be packaged with Lp in the producing cells for proper spreading. Interestingly, we also show that Patched (Ptc), the Hh receptor, is a lipoprotein receptor; Ptc actively internalizes Lp into the endocytic compartment in a Hh-independent manner and physically interacts with Lp. Ptc, as a lipoprotein receptor, can affect intracellular lipid homeostasis in imaginal <b>disk</b> <b>cells.</b> However, by using different Ptc mutants, we show that Lp internalization does not {{play a major role in}} Hh signal transduction but does in Hh gradient formation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a protein family in Drosophila containing six adenosine deaminase-related growth factors (ADGFs), which are homologous to a mitogenic growth factor discovered in conditioned medium from cells {{of a different}} fly species, Sarcophaga. Closely related proteins {{have been identified in}} other animals, and a human homolog is implicated in the genetic disease Cat-Eye Syndrome. The two most abundantly expressed ADGFs in Drosophila larvae are ADGF-A, which is strongly expressed in the gut and lymph glands, and ADGF-D, which is mainly expressed in the fat body and brain. Recombinant ADGF-A and ADGF-D are active adenosine deaminases (ADAs), and they cause polarization and serum-independent proliferation of imaginal <b>disk</b> and embryonic <b>cells</b> in vitro. The enzymatic activity of these proteins is required for their mitogenic function, making them unique among growth factors. A culture medium prepared without adenosine, or depleted of adenosine by using bovine ADA, also stimulates proliferation of imaginal <b>disk</b> <b>cells,</b> and addition of adenosine to this medium inhibits proliferation. Thus ADGFs secreted in vivo may control tissue growth by modulating the level of extracellular adenosine...|$|R

Cell growth and differentiation in each culture were examined by phase contrast microscopy and described both qualitatively and quantitatively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the growth and {{morphology}} of a salivary epithelial cell line (HSG) in vitro on several biodegradable substrata as an important step toward developing an artificial salivary gland. The substrates examined were poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), and two co-polymers, 85 % and 50 % PLGA, respectively. The substrates were formed into 20 - to 25 -mm <b>disks,</b> and the <b>cells</b> were seeded directly onto the polymers or onto polymers coated with specific extracellular matrix proteins. The two copolymer substrates became friable over time in aqueous media and proved not useful for these experiments. The purified matrix proteins examined included fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN), collagen I, collagen IV, and gelatin. In the absence of preadsorbed proteins, HSG cells did not attach to the polymer <b>disks.</b> The <b>cells,</b> in general, behaved similarly on both PLLA and PGA, although optimal results were obtained consistently in PLLA. On FN-coated PLLA <b>disks,</b> HSG <b>cells</b> were able to form a uniform monolayer, which was dependent on time and FN concentration.

40|$|Intervertebral disks (IVD) acts as shock {{absorber}} between {{each of the}} vertebrae in the spinal column by keeping the vertebrae separated when the shock caused by the action. They also serve to protect the nerves that run {{down the middle of}} the spine and intervertebral disks. The disks are made of fibrocartilaginous material. The outside of the disk is made of a strong material called the annulus fibrosus. Inside this protective covering is a jelly-like substance known as mucoprotein gel. This interior is known as the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus consists of large vacuolated notochord cells, small chondrocyte-like cells, collagen fibrils, and aggrecan, a proteoglycan that aggregates by binding to hyaluronan. Attached to each aggrecan molecule are glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate. Intervertebral disks degeneration is frequently associated with low back and neck pain, which accounts as a disability. Despite the known outcomes of the Intervertebral disks degeneration cascade, the treatment of IVD degeneration is limited in that available conservative and surgical treatments do not reverse the pathology or restore the IVD tissue. Regenerative medicine for IVD degeneration, by injection of Intervertebral <b>disks</b> <b>cells,</b> chondrocytes or stem cells, has been extensively studied in the past decade in various animal models of induced IVD degeneration, and has progressed to clinical trials in the treatment of various spinal disease. Despite preliminary results showing positive effects of cell-injection strategies for IVD regeneration, detailed basic research on Intervertebral <b>disks</b> <b>cells</b> and their niche demonstrates that transplanted cells are unable to survive and adapt in the avascular niche of the IVD. For this therapeutic strategy to succeed, the indications for its use and the patients who would benefit need to be better defined.

40|$|As {{a member}} of Cnidaria, the body wall of hydra is {{structurally}} reduced to an epithelial bilayer with an intervening extracellular matrix (ECM). Biochemical and cloning {{studies have shown that}} the molecular composition of hydra ECM is similar to that seen in vertebrates and functional studies have demonstrated that cell-ECM interactions are important to developmental processes in hydra. Because vertebrate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown to have an important role in cell-ECM interactions, the current study was designed to determine whether hydra has homologues of these proteinases and, if so, what function these enzymes have in morphogenesis and cell differentiation in this simple metazoan. Utilizing a PCR approach, a single hydra matrix metalloproteinase, named HMMP was identified and cloned. The structure of HMMP was similar to that of vertebrate MMPs with an overall identity of about 35 %. Detailed structural analysis indicated some unique features in (1) the cysteine-switch region of the prodomain, (2) the hinge region preceding the hemopexin domain, and (3) the hemopexin domain. Using a bacterial system, HMMP protein was expressed and folded to obtain an active enzyme. Substrate analysis studies indicated that recombinant HMMP could digest a number of hydra ECM components such as hydra laminin. Using a fluorogenic MMP substrate assay, it was determined that HMMP was inhibited by peptidyl hydroxamate MMP inhibitors, GM 6001 and matlistatin, and by human recombinant TIMP- 1. Whole-mount in situ studies indicated that HMMP mRNA was expressed in the endoderm along the entire longitudinal axis of hydra, but at relatively high levels at regions where cell-transdifferentiation occurred (apical and basal poles). Functional studies using GM 6001 and TIMP- 1 indicated that these MMP inhibitors could reversibly block foot regeneration. Blockage of foot regeneration was also observed using antisense thio-oligo nucleotides to HMMP introduced into the endoderm of the basal pole using a localized electroporation technique. Studies with adult intact hydra found that GM 6001 could also cause the reversible de-differentiation or inhibition of transdifferentiation of basal <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> of the foot process. Basal <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> are adjacent to those endoderm cells of the foot process that express high levels of HMMP mRNA. In summary, these studies indicate that hydra has at least one MMP that is functionally tied to morphogenesis and cell transdifferentiation in this simple metazoan...|$|R

Here we show that stacked fragments (units) of the Golgi complex dispersed in Drosophila imaginal <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> are functionally diverse. The UDP-sugar transporter FRINGE-CONNECTION (FRC) is localized to {{a subset of the}} Golgi units distinct from those harboring SULFATELESS (SFL), which modifies glucosaminoglycans (GAGs), and from those harboring the protease RHOMBOID (RHO), which processes the glycoprotein SPITZ (SPI). Whereas the glycosylation and function of NOTCH are affected in imaginal disks of frc mutants, those of SPI and of GAG core proteins are not, even though FRC transports a broad range of glycosylation substrates, suggesting that Golgi units containing FRC and those containing SFL or RHO are functionally separable. Distinct Golgi units containing FRC and RHO in embryos could also be separated biochemically by immunoisolation techniques. We also show that Tn-antigen glycan is localized only in a subset of the Golgi units distributed basally in a polarized cell. We propose that the different localizations among distinct Golgi units of molecules involved in glycosylation underlie the diversity of glycan modification...|$|R
40|$|The main {{mechanism}} for solute transport within the intervertebral disk is passive diffusion. The 2 routes for {{the exchange of}} solutes with the blood vessels outside the disk are via {{the periphery of the}} annulus, and through the end-plates. While the periphery of the annulus is completely permeable, the bone [...] disk interface is only partially so. In the region of the nucleus the effective area through which solute transport is taking place constitutes some 85 % of the actual bone/disk interface; in the region of the inner annulus it is reduced to only 35 % while the bone [...] disk interface at the outer annulus is almost completely impermeable. These figures, calculated from tracer diffusion experiments correlate very well with the qualitative observations of blood vessel contact. Apart from its dependence on the permeability of the endplate, solute diffusion is also determined {{by the nature of the}} solute. For example, a negatively charged solute such as the sulphate ion is considerably excluded from the nucleus, which limits its rate of penetration via the endplates. The sulphate uptake by the <b>disk</b> <b>cells</b> to produce glycosaminoglycans is low and comparable to that in articular cartilage...|$|R

The polarization resistance of freshly deposited Li, from electrolytes of ethers, and their mixtures with ethylene carbonate, are identical. Continuous cycling tests with maximum cathode utilization in the electrolyte of composition 1. 5 M LiAsF 672 MeTHF/THF(1 : 1) / 0. 2 % 2 MeF demonstrate a cycling efficiency of 96 - 97 % for Li.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{detailed}} description of Golgi stack biogenesis that takes place in vivo during one of the morphogenetic events in the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. In early third-instar larvae, small clusters consisting mostly of vesicles and tubules were present in epithelial imaginal <b>disk</b> <b>cells.</b> As larvae progressed through mid- and late-third instar, these larval clusters became larger but also increasingly formed cisternae, some of which were stacked. In white pupae, the typical Golgi stack was observed. We show that larval clusters are Golgi stack precursors by 1) localizing various Golgi-specific markers to the larval clusters by electron and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, 2) driving this conversion in wild-type larvae incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and 3) showing that this conversion does not take place in an NSF 1 mutant (comt 17). The biological significance of this conversion became clear when we found that the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) is critically involved in this conversion. In its absence, Golgi stack biogenesis did not occur and the larval clusters remained unaltered. We showed that dGM 130 and sec 23 p expression increases approximately three- and fivefold, respectively, when discs are exposed to ecdysone in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that we have developed an in vivo system to study the ecdysone-triggered Golgi stack biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, it {{has been}} shown that protein kinase A and {{hedgehog}} have antagonistic actions during the formation of imaginal disks. In vertebrate skin, sonic hedgehog is expressed specifically in the feather bud epithelia. Using an in vitro explant culture model we showed that dibutyryl cAMP, a protein kinase A (PKA) activator, suppresses the expression of Sonic hedgehog, (Shh) and continuous feather growth. The results suggest that Shh and PKA also have antagonistic action during vertebrate skin morphogenesis. © 1996 Academic Press. Inc. In Drosophila, Hedgehog (hh) belongs to the segment polarity class of genes and encodes a secreted protein which plays a role in extracellular signalling pathways (For reviews see 1 – 3). Specifically, it is involved in the establishment of polarity within embryonic segments (4), development of imaginal disks (5), and the progression of the morphogenetic furrow in the developing eye (6, 7). Recently, work from several groups showed that in the anterior imaginal <b>disk,</b> <b>cells</b> which lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) express decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg) (8 – 10). These cells normally express dpp and wg only in the presence of hh derived from the posterior imaginal disk. Thus the absence of PKA activity could substitute for hh activity. It was concluded that the presence of PKA normally inhibits the expression of dpp and wg, and that hh acts antagonistically to PKA...|$|R

If the factor(s) resulting in this minor foreign-body reaction are better understood, this knowledge {{can be used to}} modulate unwanted foreign-body reactions. Therefore, we investigated whether the phagocytic potential of murine macrophages and giant cells could be enhanced. Disks of HDSC were predegraded with collagenase or impregnated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) before implantation in 129 SVEV mice. Explantation was performed on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and the disks were evaluated at the (immuno) light and transmission electron-microscopic levels. More giant cells were present in the predegraded <b>disks.</b> <b>Cells</b> were associated with the HDSC bundles, and the onset of phagocytosis started on day 28, in contrast to the controls and the disks impregnated with the cytokines. Expression of MHC class II was minimal in all groups. The matrix metalloproteinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were expressed in all groups although on day 28 MMP- 9 expression was higher in the predegraded disks. Thus, predegradation only slightly enhanced the onset of the foreign-body reaction to HDSC in mice, and impregnation with cytokines not at all. This suggests that lack of proteolytic enzymes or TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma is not the cause of the impaired onset of the foreign-body reaction. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

This study investigated the effect of cell adhesion on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein and on gene expression over a 72 -h culture period. Fibroblast-like cells were cultured on anodized-hydrothermally treated commercially pure titanium with nanotopographic structure (SA-treated c. p. Ti) surfaces. MethodsMurine fibroblast-like NIH/ 3 T 3 cells were cultured for 10 – 72 h on c. p. Ti, anodic oxide (AO) c. p. Ti, and SA-treated c. p. Ti <b>disks.</b> <b>Cell</b> morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytoskeletal structure and FAK protein localization were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). FAK mRNA levels were analyzed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. ResultsSEM and CLSM showed increased NIH/ 3 T 3 cell adhesion with time, and actin filaments oriented parallel with the filopodium-like extensions on all disks. Filopodium-like extensions were bound tightly to the nanotopographic structure surface of cultures on SA-treated c. p. Ti, and especially at 72 h. FAK protein was localized along cellular extensions on SA-treated c. p. Ti and the expression of FAK mRNA was significantly higher on these disks than on c. p. Ti and AO c. p. Ti after 72 h (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsNIH/ 3 T 3 fibroblast-like cells have the capacity to adhere to SA-treated c. p. Ti as a transmucosal portion of implant surface material and express focal adhesion molecules, which may {{play a key role in}} the maintenance of a mucosal tissue barrie...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) control of the expression of b 1, 3 -glucuronosyl transferase 1 (GlcAT- 1), an important regulator of chondroitin sulfate synthesis in cells of the nucleus pulposus. Treatment with both growth factors resulted in induction of GlcAT- 1 expression and promoter activity. Deletion analysis indicated that promoter constructs lacking AP 1 and TonE sites were unresponsive to growth factor treatment. Experiments using dominant-negative proteins showed that these transcription factors along with Sp 1 were required for induction of GlcAT- 1 promoter activity. Moreover, when either AP 1 or TonE binding sites were mutated, induction was suppressed. Both BMP- 2 and TGF-b increased c-Jun and TonEBP expression and phosphorylation of transactivation domains. We investigated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway following growth factor treatment; a robust and transient activation of ERK 1 / 2, p 38, and JNK was noted. Treatment with MAPK inhibitors blocked BMP- 2 - and TGF-b-induced AP 1 reporter function, GlcAT- 1 expression, and GAG accumulation. We found that DN-ERK 1 but not DN-ERK 2 resulted in suppression of growth factor–mediated induction of GlcAT- 1 promoter activity; we also showed that p 38 d was important in GlcAT- 1 activation. Results of these studies demonstrate that BMP- 2 and TGF-b regulate GlcAT- 1 expression in nucleus pulposus cells through a signaling network comprising MAPK, AP 1, Sp 1, and TonEBP. It is concluded that by controlling both GAG and aggrecan synthesis, these growth factors positively influence <b>disk</b> <b>cell</b> function. ß 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

[...] Asexual reproduction {{occurs when}} a small segment is separated from the pedal <b>disk.</b> A single <b>cell</b> can be enough for a new Aiptasia anemone to form. The separated segment will start growing and develop a new polyp. A new polyp is usually formed within 14 days. The new polyps are clones of the original Aiptasia.
