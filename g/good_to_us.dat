500|$|We {{want to stay}} in New York, New York {{has been}} {{incredibly}} <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show... Our New York crew is spectacular, they've worked their [...] off to make the show look great. But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.|$|E
500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her are so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{that we should not}} be deserving of having such treasures about us, if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E

5000|$|The Jones Act {{prevents}} foreign-flagged {{ships from}} carrying cargo between the US mainland and noncontiguous {{parts of the}} US, such as Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam.

2500|$|.....a {{painting}} is done when the artist dies. Previously, I {{felt that a}} painting was done when I have taken {{it as far as}} I could, at that point in time, and signed it. Now, if the {{painting is}} still in my possession and I am not impressed with it, I may rework it. A painting is like a motion picture, always evolving. We hit pause when it looks <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> and then we sign it. But we may come back to it sometime later and look at it again with a perspective enhanced by experience and development and say, “this painting needs more work.” ...|$|E

[...] He belonged to the conservative group that was usually opposed to the Mama Lucy Gang, so his introduction was a gesture of unity. Richard Carbajal, representative from Belen, spoke first.
