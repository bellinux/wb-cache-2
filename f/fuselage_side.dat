5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher and the machine could reach a slightly higher ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) the maximum speed was 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E
25|$|The E-30 {{could be}} armed, {{according}} to its training rôle. Possibilities included a fixed, forward firing 7.7mm (0.303in) Vickers machine gun or a similar gun in the rear cockpit. Up to six 12kg (23lb) bombs could be attached to under fuselage and <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> racks.|$|E

25|$|As the T3M-1 was underpowered, a {{new version}} was {{produced}} with the much more powerful (770hp/574kW) Packard 3A-2500 engine. This version, the T3M-2 had revised wings with {{the upper and lower}} wings of equal span (while in the T3M-1 the lower wings were of greater span), and the radiator was replaced by two radiators on the <b>fuselage</b> <b>side,</b> allowing the crew to be moved to three individual tandem cockpits. The U.S. Navy ordered 100 T3M-2s, one of which was re-engined with the Pratt & Whitney Hornet and the Wright Cyclone radial engines as the XT3M-3 and XT3M-4 respectively. These aircraft formed the basis of the Martin T4M that would replace the T3M in service with the U.S. Navy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} version {{could also}} be equipped {{with a range of}} weapons, in order to act in anti-submarine- or gunship roles. [...] The weapon configuration could include two machine guns in <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> packs (usually 0.5" [...] Browning), plus a third gun on the rear fuselage, and two pods containing 6 x 82mm rocket pods or torpedoes or sonar buoys on the fuselage sides.|$|E
2500|$|To help {{balance the}} new engine, the radio {{equipment}} was moved further {{back in the}} rear fuselage and the access hatch was moved from the left <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> to the right. Better VHF radio equipment allowed for the aerial mast to be removed and replaced by a [...] "whip" [...] aerial further aft on the fuselage spine. Because the longer nose and the increased slipstream of the big five-bladed propeller a new tail unit with a taller, broader fin and a rudder of increased area was adopted.|$|E

2500|$|Cheli was {{assigned}} to lead the 38th BG, 30 B-25 Mitchells including stand-bys. Bad weather en route separated the force from its P-38 cover escort, and mechanical problems reduced each squadron by one Mitchell, leaving his 405th and the following 71st Squadrons to attack with 28 B-25s. His assigned aircraft that day was B-25D-1 (s/n 41-30117), a bomber field-modified into a strafer by enclosure of its plexiglass nose to mounting of four forward-firing machine guns, {{and a pair of}} <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> [...] "blister packs" [...] mounting guns that also fired forward.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} a four-engine high-wing {{monoplane}} with tricycle undercarriage, originally designed for 14 (three abreast seating with six additional seats {{mounted on the}} side) and eventually converted to take 20 passengers. The side [...] "couch seats" [...] were also able to be folded away so that cargo could be carried internally in the cabin. Individual storage space was provided for each passenger seat on the <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> above the seat. In order to accommodate a larger cargo load, a cargo hatch was located near the pilot's compartment.|$|E
2500|$|The last, sixth {{aircraft}} was not completed and flown until May 1957. [...] It was a three-seat, roadable version {{powered by a}} water-cooled [...] Tucker-Franklin. This was cooled by radiators {{on each side of}} the engine, fed air by <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> scoops. In the absence of the forward radiator the nose was remodelled, becoming shorter and blunter. The fins were also altered so that the upper and lower leading edges met at an acute angle. At some point this particular Arrowbile was renamed the Aerobile, though it was not a name that Waterman used.|$|E

2500|$|The Fauvettes's {{fuselage}} {{is built}} in three parts. [...] The nose section, with a moulded plastic foam shell over a steel frame contains the cockpit, which {{is covered by}} a high, one-piece canopy over the upright seating position, giving the Fauvette a somewhat humpbacked look. [...] The centre section also has a steel frame, covered by moulded polystyrene; wings, cockpit and twin <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> towing hooks are attached to this frame. Behind the cockpit the upper fuselage line is formed with a polystyrene fairing which overlaps the conical rear fuselage, made of ply-foam sandwich. [...] The V-tail is straight-tapered with sweep on both edges. [...] The fixed surfaces are ply-foam sandwich structures, carrying fabric covered control surfaces. [...] The Fauvette has a fixed, monowheel undercarriage, assisted by a tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designer}} of the Pirate was the experienced Harold Boultbee, who had recently produced the Civilian Coupé, and construction began early in 1935. The high wings were straight edged, but tapered, slightly swept {{on the leading edge}} and fully slotted. [...] The trailing edge carried differential ailerons and interacting flaps. A pair of V shaped lift struts ran from the two wing spars down to the lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> where there was a universal joint to facilitate wing folding. [...] The folding mechanism was unusual: unlocked, the wings slid forward and tipped leading edge down, so that when the front spar was released from its fitting the wings could fold rearwards and downwards about the rear spar. [...] Because of the initial forward movement, the folded length was less {{than it would have been}} with conventional geometries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided and rectangular in section, {{with the engine}} exposed in the nose and the passenger/observer's cockpit immediately behind it. In some engine installations the radiator was mounted along the <b>fuselage</b> <b>side,</b> with this cockpit between them. [...] The pilot's cockpit, fitted like the passenger's with a celluloid windscreen, was much further aft at about mid-fuselage with the main fuel tank between them. [...] Because the LFG had a very broad chord, low aspect ratio horizontal tail of the sort known {{at the time as}} [...] "Taube type", he sat not far in front of the its leading edge. The tailplane carried an undivided elevator. There was a triangular fin and a high, rounded and balanced rudder. [...] The Arrow had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with V-form struts, their leading members bent round into short skids laterally connected by a rod to which the wheels, on their single axle, were joined via rubber shock absorbers.|$|E

2500|$|The group {{participated in}} the Battle of the Bismarck Sea on 3 March 1943, with the 405th BS {{engaging}} in an early example of [...] "mast head" [...] (skip) bombing. Following the Bismarck Sea mission, the 38th returned all of its aircraft {{over a period of}} months to the 4th Air Depot in Townsville for field modification to the B-25C-1 (405th BS) and B-25D-1 (71st BS) strafer configuration in which the nose compartment was enclosed with sheet metal with eight forward-firing machine guns mounted in the nose and in blister packs on the <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> below the cockpit. The lower turret was also removed and replaced by a 150-gallon fuel tank mounted on bomb racks that allowed it to be jettisoned once fuel was transferred. The 405th made low level strafing attacks its standard operating procedure in March 1943, while the 71st BS commenced such missions in May. The modification process and training needs released the group from most combat operations between April and July.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 this {{engine was}} {{installed}} in a small, single seat aircraft called the Albert TE.1, designed by Robert Duhamel, this aircraft had previously flown in 1925 powered by a [...] water-cooled Vaslin V 6 B V6 engine, which had a square radiator on the nose. The TE, or Te in the designation acknowledged the use of multi-layer mahogany skinning methods developed by Alphonse Tellier and widely applied {{to the construction of}} early monocoque fuselages. It had a cantilever, one-piece parasol wing built around two wooden box spars, covered with plywood. In plan its trailing edge was straight and unswept and over the inner 50% of the span the leading edge was parallel to it; in the outboard portion the leading edge was curved elliptically. [...] The wing was attached to the raised centre of the fuselage and braced to each <b>fuselage</b> <b>side</b> with a pair of very short struts. With only six attachment points, involving twelve bolts, it was easy to separate wing and fuselage for transport. Narrow, long-span ailerons filled {{more than two-thirds of the}} trailing edge; these were operated by control rods, rather than wires.|$|E
2500|$|Detroyat's enthusiasm, {{problems}} with the MB.150, and the pressure of continuing German rearmament finally forced France to purchase 100 aircraft and 173 engines. The first Hawk 75A-1 (or H75A-1 n°1) arrived in France in December 1938 and began entering service in March 1939. Few months later, this aircraft was part of [...] "Groupe de Chasse II/5 La Fayette" [...] (heir of the Escadrille Lafayette that fought in France during World War I) and was wearing the famous Sioux Head on its <b>fuselage</b> <b>side.</b> After the first few examples, aircraft were delivered in pieces and assembled in France by the Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Centre. Officially designated as the Curtiss H75-C1 (the [...] "Hawk" [...] name was not used in France), the aircraft were powered by Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC-G engines with 900hp and had instruments calibrated for the metric system, a seat for French dorsal parachutes, a French-style throttle which operated in reverse from U.S. and British aircraft (full throttle was to the rear {{rather than to the}} front) and armament of four (later models had six with two firing through the prop and four in the wings) 7.5 mm FN-Browning machine guns, aimed with a French-supplied Baille-Lemaire gun sight. The aircraft evolved through several modifications, the most significant being the installation of the Wright R-1820 Cyclone engine. The H75-C1 variant saw little operational use due to its late delivery and reliability {{problems with}} the Wright radial engine. A total of 316 H75s were delivered to France before the German occupation.|$|E
