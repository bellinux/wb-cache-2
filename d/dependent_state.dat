Dependent States (Shuguo 屬國) were first established in 121 BC and composed mostly non-Han-Chinese nomadic tribes and confederations who surrendered after negotiation or armed conflict and accepted Han suzerainty. They served as a buffer between Han territory and hostile tribes, such as the Xiongnu, and {{as a means to}} quell tribes in the Ordos Desert. The Han court appointed a Commandant (Duwei 都尉), also known as Chief Commandant, ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, to govern the non-Han-Chinese populations of each <b>Dependent</b> <b>State.</b> The Director of Dependent States' title was abolished in 28 BC; his duties and his subordinates, the Commandants, became the responsibilities of the Minister Herald. The Protectorate of the Western Regions, established in 60 BC, which conducted foreign affairs with the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, was not the responsibility of the Director of Dependent States.|$|E

2500|$|The {{role of the}} Russians in this {{revolution}} (and later in the revolution of 1921) has been controversial. Chinese historians especially have often explained the events of 1911 {{as the product of}} [...] "Tsarist provocations and manipulations". This conclusion however contradicts with archival materials from Russia and Mongolia. The movement for independence in Outer Mongolia was to a large extent the reaction to the new Qing policies aimed at assimilating the Mongols by Han Chinese. Russian imperial government preferred to see Outer Mongolia as a buffer state against Chinese and Japanese influences on the Russian borders in Siberia, a <b>dependent</b> <b>state</b> or autonomy of China. The revolution also reflected a growing sense of nationalism {{on the part of the}} Mongolians, and their desire to form a nation state, political and social forces that were at work in China at that time as well.|$|E

The position of those Native Americans, he said, {{was that they had}} by treaty become dependent states, but according to Vattel, they had not in doing so surrendered their sovereignty. Considering the position of a <b>dependent</b> <b>state</b> that [...] "does not resist the encroachments of the superior power... preserves a profound silence when it may and ought to speak", the Judge said that over time such silence may become consent. However, the silence must be voluntary, and if such silence is the result of fear or oppression, then that is not the case. In any event, he concluded, the many violent clashes between the Aboriginal people and the white settlers [...] "make it... sufficiently manifest that the Aboriginal tribes are neither a conquered people, nor have tacitly acquiesced in the supremacy of the settlers." ...|$|E

Lord Howe then entered into a discourse of considerable length, but made no explicit proposition of peace, nor promise of redress of grievances, excepting on condition that the colonies should return to their allegiance. This, the commissioners replied, was not now to be expected.

6000|$|The head of {{a family}} is so now in {{something}} of a corporeal sense. From him emanate all its actions; to him are responsible all its parts. Any other member of it is as incapable of individual expression as is the hand, or the foot, or the eye of man. Indeed, Confucian doctors of divinity might appropriately administer psychically to the egoistic the rebuke of the Western physician to the too self-analytic youth who, finding that, after eating, his digestion failed to give him what he considered its proper sensations, had come to consult the doctor as to how it ought to feel. [...] "Feel! young man," [...] he was answered, [...] "you {{ought not to be}} aware that you have a digestion." [...] So with them, a normally constituted son knows not what it is to possess a spontaneity of his own. Indeed, this very word [...] "own," [...] which so long ago in our own tongue took to itself the symbol of possession, well exemplifies his <b>dependent</b> <b>state.</b> China furnishes the most conspicuous instance of the want of individual rights. A Chinese son cannot properly be said to own anything. The title to the land he tills is vested absolutely in the family, of which he is an undivided thirtieth, or what-not. Even the administration of the property is not his, but resides in the family, represented by its head. The outward symbols of ownership testify to the fact. The bourns that mark the boundaries of the fields bear the names of families, not of individuals. The family, as such, is the proprietor, and its lands are cultivated and enjoyed in common by all the constituents of the clan. In the tenure of its real estate, the Chinese family much resembles the Russian Mir. But so far as his personal state is concerned, the Chinese son outslaves the Slav. For he lives at home, under the immediate control of the paternal will--in the most complete of serfdoms, a filial one. Even existence becomes a communal affair. From the family mansion, or set of mansions, in which all its members dwell, to the family mausoleum, to which they will all eventually be borne, a man makes his life journey in strict company with his kin.|$|E

The adverse conditions of resource dependence push populations into trafficking networks while traffickers and trafficking victims are drawn to economic opportunity in more stable regional trade partners. This theory is tested using ordinal logistic and OLS regression, utilizing cross sectional and time series datasets that capture both trafficking flows and state efforts to combat trafficking. The analyses support the theoretical expectation that economic linkage between resource <b>dependent</b> <b>states</b> and industrial states is positively associated with human trafficking rates for both destination and source countries.
