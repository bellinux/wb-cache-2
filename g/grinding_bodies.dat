40|$|The mechanochemical {{activation}} (dry grinding) causes {{destruction in}} the crystal structure of kaolinite by the rupture of the O–H, Al–OH, Al–O–Si, and Si–O bonds. The major mineral constituents of natural kaolins are kaolinite and quartz. In this study, the attention was mainly {{directed to the}} role of quartz content (4, 25, 50, and 75 wt%) in the mechanochemical amorphization of kaolinite. Grinding experiments were carried out for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h in a planetary mill. The rate of destruction of the kaolinite structure was followed by X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectrometry. The distortion and rupture of the kaolinite structure induced by grinding was reflected in line broadening, increases in mean lattice strain, and reduction of peak areas (intensities). The increased quartz content resulted in acceleration of the mechanically induced amorphization of the kaolinite structure. The crystalline order of kaolinite was completely destroyed after grinding the sample containing 75 wt% quartz for 4 h. On the other hand, 4 h of grinding was sufficient only to cause some increase in the defect density of kaolinite in the case of samples with lower quartz contents (25 and 4 wt%). The results indicate that quartz grains act as <b>grinding</b> <b>bodies</b> during the intensive dry grinding of kaolinite...|$|E
40|$|Grinding {{process is}} {{characterized}} by high energy consumption and low productivity. Nowadays efficiency of the ball mills applied for grinding is rather low. Only 3 - 6 % of the supplied power energy is used for material grinding. The rest part of the energy disappears {{in the form of}} heat, vibration and noise. So matter concerning reduction of energy consumption is of great importance. Improvement of efficiency and quality of technological process in grinding of raw material components while producing construction materials is considered as one of priority-oriented targets of power- and resource saving in construction industry with the purpose to reduce energy consumption for grinding. Grinding efficiency at operating enterprises is reasonable to improve by modernization of the equipment and existing technological, management and other processes which are related to grinding of mineral raw material. In order to reduce grinding power consumption it is necessary to carry out a complex re-engineering of technological process in grinding of various materials which is based on usage of new modifications of <b>grinding</b> <b>bodies,</b> physical and chemical grinding aids, modern information technologies and industrial automation equipment. Application of modern information technologies and industrial automation equipment makes it possible to execute the grinding process with maximum achievable productivity for existing capacity due to automatic control and consideration of continuous changes in technological parameters. In addition to this such approach gives an opportunity to control processes in real time by immediate adjustments of technological equipment operational modes. The paper considers an approach to the development of re-engineering methodology for technological process in grinding of raw material components while producing construction materials. The present state of technological grinding process is presented in the paper. The paper points out the necessity to modernize technological equipment used for grinding raw material components with the purpose to improve efficiency and quality, power- and resource saving. The possibility of using various grinding aids that permit to increase grinding productivity is shown in the paper. The paper studies an automation concept of the control system which used for grinding process of mineral raw material. A conceptual model for complexation of various methods grinding aids has been proposed in the paper. The paper presents methodological principles for simulation of technological process used for processing of mineral raw material while producing cement and silicate products. The parameters which are to be controlled and which are necessary for development of computer simulations of technological grinding process have been determined in the paper. The paper justifies an application of imitation simulation for creation of computer models. Methodology for imitation simulation of the technological process has been studied in the paper. The paper confirms the possibility to use analytical and probability methods. Imitation simulations of a grinding mill operation have been developed on the basis of experimental data and probability functions. The possibility of controlling technological process of raw material grinding has been demonstrated in the paper. While implementing the proposed complex of organizational and technical recommendations it is possible to increase grinding productivity up to 30 - 50 % and significantly reduce и существенно снизить energy consumption for mineral raw material grinding during production of cement and silicate products.

40|$|This {{article from}} the {{analysis}} of the power consumption of the ball mill and the work characteristic of the motor, analyzes the fault reason of ball mill transmission equipment. The paper mainly deals with a side-transmission ball mill. The main fault is about the breakdown in the elastic rubber coupling of the transmission system. It is found {{from the analysis}} of the real cases and data that the actual power consumption is increased and it is caused by the overload. The main parameters which influence the ball mill power consumption are load of the mill, feed material mass, ball mill rotational speed and friction. The main part of power consumption for ball mill is used to elevating <b>grinding</b> <b>body</b> and material, a portion is used to overcome the friction force between the main bearing. Under the conditions in which the load of the mill and feed material mass are kept the same, the parameters which influence the ball mill power consumption are rotational speed and friction status. When the ball mill voltage decreased, according to the motor characteristics, its rotation speed will decrease, which will disrupt the hydrodynamic lubrication state of the hollow shaft and spherical surface, so that the power consumption of the ball mill increase. The larger power leads to the transmission fault. This paper also put forward to make sure kept the ball mill main bearing lubrication status. </p...|$|R

Due to {{existence}} of relative motion between the <b>grinding</b> machine <b>body</b> and working table, the manufacturing error of guide track {{would result in}} a considerable grinding error inevitably. Thus the guide direction error becomes the most important static error source for longitudinal cylindrical grinding. In this paper, an error compensation system based on industrial computer was developed and used to counteract the guide direction error. In order to verify the performance of the proposed system, several grinding experiments were carried out. The experimental results show that the grinding error due to guide track error reduces by about 33 % using the error compensation system...|$|R

40|$|The seven-thousand-line Middle English romance, Richard Coer de Lyon, is {{not often}} read as a text fascinated with machinery. The semi-historical, superlative, titular {{character}} and his various marvelous and deeply disturbing deeds usually claim most attention, and not without reason. There is much to examine in the heroically cannibalistic Richard, who presents a complex and often troubling vision of the ways both Englishness and the Saracen Other can be constructed within romance. Alongside these well-studied qualities, however, is a strange attention within the text to sieges and siege engines. Richard’s army {{is accompanied by a}} large, named siege tower and a countless conglomeration of throwing engines such as trébuchets, ballistas, crossbows, and mangonels. One device in particular, the mill aboard one of Richard’s ships, a machination designed to look like it <b>grinds</b> dead <b>bodies,</b> seems to perform an explicitly symbolic function. While the mill becomes a useful psychological weapon against the fictional Saracen army, I argue that it principally serves as a manifestation of some of the core ideological movements of the romance, a physical representation of the budding English identity that destroys the Saracen Other in order to create sustenance for the English community. This transformative and destructive process relies upon a body of technical knowledge shared only among the crusading army and the English reader, a manufactured community represented by the construction and operation of complex machines...|$|R
