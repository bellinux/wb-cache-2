Two closely related Japanese phytophagous ladybird beetles, Henosepilachna vigintioctomaculata and H. pustulosa, show several <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers,</b> including {{reduction in the}} number of heterospecific sperm in the female reproductive tract and low egg-hatching rates in interspecific matings. However, the mechanisms of these two potential <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers</b> and the association between them are unknown. Here we investigated temporal changes in the number of sperm stored in the female reproductive tract and egg-hatching rates in inter- and intraspecific crosses between these species. Although the number of sperm decreased after both inter- and intraspecific crosses, the reduction was more drastic in inter- than in intraspecific crosses for females of both species. Most of the sperm reduction occurred early on, during sperm transfer from the bursa copulatrix to the paired ampullae of the common oviduct (the sperm storage organs). These two species also demonstrated stably low egg-hatching rates in interspecific crosses. Since the degree and timing of the sperm reduction did not correlate with egg-hatching rates, the reduction in heterospecific sperm in interspecific crosses may not directly cause the low hatching rates.

I used a genome scan approach to identify genomic regions that are highly diverged between red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes of the bush monkeyflower (Mimulus aurantiacus). The ecotypes, which are distributed in San Diego County, are partially reproductively isolated from one another by pollinator preferences despite ongoing gene flow between them.

Evolutionary biologists and population geneticists have been exploring varying theories and models for explaining population structure.

This study explores the locations of reproductive barriers between interspecific Corymbia hybrids and investigates the reproductive success of a wide taxonomic range of C. torelliana hybrid crosses. Methods: Pollen, pistil and embryo development were investigated for four C. torelliana crosses (×C. torelliana, ×C. citriodora subsp. citriodora, ×C. tessellaris and ×C. intermedia) using fluorescent and standard microscopy to identify the locations of interspecific reproductive <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers.</b> Corymbia torelliana was also crossed with 16 taxa, representing six of the seven Corymbia sections, both Corymbia subgenera and one species each from the related genera, Angophora and Eucalyptus. All crosses were assessed for capsule and seed yields. Key Results: Interspecific C. torelliana hybridization was controlled by pre-zygotic reproductive <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers</b> inhibiting pollen adhesion to the stigma, pollen germination, pollen tube growth in the style and pollen tube penetration of the micropyle. Corymbia torelliana (subgenus Blakella, sect. Torellianae) was successfully hybridized with Corymbia species from subgenus Blakella, particularly C. citriodora subsp. citriodora, C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C. henryi (sect.

Attempted intergeneric hybrids between C. torelliana and either Angophora floribunda or Eucalyptus pellita were unsuccessful. Conclusions: Corymbia hybrids were formed between species from different sections and subgenera, but not with species from the related genera Angophora or Eucalyptus. Reproductive isolation between the interspecific Corymbia hybrid crosses was controlled by early- and late-acting pre-zygotic <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers,</b> with reproductive success generally decreasing with increasing taxonomic distance between parent species.

To model the imperfectness of the interface, we introduce a δ- function scattering potential barrier lying close to the interface of the junction. The magnetoconductance oscillations (MCO) in this system stem from two sources: one is the interference of wave functions of quasi-particles due to multiple Andreev reflections at the interface; the other is attributed to the variation {{of the number of}} the propagation modes when introducing the <b>isolating</b> <b>barrier</b> layer.

I examined two potential prezygotic reproductive <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers</b> (flowering phenology and pollinator specialisation), and two potential postzygotic barriers (pre-dispersal seed predation and hybrid seed germination). I used null models to test whether Celmisia species had temporally segregated flowering times, and found that some Celmisia are temporally segregated and thus less likely to form hybrids. I used experimental pair-wise flowering arrays to observe insect visitation to six different Celmisia species pairs. While I found {{no difference in the}} overall pollinator community, several insect families showed preferences for some Celmisia species. Furthermore, I found that subtle floral character differences were driving these insect preferences. In particular, I found scape height to be positively associated with insect visitation with taller Celmisia being favoured over shorter species. Insect preferences did not translate into strong floral constancy, therefore indicating that Celmisia flower visitors are likely to be a weak barrier to hybridisation. I reared a range of insect seed predators from field-collected capitula of the hybrid C. x pseudolyallii and both parent species (C. lyallii and C. spectabilis). There was no overall difference in the number of seed-predators per capitulum between hybrid and parent Celmisia taxa. I collected and sowed seeds from three Celmisia hybrids and their parent species in order to test whether hybrids were less fertile than their parent species.

In microchiropteran bats, sympatric species have evolved the use of different acoustic niches and subtly different echolocation signals to avoid competition among species. In this study, we examined whether similar adaptations are at play among sympatric porpoise species that use NBHF echolocation clicks. We used a six-element hydrophone array to record harbour and Dall’s porpoises in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and harbour porpoises in Denmark. The click source properties of all porpoise groups were remarkably similar and had an average directivity index of 25 dB. Yet there was a small, but consistent and significant 4 kHz difference in centroid frequency between sympatric Dall’s (13763 kHz) and Canadian harbour porpoises (14162 kHz).

However, recent molecular data have challenged this view, encouraging further work in this species complex. Here we reevaluated the taxonomic status between the North-Western African Tawny Owl, S. a. mauritanica, and its closest Iberian Tawny Owl population (from the S. a. sylvatica to S. a. aluco clade) separated by the Strait of Gibraltar. The Tawny Owl is a non-migratory and territorial species, and juvenile dispersal is restricted to a few kilometers around the natal site. This limited dispersal and the barrier imposed by the Strait of Gibraltar predicted a strong differentiation between the two populations. We tested this using DNA barcoding, Bayesian phylogenetic and species delimitation analysis. We found that an 81. 1 % of variation {{is due to the}} intergroups variation. In addition, the inter-intraspecific distances distribution revealed a barcoding gap among the two subspecies. Also, posterior probabilities and the PAB value allowed to reject the hypothesis that observed degree of distinctiveness is due to random coalescence processes.

In this study, we use Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping based on 293 codominant SNP markers in an F 2 population (n = 328) to assess the size, magnitude, and location of the genetic regions controlling floral traits known to be important for pollinator attraction in 2 species of Lousiana Irises, Iris fulva and Iris hexagona. We also evaluate correlations among F 2 traits and identify transgression in the hybrid population. Overall, we observe that differences in most floral traits between I. fulva and I. hexagona are controlled by multiple QTLs and are distributed across several linkage groups. We also find evidence of transgression at several QTL, suggesting that hybridization can contribute to generating phenotypic variation, which may be adaptive in rapidly changing environments.

Allozyme analyses showed that differentiation among 21 populations within the Ross Dependency was high (FST = 0. 55) with two main groups each representing a distinct geographical region: (1) Ross Island and Beaufort Island; and (2) all continental sites. Ross Island populations showed low levels of differentiation (FST = 0. 05) and no correlation with geographical distance, suggesting their derivation from a single glacial refuge. By contrast, continental regions revealed moderate levels of differentiation (FST = 0. 27) and a strong correlation with geographical distance, indicating a much older history with several refugia likely. Two sympatric allozyme genotypes were found at three continental sites from Taylor Valley and were congruent with two mtDNA haplotypes, implying nonrandom breeding groups. Although haplotype sharing between one Ross Island site (Cape Bird) and one continental site (Granite Harbour) was identified, the clades showed mostly fragmented allopatric distributions.

Here, we address these questions, providing historical background and offering some new perspectives. A topic of great recent interest is the role of ecology in speciation. “Ecological speciation ” is defined as the case in which divergent selection leads to reproductive isolation, with speciation under uniform selection, polyploid speciation, and speciation by genetic drift defined as “nonecological. ” We review these proposed cases of nonecological speciation and conclude that speciation by uniform selection and polyploidy normally involve ecological processes. Furthermore, because selection can impart reproductive isolation both directly through traits under selection and indirectly through pleiotropy and linkage, it is much more effective in producing isolation than genetic drift. We thus argue that natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation, and given the many ways in which stochastic and deterministic factors may interact during divergence, we question whether the ecological speciation concept is useful. We also suggest that geographic isolation caused by adaptation to different habitats plays a major, and largely neglected, role in speciation. We thus provide a framework for incorporating geographic isolation into the biological species concept (BSC) by separating ecological from historica...|$|E
40|$|Migratory divides {{are thought}} to {{facilitate}} behavioral, ecological, and genetic divergence among populations with different migratory routes. However, it is currently contentious how much genetic divergence is needed to maintain distinct migratory behavior across migratory divides. Here we investigate patterns of neutral genetic differentiation among Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) populations with different migratory strategies across Europe. We compare the level of genetic divergence of populations migrating to southwestern (SW) or southeastern (SE) wintering areas with birds wintering in the British Isles following a recently established northwesterly (NW) migration route. The migratory divide between SW and SE wintering areas {{can be interpreted as}} a result of a re-colonization process after the last glaciation. Thus we predicted greater levels of genetic differentiation among the SW/SE populations. However, a lack of genetic differentiation was found between SW and SE populations, suggesting that interbreeding likely occurs among Blackcaps with different migratory orientations across a large area; therefore the SW/SE migratory divide can be seen as diffuse, broad band and is, at best, a weak <b>isolating</b> <b>barrier.</b> Conversely, weak, albeit significant genetic differentiation was evident between NW and SW migrants breeding sympatrically in southern Germany, suggesting a stronger isolating mechanism may be acting in this population. Populations located within/near the SW/SE contact zone were the least genetically divergent from NW migrants, confirming NW migrants likely originated from within the contact zone. Significant isolation-by-distance was found among eastern Blackcap populations (i. e. SE migrants), but not among western populations (i. e. NW and SW migrants), revealing different patterns of genetic divergence among Blackcap populations in Europe. We discuss possible explanations for the genetic structure of European Blackcaps and how gene flow influences the persistence of divergent migratory behaviors...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{isolation}} {{is essential for}} the process of speciation and much has been learned in recent years about the ecology and underlying genetics of reproductive barriers. But plant species are typically isolated not by a single factor, but by a large number of different pre- and postzygotic barriers, and their potentially complex interactions. This phenomenon has often been ignored to date. Recent studies of the relative importance of different <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers</b> between plant species pairs concluded that prezygotic {{isolation is}} much stronger than postzygotic isolation. But studies of the patterns of reproductive isolation in plants did not find that prezygotic isolation evolves faster than postzygotic isolation, in contrast to most animals. This {{may be due to the}} multiple premating <b>barriers</b> that <b>isolate</b> most species pairs, some of which may be controlled by few genes of major effect and evolve rapidly, whereas others have a complex genetic architecture and evolve more slowly. Intrinsic postzygotic isolation in plants is correlated with genetic divergence, but some instrinsic postzygotic barriers evolve rapidly and are polymorphic within species. Extrinsic postzygotic barriers are rarely included in estimates of different components of reproductive isolation. Much remains to be learned about ecological and molecular interactions among <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers.</b> The role of reinforcement and reproductive character displacement in the evolution of premating barriers is an open topic that deserves further study. At the molecular level, chromosomal and genic isolation factors may be associated and act in concert to mediate reproductive isolation, but their interactions are only starting to be explored...|$|R
50|$|In electrochemistry, {{polarization}} is {{a collective}} term for certain mechanical side-effects (of an electrochemical process) by which <b>isolating</b> <b>barriers</b> develop at {{the interface between}} electrode and electrolyte. These side-effects influence the reaction mechanisms, {{as well as the}} chemical kinetics of corrosion and metal deposition.in a reaction we can displace the bonding electrons by attacking reagents. The electronic displacement in turn may be due to certain effects,some of which are permanent (inductive and mesomeric effects) and the others are temporary (electromeric effect). those effects which are permanently operating in the molecule,are known as polarization effects. and those effects which are brought into play by attacking reagent and as the attacking reagent is removed,the electronic displacement disappears known as polarisability effects.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that when an {{isolated}} porous windbreak is represented by a sink in the mean momentum equations, even the simplest turbulence closures lead to reasonably good simulations of the mean wind close to the barrier, irrespective {{of whether or not}} sources are introduced in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and dissipation rate () equations. However, unless the barrier is considered to dissipate TKE in addition to opposing the mean flow, the pattern of turbulence is poorly simulated. Here we examine the performance of simple Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) wind models for the case of a windbreak network, relative to the field experiment of McAneney and Judd (15 porous fences, height h = 2 m, spaced at Dx/h = 6 along the mean wind). All closures we considered gave mediocre predictions even for the mean flow, contrasting with the case of an isolated barrier; while, just as for the <b>isolated</b> <b>barrier,</b> prediction of the TKE in a windbreak network hinges on ambiguous choices in the treatment of TKE (and) sources at the barriers. The additional turbulence generated by a sequence of barriers implies that a proper representation of the Reynolds stress is more critical than {{in the case of an}} <b>isolated</b> <b>barrier,</b> near which the pressure-gradient force dominates. This surely accentuates the importance of the turbulence closure, and our results may imply that no existing RANS turbulence closure is adequate for this type of flow. However, the problem could alternatively stem from the treatment of sinks parameterising the flow–fence interaction, not only in the TKE and -equations (where perforce such terms are heuristic), but even in the momentum equations...|$|R
