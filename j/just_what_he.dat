5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
500|$|Elijah Muhammad {{told the}} annual Savior's Day {{convention}} on February26, [...] "MalcolmX got <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> preached", but denied any {{involvement with the}} murder. [...] "We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him", Muhammad said. [...] "We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bobby Hatfield {{reportedly}} {{expressed his}} annoyance to Spector {{when he learned}} that Bill Medley would start the first verse alone and he would {{have to wait until the}} chorus before joining Medley’s vocals. Previous to this they would have been given equal prominence in a song. When Hatfield asked Spector <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was supposed to do during Medley’s solo, Spector replied: [...] "You can go directly to the bank!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Slice of punk, with {{an ancient}} lemon on top,” {{finished}} Dave. “It’s <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> been waiting for.” And at this sally {{there was a}} general laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, it'd {{be funny}} if that little Shep, {{just to get}} even with me for tying him up so often, has treed a lion all by himself," [...] commented Jones. [...] "And I'll bet that's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done." ...|$|R
60|$|JOANNA (airily). Nothing. I was <b>just</b> {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing.|$|R
2500|$|Brown {{called his}} team {{together}} {{the night before}} the Test began. His first words were [...] "Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2015 USA Today {{article about}} how the actors of The Cosby Show responded to the allegations, Keshia Knight Pulliam of the cast stated [...] "All I can speak to is the man I know and I {{love the fact that}} he has been such an example [...] you can't take away from the great that he has done, the {{millions}} and millions of dollars he has given back to colleges and education, and <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did with the Cosby Show and how groundbreaking that was. The Cosbys, we were the first family that no matter what race, religion, you saw yourself in", further addressing the charges against Cosby. [...] "At the end of the day they are allegations ... I don't have that story to tell." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 Stewart had a brief, tumultuous {{romance with}} Hollywood queen Norma Shearer, whose husband, Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, had {{died two years}} earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director Frank Capra in 1938, when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to star in You Can't Take It With You. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in Navy Blue and Gold (1937). The director had recently completed several well received films, including It Happened One Night (1934), and {{was looking for the}} right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as Clark Gable, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, [...] "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{burst into}} a half-relieved, half-hysteric laugh. [...] "Are you crazy?" [...] gasped he. [...] "Why, Captain Jim's just huntin' ME down to make ME marry Polly. That's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> the row's about. That's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> interferin' for--just {{to carry out his}} darned fool ideas o' gettin' a wife for me; just his vanity to say HE'S made the match. It's ME that he wants to marry to that Baxter girl--not himself. He's too cursed selfish for that." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the sixth}} one, a dog-like creature, {{resembling}} Marvin K. Mooney, looks in his hand-held mirror and sees <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says and then <b>just</b> says <b>what</b> <b>he</b> sees.|$|R
50|$|Creating {{the earth}} did not {{add to the}} glory of God. It <b>just</b> showed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is capable of doing because of his glory.|$|R

6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is. Everybody knows that. What the deuce {{was the good}} then of our going down there? I couldn't do anything, and I knew he wouldn't. The truth is, Mistletoe, a man now-a-days may do <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> pleases. You ain't in that line and it won't do you any good knowing it, but since we did away with pistols {{everybody}} may do <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> likes." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{assured her}} that she was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had {{expected}} and that time had not stood still with himself.|$|E
60|$|AMAH. No, {{him just}} velly good man. He no can do velly much. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> can. The neighbours, they help little.|$|R

25|$|He {{was signed}} as a free agent by the Blue Jays on January 11, 2005, for $2,500,000, which was <b>just</b> under <b>what</b> <b>he</b> made the two {{previous}} seasons combined.|$|R
6000|$|BLAYNE. That's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would do, damn him. Oh! I say, Anthony, you {{pretend to}} know everything. Have {{you heard about}} Gaddy? ...|$|E
60|$|I was silent. I {{did think}} that that was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to do, but I hardly cared to say so.|$|E
60|$|When {{he said it}} was a patois, I knew <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. It was {{equivalent}} to saying that he couldn't understand it.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{truth in}} that," [...] he remarked. [...] "On the whole {{it might be}} better to leave all {{arrangements}} to the man in charge and <b>just</b> do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> suggests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't say nothing. I didn't stop. I <b>just</b> said <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said I was to {{and then}} I beat it. I {{thought she might}} be going to start weepin'." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{idea that}} Schwartz reminds us through {{this book is}} - ''''To see what can be, not <b>just</b> <b>what</b> is''''. <b>He</b> explains that visualization adds value to everything and thinking big means training oneself to see not <b>just</b> <b>what</b> is, but what can be.|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. Yes, that is <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{will say}} to you. (Vacantly.) It doesn't matter: I shall never see either of you again.|$|E
60|$|This {{left him}} speechless, for he knew, {{in all the}} deeps of his new-found passion, that that was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did want.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, aunt; that is <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done. And, therefore, {{perhaps it}} will not be quite so well that we should travel together." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} hand, not knowing <b>just</b> <b>what</b> to reply. <b>He</b> {{examined}} her fingers with intent gaze.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done--and South American {{freights}} {{higher than}} we'll {{live to see}} them again. He's laid her up to paint her--to paint her--to paint her!' says the little clerk, dancin' like a hen on a hot plate. 'Five thousand ton o' potential freight rottin' in drydock, man; an' he dolin' the paint out in quarter-pound tins, for it cuts him to the heart, mad though he is. An' the Grotkau--the Grotkau of all conceivable bottoms--soaking up every pound that should be ours at Liverpool!' ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{laid down}} his bundle {{and thought of}} his misfortune. And <b>just</b> <b>what</b> {{pleasure}} had <b>he</b> found, since he came into this world? ...|$|R

6000|$|He smiled his fatuous smile. 'That's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> I say,' <b>he</b> answered. 'Why the jooce {{introduce}} them? But don't snap my head off!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's <b>just</b> it--just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "I've got---- But wait," [...] {{cried the}} shipowner's son, {{interrupting}} himself. [...] "I'll plan this thing out. You shall all be my guests later on," [...] he added, mysteriously.|$|R
