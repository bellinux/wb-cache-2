50|$|The <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennant</b> {{patterns}} are commonly found {{patterns in the}} price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc.).

60|$|From {{the deck}} of the Amoz I scanned the shore through the glasses that Perry had brought with him. When we were close enough for the glasses to be of value I saw that there was indeed a vast {{concourse}} of warriors entirely encircling the walled-village of Goork, chief of the Thurians. As we approached smaller objects became distinguishable. It was then that I discovered numerous <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> floating above the army of the besiegers.|$|E
60|$|On Christmas day {{he went to}} Carlton Hall. It was {{a chance}} {{he did not want}} to miss, for very few {{students}} would be there. As it turned out he spent some pleasant hours. But before he left the club his steps led him into the athletic trophy room, and there he was plunged into grief. The place was all ablaze with <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants,</b> silver cups and gold medals, pictures of teams and individuals. There were mounted sculls and oars, footballs and baseballs. The long and proud record of the university was there to be read. All her famous athletes were pictured there, and every one who had fought for his college. Ken realized that here for the first time he was in the atmosphere of college spirit for which the university was famed. What would he not have given for a permanent place in that gallery! But it was too late. He had humiliated the captain of the baseball team. Ken sought out the picture of the last season's varsity. What a stocky lot of young chaps, all consciously proud of the big letter on their shirts! Dale, the captain and pitcher, was in the centre of the group. Ken knew his record, and it was a splendid one. Ken took another look at Dale, another at the famous trainer, Murray, and the professional coach, Arthurs--men under whom it had been his dream to play--and then he left the room, broken-hearted.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flag was}} {{designed}} {{in a contest}} conceived by Springfield resident and famed poet Vachel Lindsay. The contest {{was sponsored by the}} Springfield Art Association and its winner was S.T. Wallace. The Springfield city council adopted the flag design on October 22, 1917 and it was first displayed on November 8, 1917. Today the flag is adorned with the word [...] "Springfield, Illinois." [...] Older photographs, dated May 14, 1953, show the flag, absent its lettering. Indeed, the Springfield Code of Ordinances makes no stipulation for the lettering which appears on the current flag. Instead, it describes a [...] "pennant," [...] similar in description to the flag. The pennant is described as containing the same elements and proportions as the flag, with the addition of the words. In the code the <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennant</b> are described as two separate entities.|$|R

5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign <b>and</b> the <b>pennant</b> of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> red <b>pennants,</b> a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|R

60|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} for a man-of-war to communicate with a merchant vessel, or with some other war-ship belonging to a foreign country.

There are eighteen <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> a code <b>pennant,</b> corresponding to the consonants of the alphabet, omitting x and z. The code pennant is also used with these signals.|$|R
25|$|The Stanley {{proposal}} {{was placed on}} a wall of the Flag Committee's meeting room in Ottawa with literally hundreds of other <b>flag</b> designs, <b>and</b> eventually was selected {{as one of the}} final three designs for consideration. In a classic Canadian compromise, the Stanley design, which was supported by the sole NDP member (Reid Scott) on the Flag Committee, beat out John Diefenbaker's flag (a combination of fleurs-de-lis, a maple leaf <b>and</b> the Union <b>Flag)</b> <b>and</b> the Pearson <b>Pennant</b> (three red leaves conjoined on a stem set against a white background with blue bars on either side—a flag proposal designed by Alan Beddoe).|$|R

5000|$|In 1924 the Hydrographic Office {{was renamed}} the 'Central Hydrographic Department of the USSR' {{and a set}} of new <b>flags</b> <b>and</b> <b>pennants</b> was issued.

They had hoisted the black <b>flag</b> <b>and</b> the red <b>pennant,</b> but no answer came from the shore. Craddock strained his eyes, hoping every instant to see a boat shoot out to them with Sharkey seated in the sheets.

50|$|For over 100 years, display {{stations}} were established at yacht clubs, marinas, and Coast Guard stations to hoist <b>flags,</b> <b>pennants</b> <b>and</b> colored lights to warn mariners of storms at sea. The display {{stations were}} individually notified by the National Weather Service {{to raise the}} signals and again to lower them when the hazards passed. The National Weather Service paid for the visual signals; however, the display stations were operated by other agencies or volunteers. Although the Coastal Warning Display program has been formally discontinued, U.S. Coast Guard and other stations may continue to display warning signals without the direct participation of the National Weather Service.|$|R
