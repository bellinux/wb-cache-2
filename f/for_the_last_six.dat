The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E

Also because of the species ability to persist given the heavy grazing that occurred in the park, the wild populations of the plant looks likely to remain for at least another 50–100 years. The lack of recruitment is a concern for the survival of the plant in the long-term. A possible reason for its rarity is most likely the result of natural evolutionary and ecological processes.|$|E

25|$|In 1929 Alfredo Binda won {{a record}} eight {{consecutive}} stages {{on the way}} to his third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory. This Giro began in Rome, which was the second time that the Giro had not started in Milan in the history of its running.

The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire— {{the same amount of money}} the winner of the Giro would get— not to participate in the Giro. Binda's absence left the field open for everyone else. The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race.

25|$|England set {{themselves}} up well against Australia, {{but failed to}} hit out in the last over thanks to some accurate and fierce bowling from Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who had earlier hit 38 not out with the bat to lift Australia to 222 for 7 after three for 39 from Clare Connor. Arran Brindle continued on her magnificent form from the first Test, when she made a fifty and a hundred, and in partnerships with Jenny Gunn and Claire Taylor she lifted the English to 198 for 4 with her score of 81. With only 25 runs left to hit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets, it {{was there for the}} taking. But Fitzpatrick returned, having taken the wicket of Laura Newton earlier on, and she took three more wickets as the English lower order were strangled - and collapsed to 210 all out with five balls remaining in the innings. Fitzpatrick ended with figures of four for 19 from 10 overs, and Emma Liddell also took three for 29.|$|E
25|$|In week 11 of the 2002 season, McNabb {{suffered}} a broken ankle. On the third {{play of the}} game against the Arizona Cardinals, he was sacked by the Cardinals' Adrian Wilson and LeVar Woods. He fumbled the ball, fell to the ground, and held his right leg. He went to the locker room to have his ankle taped, but returned for the Eagles' second drive. His injury was reported to be a sprained ankle, but X-rays after the game revealed that McNabb had broken his fibula in three places. During the game, however, he was 20-of-25 passing, with 255 yards and four touchdowns. McNabb was out <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> weeks of the regular season. A dominant defense helped A. J. Feeley and Koy Detmer go a combined 5-1 to finish the season. McNabb returned to face the Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs, but he recovered slowly. The Eagles defeated the Falcons 20–6, but were upset at home by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27–10 in the NFC championship game. Following the broken ankle, McNabb's willingness to run decreased, and his rushing statistics never matched the high standards set in his first 4 years.|$|E
