5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E

5|$|The episode begins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comic book; FBI {{special agent}} Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Shaineh Berkowitz (Pattie Tierce), a single mother {{who claims to have}} been mysteriously impregnated, while unconscious, by an unknown presence 18years ago, resulting in the birth of her son, Izzy (Stewart Gale). Now, following a similarly unexplained attack, she is pregnant again. She has heard about Mulder's expertise in the paranormal from The Jerry Springer Show and wants him to investigate. Mulder and his partner, special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), travel to rural Albion, Indiana. They meet Shaineh and her son Izzy and learn that the description of the creature that attacked her, with a lumpy head and two mouths, is very similar to a comic book character invented by Izzy. His monstrous creation, called The Great Mutato, is inspired by a mysterious creature that has been seen by many of the locals. Izzy and his friends take the agents to a wooded area where they see Mutato (Chris Owens) from a distance.|$|E

5|$|The {{subordinate}} {{relationship between}} the CMF and Regular Army was further underlined when the national service scheme was re-introduced in 1965, albeit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> selective ballot. Whereas previous incarnations of the system had not allowed for national servicemen to be sent overseas (within various definitions of that term), the new scheme was implemented with {{the express purpose of}} sending these recruits overseas as Australia's commitments in the region required a large-scale increase in the Army. Additionally, instead of being used to fill the ranks of the CMF, the scheme was essentially used to expand the Regular Army. Due to the terms of service, national servicemen were required to serve two years full-time in Regular Army units, after which they were required to serve a further three years in the CMF. Despite this, however, potential conscripts were given the option to voluntarily enlist in the CMF prior to their date of birth being announced, thus exempting them from being drafted for overseas service. Due to the desire of many to avoid being sent overseas, {{as a result of this}} option, it was estimated that by 1968 almost half of the 35,000 men in the CMF had joined to avoid being drafted.|$|E
5|$|The troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach, {{to compete}} for the champion's portion at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire will accept the result. Cú Roí mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hideous churl and {{challenging}} them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who picks up his head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Other examples include the 13th century French Life of Caradoc and the English romances The Turke and Gowin, and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E
5|$|While {{willing to}} accept his death and allow Momohime her {{remaining}} time in her body, Kongiku shows them another way to Heaven. There, Yukinojo appears and reveals {{that he had the}} Dark Resurrection all along. They are then attacked by Fudo-Myoou, who is there to deliver divine justice upon Jinkuro. In the first ending, Jinkuro allows himself to be sent to Yomi while Momohime lives; she decides to forgo her marriage to Yukinojo and become a Buddhist nun in the hope of saving Jinkuro's soul through prayer. In the second ending, Momohime and Jinkuro are intercepted by Kisuke and Yuzuruha, resulting in Kongiku being robbed of her human form as punishment for her defiance. Though defeated, Kisuke delivers a fatal wound to Momohime, forcing Jinkuro to merge his soul with Momohime's to save her: this act leaves her an amnesiac but grants her Jinkuro's sword fighting abilities, which become legendary as she travels Japan in search of her missing memories. In the third ending, after the battle with Fudo-Myoou Jinkuro is transported to the night he first attacked Yukinojo and Momohime with the power of the Oboro Muramasa Demon Blade, which can defy the passage of fate. He chooses not to attack them, then later possesses Yukinojo's body and uses that position to ensure Momohime's safety and her family's security. Momohime herself lives to be one hundred years old and bears three children, while Kongiku remains close to Jinkuro <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guise</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> servant.|$|E
