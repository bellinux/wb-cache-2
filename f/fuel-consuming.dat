50|$|Fuel hedging is a {{contractual}} tool {{some large}} fuel consuming companies, such as airlines, cruise lines and trucking companies, use {{to reduce their}} exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. A fuel hedge contract is a futures contract that allows a <b>fuel-consuming</b> company to establish a fixed or capped cost, via a commodity swap or option. The companies enter into hedging contracts to mitigate their exposure to future fuel prices that may be higher than current prices and/or to establish a known fuel cost for budgeting purposes. If such a company buys a fuel swap {{and the price of}} fuel declines, the company will effectively be forced to pay an above-market rate for fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option and the price of fuel increases, the company will receive a return on the option that offsets their actual cost of fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option, which requires an upfront premium cost, much like insurance, and the price of fuel decreases, the company will not receive a return on the option but they will benefit from buying fuel at the then-lower cost.|$|E

40|$|Emissions from {{commercial}} shipping are currently {{the subject of}} intense scrutiny. Among the top <b>fuel-consuming</b> categories of ships and hence air polluters are container vessels. The main reason is their high service speed. Lately, speed reduction has become a very popular operational measure {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and can obviously be used to curb emissions. This paper examines such an operational scenario. Since time at sea increases with slow steaming, there is a parallel and strong interest to investigate possible ways to decrease time in port. One way to do so is to reduce port service time. Another possible way to minimize disruption and maximize efficiency is the prompt berthing of vessels upon arrival. To that effect, a related berthing policy is investigated as a measure to reduce waiting time. The objective of reducing emissions along the maritime inter modal container chain is investigated vis-à-vis reduction in operational costs and other service attributes.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the role that}} technological change and car characteristics have played {{in the rate of}} fuel consumption of vehicles over time. Using data from the Spanish car market from 1988 to 2013, we estimate a reduced form equation that relates fuel consumption with a set of car characteristics. The results for the sales-weighted sample of vehicles show that energy efficiency would have improved by 30 % and 42 % for petrol and diesel cars respectively had car characteristics been held constant at 1988 values. However, the shift to bigger and more <b>fuel-consuming</b> cars reduced the gains from technological progress. Additionally, using the results of the fuel equation we show that, besides a natural growth rate of 1. 1 %, technological progress is affected by both the international price of oil and the adoption of mandatory emission standards. Moreover, according to our estimations, a 1 % growth in GDP would modify car characteristics {{in such a way that}} fuel consumption would increase by around 0. 23 % for petrol cars and 0. 35 % for diesel cars...|$|E
40|$|The {{woodlands}} in {{some parts}} of the Sahel are effectively an open-access resource. Under open access, fuelwood cutters have no incentive to allow for benefits that might accrue if the wooded area were managed rather than mined. Those benefits include sustainable streams of fuelwood, fruits, and other tree products, browse for cattle, and ecological services such as nitrogen fixation and erosion prevention. To remedy this problem, some Sahelian areas have moved to give communities effective control of local woodland resources. To make it easier to analyze the economic cost of such supply-side interventions, the authors present an economic framework and computational method for assessing policy impacts on the cost of woodfuel supplies, and the spatial distribution of biomass, in a particular Sahelian woodland setting. They use spatial data on standing stock and on the costs of transport to market to model a supply curve of fuel to a <b>fuel-consuming</b> location. given an exogenously specified demand, the model simulates, period by period, the extraction, regeneration, and transport of wood fuels. It also permits easy calculation of the dynamic cost of woodfuel depletion.

40|$|Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a multivariable {{advanced}} {{control technique}} widely popular inmany industrial applications {{due to its}} ability to explicitly optimize performance, straightforwardly handling constraints on system variables. However, MPC requires solving a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization problem at each sampling step. This has slowed down its diffusion in embedded applications, in which fast sampling rates are paired with scarce computational capabilities, as in the automotive and aerospace industries. This thesis proposes optimization techniques and controller formulations specifically tailored to embedded applications. First, fixed-point implementations of Dual Gradient Projection (DGP) and Proximal Newton methods are introduced. Detailed convergence analysis {{in the presence of}} round-off errors and algorithm optimizations are presented, and concrete guidelines for selecting the minimum number of fractional and integer bits that guarantee convergence are provided. Moreover, extensive simulations and experimental tests on embedded devices, supported by general-purpose processing units and FPGAs, are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solvers, and to expose the benefits of fixed-point arithmetic in terms of computation speeds and memory requirements. Finally, an embedded MPC application to spacecraft attitude control with reaction wheels actuators is presented. A lightweight controller with specific optimizations is developed, and its good performance evaluated in simulations. Moreover, special MPC formulations that address the problem of reaction wheel desaturation are discussed, where the constraint handling property of MPC is exploited to achieve desaturation without the need of <b>fuel-consuming</b> devices such as thrusters...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a global model of climate policy, {{focusing on the}} choice between tax and cap-and-trade solutions. We assume that {{the world can be}} split into two regions, with two fuels that both lead to carbon emissions. Region A consumes all fuels, and is responsible for defining and implementing climate policy. Region B produces all of fuel 1 (oil), while fuel 2 (interpreted as either coal; natural gas; or renewables) is both produced and consumed in region A. We study three model variants. All involve full policy coordination within each country block, but no coordination across blocks; and all involve an optimal producer tax on fuel 1 by region B. In model 1, region A sets two fuel consumption taxes, one for each fuel. The optimal region A tax on fuel 1 then exceeds the Pigou level as defined by the region; while the tax set on fuel 2 is Pigouvian. Presence of a second fuel in region A reduces region B’s optimal tax on fuel 1. In model 2, region A sets a common carbon tax, which is lower (higher) for fuel 1 (2) than in model 1. In model 3, region A sets a carbon emissions cap. This enhances region B’s strategic position via the trade-off between fuels 1 and 2 in region A, following from the cap. In realistic cases, this leaves region A strategically weaker under a cap policy than under a tax policy, more so the less carbon-intensive the local fuel (2) is. In conclusion, a <b>fuel-consuming</b> and-importing region that determines a climate policy, will typically prefer to set a carbon tax, instead of setting a carbon emissions cap. The main reason is that a tax is more efficient than a cap at extracting rent from fuel (oil) exporters. ...|$|E
