5|$|Bajpayee's sole {{release of}} 2002 was the road thriller Road. He played the {{antagonist}} in the film, a hitchhiker who {{turns out to}} be a psychopathic killer, after taking a lift <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> (played by Vivek Oberoi and Antara Mali). Bajpayee received another Filmfare nomination for Best Performance in a Negative Role, for the film. Pinjar (2003), a period drama, set during the partition of India, was Bajpayee's first release of the year. Directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, the film was based on a Punjabi novel of the same name. He received the National Film Special Jury Award for his performance in the film. He subsequently portrayed Grenadier Yogendra Singh Yadav in J. P. Dutta's ensemble war film LOC Kargil. It was based on the Kargil War, and Bajpayee was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for it. Both the films were commercially unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese Combined Fleet {{was also}} seeking to draw Allied naval forces {{into what was}} hoped to be a decisive battle. Two fleet {{carriers}}— and —and one light carrier——arrived at the main Japanese naval base at Truk Atoll from Japan in early October and joined Shōkaku and Zuikaku. With five carriers fully equipped with air groups, plus their numerous battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, the Japanese Combined Fleet, directed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was confident that it could {{make up for the}} defeat at the Battle of Midway. Apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of air raids on Henderson Field in October, the Japanese carriers and their supporting warships stayed in the northwestern area of the Solomon Islands, out of the battle for Guadalcanal and waiting for a chance to approach and engage the U.S. carriers. With the Japanese Army's next planned major ground attack on Allied forces on Guadalcanal set for 20 October, Yamamoto's warships began to move towards the southern Solomons to support the offensive and to be ready to engage any Allied (primarily U.S.) ships, especially carriers, that approached to support the Allied defenses on Guadalcanal.|$|E

25|$|Rogers' {{second season}} as Somerset captain, 1951, was more {{difficult}} than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, {{but no one else}} apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats.|$|E
