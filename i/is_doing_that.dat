500|$|The episode {{has been}} met with {{critical}} acclaim {{since it has}} aired and {{is considered one of}} the best episodes of The Office by many critics. Travis Fickett of IGN wrote that [...] "this is one of those great episodes of The Office that is hysterical and difficult to watch at the same time." [...] He noted that this was largely due to the fact that [...] "it's not because of something Michael <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> makes you wince. It's because of what's happening to him." [...] He ultimately gave the episode an 8.9/10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. Jay Black of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] was happy The Office was back" [...] but [...] "the only thing [...] worried about was whether it'd still be good" [...] after the writers strike. However, he noted that his fears were put to rest and that [...] "Dinner Party" [...] was [...] "a Barry Bond's-style [...] chemically enhanced mega-home-run." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded this episode with an [...] "A." [...] Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly said that her favorite moment of the episode [...] "was when Jan popped on that song by her former assistant, Hunter." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the family}} arrives in Manhattan, {{they decide to}} split up. Upon arrival at his car, Homer discovers it has been issued many parking tickets and has been wheel clamped. While waiting for a parking officer to come remove the clamp, Homer drinks an {{excessive}} amount of crab juice from a food vendor and needs to urinate, but is afraid to leave his car behind. After several hours of holding it in, he finally goes to the restroom at the South Tower's indoor observation deck, but discovers that {{it is out of}} order and must use the one {{at the top of the}} North Tower. While he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> the officer arrives at the car and, finding no one present, issues another ticket and leaves; Homer's subsequent [...] "D'oh!" [...] echoes across the city. Meanwhile, the rest of the family tours the Statue of Liberty, Little Italy, Chinatown, and the Empire State Building. Bart leaves the group to visit the offices of Mad magazine, and is in awe when he sees Alfred E. Neuman. The family attends a Broadway musical about the Betty Ford Clinic, and then takes a carriage through Central Park to where they are planning to meet Homer.|$|E

When asked what Israel <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> other countries are not, Reeve responded, [...] "They have a very progressive atmosphere here. They have socialized medicine so that doctors and patients do not have the problem of profit or trying to get insurance companies to pay for treatment. They also work very well together. They share their knowledge. This is a country of six million people about the size of Long Island, and everyone works together very tremendously. The people of the country benefit from that." ...|$|E

60|$|And I also {{propose to}} rule out another set of topics from this discussion--simply because if we don't do so we shall have more matter than we can handle {{conveniently}} in the time at our disposal.
