40|$|Abstract: In Central Europe one of {{the most}} {{important}} interchanges between the North Temperate Realm and the Tethyan Realm took place during the Cenomanian along the course of the Elbe Valley <b>Geosuture</b> that separates the Erzgebirge block (part of the Mid European Island during the Cretaceous) from the Lusatian block (West Sudetic Island). Strata of the Lower Cretaceous and the basal portion of Lower Cenomanian are absent in the Elbe Valley <b>Geosuture</b> but a marine transgression in a NW-SE direction occupied a portion of this tract during the late Early Cenomanian and a second incursion from SE to NW occurred during the Late Cenomanian. These transgressions are known to have occurred because of faunal migrations southwards from the North Temperate Realm and northwards from the Tethyan Realm across the Bohemian Basin. Sediments of the first transgression (Lower Cenomanian, dixoni zone) are restricted to the northwestern part of the Elbe Valley <b>Geosuture</b> in the Meissen area for at that time the fluvial Niederschöna Formation occupied the southern part of the Elbe Valley <b>Geosuture</b> and the adjacent Erzgebirge block. Most of the rivers in this system ran eastward but drained toward northern Bohemia. This fluvial environment predominated in the southern part of the Elbe Valley <b>Geosuture</b> and on the adjacent Erzgebirge block...|$|E

40|$|Crustal {{architecture}} can be recognised from Seismic fabric {{characteristics and}} velocity information. Across Phanerozoic eastern Australia, three major crustal sub-divisions are identified from data in southern Queensland. They occur under (west to east) the Nebine Ridge, Taroom Trough and New England Fold Belt, with each crustal sub-division having {{its own internal}} architecture but separated by major bounding structures (geosutures). These features are assessed against evolutionary models for the region. The significant conclusions are as follows: 1. (1) The Nebine Ridge forms the southeastern part of the Thomson Fold Belt but has a crustal architecture distinctly different from that under {{the central part of}} the fold belt, tentatively supporting an evolutionary model involving fragmentation and eastward stretching and thinning of a Precambrian Australian craton. The ridge crust has possibly been considerably altered by Carboniferous plutonism and compressional events. 2. (2) Between the Nebine Ridge and the crust under the Taroom Trough of the Bowen Basin there is a major low-angle (5 - 10 °) <b>geosuture</b> (the Foyleview <b>geosuture),</b> which extends from upper to lower crustal levels along a series of prominent horizons. It was probably active during the major Carboniferous tectonism which severely structured Devonian basins west of the Nebine Ridge. The <b>geosuture</b> forms the southeastern boundary of the Thomson Fold Belt. 3. (3) The crustal architecture under the Taroom Trough has little obvious structure above an outstanding Moho transition zone. However, the prominent Meandarra Gravity Ridge striking along the trough axis highlights the possibility of high-density mafic volcanics within the crust and the probability of a rift model being appropriate early in the trough 2 ̆ 7 s history. The sedimentary basin architecture supports the concept of an early extensional history for the crust within a poorly defined, N-S trending, strike-slip regime. 4. (4) Between the Taroom Trough and the New England Fold Belt we interpret a high-angle <b>geosuture</b> extending through the crust (the Burunga-Mooki <b>geosuture).</b> Reactivation during late Palaeozoic-early Mesozoic times produced a series of reverse faults along the uplifted eastern margin of the trough. Some of these structures are tentatively considered to be positive flower structures above deeper faults with strike-slip movement. The <b>geosuture</b> separates regions with distinctly different Seismic fabrics and played an important role in the formation of the Bowen-Gunne-dah-Sydney Basin system. 5. (5) Within the New England Fold Belt, crustal domains can be recognized associated with late Palaeozoic oroclinal bending and early Mesozoic trans-tensional basins. Major oroclinal bending of the upper crust in the west of the fold belt is interpreted above a mid-crustal detachment (the Texas detachment). In {{the central part of the}} fold belt, the Seismic data support a trans-tensional mechanism for the formation of Triassic basins with steeply dipping bounding faults. Under the east of the fold belt, an imbricate thrust stack/accretionary wedge is clearly imaged above a mid-crustal horizon (the Brisbane mid-crustal detachment). Upper crustal deformation appears to have occurred above this detachment. 6. (6) From the Nebine Ridge to the coast, the Moho is clearly defined below a 3 -km thick Moho transition zone. Hast of the Thomson Fold Belt, the Moho level is identified as a gently undulating feature at 36 - 38 km depth and probably re-established after the major late Palaeozoic tectonic events which formed the crust under the Taroom Trough and New England Fold Belt. This contrasts with the middle Palaeozoic lower crustal/Moho features which appear to be preserved under the Thomson Fold Belt. 7. (7) The thickest crust under the Nebine Ridge (about 44 km) appears to be associated with lower crustal wedging from the east. There is an apparent thinning of the non-sedimentary crust under the deepest basin (Taroom Trough) of about 30...|$|E
40|$|South China, {{composed}} of the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks and the intervening Jiangnan orogenic belt, has been central to {{the debate on the}} tectonic evolution of East Asia. Here we investigate the crustal structure and composition of South China from seismic data employing the H-k stacking technique. Our results show that the composition and seismic structure of the crust in the Jiangnan orogenic belt are identical to those of the Cathaysia Block. Our data reveal a distinct contrast in the crustal structure and composition between the two flanks of the Jiujiang-Shitai buried fault. We propose that the Jiujiang-Shitai buried fault defines a <b>geosuture</b> between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks, and that the felsic lower crust of the Cathaysia Block and the Jiangnan orogenic belt may represent fragments derived from the Gondwana supercontinent.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a geophysical study carried out in northeastern São Paulo State and southwestern Minas Gerais State over an area 80 km wide and 97. 5 km long in SE Brazil. The Bouguer anomaly map, and geological and structural data allowed to identify three different gravity domains - crustal blocks limited by major discontinuities -related to the structural pattern of the area. These discontinuities were interpreted as <b>geosuture</b> zones underlying the Paraná Basin sediments which have extensions in the Pre-cambrian Basement. The crustal discontinuities named Alterosa and Ribeirão Preto may be seen as A - type collision sutures in a triple junction arramgement. Two prominent linear anomalies are recognized in the Bouguer anomaly map, as well as the limit between the Brasilia and São Paulo crustal blocks or paleoplates. The Alterosa suture zone trends NW-SE while the Ribeirão Preto suture has a NE-SW direction. The Bouguer anomaly map provides subsidies and information on new concepts and theories leading to the refinement of tectonic models...|$|E
40|$|The {{geomorphology}} of {{the area}} of the Nahr el Kebir is of considerable interest since it is very rich in both Quaternary shorelines and fluviatile terraces, in which there are numerous flint artifacts. 1. General View The Nahr el Kebir lies between two different geological areas : one is the Baer and Bassit mountainous area to the North, with greenstone rocks (ophiolites) which were formed here in the Maestrichtian; the other is the Alaouite mountain range to the South, an anticline of Jurassic and Cretaceous carbonaceous rocks. Between these two mountain areas there was once an important Neogene gulf, in which sedimentation was mainly marly. Deposits of Pliocene age are very thick in the lower valley of the Nahr el Kebir (460 m of marls). According to Soviet geologists, the Nahr el Kebir lies exactly along an important accident, a <b>geosuture,</b> separating the Arabian Platform from the Tauric structure. This accident {{does not seem to have}} moved to any great extent during the Quaternary. The lower part of the Nahr el Kebir valley has cut widely into Pliocene marls, and is sometimes 6 km wide. It is incised in a plateau, smoothly sloping towards the West, and forming a glacis; in the South this is exclusively cut into the Pliocene, but also into rocks of different age and hardness in the North. The fluviatile terraces of the lower Nahr el Kebir valley occur down its length as buttes and hills, whereas on the plateau it is marine deposits which outcrop frequently, with the main shoreline at about 80 - 85 m above sea-level. 2. The marine deposits of the plateau The topography of the plateau is very regular, except for some small breaks of slope. Fluvial deposits are the exception, while in contrast, marine deposits frequently occur, easily recognisable by their darker soils. They are formed, sometimes of sandstone or of conglomerates, up to 15 m thick, and sometimes of very rolled flint gravels or pebbles. The fauna, firmly cemented, is not rare, but it is banal. The most important marine formation is connected by the 80 - 85 m shoreline, and can be seen between Fidio and Hennadi, as well as, in the North, between Qannjra and Kirsane. Marine deposits are very abundant down to 30 m along the Nahr Snoubar;they rise gently and continuously from the present shoreline to the foot of the Cheikh Mohammed butte; the same transgressive formation sometimes fossilised an erosional topography and we know of several shorelines with two unconformable marine series (el Haqime and Boustane). Along the Nahr el Kebir valley the faciès is fluvio-marine, with alternating marine (with fauna) and fluviatile series. This transgressive formation, which is continuous for about 60 km, from the Nahr el Arab in the North to Banyas in the South, certainly belongs to the penultimate interpluvial; the Tyrrhenian with Strombus bubonius does not outcrop at the mouth of the Nahr el Kebir or in the Jebleh area, but it exists at Banyas, and near the Nahr el Arab it overlaps, with an unconformity, the Khellale- Hennadi Formation, which corresponds to the Jbailian of Lebanon. The Baksa Formation is relatively well preserved on both sides of the Nahr el Kebir between 90 and 135 m. At Jabal Idriss, it has a fluvio-marine faciès. Probably it belongs to the antepenultimate interpluvial and corresponds to the Zaqrounian of Lebanon. The Mchairfet Formation rises up to 190 m and is of great age (pre-Günz). Its altitude is approximately the same on both sides of the river, so that the Nahr el Kebir <b>geosuture</b> has not operated very much since the lower Quaternary. 3. Fluviatile terraces Like the Orontes river, the Nahr el Kebir has a complete series of fluviatile terraces, the best in the entire Levantine coastal area. These terraces are generally stepped, owing to the wide incisions into the valley cut during the Quaternary. The fluviatile accumulations must be correlated with the glacial periods of temperate zones (regression periods) with a climatic control. The material is generally coarse, but it also includes thick, silty series. The buttes, benches and hills are generally structural surfaces. However, the two first Wurmian terraces were cut by two subsequent erosional surfaces; the younger the terraces, the smoother the terrace profile becomes. The glacis slope is 1. 3 %; the Mindel terrace slope is 1 %; the Riss, 0. 55 %; the Würmian, 0. 33 %, probably because of an epeirogenic rise of this area during the Quaternary. Finally, these terraces decrease in age towards the East; the axis of the valley has moved progressively eastward, because erosion is easier in Pliocene marls; also there may have been a slight tilting of the basin of the river. The altimetric situation, stratigraphy, faciès, surface alterations and artifacts allow us to propose a relative chronology of these terraces mainly due to the fact that South of Snoubar, the Jinndiriye Formation lies unconformably over the Hennadi-Kellale Formation : The lower terrace (Qo) is quite important (3 or 4 m) and contains potsherds. Three formations are Wurmian (QI). Two Ech-Chir Formations (QIa and QIb) contain Middle Paleolithic, but not Upper Paleolithic, artifacts, and are dated from the first half of the Würm. The first one is mainly silty; both are 30 m thick. In the Ech-Chir-Khoura area the second one lies unconformably over the first. Near Jinndiriye, and Haqime, a colluvial-alluvial deposit with red, clayey matrix (Jraïmaqiye Formation) contains some Upper Paleolithic flints (QIc). The Jinndinye Formation (QII, Rissian) has been very well preserved on the right bank, in the high cliff at Jinndiriye, Jabal Aamrouniye, Jabal Souayate, where the deposits are sometimes 30 m thick, coarse in the lower part, then silty (but not loessic, as stated by Wendt, 1971), then with a rarely-preserved pebble series at the top. The apparent base of this formation is at about 65 m above the talweg of the Nahr el Kebir. The older formations are much rarer and only exceptionally form terraces. The Berzine Formation (QIII, Mindelian) is preserved only in three or four outcrops, but was clearly identified in Berzine, where it is at + 100 m, i. e. 90 m above the alluvial plain, and where we found many artifacts. The Sitt Markho Formation (QIV, Günz) is know from only one outcrop, at 110 m above the river, and about 10 m below the plateau. The numerous decalcified flints, the altitude and the geoche- mical alteration of pebbles, show that this formation is very old. Sanlaville Paul.

40|$|The Saldania Belt forms part of {{a system}} of Neoproterozoic mobile belts that {{surround}} and weld older cratons on the African continent. It is a poorly exposed, low-grade orogenic belt composed of a number of inliers unroofed in mega-anticlinal hinges of the Permo-Triassic Cape Fold Belt, along the southern tip of Africa. Deformed meta-volcanosedimentary units are contained within tectonostratigraphic terranes separated by deep-rooted, sinistral/dextral strike-slip fault zones, which display evidence of prolonged reactivation. Sedimentary rocks and volcanics of the Boland terrane (Malmesbury Group), lower Kango Group and Gamtoos Group are considered to be distal facies of rift successions, overlying the mid-Proterozoic crystalline basement on the southwestern edge of the Kalahari Craton. These lithologies have been deposited in semi-pull-apart basins that formed in response to the breakup of Rodinia and progressive opening of the proto-Atlantic (Adamaster Ocean) from 780 - 750 Ma. Fragments of juvenile Pan-African crust with WPB-MORB characteristics occur in the Bridgetown Formation (Swartland terrane, Malmesbury inlier) and attest to ocean floor spreading in this belt. The thick turbidite successions of the Swartland and Tygerberg terranes (Malmesbury Group) reflect deeper water conditions and were deposited partly on oceanic crust in an evolving ocean/continental margin basin marked by increasing sea levels and reduction of continental freeboard. Reversal of spreading and closing of the Adamastor Ocean, possibly initiated by the opening of Iapetus, occurred in the period 600 - 570 Ma. Although this movement vector caused sinistral transpressional reactivation of the Gariep and Saldanian margins, there is no proper collision orogen developed in the Saldania Belt. The Bridgetown Formation represents the suture between the southern, rifted margin succession of the Kalahari Craton and a poorly developed southern orogenic belt represented in part by the Swartland and Tygerberg terranes. This <b>geosuture</b> {{is similar to that of}} the South Atlantic, which formed in the analogous Gariep Belt between 575 and 543 Ma. Multiphase S-, I- and A-type granites of the Cape Granite Suite intruded the Saldania Belt in a pervasive transpressive regime between 550 and 510 Ma, comparing well with the timing of peak metamorphism/collision in the Gariep Belt (545 Ma). The absence of a proper collisional orogen and the strongly developed northwesterly structural grain in the Saldania Belt seem to suggest that the Cape Granite Suite was generated in a strike-slip regime. A discrepancy of approximately 50 Ma between the age of the collision granites of the Dom Feliciano Belt and Cape Granite Suite suggests that they are genetically unrelated. Similarities in structural styles, magmatism and dated events between the Saldania-Ross-Delamarian chain of orogens, however, indicate a common history. The evolution of this chain and that of the Gariep-Damara-Dom Feliciano Belts can be accommodated in a single plate tectonic model of simultaneous sinistral transpressive subduction driven by the rifting of Laurentia from South America and opening of the Iapetus Ocean. Loading and depression of the western and southern Kalahari Craton margin by thrust stacks of the Late Neoproterozoic orogens led to the formation of syn- to post-orogenic peripheral foreland basins, such as those represented by the Nama and Vanrhynsdorp Groups, lowering of sea level and increased continental freeboard. Deposition of the unconformity based upper Kango Group, and possibly the molassic Franschhoek Formation, occurred in intra-orogen pull-apart basins, which possibly developed between 530 and 510 Ma in the Saldania Belt.
