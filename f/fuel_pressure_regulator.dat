50|$|There {{also some}} {{alternative}} {{options in the}} way of interceptors like # Unichip that clamp the various inputs to the standard management systems, but they are restricted by the fact that fuel delivery generally cannot be easily increased as manipulation of the air-flow meter input and/or aggressive modifying of the ignition timing causes the Check Engine Light (CEL) to illuminate easily due to a deviation between the expected and targeted torque and quality of emissions.It is therefore common to increase the fuel pressure across the board by using an aftermarket <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> when tuning is performed by these interceptor computers, and trim the fuel out instead. However, increased fuel pressure has the side-effect of affecting the engine's ability to idle due to injector lockup, and as such sometimes an alternative solution of additional injectors instead of a raised-fuel-pressure regulator is proposed.The number of cars with such complex requirements is very low, and in general a full aftermarket engine management system is used in these cases, such as Nira or MoTeC.|$|E
5000|$|Spec Racer {{was first}} {{conceived}} as low-cost sports racing class by {{a director of}} the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), Ted Cronin, in the early 1980s. The car was developed and originally manufactured by Renault/Jeep Sport USA in Livonia, Michigan under direction of Vic Elford. The car, designed by Roy Lunn, was introduced into SCCA Club Racing in 1984 as [...] "Sports Renault." [...] After Renault bowed out of the program in 1989, the car was renamed [...] "Spec Racer (SR)." [...] The original Sports Renault/Spec Racer is now an SCCA Regional-only class and a few Renault powered cars still compete in National Auto Sport Association (NASA), Midwestern Council of Sports Cars Club (MCSCC) and Independent Motorsports Group (IMG) events. By 1994, the supply of rebuildable 1.7-liter Renault engines was drying up in the United States. The SCCA made the decision to replace the original Renault drivetrain with a 1.9-liter engine and five-speed transmission manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. This change gave the SRF an additional [...] to 105 - enough to push the cars along at speeds up to 135 mph. Ford Motor Company started to provide a new drivetrain in 1994 and the cars with the Ford powertrain renamed [...] "Spec Racer Ford (SRF)." [...] For a period of time, both Spec Racers (Renault powered) and Spec Racer Ford (Ford powered) both raced in the SCCA.

40|$|For {{lifetime}} verification in automotive components it {{is necessary}} to simulate their operation in test benches that reproduce the conditions of vehicular application, according to the boundary conditions defined in the project. In durability tests of electric fuel pumps for Otto cycle engines, test benches are often used comprised of fuel tanks made of stainless steel provided with a fuel temperature control system. They also have a hydraulic system that allows simulating the fuel circulation loop of the vehicle consisting of fuel filter and <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Moreover, they are also equipped with flow meters and fuel pressure for monitoring the test.
