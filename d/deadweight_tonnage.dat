5|$|The modern {{practice}} of flagging ships {{in foreign countries}} began in the 1920s in the United States when shipowners, frustrated by increased regulations and rising labor costs, began to register their ships to Panama. The use of open registries steadily increased, and in 1968, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest shipping register. , {{more than half of}} the world’s merchant ships were registered with open registries, and the Panama, Liberia, and Marshall Islands flags accounted for almost 40% of the entire world fleet, in terms of <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage.</b> In 2006 up to 20% of high-seas fishing vessels were registered in states they were not connected to.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E
25|$|She is {{also the}} second largest ship {{currently}} in service by <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage,</b> {{second only to the}} TI class supertankers that have a <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> of over 440,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|Ship {{displacement}} {{should not}} be confused with measurements of volume or capacity typically used for commercial vessels, such as net tonnage, gross tonnage, or <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first Valemax vessels {{were ordered}} on 3 August 2008 when Vale signed a {{contract}} with the Chinese shipbuilder Jiangsu Rongsheng Heavy Industries (RSHI) for the construction of twelve 400,000-ton ore carriers. The development had reportedly started in 2007. The contract, worth $1.6 billion, was the world's biggest single shipbuilding contract by <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{ship had}} a <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage,</b> or {{carrying}} capacity, of approximately 81,000 tons, a measurement that {{put it at}} the small end of the Aframax class of tankers, smaller than most carriers of crude oil but larger than most carriers of refined products. It was classed by the American Bureau of Shipping and insured by the London Steam-Ship Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, a shipowners' mutual known as the London Club.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 a {{workgroup}} {{consisting of}} the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new ice class rules in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E
25|$|West Humhaw had {{a design}} <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 8,800 tons and gross {{register}} tonnage of 5,600. The ship had an overall length of 423 feet 9inches, {{a beam of}} 54 feet and a draft of 24 feet 2inches. She was powered by a Curtis geared turbine driving a single screw propeller, delivering a service speed of 11.5 knots. For wartime service, West Humhaw was armed with one 5"/51 caliber and one 3"/50 caliber gun.|$|E

Since the ship was completed too late to see wartime service—having been delivered {{just two days after}} Armistice Day—she was not provided with any armament.|$|E
25|$|Valemax {{ships are}} {{a fleet of}} very large ore {{carriers}} (VLOC) owned or chartered by the Brazilian mining company Vale S.A. to carry iron ore from Brazil to European and Asian ports. With a capacity ranging from 380,000 to 400,000 tons deadweight, the vessels meet the Chinamax standard of ship measurements for limits on draft and beam. Valemax ships are the largest bulk carriers ever constructed, when measuring <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> or length overall, and are amongst the longest ships of any type currently in service.|$|E
25|$|When completed, War Flame had a <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 8,480 tons (8,800 nominal) and a gross {{register}} tonnage of 5,520 tons (5,600 nominal). The ship had an overall length of 423 feet 9inches, {{a beam of}} 54 feet and a draft of 24 feet 2inches. War Flame was powered by a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine supplied by the Puget Sound Machinery Depot of Seattle, with cylinders of 25, 42 and 72inches respectively and a stroke of 48inches, which drove a single screw propeller and delivered a service speed of 11 knots.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the ships Vale ordered for itself, more ships of similar size were to be built for other shipping companies and chartered to Vale under exclusive long-term contracts. Eight very large ore carriers were ordered from the South Korean shipbuilder STX Offshore & Shipbuilding in Jinhae, South Korea (STX Jinhae), and Dalian, China (STX Dalian). The shipping company, STX Pan Ocean, signed a 25-year contract with Vale in 2009. The <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> of the Valemax vessels built by STX, 374,400 tons, is slightly smaller {{than that of the}} similar ships built by DSME and RSHI.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} medieval galley specification {{comes from}} an order of Charles I of Sicily, in 1275 AD. Overall length 39.30m, keel length 28.03m, depth 2.08m. Hull width 3.67m. Width between outriggers 4.45m. 108 oars, most 6.81m long, some 7.86m, 2 steering oars 6.03m long. Foremast and middle mast respectively heights 16.08m, 11.00m; circumference both 0.79m, yard lengths 26.72m, 17.29m. Overall <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage</b> approximately 80 metric tons. This type of vessel had two, later three, men on a bench, each working his own oar. This vessel had much longer oars than the Athenian trireme which were 4.41m & 4.66m long. This type of warship was called galia sottil.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{consisted of}} retrofitting a bulbous bow, faired {{to the existing}} icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by KaMeWa, to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker to ballast water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated heeling tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to , which substantially increased the ships' <b>deadweight</b> <b>tonnage.</b> Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new incinerator {{to deal with the}} shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the Wärtsilä Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.|$|E
