50|$|<b>Flurithromycin</b> is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic. It is a fluorinated {{derivative of}} erythromycin A.|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} <b>flurithromycin</b> in {{gynecological}} tissue in 20 female patients were studied after preoperative administration. The tissue <b>flurithromycin</b> levels obtained were {{comparable to those}} obtained in serum at 3 and 4 h but were frequently higher than those in serum at 6 and 12 h. <b>Flurithromycin</b> reached the highest concentrations in ovary at 4 h and in endometrium at 6 h...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-vitro}} {{activity of}} <b>flurithromycin</b> against common respiratory tract Gram-positive (85 strains) and Gram-negative (44 strains) pathogens, {{and a collection}} of anaerobes (125 strains) was compared with that of erythromycin, cefixime, amoxy-tillin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, nctilmicin and dindamycin. <b>Flurithromycin</b> possessed the same spectrum and potency of antimicrobial activity as erythromycin. The presence of 50 % human serum in the test media enhanced the activity of <b>flurithromycin</b> against all isolates, with the exception of Streptococcus pyogenes. <b>Flurithromycin</b> induced a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) that ranged from 0 - 25 h (Haemophiius influenzae) to 3 - 5 h {Streptococcus pneumoniae) for all strains tested. The presence of serum increased or diminished the duration of the PAE, depending on the strain being analysed. No interaction between <b>flurithromycin</b> and the other drugs tested was observed by the chequerboard technique, but when the time-kill system was used, 35 cases of synergy were noted out of 120 tests performed (29 %), of which 15 (43 %) were with Moraxella catarrhaJis, 12 (34 %) with Staphylococcus aureus, four (11 %) with H. influenzae and the remainder with 5. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Netilmkin produced most synergic interactions. Antagonism was not detected by either methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the authors {{examined}} {{the activity of}} <b>flurithromycin</b> {{compared to that of}} erythromycin, spiramycin and penicillin against 107 strains of various species supposed to cause periodontitis. The range of MICs of <b>flurithromycin</b> was: ≤ 0. 06 - 2 mg/l for P. gingivalis (28 isolates), 0. 06 - 2 mg/l for P. melaninogenica (7), 0. 5 - 4 mg/l for P. intermedia (5), 0. 25 - 8 mg/l for Prevotella sp. (8), 1 - 16 mg/l for F. nucleatum (14), 0. 12 - 0. 5 mg/l for W. recta (2), 0. 5 - 32 mg/l for E. corrodens, 0. 5 - 2 mg/l for B. forsythus (2); ≤ 0. 06 - 64 mg/l for Peptostreptococcus sp. (11), ≤ 0. 06 - 1 mg/l for A. odontolyticus (11) and for A. naeslundii (7) and ≤ 0. 06 - 16 mg/l for A. viscosus (7). Macrolide activity was ranked in decreasing order from <b>flurithromycin</b> to erythromycin to spiramycin. Beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in Prevotella sp. (20 %) and in F. nucleatum (7 %). Isolates which were β-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among Peptostreptococcus sp. and Actinomyces sp. A post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for <b>flurithromycin</b> on P. gingivalis and E. corrodens. The good in vitro activity of <b>flurithromycin</b> against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between concentrations in serum and levels in tissue of <b>flurithromycin,</b> a new fluorinated macrolide, was determined in patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery and thoracotomy. All patients received 500 mg of <b>flurithromycin</b> orally every 8 h. Drug levels in serum, bone, soft tissue, lung, and pericardial fluid were determined microbiologically. The {{total amount of}} antibiotic per gram of tissue was calculated {{on the basis of}} the concentration in the supernatant of the homogenate. From the parallel course between free concentrations in serum and calculated contents in interstitial fluid tissue, it was concluded that the tissues examined were easily accessible by flurithromycin; penetration values measured by the ratio of areas under the curve were 8. 3 for lung, 3. 6 for bone, and 0. 8 for soft tissue. The results of the pharmacokinetic study suggest that accumulation of the drug during repetitive multiple doses is predictable. Mean residence times were 10. 2 and 8. 3 h in group 1 and 2, respectively. For bacteriostatic drugs such as macrolides, not only very high but also prolonged concentrations in tissue lead to a favorable therapeutic result...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} macrolide antibiotics {{have been}} covered in this review: erythromycin and its related substances, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, roxithromycin, <b>flurithromycin,</b> josamycin, rokitamycin, kitasamycin, mycinamycin, mirosamycin, oleandomycin, rosaramicin, spiramycin and tylosin. The application of various thin-layer chromatography, paper chromatography, gas chromatography, {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} and capillary zone electrophoresis procedures for their analysis are described. These techniques have been applied to the separation and quantitative analysis of the macrolides in fermentation media, purity assessment of raw materials, assay of pharmaceutical dosage forms and the measurement of clinically useful macrolide antibiotics in biological samples such as blood, plasma, serum, urine and tissues. Data relating to the chromatographic behaviour of some macrolide antibiotics {{as well as the}} various detection methods used, such as bioautography, UV spectrophotometry, fluorometry, electrochemical detection, chemiluminescence and mass spectrometry techniques are also included. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of several 14 -, 15 - and 16 -membered macrolides {{were compared with}} that of erythromycin. In general, 14 -membered macrolides such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and <b>flurithromycin</b> were more active against streptococci and Bordetella pertussis than was the 15 -membered macrolide azithromycin, which was more active than 16 -membered macrolides such as miocamycin and rokitamycin. Clarithromycin was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species. Legionella pneumophila was most susceptible to miocamycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae were most susceptible to azithromycin. Azithromycin and dirithromycin were the most active compounds against Campylobacter jejuni. MICs of 16 -membered macrolides for strains expressing inducible-type resistance to erythromycin were {{less than or equal to}} 1 microgram/ml, whereas none of the compounds had activity against strains expressing constitutive-type resistance. The MICs of roxithromycin, miocamycin, rokitamycin, and josamycin increased in the presence of human serum, whereas MICs of the other compounds either were unchanged or decreased...|$|E
