5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
5|$|Because General Maurice Sarrail had {{demonstrated}} {{a tendency to}} <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> politics, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau relieved him of his command in December 1917.

50|$|In general, the Act is {{intended}} to prevent unauthorized American citizens from <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> disputes or controversies between the United States and foreign governments.

5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> day-to-day administration, she probably {{had the power}} to command the governors in the organization of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E
5|$|Stationed off Haiti was the British frigate HMS Southampton under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo, {{tasked with}} observing the {{political}} situation but with orders not to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the intermittent conflict between Christophe and Pétion.

When in April 1861, the Confederacy announced that it would authorize privateers, Seward sent word to the American representatives abroad that the U.S. would become party to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law of 1856, outlawing such vessels, but Britain required that, if the U.S. were to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser {{established}} a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and {{the dissolution of}} all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes {{got the impression that}} the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E

Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the land will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor.

5|$|Early in the 1190s, the Georgian {{government}} began to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> {{the affairs of}} the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Birch {{came out}} of {{retirement}} and returned to WWE at the SmackDown tapings on April 20, where he lost to Shelton Benjamin in a dark match. On April 25 at Extreme Rules, he reappeared on television as a masked member of CM Punk's The Straight Edge Society stable and interfered in Punk's match with Rey Mysterio, helping him pick up the win. Birch continued to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Punk's matches during the following months, before being unmasked by Big Show on the July 23 episode of SmackDown. This led to a handicap match at SummerSlam where Big Show defeated the entire Society. In early September {{it was reported that}} Mercury had undergone surgery on a torn pectoral muscle.|$|E
50|$|On the April 18 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Gurv and Harv, now {{referred}} to as Sunil Singh and Samir Singh, respectively, or the Singh Brothers, made their SmackDown debut <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> a six-pack challenge match {{to determine the number}} one contender for Randy Orton's WWE Championship at Backlash, helping Jinder Mahal win the match. They also <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> Orton's House of Horrors match against Bray Wyatt at Payback, distracting Orton long enough for Mahal to attack him with the stolen WWE Championship, allowing Wyatt to take advantage and defeat Orton with a Sister Abigail. At Backlash, the Singh Brothers were at ringside for Mahal, ultimately helping him defeat Randy Orton and capturing his first WWE Championship. At Money in the Bank, the two <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> Mahal's WWE Championship rematch against Orton, ultimately helping him retain the title. At Battleground, they <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> Mahal's Punjabi Prison match against Orton for the WWE Championship, being fought off by Orton. However, The Great Khali interfered, allowing Mahal to retain the title. After getting injured, the brothers wore a neck brace and a cast, respectively. They soon recovered.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Twenty five {{different}} analytical procedures, {{commonly used in}} clinical laboratories, were in-vestigated for interference by eight analgesic and antirheumatic drugs. Ten of the investigated assays showed no statistically significant interference. Acetylsalicylic acid <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> six assays (for glucose, uric acid, protein * and cholesterol). Aminophenazone significantly decreased glucose, bilirubin and protein values, whereas caffeine affected four methods (for glucose, protein and iron). No definite influence of phenobarbital could be detected on any assay. Glucose, uric acid and iron values were altered {{in the presence of}} diclofenac. Indomethacin <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> glucose, urea, uric acid and protein assays. Samples containing ibuprofen had altered creatinine, bilirubin and iron values, whereas ketoprofen <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> glucose and iron determination.

5|$|In early 1813, Ernest was {{involved}} in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown {{to be one of}} three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, German {{forces were}} {{defeated}} in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences. In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner. Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk. Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric Flair faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} Flair on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through {{the table with a}} Splash. Near the end of the match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E
