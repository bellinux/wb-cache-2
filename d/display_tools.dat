30|$|As {{our ability}} to collect, process, and display data {{improves}} and becomes automated, the jobs associated with those functions are declining. The debate about whether that’s a good thing focuses on the costs (jobs lost) and benefits (freeing people up for less mundane and more creative work) of automation. Recent work by the McKinsey Global Institute suggests that a focus on jobs is misleading. While few jobs will disappear, many activities {{are likely to be}} automated. In fact, their analyses suggest as many as 45  % of activities done by individuals could be automated using current technologies (Chui et al. 2015), which shows how fast our tools for data collection, processing, and <b>display</b> <b>tools</b> are progressing.|$|E
