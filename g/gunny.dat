Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Anne's Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a <b>gunny</b> sack.

5|$|After the kidnapping, {{the couple}} were beaten. Babli's brother Suresh forced her to consume pesticide, while four other family members pushed Manoj to the ground, her uncle Rajinder pulling a noose around Manoj's neck and {{strangling}} {{him in front of}} Babli. They wrapped the bodies in <b>gunny</b> sacks and dumped them in Barwala Link Canal in Hisar district. On 23 June, nine days later, their mutilated bodies, hands and feet tied, were fished out of the canal by Kheri Chowki police. After autopsy, police preserved Manoj's shirt and Babli's anklet and cremated the bodies as unclaimed on 24 June. On 1 July the family identified them by the remnants of their clothing. The accused were subsequently arrested.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent an extensive $20million renovation directed by Chicago architect <b>Gunny</b> Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included {{restoration of the}} main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|Rather {{than being}} kept open, disused <b>gunnies</b> were {{often used as}} a {{convenient}} site for the disposal of waste rock (known as [...] "deads" [...] or [...] "attle"). This had the useful side-effect of avoiding the need to support {{the sides of the}} <b>gunnies</b> with stulls, especially if the <b>gunnies</b> diverged significantly from the vertical, to avoid the likely collapse of the hanging wall. This was still not an ideal solution, however, because if it became necessary to pass through the filled <b>gunnies</b> in later development of the mine, the problem became one of digging through and supporting tons of loose rock. The 1893 mining accident at Dolcoath in which seven men were killed was caused by failure of the stull holding up a huge quantity of deads in a <b>gunnies.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the <b>gunny</b> bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

50|$|A <b>gunnies,</b> gunnis, or gunniss is {{the space}} {{left in a}} mine after the {{extraction}} by stoping of a vertical or near vertical ore-bearing lode. The term is also used when this space breaks {{the surface of the}} ground, but it can then be known as a coffin or goffen. It {{can also be used to}} describe the deep trenches that were dug by early miners in following the ore-bearing lode downwards from the surface - in this case they are often called open-works; their existence can provide the earliest evidence of mining in an area. William Pryce, writing in 1778, also used the term as a measure of width, a single <b>gunnies</b> being equal to three feet.|$|R

25|$|The soaring {{temperature}} in Chennai, especially during summer, demands extra care for {{residents of the}} zoo. Fortunately, the {{temperature in}}side the zoo campus {{is a couple of}} degrees lower than outside any time of the year, primarily due to the lush greenery. The park also maintains an exclusive summer management schedule. All animal enclosures have thatched roofs and fresh river sand spread on the floor to make it cooler for the animals. Water is sprinkled on the sand to provide extra cooling. Roofs of water birds' enclosures are covered with coconut leaves and wet <b>gunny</b> bags. Caves that are exposed directly to the sun are put under a shower twice a day. The enclosure for the king cobra has an air conditioner in order to provide an environment similar to its natural habitat as the species cannot withstand the summer heat. For birds, the topmost part of the cage is covered with jute bags, and water is sprinkled three times a day. Based on the temperature, cucumber, buttermilk, apple and banana are also served to herbivores. The zoo has also set up sprinklers to help animals beat the summer heat and is planning to set up about 20 more sprinklers at the deer safari.|$|E

5000|$|Another problem caused {{to later}} mining was if a <b>gunnies</b> became flooded, {{when it would}} {{sometimes}} be called [...] "a <b>gunnies</b> of water", but more often [...] "a house of water". In his Mineralogia Cornubiensis of 1778, William Pryce talks of the care taken by miners when they thought they might be digging an adit towards a house of water: they ensured that they used an iron rod to bore a small hole several feet ahead of their main pickaxe excavation; by so doing they received advance warning of breaking into a huge volume of water. Despite this care, Pryce reported that the water pressure could quickly enlarge the small hole and uncontrollably flood the mine; he also stated that men were paid extra money for working in such dangerous areas {{and that he was}} aware of miners being killed when doing this.|$|R

5000|$|The {{large extent}} and great depth of some <b>gunnies</b> often caused {{problems}} when they {{lay in the}} way of later mine development. For instance, Joseph Jennings, the former mine manager at East Pool mine wrote in 1916 that in 1908 he had had to bridge the [...] "gunniss" [...] of the Great Lode at the 160 fathom level, and that of the New North Lode at the 240 fathom level and install expensive timber stulls to enable the continued development of the mine. These large open underground spaces were the inevitable cause of accidents too: in 1836 a miner was killed at Dolcoath mine when he fell 13 fathoms (about 80 feet) from a [...] "swing stage", a platform let down on ropes or chains into a <b>gunnies</b> that was too wide for any available timber to reach from side to side.|$|R

2500|$|Although they {{attended}} school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They {{were not allowed}} to sit inside the class.

This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as [...] "No peon, No Water".

60|$|Already {{the sailors}} show {{marks of the}} {{hardship}} they are enduring. It is surprising, in so short a time, how lean their faces have grown, how lined and seamed.

Their walk is a waddle, and they bulge with seaming corpulency. This {{is due to the}} amount of clothing they have on. I noticed Larry, to- day, had on two vests, two coats, and an overcoat, with his oilskin outside of that.

50|$|Some, {{including}} J. R. R. Tolkien {{have argued}} that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax.

Br. krampouz), noggin, gob (cf. Gaelic gob), nook; and the dialectal term for a badger, i.e. brock (cf. Welsh broch, C. brogh and Gaelic broc). Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system Yan Tan Tethera in the west, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as Cumbria.
