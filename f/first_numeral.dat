25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the <b>first</b> <b>numeral,</b> the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{debate has}} been carried out about a {{possible}} Indo-European origin of the Etruscan cardinals. In the words of Larissa Bonfante (1990), [...] "What these numerals show, beyond any shadow of a doubt, is the non-Indo-European nature of the Etruscan language". Conversely, other scholars, including Francisco R. Adrados, Albert Carnoy, Marcello Durante, Vladimir Georgiev, Alessando Morandi and Massimo Pittau, have proposed a close phonetic proximity of the <b>first</b> ten Etruscan <b>numerals</b> to the corresponding numerals in other Indo-European languages. Italian linguist and glottologist Massimo Pittau has argued that [...] "all the <b>first</b> ten Etruscan <b>numerals</b> have a congruent phonetic matching in as many Indo-European languages" [...] and [...] "perfectly fit within the Indo-European series", supporting the idea that the Etruscan language was of Indo-European origins.|$|R
25|$|The numerals are {{arranged}} with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions {{added to the}} left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left-to-right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet.

25|$|Numbers {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from numerals, the symbols used to represent numbers.

The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient mathematicians in the Indian subcontinent around 500 AD.|$|R

50|$|The {{first part}} of this linguascale is the decimal {{classification}} referred to above, consisting of a linguasphere key of two numerals denoting the relevant phylozone or geozone: from 00. to 99. This provides a systematic numerical key for the initial classification of any of the world's languages, following the principles set out in the Linguasphere Register. The <b>first</b> <b>numeral</b> of the key represents one of the ten referential sectors into which the world's languages are initially divided. The sector can either be a phylosector, in which the constituent languages are considered to be in a diachronic relationship one with another, or a geosector, in which languages are grouped geographically rather than historically.|$|E

Many Maba people also speak Arabic, as their traditional trade language.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{the ability}} to predict events {{recurring}} only after so long a period as eighteen years, implies a considerable advance in civilisation--a considerable development of general knowledge; and we have now to inquire what progress in other sciences accompanied, and was necessary to, these astronomical previsions. In the first place, there must clearly have been a tolerably efficient system of calculation. Mere finger-counting, mere head-reckoning, even {{with the aid of}} a regular decimal notation, could not have sufficed for numbering the days in a year; much less the years, months, and days between eclipses. Consequently there must have been a mode of registering numbers; probably even a system of numerals. The earliest numerical records, if we may judge by the practices of the less civilised races now existing, were probably kept by notches cut on sticks, or strokes marked on walls; much as public-house scores are kept now. And there seems reason to believe that the <b>first</b> <b>numerals</b> used were simply groups of straight strokes, as some of the still-extant Roman ones are; leading us to suspect that these groups of strokes were used to represent groups of fingers, as the groups of fingers had been used to represent groups of objects--a supposition quite in conformity with the aboriginal system of picture writing and its subsequent modifications. Be this so or not, however, it is manifest that before the Chaldeans discovered their Saros, there must have been both a set of written symbols serving for an extensive numeration, and a familiarity with the simpler rules of arithmetic.|$|R
