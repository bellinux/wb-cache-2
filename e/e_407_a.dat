The draft genome of R. nanhaiensis <b>E</b> <b>407</b> - 8 T consists of 3, 987, 205 bp and contains 3, 730 predicated protein-coding genes, including 82 extracellular peptidase genes. Protease-producing bacteria {{are considered to be}} key players forthe degradation of organic nitrogen in marine environments (3, 11, 17).

40|$|Nitrite-dependent {{anaerobic}} methane oxidation (n-damo) {{process is}} unique in linking the microbial carbon and nitrogen cycles, but the presence of n-damo bacteria in marine ecosystem and the associated environmental factors are still poorly understood. In the present study, detection of n-damo bacteria using 16 S rRNA and pmoA gene-based PCR primers was successfully employed to reveal their diversity and distribution in the surface and subsurface sediments of the South China Sea (SCS). The widespread occurrence of n-damo bacteria in both the surface and subsurface sediments with high diversity has been confirmed in this study. The pmoA gene-amplified sequences clustered within three newly erected subclusters, namely SCS- 1, SCS- 2, and SCS- 3, suggesting the unique niche specificity of n-damo bacteria in the marine ecosystem. Results indicated the presence of n-damo bacteria in the west Pacific Ocean with a wide distribution from the continental shelf (E 201 S) to the deep abyss (<b>E</b> <b>407</b> S and <b>E</b> <b>407</b> B). Community structures of n-damo bacteria in SCS are clearly {{different from those of}} nonmarine ones known. It is also found that NOx− and NH 4 + affected the community structures and distribution of n-damo bacteria in the SCS sediments differently. Salinity is another important factor identified, shaping the n-damo communities in marine environments.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported the X-ray structures of wild-type Escherichia coli AcrB, a proton motive force-dependent multidrug efflux pump, and its N 109 A mutant. These structures presumably reflect the resting state of AcrB, which can bind drugs. After ligand binding, a proton may bind to an acidic residue(s) in the transmembrane domain, i. <b>e.,</b> Asp <b>407</b> or Asp 408, within the putative network of electrostatically interacting residues, which also include Lys 940 and Thr 978, {{and this may}} initiate a series of conformational changes that result in drug expulsion.

These mutant proteins revealed remarkably similar conformations, which show striking differences from the previously known conformations of the wild-type protein. For example, the loop containing Phe 386 and Phe 388, which {{play a major role}} in the initial binding of substrates in the central cavity, becomes prominently extended into the center of the cavity, such that binding of large substrate molecules may become difficult. We believe that this new conformation may mimic, at least partially, one of the transient conformations of the transporter during the transport cycle...|$|R

40|$|The equine-associated obligate {{pathogen}} Burkholderia mallei {{was developed}} by reductive evolution involving {{a substantial portion of}} the genome from Burkholderia pseudomallei, a free-living opportunistic pathogen. With its short history of divergence (∼ 3. 5 myr), B. mallei provides an excellent resource to study the early steps in bacterial genome reductive evolution in the host. By examining 20 genomes of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei, we found that stepwise massive expansion of IS (insertion sequence) elements ISBma 1, ISBma 2, and IS <b>407</b> <b>A</b> occurred during the evolution of B. mallei. Each element proliferated through the sites where its target selection preference was met. Then, ISBma 1 and ISBma 2 contributed to the further spread of IS <b>407</b> <b>A</b> by providing secondary insertion sites. This spread increased genomic deletions and rearrangements, which were predominantly mediated by IS <b>407</b> <b>A.</b> There were also nucleotide-level disruptions in a large number of genes. However, no significant signs of erosion were yet noted in these genes. Intriguingly, all these genomic modifications did not seriously alter the gene expression patterns inherited from B. pseudomallei. This efficient and elaborate genomic transition was enabled largely through the formation of the highly flexible IS-blended genome and the guidance by selective forces in the host. The detailed IS intervention, unveiled for the first time in this study, may represent the key component of a general mechanism for early bacterial evolution in the host...|$|R

40|$|Avaliou-se a resposta de nove cultivares de algodoeiro, de importância econômica no Estado do Mato Grosso, quanto à intoxicação causada por subdoses de {{glyphosate}}. Os cultivares de algodoeiro utilizados foram Fabrika, Makina, ITA- 90, FM 986, FM 966, Delta Opal, BRS Facual, Antares <b>e</b> Coodetec <b>407.</b> <b>As</b> plantas foram cultivadas em tubetes preenchidos com substrato de solo e mantidas em casa telada, tendo recebido a aplicação do glyphosate aos 20 dias após a emergência, época em que apresentavam quatro folhas verdadeiras. As subdoses de glyphosate, simulando deriva, foram de 270 e 540 g ha- 1. Também foi utilizada testemunha, sem aplicação do herbicida, para efeito de comparação. Foram realizadas avaliações semanais até 42 dias após a aplicação dos tratamentos (DAA), período em que também foi tomada a altura das plantas. Os sintomas visuais de intoxicação iniciaram-se aos 3 DAA, caracterizados pelo amarelecimento das pontas das folhas mais novas, seguido de murchamento do ápice das plantas. Na dose de 270 g ha- 1 esses sintomas foram de baixa intensidade, mas a 540 g ha- 1 causaram, na maioria dos casos, toxidez "preocupante" a "muito alta". Os cultivares BRS Facual e FM 986 mostraram-se os mais suscetíveis. A altura das plantas foi mais afetada quando se aplicou a menor dose de glyphosate. Houve recuperação de todos os cultivares tratados com 270 g ha- 1 de glyphosate até os 42 DAA. Quando tratados com 540 g ha- 1 de glyphosate, os cultivares Fabrika, Coodetec <b>407,</b> BRS-Facual <b>e</b> ITA- 90 foram mais sensíveis, apresentando redução de altura entre 84 e 90 % aos 42 DAA. Os cultivares menos sensíveis na dose de 270 g ha- 1 de glyphosate não foram os mesmos para a dose de 540 g ha- 1. The {{response of}} nine cotton cultivars economically {{important in the}} state of Mato Grosso was evaluated in relation to the toxicity caused by reduced rates of glyphosate. The cotton cultivars used were Fabrika, Makina, ITA- 90, FM 986, FM 966, Delta Opal, BRS Facual, Antares and Coodetec 407. The plants were cultivated in plastic pots filled with soil substratum and kept under greenhouse conditions. Glyphosate application was performed 20 days post emergence, at which time they presented four true leaves. Reduced rates of glyphosate, simulating drift, ranged from 270 and 540 g. A control was also used, without herbicide application to compare the effects. Weekly evaluations were accomplished up to 42 days after application (DAA). During this period, plant height was also measured. Visual symptoms began 3 DAA, with the appearance of yellow spots at the tips of the youngest leaves, followed by withering at the apex of the plants. At the rate of 270 g ha- 1, these symptoms showed low intensity but at the rate of 540 g ha- 1 the symptoms caused "worrisome" to "very high'' toxicity, in most of the cases. BRS Facual and FM 986 were the most susceptible. Plant height was the most affected when the lowest glyphosate dose was applied. All cultivars treated with 270 g ha- 1 glyphosate rate until 42 DAA were recovered. Fabrika, Coodetec 407, BRS Facual and ITA- 90 cultivars, when treated with 540 g ha- 1 glyphosate were more sensitive, presenting a height reduction between 84 and 90 % 42 DAA.
