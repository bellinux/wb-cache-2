25|$|The site of {{the mass}} killing of Khojaly {{inhabitants}} was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist Chingiz Mustafayev. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight {{to the scene of}} the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the little girl in her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his camera, but after recovering from the shock started filming. However, the helicopter came under the fire, and they had to leave.|$|E
25|$|At the Ministry, a tank {{made its}} way to the main entrance, climbed the steps into the building, and started firing on offices. Sergeant Rafael Veillena, of the Army's Second Division, was killed when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> a ninth-floor window. The firing of machine guns and tanks panicked workers in the area, who at that hour were making their way to their jobs downtown. A woman working at the State Bank near the Ministry was killed, as well as a couple who were caught in cross-fire. At least 16 people were wounded, four seriously. A group of foreign journalists {{covering}} the reforms carried out by Allende's government was {{caught in the middle of}} the insurrection. While filming the events outside La Moneda, Argentine cameraman Leonardo Henrichsen and his colleague Jan Sandquist were fired at by corporal Héctor Hernán Bustamante Gómez and several soldiers. Henrichsen was fatally shot by a soldier, who was never identified. Before collapsing in the arms of Sandquist, Henrichsen recorded the military foot patrol firing at him. The footage was recovered by Sandquist and showed on the Argentine television on 24 July.|$|E
500|$|Another man, Michel (Nicholas Lea), {{is having}} sex with the female form of Brother Martin in a parked car before a patrol officer {{interrupts}} them. As Michel suddenly starts retching, the officer is attacked by Brother Martin, who changes into a man and escapes. In the hospital Michel reluctantly reveals to Mulder and Scully that when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of the car, the girl he was with [...] "looked like a man". The agents are alerted about activity on a previous victim's credit card, which was stolen by Brother Martin. The agents chase Brother Martin into an alley, {{only to have the}} Kindred appear and take him away. The following morning the agents return to the Kindred's dwelling, which now appears deserted. The tunnels are blocked entirely with the white clay. Mulder and Scully walk into the nearby field where they find a large crop circle, suggesting that the Kindred are aliens.|$|E

6000|$|... "Er--Will--held Duncan pretty tight--didn't you? He's a {{hard one}} to fool, too. Never {{suspected}} a mite, did <b>he?</b> <b>Look</b> <b>out</b> for your watch!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{architect}} {{came into}} Wood's office {{one day and}} said it was time to select the color for the hospital. Wood said <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> his window at the red dirt on the then-undeveloped Moanalua Ridge and said, [...] "You've got to get it as close to that color as you can because that's the color it will be when you're through." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... {{about six}} o’clock, that morning, I {{observed}} the air very much condensed in my chamber-window; and, upon getting up, was informed by a tenant that finding himself cold in bed, about three o’clock in the morning, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at his window, {{and to his}} great surprise saw the ground covered with a white frost: and I was assured that two men at Barton, about [...] off, saw in some shallow tubs, ice of the thickness of a crown-piece.|$|E
2500|$|When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly (then Minister of War) {{chose to}} follow the {{scorched}} earth principle and retreat rather than to risk a major battle. His strategy aroused grudges {{from most of the}} generals and soldiers, notably Prince Pyotr Bagration. [...] As Alexander had to choose a new general, there was only one choice: Kutuzov. [...] He found popularity among the troops mainly because he was Russian (most of the generals commanding Russian troops at that time were foreign), he was brave, he had proven himself in battle, strongly believed in the Russian Orthodox Church, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> for the troops’ well-being. The nobles and clergy also regarded Kutuzov highly. Therefore, when Kutuzov was appointed commander-in-chief in late August and he joined the army on 29 August 1812, the nation greeted Kutuzov with delight. Only Alexander, repulsed by Kutuzov’s physique and irrationally holding him responsible for the defeat at Austerlitz, did not celebrate Kutuzov’s commission.|$|E

2500|$|Chief of the YGN news desk. Gyo-dong {{works with}} the motto [...] "the truth can change the world". <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for Dal-po and tries to discreetly help him in proving his family's innocence.|$|R

6000|$|Jonas did so, and {{was almost}} at his ease. 'Pecksniff,' he whispered, as they drew their chairs about the table; 'I gave him {{as good as}} he brought, eh? <b>He</b> had better <b>look</b> at home, before <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of window, I think?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or going crazy!" [...] said Tom; [...] "and on my word," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of the window, [...] "there's a drayman ringing at our door, with a stove, with a teakettle {{set in the}} top of it!" ...|$|R

60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> {{he heard}} a faint cry. He listened intently and soon the cry was repeated.|$|E
50|$|Dürer {{presents}} {{himself as}} almost seductive, with a rakish patterned hat placed over long, almost girlishly curled blond locks of hair under a draped pointed {{hat with a}} tassel. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> at the viewer with a cool ironic stare.|$|R
60|$|CAMPBELL (looking round). We {{appear to}} have fallen in with a party of dry-goods drummers. It makes a gentleman feel like an intruder. [The train stops; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of the window.] We've arrived. Come, Agnes; come, Roberts; come, Mr. Sawyer--let's be going.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> hesitated, <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of the window. Then {{he shrugged}} his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|From {{a window}} of an old coach <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> upon the dim lights and pale tent shapes.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Tom knitted {{his brows}} a little, then he smiled, and then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over the flower-beds without saying anything.|$|E
60|$|Dawes jerked suddenly, {{as if he}} {{had been}} held on a strain. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over the sea, but he saw nothing.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fentolin smiled quietly. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> sea-ward, {{beyond the}} sky-line, from whence {{had come to}} him, through the clouds, that tangle of messages.|$|E
50|$|The moon is {{reflected}} in a lake, although the moon itself {{is not in the}} night sky. The sounds of nocturnal birds are heard. Caino, who is young and black, enters from the right. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> over the lake and sits in the lotus position.|$|R
