The edge pieces are {{held in place by}} the centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well.|$|E
50|$|Scholars {{debate the}} {{underlying}} developmental causes and reasons for these mistakes. One theory, the semantic feature hypothesis, states that mistakes occur because children acquire the basic {{features of a}} word’s meaning before learning its more specific aspects. For instance, the child may initially use the word basketball in reference to any round object, but then change its meaning to a round, orange, and <b>grooved</b> <b>ball</b> that bounces. Children may overextend the meaning of basketball to any round object until they learn the more specific aspects of the word’s meaning. Other theories suggest that errors in early word use {{are the result of}} an inability {{on the part of the}} child to retrieve the correct word. Although the child might have accurately comprehended the word at one time, they are unable to actively retrieve the word or its meaning from their rapidly growing vocabulary.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a five {{degrees of freedom}} (5 -DOF) model for aeroengine spindle dual-rotor system dynamic analysis. In this system, the dual rotors are supported on two angular contact ball bearings and two deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings, one of the latter-mentioned bearings works as the inter-shaft bearing. Driven by respective motors, the dual rotors have different co-rotating speeds. The proposed model mathematically formulates the nonlinear displacements, elastic deflections and contact forces of bearings with consideration of 5 -DOF and coupling of dual rotors. The nonlinear equations of motions of dual rotors with 5 -DOF are solved using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} introduced 5 -DOF and nonlinear dynamic bearing model, we compare the proposed model with two models: the 3 -DOF model of this system only considering three translational degrees of freedom (Gupta, 1993, rotational freedom is neglected); the 5 -DOF model where the deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearings are simplified as linear elastic spring (Guskov, 2007).

40|$|Abstract Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} is a {{degradation process}} of mechanical/tribological properties (toughness, wear etc.) of mating steel surfaces. This {{is caused by}} the presence and interaction of hydrogen with applied stresses. Therefore, it is important to quantify the hydrogen content which could be dissolved under applied stresses in steel. Water contamination of lubricants is often considered as a reason of hydrogen embrittlement of rolling bearings. Thus the effect of water and %RH (relative humidity) on the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of steel was studied experimentally under different operating conditions. Two types of steels were used, that are silver steel and AISI- 52100 ball bearing steel. The testing conditions used in various tests, were percent relative humidity (%RH), temperature, rotating bending stresses, uni-axial tensile stress, rolling and sliding in combination with rotating bending stresses. As a first task, the hydrogen content was quantified in as-received specimens of bearing steel. The spread of hydrogen content was measured in radial and axial directions of the as-received bearing steel bars. This was done to show the importance of the internal hydrogen embrittlement effects of the initial hydrogen content. Sample melting technique (SMT) was used to quantitatively analyze the total content of hydrogen in all specimens using a hydrogen analyzer. In addition to this, Elastic Recoil Detection Technique (ERDT) was employed to qualitatively analyze the local hydrogen content distribution in soft and hard AISI- 52100 bearing steel. Secondly, the influence of applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen content into respective steel specimens was studied. A rotating bending set up was used through a lathe machine. Water was used as a source of hydrogen charging of the testing samples in all rotating bending tests. The influence of rotating bending stresses on the absorption of hydrogen was studied in silver steel and in bearing steel bar samples. Further, a universal fatigue testing machine was used to study the effect of cyclic released uni-axial tension on the absorption of hydrogen in the bearing steel. Similarly, the influence of Sliding and Rolling on the absorption/desorption of hydrogen content was studied in combination of rotating bending stresses using the same lathe machine. Mild and water quenched silver steel bar specimens were used to study the influence of quenching and applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen. Finally, the experiments were conducted on SKF- 624 deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearing (DGBB) under isolated operating environment. Non water absorbing grease was used as lubricant. Tests were run for 10 % of L 10 life of deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearing. Two different amplitudes of pure radial loading were selected for testing under high and low relative humidity of the operating environment. Total content of hydrogen was measured in the inner ring, outer ring and 7 -balls of DGBB (deep <b>groove</b> <b>ball</b> bearing) using the hydrogen analyzer. Results are presented for total dissolved (or absorbed) hydrogen content in various components as a function of bearing shaft revolutions and operating conditions. Results obtained revealed a dependence of total content of hydrogen on the number of inner ring shaft revolutions. Hydrogen seems to accumulate in the specimens with the increase of number of stress cycles or shaft revolutions...|$|R
