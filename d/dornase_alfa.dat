40|$|AbstractEmpyema is {{a severe}} {{complication}} of different diseases and traumas. Management of this complication {{is difficult and}} should comprise general and local procedures. The general procedure is mainly based on administering wide-spectrum antibiotics. Local management depends on general condition, but in all cases the essential procedure is inserting a drain into the pleural cavity and evacuation the pus. Sometimes pus is very thick and its evacuation and re-expansion of the lung is rather impossible. In these patients surgical procedures are required. The use of intrapleural enzymes to aid drainage was first described in 1949 by Tillett and Sherry using a mixture of streptokinase and streptococcal DNase (deoxyribonuclease). 1 In recent years purified streptokinase has come into widespread use, but recent studies suggest {{that it has no}} effect on pus viscosity.

40|$|AbstractIn CF {{patients}} with mild or moderate lung disease, {{the most sensitive}} spirometric measure of response to <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> is peripheral airflow. Cross-over studies in patients, already stabilised on <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa,</b> indicate that peripheral airflow shows greater improvement when it is administered 30 minutes before airway clearance therapy (ACT) rather than shortly after ACT. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that the major role of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> is to facilitate expectoration of sputum during ACT. When ACT is performed in the morning, efficacy and safety are similar when <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> is inhaled before bedtime or upon awakening.

40|$|Background: Although the {{benefits}} of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (<b>dornase</b> <b>alfa)</b> in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are established, its optimal timing in relation to physiotherapy is unknown. As its enzymatic effect lasts for 6 - 11 hr, <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> may be more efficacious if the time interval between inhalation and chest physiotherapy is increased. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if a longer time interval between <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> nebulization and chest physiotherapy improves clinical outcomes of subjects with CR Methods: A single-blind randomized cross-over trial was conducted on subjects with CF from outpatients of four hospitals. Subjects were in stable health and studied over 6 weeks (utilizing 14 -day blocks of morning or evening <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> administration with 14 days washout). Usual regimens for physiotherapy and exercise were unaltered. Thus changing the times altered the dwell time of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> prior to physiotherapy. Long interval was defined as dwell time of > 6 hr and short as ≤ 6 hr. Outcomes were measured at pre and post each regimen. Results: Twenty subjects aged 7 - 40 years completed the study. At end of long interval regimen, (median interval = 11. 1 hr), FEF 25 - 75 % and CF-specific quality of life significantly improved compared to baseline values and to short interval regimen (median interval = 0. 25 hr) outcomes. FVC, FEV 1, sputum weights, and adherence were similar in both regimens. Conclusions: A longer time interval between <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> and physiotherapy is more efficacious than short interval.

40|$|AbstractDornase alfa {{has been}} shown to reduce markers of {{inflammation}} and neutrophil-associated metalloproteinases in cystic fibrosis (CF), suggesting a potential benefit from use of this therapy early in the disease.

A 2 -year, early intervention study of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> in CF patients with early lung disease demonstrated significant improvements in lung function and risk of exacerbation compared to placebo.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} long-term treatment of young patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> maintains lung function and reduces respiratory tract exacerbations. STUDY DESIGN: This was a 96 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 49 CF centers. Inclusion criteria were age 6 to 10 years and forced vital capacity > or = 85 % predicted. Patients were excluded for hospitalization for complications of CF within 2 months and use of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> within 6 months. Patients were treated with <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> 2. 5 mg or placebo once daily with a jet nebulizer and a compressor. RESULTS: Patients were randomized, 239 to <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> and 235 to placebo. At baseline the mean age was 8. 4 years, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second 95 % predicted, the mean forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase 85 % predicted, and the mean forced vital capacity 102 % predicted. At 96 weeks the treatment benefit for <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> compared with placebo in percent predicted (mean +/- SE) was 3. 2 +/- 1. 2 for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P =. 006), 7. 9 +/- 2. 3 for forced expiratory flow between 25 % and 75 % of vital capacity (P =. 0008), and 0. 7 +/- 1. 0 for forced vital capacity (P =. 51). The risk of respiratory tract exacerbation was reduced by 34 % in patients who received <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> (relative risk 0. 66, P =. 048). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in changes in weight-for-age percentile. Adverse event profiles for the treatment groups were similar.

Thymosin beta 4 (Tbeta 4) is the major monomeric actin-sequestering peptide in cells and can depolymerize F-actin. Tbeta 4 could potentially decrease sputum viscoelasticity and adhesivity and improve sputum clearance. Sputum was collected during pulmonary function testing from 17 subjects during a cystic fibrosis (CF) center visit. Sputum rheology, cough and ciliary transportability, and interfacial tension were measured before and after the addition of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> at 30 microg/mL; Tbeta 4 at 0. 3, 3, 30, and 150 microg/mL; and Tbeta 4 with <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> at 1. 5 microg/mL each. Sputum was separately incubated with Tbeta 4 at 30 microg/mL for 0, 10, 20, or 60 min. There was a direct relationship between actin filament length and sputum cohesivity. There was a dose-dependent threshold decrease in cohesivity with Tbeta 4 and a time-dependent decrease in cohesivity over 60 min at 30 microg/mL. With the combination of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> and Tbeta 4 at 1. 5 microg/mL each, there was a 70 % decrease in G*s and a 65 % decrease in G' at 1 rad/s (p = 0. 013).

There is no evidence for aztreonam lysine for inhalation (AZLI) beyond a 28 -day course. • Efficacy and safety has not been established for use of AZLI in patients < 7 years old, TIS < 6 years old, and DA < 5 years old. • There is insufficient comparative evidence for efficacy and safety of TIS and AZLI. • There is moderate quality evidence that overall, the frequencies of pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalizations, and parenteral antipseudomonal antibiotic use are improved with chronic suppressive therapy with TIS in patients with mild to severe CF. • There is low to moderate quality short term evidence that AZLI modestly improves lung function as measured by FEV 1, improves patient-reported respiratory symptoms, and lengthens the time to use of additional antipseudomonal antibiotics compared to placebo. • A Cochrane review showed demonstrated low quality evidence that inhaled antibiotics improved lung function in patients with CF and that TIS, specifically, significantly decreased hospitalization among patients. • AZLI and TIS were well tolerated throughout all clinical trials, with cough being the most frequently reported adverse event.

30|$|Asthma, chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF) are all chronic {{pulmonary disease}}s, albeit with different etiologies, that {{are characterized by}} airflow limitation, chronic inflammation, and abnormal mucus production/rheology. Small synthetic molecule-based therapies are commonly prescribed for all three diseases. However, there has been increased interest in “biologicals” to treat these diseases. Biologicals typically constitute protein- or peptide-based therapies and are often more potent than small molecule-based drugs. In this review, we shall describe {{the pros and cons of}} several different biological-based therapies for respiratory disease, including <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa,</b> a recombinant DNAase that reduces mucus viscosity and short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC 1)-derived peptides that treat Na+ hyperabsorption and rebalance CF airway surface liquid homeostasis.|$|E
30|$|Sputum {{contains}} {{products of}} inflammation including DNA and filamentous actin (F-actin) polymers formed [4]. DNA and F-actin copolymerize {{to form a}} rigid network entangled with the mucin gel. Peptide mucolytics degrade these abnormal polymers. <b>Dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> (Pulmozyme, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) is widely used {{for the treatment of}} CF airway disease and this peptide mucolytic has been shown to improve pulmonary function and decrease the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations when used daily as an aerosol [57, 58]. However dornase has not been shown to be effective in treating any pulmonary disease other than CF [59]. The G-actin sequestering and F-actin depolymerizing peptide, thymosin β 4 has also shown promise in vitro as a peptide mucolytic and potentially an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of CF [60].|$|E
30|$|CF and COPD airways are {{characterized}} by high levels of DNA [49] and actin [60] in the lung lumen, which are released by necrotic neutrophils [36]. Excess DNA and actin adversely alter mucus rheology and increase viscosity, leading to decreased mucociliary clearance [48]. Therefore, another approach to increase mucociliary clearance in CF and COPD lungs is to decrease mucus viscosity by cleaving extracellular DNA. <b>Dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> is a recombinant version of human Dnase 1 protein that {{is used as a}} therapeutic for CF [61]. Dnase 1 cleaves extracellular DNA in the lung lumen leading to reduced DNA length/concentration and, therefore, reduced sputum viscosity. Pulmozyme is a recombinant version of human Dnase 1 marketed by Genentech for the treatment of CF. Pulmozyme is administered via nebulization and has been shown to reduce the incidence of CF infections [56].|$|E
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} is multiple organ pathology {{that requires}} a complex treatment. Its standardization and pharmacoeconomic analysis are absolutely necessary. We performed a retrospective analysis of the trends in life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients who lived in Moscow in 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013. It {{was found that the}} survival rate of these patients depended on the choice of drug therapy (pancreatic enzymes, <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa,</b> intravenous and inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics), changes in diet, active dispensary observation at a specialized center for cystic fibrosis, and neonatal screening. We determined the cost of drug therapy per patient. From  1993 to 2013, the survival rate of patients who lived in Moscow increased by more than 20 years (from 16 to 39 years, respectively).  The average cost of therapy increased more than 10 times (from USD 1. 8 to 21. 9 thousand, respectively). </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRoutine CF {{management}} {{often does}} not include upper airway (UAW) assessment although CFTR defects equally affect the sinonasal mucosa. Up to 50 % of CF patients have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and/or nasal polyps, and almost 100 % reveal UAW abnormalities on CT scan. CRS impairs quality of life. UAW dysfunction in filtering, humidifying, and warming inspired air affects lower airways and the UAW is a potential site of first colonization and a reservoir for opportunistic bacteria. Therefore, UAW pathology substantially affects overall health in CF. Standard treatments are scarce and mostly lack evidence. Nasal douche can remove mucus and crusts. Recently, delivery of <b>dornase</b> <b>alfa</b> using a vibrating aerosol has shown potential as treatment for CF-related CRS. Surgery is indicated when conservative approaches fail but postoperative relapse is frequent. In summary, upper airway involvement in CF is undertreated and requires prospective investigation and an interdisciplinary consensus on diagnosis and therapy...|$|E
