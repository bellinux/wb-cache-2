25|$|Numbers {{are usually}} written in Arabic numerals. Roman numerals are only {{used in some}} special {{traditional}} cases, only to express ordinal numbers (e.g. to express the numbering of monarchs, popes, districts of a city, congresses, etc.). Their use is advisable {{if they have a}} distinctive role as opposed to Arabic numbers, e.g. to denote the month between the year and the day, or to mark the floor number <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> number.|$|E
2500|$|Krämer instead {{proposed}} as the [...] "most obvious source" [...] of Degas's composition a lithograph by Paul Gavarni: sheet number five from the Lorettes series, published in 1841 in Le Charivari. Gavarni {{was an artist}} greatly admired by Degas, who amassed a collection of some 2,000 of Gavarni's lithographs. Points of similarity between the print and Interior are described by Krämer: As in Degas's Le Viol, [...] has her back turned towards the man who stands <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> his legs spread wide and {{his hands in his}} pockets. From above, as if contemplating his prize, his gaze is fixed on the woman who, significantly, is seated on an animal-skin rug. Not only is the man's posture reminiscent of Degas's painting, but the woman is also in a comparable pose, her right hand raised to her head, her garment sliding off her shoulder. Even the pictures on the wall and the discarded clothes on the sofa could have inspired Degas.|$|E

2500|$|Set dresser Frank Silva {{was cast}} as the mysterious [...] "Bob". Lynch himself recalls that the idea {{originated}} when he overheard Silva moving furniture around in the bedroom set, and then heard a woman warning Silva not to block himself in by moving furniture <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Lynch was struck with an image of Silva in the room. When he learned that Silva was an actor, he filmed two panning shots, one with Silva {{at the base of}} the bed, and one without; he did not yet know how he would use this material. Later that day, during the filming of Sarah Palmer having a vision, the camera operator told Lynch that the shot was ruined because [...] "Frank [...] was reflected in the mirror." [...] Lynch comments, [...] "Things like this happen and make you start dreaming. And one thing leads to another, and if you let it, a whole other thing opens up." [...] Lynch used the panning shot of Silva in the bedroom, and the shot featuring Silva's reflection, in the closing scenes of the European version of the pilot episode. Silva's reflection in the mirror can also be glimpsed during the scene of Sarah's vision at the end of the original pilot, but it is less clear. A close-up of Silva in the bedroom later became a significant image in episodes of the TV series.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these exceptions, Number 10 {{has been}} known as the Prime Minister's {{official}} home for over one hundred years. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, photography and the penny press had linked Number 10 in the public mind with the premiership. The introduction of films and television would strengthen this association. Pictures of prime ministers with distinguished guests at the door became commonplace. With or without the Prime Minister present, visitors had their picture taken. Suffragettes posed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> when they petitioned H. H. Asquith for women's rights in 1913, a picture that became famous and was circulated around the world. In 1931, Mohandas Gandhi, wearing the traditional homespun dhoti, posed leaving Number 10 after meeting with Ramsay MacDonald to discuss India's independence. This picture, too, became famous especially in India. The freedom fighters could see their leader had been received in the Prime Minister's home. Couse's elegant, understated door—stark black, framed in cream white with a bold white [...] "10" [...] clearly visible—was the perfect backdrop to record such events. Prime Ministers made historic announcements from the front step. Waving the Anglo-German Agreement of Friendship, Neville Chamberlain proclaimed [...] "Peace with honour" [...] in 1938 from Number 10 after his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich. During World War II, Churchill was photographed many times emerging confidently from Number 10 holding up two fingers in the sign for [...] "Victory".|$|E
2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, sitting <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or {{had anything to do with}} the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
