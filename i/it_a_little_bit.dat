5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.|$|E

I mean, doesn't everybody wish that somebody was going to sing this about them? And the song is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different for me. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> vulnerable ... basically saying, 'I can't believe I have you, and everybody else thinks you're amazing, but you're all mine.' I love the fact that <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different. <b>It's</b> something that songs have said forever -- 'I love you' -- but <b>it's</b> said in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> different way, and I thought that was really cool." ...|$|R

500|$|... "After I {{showed the}} film to George , at an hour and 55 minutes, {{we looked at each}} other," [...] Spielberg remembered. [...] "The first thing that we said was, 'Too fast'. We needed to {{decelerate}} the action. I did a few more matte shots to slow it down. We made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> slower, by putting breathing room back in so there'd be a two-hour oxygen supply for the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|One feminist {{viewpoint}} {{sees the}} bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes. US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant [...] "yanking and fiddling." [...] Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over-straining the abdominal muscles while {{many others have}} gone through augmentation mammoplasty to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that [...] "it's kind of disrespectful to the female players. I'm sure the male spectators love it, but I find <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> offensive." ...|$|E

[...] Before the 2011–12 season, he relented, [...] "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." ...|$|E
5000|$|About the album's title, Campbell explained: [...] "I {{was at this}} {{turning point}} with the new record where I was like, “I don't want {{to write about the}} {{suburban}} American experience anymore ...” I was thinking about other things in life ... It started to feel like I was in a footrace with an expanding universe, and I was never {{going to get to the}} finish line." [...] No Closer to Heaven is a concept album, detailing the loss of a loved one. Asked how this album is different compared to their previous output, Campbell replied: [...] "We want to make something new. We just tried to push out in every direction. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> softer, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> louder, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> faster, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> slower. <b>It</b> moves out every way." [...] All the songs were written by The Wonder Years at The Nightmare Factory. Campbell wrote all the lyrics in, according to the album booklet, [...] "his bedroom and various coffee shops or parks." [...] Jason Aalon Butler provided additional lyrics for [...] "Stained Glass Ceilings" [...] while in the break room at the studio. In [...] "Cardinals", Campbell expresses grief about himself [...] "being too self-involved to see when someone you love needs your help." [...] "Thanks for the Ride" [...] was written about Campbell's deceased friend who he ponders what her life would be like if she had lived. Campbell explained that he attempted to write a verse [...] "if person had come out of the coma scenario".|$|R

500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought." [...] Drummer Dave Grohl has stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, [...] "Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> hard to believe that the song has {{a lot to say about}} something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wisteria Lane set, {{which is}} located on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios, {{underwent}} changes for the time jump. Production designer P. Erik Carlson explained, [...] " [...] had already created a fairly Utopian world, and we wanted to exaggerate and enhance <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more, mostly through the use of color. We didn’t want it to feel ridiculously futuristic or viewers would be jarred by the contrast." [...] Bree's garage was remodeled into a testing kitchen as result of the character's catering business. Additionally, all houses were repainted with bolder colors, with the exception of Gabrielle's home, in order to reflect the Solis' financial situation.|$|E
500|$|The role of Holly {{was created}} by series co-creator Ryan Murphy {{specifically}} for Paltrow, a personal friend. Murphy suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Murphy said of Paltrow, [...] "Gwyneth is a great singer. She's done <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> but I really want to show it off and show everyone how great she is." [...] It {{was not the first}} time Paltrow had sung on screen: she played a karaoke singer in the movie Duets in 2000, and had a number one hit in Australia for her duet of [...] "Cruisin' from its soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell.

5000|$|Much of {{the initial}} {{critical}} response to Deutscher's compositions and recitals centred on her age and status as a child prodigy. Commenting on the public perception of child prodigies and their musical output, Deutscher has said [...] "….I want my music to be taken seriously….and sometimes <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> {{difficult for people to}} take me seriously because I'm just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl." ...|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of the points deduction, Arsenal were placed second in the league, eight points behind leaders Liverpool and one in front of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. O'Leary {{expressed}} his disappointment at the docked points: [...] "The champagne will be out at Liverpool tonight because this makes our task very much harder." [...] His teammate Limpar was more optimistic: [...] "It seems very harsh. It makes <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> harder to catch Liverpool, but it is not impossible." [...] Indeed, Arsenal went on to lose just one game all season and won the First Division title, seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. They became England's first representatives in the European Cup since the ban imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted. Manchester United finished sixth, but did not end the season empty-handed, winning the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup in the first season English clubs were allowed back into UEFA competitions.|$|E
500|$|To lend {{a strong}} air of realism to Gordon's death, {{the scene was}} created by {{combining}} various special effects during filming with post-production visual effects. Plastic razor wire with blood tubing aided in the initial phases of the decapitation; it would slightly sink into Brown's neck as pressure was applied, forcing out the fake blood. For the aftermath, Brown laid down on the floor, and the visual effects department removed his head from the shot and recreated it as a three-dimensional model. The department decided to [...] "push <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> farther" [...] by having the head rocking into place and the mouth twitching, but Standards and Practices found it too graphic and forced them to remove the motion. Established in the first-season episode [...] "Dead Man's Blood" [...] were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the design has been subtly improved with each vampire episode. Though the special effects makeup department used molds of the actors' mouths to create the fanged acrylic dentures, McNab noted {{that it was very}} difficult to speak while wearing them. Blood-like makeup around the actors' mouths helped to round out the vampiric visages.|$|E
500|$|While on hiatus {{between the}} release of his first EP Versus and Looking 4 Myself, Usher told AOL Music that he mainly {{traveled}} to various locations {{to listen to music}} which he [...] "felt was really significant in terms of energy." [...] Some of these locations included the Coachella Music Festival, Ibiza, Germany, Las Vegas, Miami and Southern France. He described some of the music as a [...] "little bit more electronic, some of <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more dance. Some of it, a bit more world." [...] It was Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun that inspired Usher to produce the album's title track, with producer Rico Love, which led to the singer collaborating with producers he normally wouldn't work with or admired, such as Diplo. Usher's intention for the album was one [...] "that was not genre-specific but just experimental". During an episode of NBC's The Voice, Usher called the album [...] "by far one of my most risky records ... I wanted to challenge myself". Looking 4 Myself was chosen as the album's title as it described Usher's 'musical journey'.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{revealed}} that the album's title would be Stronger. She described it as [...] "very much about strength and empowerment, so Stronger felt like the perfect title. Plus that song is just a gold mine — <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> pop, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> pop-rock, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> urban, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> dance, and <b>it</b> ties everything in.

5000|$|... "Strange" [...] is a {{moderate}} up-tempo {{in which the}} narrator says that she has just ended a relationship, and that she finds it [...] "strange" [...] {{that she is not}} upset over its ending. McEntire described the song as [...] "tongue-in-cheek. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about, you know, 'I'm supposed to be in love with this guy and really heartbroken, but I'm not.' So, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> tough-woman song." ...|$|R
500|$|Kolb {{competed in}} North Texas fishing tournaments in the offseason. [...] Kolb also enjoys hunting wild hogs {{in his spare}} time. It may seem {{dangerous}} to hunt with just a twelve-inch Bowie knife, but Kolb, assured the public, [...] "Our dogs go and find 'em first, and then we stab the pigs. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> dangerous, {{but as long as}} you know what you're doing, you'll be all right." ...|$|R
500|$|Both [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] and [...] "That's How You Know" [...] {{also pay}} tributes to past Disney songs. [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] pays a lyrical homage to such songs as [...] "Whistle While You Work" [...] (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), [...] "The Work Song" [...] (Cinderella) [...] "A Spoonful of Sugar" [...] (Mary Poppins) and “Making Christmas” (The Nightmare Before Christmas), and a musical {{homage to the}} Sherman Brothers (with a self-parodic [...] "Alan Menken style" [...] middle eight). [...] "That's How You Know" [...] is a self-parody of Menken's {{compositions}} for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as [...] "Under the Sea" [...] (The Little Mermaid) and [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] (Beauty and the Beast). To achieve this, Schwartz admitted he had to [...] "push <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics" [...] while maintaining [...] "the classic Walt Disney sensibility". However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been [...] "a little tongue-in-cheek". As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad [...] "So Close" [...] and the country/pop number [...] "Ever Ever After" [...] (sung by Carrie Underwood as a voice-over).|$|E
500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold your head down, so your view is only about {{a foot and a half}} in front of you, which still makes <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create the Night King, {{according}} to Barrie Gower, it is primarily practical prosthetic, but also incorporates some VFX {{to create a more}} icy look and feel, saying about the eyes, [...] "The effects department alters the eyes in post-production. They give them that blue-glowy hue to them, which we can't really achieve with contact lenses." [...] In regards to the overall prosthetic, [...] "they've added this sort of icy layer over the top of him to create this — it's something incredibly difficult to achieve practically, prosthetics are cast in a translucent rubber, which can only give you so much of that icy quality, so visual effects help augment <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> further to give it more dimension." [...] Prior to the sixth season, the Night King was portrayed by Richard Brake, with a head mold of Brake being created in order to accurately mold the prosthetic to his face. In the sixth season he was portrayed by Vladimir Furdik. The White Walker army was first shot in front of a green screen in Magheramorne quarry, and according to a piece in The Hollywood Reporter [...] "A scan was taken from a drone and used as the basis for a CG model of the location, which was augmented with VFX and joined with volcanic hills that were photographed in Iceland." [...] Crowd replication was used to create the 1,000-man army, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer saying [...] "It's scans of those actors in the makeup and costumes, with variations we used to make a digital army that extends up onto the hills." [...] Bauer also noted that VFX were used to create the weather conditions in the scene, noting [...] "It's wind, mist, fog and heavy atmosphere that you'd get in a marine layer. The dramatic value is to say something's wrong; it's a mystery what they are facing. The temperature drops, and our characters can see their breath. The weather obscures their vision." [...] Spain-based El Ranchito, one of several special effects companies used by Game of Thrones, was responsible for the White Walker army shots.|$|E
