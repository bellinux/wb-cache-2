40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{typically}} divides asymmetrically {{to give a}} large mother {{cell and}} a smaller daughter cell. As mother cells become old, they enlarge and produce daughter cells that are larger than <b>daughters</b> derived <b>from</b> young mother cells. We found that occasional daughter cells were indistinguishable in size from their mothers, giving rise to a symmetric division. The frequency of symmetric divisions became greater as mother cells aged and reached a maximum occurrence of 30 % in mothers undergoing their last cell division. Symmetric divisions occurred similarly in rad 9 and ste 12 mutants. Strikingly, <b>daughters</b> <b>from</b> old mothers, whether they arose from symmetric divisions or not, displayed reduced life spans relative to <b>daughters</b> <b>from</b> young mothers. Because <b>daughters</b> <b>from</b> old mothers were larger than <b>daughters</b> <b>from</b> young mothers, we investigated whether an increased size per se shortened life span {{and found that it}} did not. These findings are consistent with a model for aging that invokes a senescence substance which accumulates in old mother cells and is inherited by their daughters...|$|R

5|$|One notable {{section of}} Riverside is Silvertown, a {{subdivision}} developed in 1887 for African Americans.

A few one-story wood-frame houses in the area may date to the original development, including one pantation house owned by a woman and then her <b>daughter</b> <b>from</b> 1887 into the 1980s.|$|E
