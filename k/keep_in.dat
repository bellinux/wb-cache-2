5|$|During the 12th century, {{new designs}} {{began to be}} {{introduced}} – <b>in</b> France, quatrefoil-shaped <b>keeps</b> were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By {{the end of the}} century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without <b>keeps.</b> <b>In</b> Spain, <b>keeps</b> were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall towers called Bergfriede were preferred to <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> the western fashion. In {{the second half of the}} 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of <b>keeps.</b> <b>In</b> France, the <b>keep</b> at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, tower <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.|$|R

In the fall of 1941, FDR rewrote his will to leave half of the annual income from his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) for LeHand's care, and half to Eleanor. The will stated that upon LeHand's death the income would go to Eleanor, with the principal eventually divided equally among his children. As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.|$|E

5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E

5|$|By 1958 the castle's {{condition}} {{had deteriorated}} and the Ministry of Works took legal {{custody of the}} site, although it continued to be owned by the Howard family. Conservation work {{took place during the}} 1960s, stabilising the stonework of the keep. Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on the <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, and grass lawns laid down around the remaining stonework and foundations. Further excavations were carried out in 1987 during the construction of the ticket office beside the castle.|$|E
