5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fears of}} his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This {{is seen as a}} cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E

Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we got a chance to do it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would [...] "fall on his face with improvisation" [...] but soon [...] "was churning out material faster than [...] could make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|According to some writers, Sex {{also helped}} Madonna {{make a name}} in the porn industry, and earned her the title of S's first {{cultural}} ambassador and was praised for recreating [...] "porn-chic". Humberto Quiroga Lavié pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Sex was considered pornographic that helped it become a bestseller. Steve Bachmann, on his book Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity pointed out that [...] "perhaps {{one of the most}} interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise". McNair wrote in his book that [...] "Sex brought out the personal underground to the surface of pop culture". London art critic Sarah Kent wrote in Time Out magazine that the timing of Sex was [...] "impeccable. Obsessions about the human body was in vogue, with Madonna's book as well as artist Andres Serrano's [...] "cumming shots" [...] and Jeff Koons' The Jeff Koons Handbook, the latter portrayed fairytale pictures of the artist having sex with his pornographic actor wife, Cicciolina.|$|E

500|$|King is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately. Other bowlers in his time could sometimes get the ball to swing, but King w{{as one of the}} first to do so at will with an old or new ball. He made use of a lethal delivery which he called the [...] "angler", a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher, to confuse the English batsmen. He would come in with the ball clasped above his head in both hands as would a baseball pitcher. He was famous for his late swing—in and out—and would produce the in-swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder. He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or [...] of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen. After a tour to Philadelphia by an Australian side in 1896, George Giffen said [...] "the Philadelphians really have some high-class players, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that upset our batsmen." ...|$|E
500|$|Nellee Hooper {{produced}} {{another new}} {{addition to the}} compilation, the cover version of Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Want You". After Madonna accepted Hooper's suggestion to collaborate with Massive Attack, the band sent Madonna {{the music of the}} song first. Robert [...] "3D" [...] Del Naja, one of the band members, subsequently went to New York with Hooper and worked in the studio for two days. Del Naja said, [...] "I think the really cool thing about <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that [...] sang it so beautifully. There was no special effects, no messing around—it was just in there singing it with a lot of passion and soul." [...] The opening track of the compilation, [...] "I Want You" [...] starts with a long introduction featuring a hip-hop drum beat with emphasis on the bass section of the instrumental alongside a semi-tonal string figure. The second verse features a harp and a repeating drum loop accompanied with a telephone style bleeping sound. Madonna's vocals at times are accompanied by spoken passages with her overall vocals dominating the track, with lyrics discussing a man that no longer wants her, while she is determined to change his mind. The compilation closes with the orchestral version of [...] "I Want You" [...] in which the original drum track, bass and percussion are removed. The version starts slower with Madonna's vocals entering with a low string bass line only, gradually more string arrangements are added with harp and brass featured in the background of the mix. A moment {{towards the end of the}} track hears her voice with no accompaniment creating a [...] "dramatic" [...] theme, and overall the version features around 20 seconds less than the original.|$|E

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of modern science, the main obstacle {{to the evolution of}} language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one.

As <b>the</b> saying goes, 'words <b>are</b> cheap.' <b>The</b> problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists.|$|R

"What {{was said}} in court was a defense {{argument}} made that we put a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury {{that they ought to}} convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there <b>was</b> a cloud over anyone was not our doing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of <b>the</b> case. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of <b>the</b> case. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods.

Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show.

[...] " [...] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that they were going to}} have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun.

The benefits of such a policy are based on theoretical models that assume foreign manufacturers sell directly to consumers.

We present a model of retailers that illustrates how accounting for these strategic intermediaries can actually make some domestic manufacturers worse off in response to an increased tariff. Moreover, any production gains that occur are biased towards higher cost domestic manufacturers.
