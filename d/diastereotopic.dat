50|$|The stereochemical term <b>diastereotopic</b> {{refers to}} the {{relationship}} between two groups in a molecule which, if replaced, would generate compounds that are diastereomers. <b>Diastereotopic</b> groups are often, but not always, identical groups attached to the same atom in a molecule containing at least one chiral center.|$|E

50|$|In chiral {{molecules}} containing <b>diastereotopic</b> groups, {{such as in}} 2-bromobutane, there is no requirement for enantiomeric or optical purity; no matter its proportion, each enantiomer will generate enantiomeric sets of diastereomers upon substitution of <b>diastereotopic</b> groups (though, {{as in the case}} of substitution by bromine in 2-bromobutane, meso isomers have, strictly speaking, no enantiomer).|$|E

50|$|Heterotopic {{groups are}} those that when {{substituted}} are structurally different. They are not <b>diastereotopic</b> or enantiotopic.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>diastereotopic</b> is also {{applied to}} {{identical}} groups {{attached to the}} same end of an alkene moiety which, if replaced, would generate geometric isomers (also falling {{in the category of}} diastereomers). Thus, the CH2 hydrogens of propene are <b>diastereotopic,</b> one being cis to the CH3 group, and the other being trans to it, and replacement of one or the other with CH3 would generate cis- or trans--2-butene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diastereotopic</b> {{groups also}} arise in achiral molecules. For instance, any {{one pair of}} CH2 hydrogens in 3-pentanol (Figure 1) are <b>diastereotopic,</b> as the two CH2 carbons are enantiotopic. Substitution of {{any one of the}} four CH2 hydrogens creates two chiral centers at once, and the two {{possible}} hydrogen substitution products at any one CH2 carbon will be diastereomers. This kind of relationship is often easier to detect in cyclic molecules. For instance, any pair of CH2 hydrogens in cyclopentanol (Figure 1) are similarly <b>diastereotopic,</b> and this is easily discerned as one of the hydrogens in the pair will be cis to the OH group (on {{the same side of the}} ring face) while the other will be trans to it (on the opposite side).|$|E
50|$|When {{attached}} to chiral metal centers, the P-methyl groups are <b>diastereotopic,</b> appearing as separate doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum.|$|E
50|$|In {{unsymmetrical}} ethylated compounds, the methylene protons in the ethyl substituent are <b>diastereotopic.</b> Chiral reagents {{are known}} to stereoselectively modify such substituents.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{enantiotopic}} and <b>diastereotopic</b> {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} faces of planar groups (especially carbonyl groups and alkene moities). See Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diastereotopic</b> {{groups are}} not mirror images {{of one another}} about any plane. They are always different, in any environment, but may not be distinguishable. For instance, both pairs of CH2 hydrogens in ethyl phenylalaninate {{hydrochloride}} (PhCH2CH(NH3+)COOCH2CH3 Cl−) are <b>diastereotopic</b> and both give pairs of distinct 1H-NMR signals in DMSO-d6 at 300 MHz, but in the similar ethyl 2-nitrobutanoate (CH3CH2CH(NO2)COOCH2CH3), only the CH2 group next to the chiral center gives distinct signals from its two hydrogens with the same instrument in CDCl3. Such signals are often complex because of small differences in chemical shift, overlap and an additional strong coupling between geminal hydrogens. On the other hand, the two CH3 groups of ipsenol, which are three bonds away from the chiral center, give separate 1H doublets at 300 MHz and separate 13C-NMR signals in CDCl3, but the <b>diastereotopic</b> hydrogens in ethyl alaninate hydrochloride (CH3CH(NH3+)COOCH2CH3 Cl−), also three bonds away from the chiral center, show barely distinguishable 1H-NMR signals in DMSO-d6.|$|E
50|$|In stereochemistry, topicity is the stereochemical {{relationship}} between substituents {{and the structure}} {{to which they are}} attached. Depending on the relationship, such groups can be heterotopic, homotopic, enantiotopic, or <b>diastereotopic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diastereoselective {{epoxidation}} may {{be achieved}} {{through the use of}} alkene starting materials with <b>diastereotopic</b> faces. When racemic 3-isopropylcyclohexene was subjected to DMD oxidation, the trans epoxide, which resulted from attack on the less hindered face of the double bond, was the major product.|$|E
50|$|For example, the two {{hydrogen}} atoms of the CH2 moiety in (S)-2-bromobutane are <b>diastereotopic.</b> Replacement of one hydrogen atom (colored blue) with a bromine atom will produce (2S,3R)-2,3-dibromobutane. Replacement {{of the other}} hydrogen atom (colored red) with a bromine atom will produce the diastereomer (2S,3S)-2,3-dibromobutane.|$|E
5000|$|Diastereotopicity is {{not limited}} to organic molecules, nor to groups {{attached}} to carbon, nor to molecules with chiral tetrahedral (sp3-hybridized) centers: for instance, the pair of hydrogens in any CH2 or NH2 group in tris(ethylenediamine)chromium(III) ion (Cr(en)33+), where the metal center is chiral, are <b>diastereotopic</b> (Figure 2).|$|E
5000|$|Nonenzymatic {{methods for}} the {{differentiation}} of enantiotopic groups employ chiral catalysts or auxiliaries. For instance, {{the introduction of}} a chiral leaving group on both carboxylic acid groups of a meso diacid leads to selective attack by an achiral nucleophile at one of the (now) <b>diastereotopic</b> carbonyl groups.(13) ...|$|E
50|$|Cp′ {{can be used}} {{to probe}} the {{structure}} of organometallic complexes. For example, Cp′Fe(PPh3)(CO)I has four different signals in the 1H-NMR spectrum for the ring hydrogens and five different signals in the 13C-NMR spectrum for the ring carbons. There is therefore no symmetry within the ring even accounting for rotation around the ring-metal axis, but instead there is a <b>diastereotopic</b> relationship as a result of being part of a chiral complex. The achiral precursor complex Cp'Fe(CO)2I has only two signals for those hydrogens and three for those carbons, indicating a symmetric structure.|$|E
50|$|Enantiotopic {{groups are}} {{identical}} and indistinguishable except in chiral environments. For instance, the CH2 hydrogens in ethanol (CH3CH2OH) are normally enantiotopic, {{but can be}} made different (<b>diastereotopic)</b> if combined with a chiral center, for instance by conversion to an ester of a chiral carboxylic acid such as lactic acid, or if coordinated to a chiral metal center, or if associated with an enzyme active site, since enzymes are constituted of chiral amino acids. Indeed, {{in the presence of}} the enzyme LADH, one specific hydrogen is removed from the CH2 group during the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, and it gets replaced in the same place during the reverse reaction. The chiral environment needs not be optically pure for this effect.|$|E
50|$|Stereochemistry {{also plays}} a role {{assigning}} faces to trigonal molecules such as ketones. A nucleophile in a nucleophilic addition can approach the carbonyl group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks acetone, both faces are identical and {{there is only one}} reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks butanone, the faces are not identical (enantiotopic) and a racemic product results. When the nucleophile is a chiral molecule diastereoisomers are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called <b>diastereotopic.</b> The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (R or S) also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the re-faces and si-faces. In the example displayed on the right, the compound acetophenone is viewed from the re face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the S-enantiomer and attack from the opposite Si face will give the R-enantiomer. However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral center from the re-face will not always lead to an S stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from. In the above-mentioned example, if chloride (Cl-) was added to the prochiral center from the re-face, this would result in an R-enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|Kalkitoxin {{has five}} chiral centers, {{one of which}} is the ring carbon to which the {{terminal}} alkene is coordinated, with the remaining four occurring at tertiary carbon atoms along the aliphatic chain originating from the imine nitrogen. The total stereochemistry of natural (+)-kalkitoxin is 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R. For this determination, 3JCH values by a variation of the HSQMBC pulse technique, a type of HMBC spectroscopy, and 3JHH values by exclusive correlation spectroscopy (E.COSY). These methods use NMR to evaluate the spin-spin coupling constants which directly relate to the dihedral angle of the atoms being analyzed, allowing for the determination of chirality. This was used to determine the stereochemistry of chiral centers at C7, C8, and C10. Because C7 and C8 are adjacent stereocenters, these techniques allowed for immediate determination of their relative stereochemistry, however C10 is separated from C8 by C9, which carries two <b>diastereotopic</b> protons. This allows for the determination of relative stereochemistry of C8 and C10 to the C9 protons through J-coupling \3J coupling values, so as to relate the relative stereochemistry of C8 to C10. These methods yielded a relative stereochemistry of 7R, 8S, 10S for the aliphatic chain stereocenters. Stereochemistry at C3 was determined by Marfey's analysis, wherein the compound was ozonized and subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain cysteic acid from the thiazoline ring and attached terminal alkene. Marfey's analysis indicated this amino acid derivative was L-cysteic acid, indicating R absolute stereochemistry at C3. The absolute stereochemistry of the total molecule was determined by synthesizing the possible configurations of the already determined relative chiralities, and comparison of these to natural Kalkitoxin via 13C NMR shift differences, revealing the natural (+)-kalkitoxin stereochemistry to be 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of stereoselectivity in methyl methacrylate (MMA) monometallic polymerization {{promoted by the}} C- 1 -symmetric ansa-Me 2 C(CP) (Ind) Zr-based zirconocene, presenting two <b>diastereotopic</b> coordination sites, was investigated within density functional theory. At variance from the case of propene polymerization, our results suggest that MMA addition is stereoselective when the growing chain is in the more hindered {{as well as in}} the more open <b>diastereotopic</b> coordination site. In both cases the same enantioface of the enolate bond of the ester enolate growing chain is selected, although selectivity is higher when the growing chain is in the more hindered <b>diastereotopic</b> coordination site. Further, there is no substantial energy difference between these two situations, which indicates that the moderate isotacticity of the produced PMMA is consistent with an almost regular chain-migratory mechanism. The different stereoselectivity of the two <b>diastereotopic</b> sites is due to different steric interaction between the growing chain (chain effect) or MMA (monomer effect) with the indenyl ligand. This decomposition of stereoselectivity into chain and monomer effects is used to reinvestigate the stereoselectivity of strictly related C- 2 - and C-s-symmetric zirconocenes...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{different strategies}} to desymmetrise 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene derivatives with concomitant {{formation of a}} quaternary stereogenic centre. Chapter 1 gives {{a brief overview of}} the previous desymmetrisation and <b>diastereotopic</b> group selection processes of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene derivatives. Chapter 2 describes the initial model studies for the formation of the quaternary stereogenic centre using achiral cyclohexa- 1, 4 -dienone derivatives. This was developed to permit stereoselective formation of a quaternary stereogenic centre using a chiral sulfinyl group as the stereodirecting influence during the cyclisation step. This proceeded with acceptable levels of discrimination between the two <b>diastereotopic</b> double bonds. Chapter 3 outlines attempts to improve the level of diastereoselectivity obtained {{under the influence of the}} sulfinyl group by synthesising a range of different compounds having only carbon atoms in the tether. Chapter 4 describes the desymmetrisation of the two <b>diastereotopic</b> double bonds of derivatives of cyclohexa- 1, 4 -diene using free-radical methodology. The sense and level of the diastereoselectivity is dependent on the protecting group used. Application of this methodology toward natural product synthesis has been described. Chapters 5 describes the desymmetrisation of the two <b>diastereotopic</b> double bonds of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene derivatives using the Prins cyclisation reaction. This approach afforded an easy and stereocontrolled access to fused tetrahydropyrans and tetrahydrofurans depending on the reaction conditions employed.

40|$|Abstract Background Biological {{chemistry}} is very stereospecific. Nonetheless, the <b>diastereotopic</b> oxygen atoms of diphosphate-containing molecules in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are often given names {{that do not}} uniquely distinguish them from each other {{due to the lack}} of standardization. This issue has largely not been addressed by the protein structure community. Results Of 472 <b>diastereotopic</b> atom pairs studied from the PDB, 118 were found to have names that are not uniquely assigned. Among the molecules identified with these inconsistencies were many cofactors of enzymatic processes such as mononucleotides (e. g. ADP, ATP, GTP), dinucleotide cofactors (e. g. FAD, NAD), and coenzyme A. There were no overall trends in naming conventions, though ligand-specific trends were prominent. Conclusion The lack of standardized naming conventions for <b>diastereotopic</b> atoms of small molecules has left the ad hoc names assigned to many of these atoms non-unique, which may create problems in data-mining of the PDB. We suggest a naming convention to resolve this issue. The in-house software used in this study is available upon request.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{calculated}} chemical shifts for a {{range of}} <b>diastereotopic</b> protons in proteins (i. e. methylene protons, and the methyl groups of valine and leucine residues), using a recently optimised method for chemical shift calculation. The calculations are based on crystal structure coordinates, and ave been compared with experimental stereospecific assignments. The results indicate that chemical shifts can be used to suggest stereospecific assignments with about 80 % probability of being correct, in cases where both the experimental and the calculated chemical shift differences between a pair of <b>diastereotopic</b> protons are greater than 0. 3 ppm. Inaccurate calculations are shown to be caused in most cases by differences between crystal and solution structures. Furthermore, chemical shift calculations based on NMR structures are shown to be capable of acting as a further constraint on structure, by limiting the range of side-chain conformations adopted in structures calculated from NMR data...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{examples of}} net diastereotopic-group-selective radical processes having the unusual feature {{that a single}} product is formed even though the key reaction of the two <b>diastereotopic</b> radical precursors is nonselective. For example, reaction of (R) -N-(cyclohex- 2 -en- 1 -yl) -N-(2, 6 -diiodo- 4 - methylphenyl) acetamide with tributyltin hydride produces 1 -((4 aR, 9 aR) - 6 -methyl- 2, 3, 4, 4 a-tetrahydro- 1 H-carbazol- 9 (9 aH) -yl) ethanone with high product selectivity and in high yield. Analysis of the concentration profiles of the closed-shell intermediates at the halfway point of the reaction shows that nonselective abstraction of <b>diastereotopic</b> iodides by tin radicals occurs, leading to diastereomeric aryl radicals. These isomeric intermediates evolve via two nonintersecting reaction pathways, cyclization and bimolecular trapping or vice versa, into the same final product. Origins of the selectivity are suggested {{on the basis of}} conformational analysis of the products using both X-ray crystallography and density functional theory calculations. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{stereoselectivity}} of {{isotopic exchange}} by the <b>diastereotopic</b> methylene protons was examined for two ketones: (a) the conformationally rigid biarylcycloheptadienone, 16; (b) the conformationally rigid tricycloketone, Twistan- 4 -one, 17. (a) The <b>diastereotopic</b> alpha-keto methylene protons in 16 {{were found to}} undergo H/D exchange with a rate ratio of 63 : 1 in methanol- 0 -d with sodium methoxide as base, the proton whose C-H bond is perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} C= 0 bond exchanging fastest. The ratio decreased to 34 : 1 with sodium phenoxide base and 7 : 1 with sodium 2, 6 -dimethylphenoxide as base (both in methanol- 0 -d), showing that the more labile proton is in the more sterically hindered position. The effect of internal return was evaluated qualitatively by measuring the rate ratio for H/D exchange in the presence of crown ether. No change in stereoselectivity was observed. Also, the rate ratio for the back exchange (D/H) was measured as 12 : 1, a change consistent with the absence of internal return. Attempts to quantitatively evaluate the effect of internal return by measurement of the primary isotope effects (kH/kT and kD/kT) gave unacceptable results, probably due to the large effect of experimental errors on the calculated internal return vales. The absence of internal return was therefore assumed. However, these primary isotope effects along with the D/H exchange ratio of 12 : 1 were used to estimate the kH/kD values and solvent isotope effects at the two <b>diastereotopic</b> positions. It was found that the two protons exhibit different primary isotope effects (kH/k D) and different solvent isotope effects. F or the fast position, kH/kD = 3. 8, kMeOD/kMeOH = 2. 6. For the slow positions, kH/kD = 2. 3, kMeOD/kMeOH = 1. 2. These results are consistent with the two protons having different exchange mechanisms and therefore with the stereoselectivity of H/D exchange being due to the stereoelectronic control effect. The secondary isotope effect for the fast exchanging position was measured as i = 1. 18. (b) The diasteriotopic alpha-keto methylene protons in 17 were found to undergo H/D exchange with a rate ratio of 300 : 1 in methanol- 0 -d with sodium methoxide as base and 340 : 1 with sodium phenoxide as base. It was therefore concluded that the <b>diastereotopic</b> protons were in sterically similar environments. Assuming no internal return and the same secondary and solvent isotope effects which had been measured directly for 16, the measured rate ratio for back exchange (D/H) for 17 of 52 : 1 was used to estimate KH/kD = 5. 8 for the fast position and kH/kD = 2. 9 for the slow position. These results are again consistent with differing mechanisms for exchange at the two <b>diastereotopic</b> positions and therfore with stereoelectronic control as the factor responsible for the high exchange ratio for these protons...|$|E
