40|$|Recognition of {{individuals}} {{is necessary for}} accurate <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> dynamics for effective management and conservation. Identifying individual wildlife by their distinctive body marks {{is one of the}} least invasive methods available. Although widely practiced, this method is mostly manual where newly captured images are compared with those in the library of previously captured images. The ability to do so automatically using computer vision techniques can improve speed and accuracy, facilitate on-field matching, and so on. This paper reports the results of using a texture based image feature descriptor, the Local Binary Patterns (LBP), for the automatic identification of an important endangered species - The Great Crested Newt (GCN). The proposed approach is tested on a database of newts' distinctive belly images which are treated as a source of biometric information. Results indicate that when both appearance and spatial information of newt belly patterns are encoded into a composite LBP feature vector, the discriminating power of the system can improve significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> {{density is}} difficult and requires considerable investment of resources and time. Population indices are easier to obtain but are influenced by many unknowns and the relationships to actual population densities are usually unclear. Wildlife biologists, whether in the public or private sector, often find themselves in difficult situations where a resource manager or landowner wants good information, quickly, at low cost, and without clear objectives. In many situations, in addition to establishing clear objectives, a budget and timeframe, a biologist must understand {{and deal with the}} reality of many logistical concerns that will make the achievement of the objectives difficult or impossible. The situation is often complicated because the biology and ecology of the species of interest may be poorly understood in the specific setting and the species may be very rare or strongly influenced by current or past human activities. Methods to monitor a wildlife population may need to be tested or validated, extending the time and resources needed to complete the assigned task. In this paper, I discuss many of the challenges faced and the decisions to be made when a biologist is requested to provide useful, timely information on the status of a wildlife population...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{deals with}} bootstrap interval <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> sizes from multiple surveys in the Hluhluwe-Umfolosi Park. The jackknife procedure {{was also used}} to provide the standard errors for the survey estimates. The main wildlife speciese studied in the research were the White and Black Rhino. The survey estimates for the wildlife species were obtained using line transect sampling and mark-recapture methods respectively. The bootstrap and jackknife procedures were applied separately {{to each of the}} datasets. Bootstrap estimates for each of the time point were obtained and the confidence intervals of the bootstrap estimates were constructed using percentile and standard methods. The coverage probability was assessed using the Monte Carlo simulations. Only the nonparametric bootstrap was applied in this research and the results were compared to the jackknife results. The lengths of the confidence intervals were used to assess the confidence intervals with a shorter confidence interval being more exact. The estimates used for both the bootstrap and jackknife methodology were based on a simple state space model. The discrete state space model used was proposed by Fatti et al (2002). State space models provide a natural framework for estimating and predicting animal population abundance given partial or inexact information. The model takes into account the (unknown) birth rate in the population and all known losses (mortalities and relocations) and gains (introductions) in the population between successive surveys as well as the errors in the survey estimates...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> {{resources}} requires {{effective management}} strategies. Unbiased <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> through efficient survey methodology is therefore crucial in formulating effective wildlife management policy. I expected intensive survey for low Peary caribou populations to produce good precision and accuracy. Also, for moderate and low survey coverage to produce useful minimum counts at medium and high Peary caribou densities. Empirical Peary caribou data points and watershed delineations obtained from previous aerial survey {{carried out in}} the Island were used in creating resource selection model. The significant variables used in formulating the realistic habitat scenarios of the resource selection model included elevations, slope, and hill-shade. Specified low, medium and high densities of Peary caribou were simulated across the Island using the Resource Selection Function (RSF). Systematic transects placement of varying spacing (low, moderate and high survey coverage) were overlaid on the different population density scenarios, and distance estimation method used in determining the population estimates. The detection probabilities (more than 50 %) and the coefficient of variation (precision level as low as 18 %) of the survey designs revealed that they were suitable for Peary caribou survey in Bathurst Island. However, the accuracy levels of each survey design, measured by the percent difference between the simulated and the estimated Peary caribou populations for each density scenarios varied greatly between the intensive survey design and the moderate/low survey coverage. For low density Peary caribou, 20 % accuracy level was observed with intensive survey coverage while 75 % - 96 % accuracy level was observed for moderate and low survey coverage. Low density of Peary caribou have been reported in Bathurst Island in past surveys. I would therefore recommend that moderate or low survey coverage which produced better accuracy and relatively good precision be field-tested to assess practicability...|$|R

40|$|Accurate <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> size {{is central}} to {{effective}} management and conservation but is notoriously difficult for rare and cryptic carnivores. Mark-recapture methods can reliably estimate the abundance of large carnivores but are sensitive to departures from the assumption of equal catchability, which is probable for territorial and social carnivores. We empirically analysed how pride area, age and sex, group size and pride size of lions Panthera leo and possession of a kill affect {{the performance of the}} sight-resight method relative to concurrent total counts. We stratified the population by pride area to obtain a better sample size for reliable population size estimation, and determined the composition and size of each pride. Marking and recapture involved merely identifying and re-identifying individual lions. The per cent of the population marked in each pride area varied from 33. 3 to 100. Twenty-six estimates of pride size for 22 different pride areas and repeat surveys in five pride areas were made between September 1990 and April 1992. The second samples involved sampling with replacement, so b 5 Bailey's (1952) bias-corrected estimator for closed populations was applied. Increasing the per cent of the population marked improved accuracy only when the number of lions marked in a pride area was at least seven. Estimates were somewhat poorer when the number marked was less than seven but improved with more markings, but no estimate of population size was biased high. Age, sex, group size, pride size and feeding events all influenced the sightability of lions. Notably, females (> 1 year) were sighted or resighted in proportion to their presence in the population, whereas similarly aged males, adults or subadults fluctuated erratically about their population proportions. Sight-resight surveys of territorial and social carnivores are reliable but can be costly and time consuming...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Wildlife-human {{interactions}} are increasing in prevalence as urban sprawl continues to encroach into rural areas. Once {{considered to be}} unsuitable habitat for most wildlife species, urban/suburban areas now host an array <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> many <b>of</b> which were previously restricted to rural or pristine habitats. The presence <b>of</b> some <b>wildlife</b> species {{in close proximity to}} dense human populations can create conflict, forcing resource managers to address issues relating to urban wildlife. However, evidence suggests that wildlife residing in urban areas may not exhibit the same life history traits as their rural counterparts because of adaptation to human-induced stresses. This creates difficulty for biologists or managers that must address problems associated with urban <b>wildlife.</b> <b>Population</b> control or mitigation efforts aimed at urban wildlife require detailed knowledge of the habits <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> in urban areas.

40|$|Harvesting <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> {{by humans}} is usually {{targeted}} by sex, age or phenotypic criteria, {{and is therefore}} selective. Selective harvesting {{has the potential to}} elicit a genetic response from the target populations in several ways. First, selective harvesting may affect population demographic structure (age structure, sex ratio), which in turn may have consequences for effective population size and hence genetic diversity. Second, wildlifeharvesting regimes that use selective criteria based on phenotypic characteristics (e. g. minimum body size, horn length or antler size) have the potential to impose artificial selection on harvested populations. If there is heritable genetic variation for the target characteristic and harvesting occurs before the age of maturity, then an evolutionary response over time may ensue. Molecular ecological techniques offer ways to predict and detect genetic change in harvested populations, and therefore have great utility for effective wildlife management. Molecular markers can be used to assess the genetic structure <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> and thereby assist in the prediction of genetic impacts by delineating evolutionarily meaningful management units.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} what is known about the effects of roads on persistence <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> and to highlight areas requiring further research. By definition, populations decline before they go extinct. Small populations are known to be more susceptible to extinction (Wilcox and Murphy 1985). Therefore, the question "how do roads affect persistence <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations?</b> " is equivalent to the more tractable question "how do roads reduce <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations?</b> " Figure 1 summarizes the ways in which roads reduce <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> sizes and thereby reduce population persistence. Roads directly reduce population size through mortality (Fahrig et al. 1995) and habitat loss (Forman 2000). Habitat loss is further reduced for species that avoid habitats near roads (Reijnen et al. 1996). In addition to these direct effects on population size, roads reduce movement of animals through the landscape, which can fragment populations, thus reducing their sizes. Reduced movement can also restrict access of individuals to required resources. This limited access may result in death (e. g., through starvation) or lack of reproduction (e. g., inability to access a mate), both of which can ultimately reduce population sizes. An important question is "what is the relative importance of habitat loss, resource inaccessibility, habitat fragmentation, and road mortality on population persistence? " This question has important implications for determining what mitigation measures should have priority. For example, Jaeger and Fahrig (2001) sugges...|$|R
