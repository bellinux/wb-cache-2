5|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the film was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable {{effort was made to}} bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E

25|$|The CLC draws its {{inspiration}} from the teachings of St. Ignatius of Loyola, and receives spiritual guidance from the Jesuits. The experience of making the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius {{is of paramount importance}} {{to the members of the}} CLC. Members are encouraged to adhere to a lifestyle which is gospel-based and simple, to serve the poor and to integrate contemplation and action. As Ignatian spirituality has an essential apostolic dimension, members of the CLC do reflect also on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Gospel values into all aspects of life in today's world.|$|E
25|$|Follower-focused {{approaches}} look at {{the processes}} by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature {{in the domain of}} motivation in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in teams and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders {{need to be aware of}} the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about team effectiveness and performance.|$|E

40|$|African {{independence}} {{challenged the}} new nations of Africa with <b>how</b> best <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about {{the betterment of}} life. Before independence, Africans were subordinated and given a low priority in the sharing of their countries' economic blessings. Therefore, with the withering away of colonialism, African leaders had <b>to</b> think of <b>how</b> best <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about development for their respective countries. Developmental strategies that ensued ranged from trial and error to dogmatic. However, imperialism did not leave them alone. Many leaders were overthrown regardless of the endearment of their nationals. And, the resulting economic situation was in shambles. Natural disasters did not spare the African new states. Then again, Africans' own warrings retarded their economic growth. This paper looks into {{the ways and means}} of one of Africa's leaders, Julius Kambarage Nyerere of Tanzania, as for over two decades he struggled toward making Tanzania an economically viable nation-state...|$|R

25|$|Thanks to Henry's quick thinking, {{he looks}} at the book to find out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them to Clorinda. When Ashley arrived to the stable, she finds an injured Clorinda who was faking it as bait, when Lady Tramaine points the shotgun at her. Clorinda then threatens to shoot Ashley but stops and she learns that Jacob is alive and that they are in his farm. As they are reunited, Lady Tramaine threatens to shoot them but Ashley protects them but is stabbed with Lady Tramaine's {{poisoned}} cane. Emma, Henry and Hook arrived and stopped Lady Tramaine from doing any more damage. With encouragement from Henry, Emma uses her magic to heal Ashley. Later on, Emma asked Hook to move in with her, and he agrees. As part of her punishment for stabbing Ashley, Tramaine is jailed and forced to do clean up detail under Leroy's supervision.|$|E
25|$|Once selected, {{the cast}} were {{gathered}} together and told by Hiroi and Tanaka of their goals, along with being handed {{pictures of their}} respective characters. The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato, who followed Hiroi's request that the characters be portrayed as real people. Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and being told {{it was just one}} third of the entire script. Sato's instruction to the cast was that they would be the characters' main emotive force as their faces would not move much. Sakura was the last character to be recorded, so Sato could concentrate on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire. The sheer amount of voice acting was the main reason the game was delayed.|$|E
25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E
60|$|The baronet paused, and he {{appeared}} to ruminate. Enough had already passed to satisfy him he had not an ordinary mind in that of his companion to deal with, and he was slightly at a loss <b>how</b> <b>to</b> answer. <b>To</b> <b>bring</b> the other within his lures, he was fully resolved; and the spirits that aid the designing just at that moment suggested the plan which, of all others, was {{most likely to be}} successful. Bluewater had betrayed his aversion to the interference of foreign troops in the quarrel, and on this subject he intended to strike a chord which he rightly fancied would thrill on the rear-admiral's feelings.|$|R

25|$|In the beginning, a {{difference}} between hardware and software did not exist. The user and programmer of a computer were one and the same. When the first commercial electronic computer was introduced by IBM in 1952, the machine was hard to maintain and expensive. Putting {{the price of the}} machine aside, it was the software that caused the problem when owning one of these computers. Then in 1952, a collaboration of all the owners of the computer got together and created a set of tools. The collaboration of people were in a group called PACT (The Project for the Advancement of Coding techniques). After passing this hurdle, in 1956, the Eisenhower administration decided to put restrictions on the types of sales AT could make. This did not stop the inventors from developing new ideas of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the computer to the mass population. The next step was making the computer more affordable which slowly developed through different companies. Then they had to develop software that would host multiple users. MIT computation center developed one of the first systems, CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System). This laid the foundation for many more systems, and what we now call the Open Source Movement.|$|E
25|$|When the {{guardianship}} of Sigismund {{ended on}} 25 July 1443 and Friedrich, now King Friedrich III of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to prolong it for another six years, the Landstände of Tyrol organized an open revolt. Oswald {{became one of}} five military commanders and was tasked with the defence {{of the most important}} of all positions, the Mühlbacher Klause (Mühlbach fortress), which blocked the most likely invasion route from Styria, where King Friedrich had taken up residence. The cities of Merano and Bolzano provided funds and troops to reinforce the fortress, and all other passes and entrances into Tyrol were blocked by troops. As the city of Trento backed the King, an army of 3,000 men was sent south to besiege the city. On 10 December, a Tyrolean delegation arrived in Graz to demand the release of Sigismund and the return of the county's treasures, taken by Friedrich in 1440. Friedrich refused and threatened war. The Tyroleans responded by sacking Trento and electing Johann Röttel as the new bishop on 4 January 1440. Röttel's first declaration was to fully support the Landstände against the King. Oswald was one of the electors and the main instigator of this election. The next session by the Landstände began in Merano on 16 May 1445, and as it was now clear that King Friedrich was not planning an attack, options were discussed on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Sigismund to Tyrol.|$|E

500|$|The {{return of}} the William Bell {{character}} to the series was inspired by Leonard Nimoy from earlier seasons. In his first appearance on Fringe in the first season finale, [...] "There's More Than One of Everything", Nimoy requested that a bell be placed on his desk so that his character {{would be able to}} ring it as a play on the character's name. [...] When the writers considered <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Bell back for the third season, they recalled this mannerism, and wrote it into the larger mythos, being the means by which Bell's mind emerged from Olivia's {{at the end of this}} episode.|$|E
