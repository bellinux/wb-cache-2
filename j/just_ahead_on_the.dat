60|$|To {{add to his}} difficulty, a small bright moon shone {{brilliant}}ly <b>just</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, {{a painful}} brilliant thing that was always there, unremitting, from {{which there was no}} escape. He wanted so to come to the end--he had had enough. Yet he did not sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] yelled Phil, suddenly. But {{the warning}} was not necessary, for Dunston Porter saw the danger {{and so did}} the others. A horse and buggy were <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> torn-up highway, going in the same {{direction}} as themselves. The horse was prancing and rearing and the driver was sawing at the lines in an effort to quiet the steed. It looked as if there might be a collision.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2006 Kentucky Derby on May 6, Bluegrass Cat was a 30-1 longshot in a {{field of}} 20. For the first [...] of a mile, he raced in fifth or sixth a few lengths behind the leaders, with Barbaro <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside. On the far turn, Barbaro made his move, {{eventually}} winning by [...] lengths. Bluegrass Cat could not match Barbaro's acceleration but was good enough to finish second by two lengths over Steppenwolfer, with Jazil and Brother Derek in a dead heat for fourth another length back. Bluegrass Cat's connections skipped the Preakness Stakes, won by Bernardini after Barbaro's tragic breakdown, and rested him for the Belmont Stakes. When Bernardini skipped the Belmont Stakes, Bluegrass Cat became the second choice in a wide-open field of twelve. He raced just behind the early pace and made his move on the far turn, but was out-kicked by Jazil and finished second.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was hopping along mighty fast when whom should I see <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of me <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path but Mr. Fox, {{standing}} with his head cocked over on one side as he always holds it when he's up to some mischief. I was in a terrible hurry, but it seemed safer to stop a bit till I'd found out {{what he was up}} to, and lucky it was that I did.|$|R
60|$|Those {{who sought}} us must have sent a party {{up the river}} {{immediately}} after we escaped; for when we came at last onto the river-trail not far from our destination, {{there can be no}} doubt but that we were seen by Hoojans who were <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of us <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stream. The result was that as we were passing through a clump of bush a score of warriors leaped out upon us, and before we could scarce strike a blow in defense, had disarmed and bound us.|$|R
50|$|From 1980-1983, {{the club}} painfully {{finished}} runner-up on four successive occasions. In 1980 they finished second to Preston Makedonia, managed by former Essendon Croatia boss Brian Edgley, {{who had been}} replaced by Duje Zemunik midway through the previous season. Despite having a fantastic season where Essendon Croatia only lost 2 matches (both losses being to the eventual champions Preston). It was a close battle between the two sides for {{a large part of the}} season. After round 14 both Essendon Croatia and Preston Makedonia found themselves on equal points with Preston <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> goal difference, <b>the</b> following round saw the two sides face off. Preston won the crucial match 1-0 as they pulled away from Essendon Croatia, holding onto top spot for the rest of the season.|$|R
5000|$|Willowleaf blade: A long, narrow blade {{shaped like}} the foliage it is named after, the Willowleaf has an almost flat cross-section, and {{stresses}} flash over vibration, having very little vibration at all. It {{has the most}} flash out of all blade types, therefore, making it perfect for imitating baitfish. It is most successful {{during the summer and}} fall seasons when there is ample visibility and bass are actively feeding. The flash from the blade and clear waters allow prey to easily see it and be enticed. A popular safety-pin blade setup is to have a Willowleaf blade with a Colorado blade mounted <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frame in a 'tandem' configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Heading {{directly}} {{south on}} a heading for Kings Bay, after 24 hours of increasing head winds and thick mist the Italia was only halfway back to base. The airship struggled to gain ground and {{break through to}} the zone of calmer winds which expedition meteorologist Finn Malmgren predicted was <b>just</b> <b>ahead.</b> Ice formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> propellers and shot off into the envelope, necessitating running repairs. Engine speed was increased but with little effect, except for a doubling of fuel consumption. Dr Běhounek, {{in charge of the}} compass, started reporting variations in course of up to 30 degrees, and the elevator man Cecioni had similar problems maintaining control. By 07:30 on 25 May, Nobile, who had been awake for over 48 hours, knew that the situation was critical and Giuseppe Biagi, the wireless operator, sent out the message: [...] "If I don't answer, I have good reason". By dead reckoning, Nobile estimated his position as 250 mi northeast from Moffen Island. This estimate was 350 mi off.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Magne again {{started in}} the Tour de France, in a strong French team. Magne led from the second day and his team won 19 of the 23 stages, Magne himself winning two stages, {{including}} the first time trial in the Tour de France, over 80 km from La Roche-sur-Yon to Nantes. His hopes looked over when he broke a wheel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> descent from l'Hospitalet to Ax-les-Thermes in the Pyrenees. He was rescued by the youngest rider in his team, René Vietto, who handed him his own wheel despite being in third place himself.The next day Magne again had trouble. Vietto was <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Col de Portet d'Aspet, turned and saw his leader waving a wheel and rode back {{down the hill to}} hand him his own. Vietto wept by the roadside as he waited for another wheel. Magne won the Tour and France dominated it but Vietto, who finished fifth, was the hero. He also won the Grand Prix des Nations, the unofficial world championship of the individual time trial, {{for the first time that}} year.|$|R
50|$|Stewart and Amon {{qualified}} {{their cars}} in {{first and second}} place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grid, respectively. Andretti had damaged the rear of his car during a private test session {{the day before the}} first official session and the process of repairing it and sourcing a spare engine meant that he missed the first two timed practices. He started from 11th. <b>Just</b> <b>ahead</b> of him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grid was Siffert in ninth position, while Servoz-Gavin was two rows behind the American, starting from 17th position. In the early portion of the race Stewart's car lead for many laps, but this was largely owing to his opposition being impeded and put out of position due to a first corner spin by Jochen Rindt. Once Jack Brabham's Brabham and Denny Hulme in a McLaren had cleared the confusion they began to whittle down Stewart's lead. Brabham passed Stewart <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 20th lap of the race, as did Hulme on lap 38, and the reigning World Champion eventually finished in third place. Amon and Andretti both suffered from severe overheating following failures of their cars' cooling system header tanks, and they retired after two and 11 laps, respectively. Siffert was running in the top ten in the early portion of the race, but while dicing with Jacky Ickx and Jean-Pierre Beltoise for fifth position he spun and crushed his car's right exhaust pipe. The time he lost in the pits having the damage repaired pushed him well down the field and he eventually finished five laps down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leaders, in tenth place. Servoz-Gavin's engine failed on lap 57, also following the loss of his coolant fluid, and he retired.|$|R
50|$|At the 1985 Westfield Ultra Marathon, a 960 km {{race from}} Sydney to Melbourne, Eleanor Robinson lined up against Donna Hudson and Margaret Smith of Melbourne. Robinson and Hudson were favourites {{but after the}} first day, Smith led the race. Robinson got <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day to win the race, <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> of Hudson and Smith.|$|R

He was good-natured enough to wait until I could find my bag, and as soon a'terwards as the men could get their grog we shoved off. The Molly was just getting in behind Blackwell's as we left the wharf, and, having four good oars, and the shortest road, we come out into <b>the</b> Gate <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> you.

25|$|On lap 14, Morbidelli crashed, and Brundle crashed off {{shortly after}} {{at the same}} point whilst the marshalls were still dealing with Morbidelli's car. Although no-one was hit by the car, one marshall was hit by debris and {{suffered}} a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was <b>just</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> track but 6 seconds <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last {{to the end of the}} race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but got caught in traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking wheel nut. This, coupled with Hill's heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.|$|R

50|$|To {{the people}} in the Hunsrück, the war’s imminence was {{something}} that was unknown. Only in mid July 1914 did it become apparent that a military conflict of some kind lay <b>just</b> <b>ahead.</b> <b>On</b> 6 August, Kaiser Wilhelm II issued a decree. A few days later, soldiers from Mittelstrimmig were leaving their homeland. With Germany’s defeat, {{the people in}} Mittelstrimmig saw the world that they had known fall apart. Not only was the monarchy gone, but the toll in blood had been quite high. Nine men from Mittelstrimmig had fallen “for Empire and Emperor”. When soldiers withdrew from the villages, they left behind weapons and ammunition. Civilians took these and used them for hunting. With the German soldiers gone, <b>the</b> villages <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Strimmiger Berg were occupied by the Americans, who were billeted in barns, stables, barrooms at inns and schools. Once Germany had been divided into occupation zones by the victorious powers, the Americans withdrew and the Rhineland, and along with it the Strimmiger Berg, once again fell under French rule.|$|R
