40|$|We {{focus on}} two {{commonly}} observed insurance policy provisions: upper limits on coverage and <b>deductibles.</b> We suggest that upper limits on coverage {{result from the}} effective limited liability obtained through the bankruptcy statutes. We show that absent moral hazard, if the administrative cost structure has fixed costs and scale economies, <b>deductibles</b> are not optimal. But the optimal contractual form leads to a moral hazard problem, which <b>deductibles</b> control. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{bonus-malus}} systems with different claim types and varying <b>deductibles.</b> The premium relativities are softened for the policyholders {{who are in}} the malus zone and these policyholders are subject to per claim <b>deductibles</b> depending on their levels in the bonus-malus scale and the types of the reported claims. We introduce such bonus-malus systems and study their basic properties. In particular, we investigate when it is possible to introduce varying <b>deductibles,</b> what restrictions we have and how we can do this. Moreover, we deal with the special case where varying <b>deductibles</b> are applied to the claims reported by policyholders occupying the highest level in the bonus-malus scale and consider two allocation principles for the <b>deductibles.</b> Finally, numerical illustrations are presented.

40|$|One unique {{feature of}} the German health {{insurance}} system is the possibility for certain socioeconomic groups to opt-out of the otherwise compulsory system. To determine whether rates incorporating <b>deductibles</b> can heighten the appeal of statutory health insurance funds (SHI funds) compared with private health insurance companies, Germany?s third largest SHI fund Techniker Krankenkasse implemented a pilot scheme involving the use of <b>deductibles.</b> Preliminary scientific evaluations of the pilot scheme indicate that these <b>deductibles</b> are compatible {{with the principles of}} solidarity in the statutory health insurance system and provide an effective means of preventing defection to private health insurance companies...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the size of <b>deductibles</b> in the basic health insurance in Switzerland on the probability of a doctor visit. We employ nonparametric bounding techniques to minimise statistical assumptions. In order to tighten the bounds we consider three further assumptions: mean independence of an instrument, monotone treatment response, and monotone treatment selection. Under the first two assumptions we are able to bound the treatment effect of high <b>deductibles</b> compared to low <b>deductibles</b> below zero. Adding the third assumption allows to tighten the bounds further. We conclude that there is a negative treatment effect...|$|R

Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax <b>deductible,</b> and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political lobbying. The two organizations share office space and employees.|$|E
5|$|The plan allows low to {{moderate}} income households where the members have {{no access to}} employer provided healthcare to apply for coverage. The fee for coverage is calculated using a formula that results in a charge between 2%–5% of a person's income. A $1,100 annual <b>deductible</b> is standard on all policies and allows applicants to qualify for a health savings account. The plan pays a maximum of $300,000 in annual benefits.|$|E
5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax <b>deductible</b> status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deductibles</b> {{in health}} {{insurance}} are often {{regarded as a}} means to contain health care costs when individuals exhibit moral hazard. However, in the absence of moral hazard, voluntarily chosen <b>deductibles</b> may instead lead to self-selection into different insurance contracts.

A latent class approach that takes into account the panel structure of the data reveals that the effect of <b>deductibles</b> on the number of doctor visits is negligible. Private add-on insurance increases the number of doctor visits. However, altogether the effects of the insurance state on the demand for doctor visits are small in magnitude.

However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{hospice care}} may {{be met by}} health {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or <b>deductible</b> by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home hospice care is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient hospice care. A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Deductibles</b> {{in health}} {{insurance}} are often {{regarded as a}} means to contain health care costs when the behaviour of individuals exhibits moral hazard. However, in the absence of moral hazard, voluntarily chosen <b>deductibles</b> rather lead to adverse selection. I use a set of new variables in the German Socioeconomic Panel for the years 2002, 2004 and 2006 that measure individual health more accurately and include risk-attitudes towards health in order to detect the price-elasticity of demand for health care. A latent class approach that takes into account the panel structure reveals that the effect of <b>deductibles</b> on the number of doctor visits is negligible.

40|$|In the literature, orderings of optimal {{allocations}} {{of policy}} limits and <b>deductibles</b> were established {{with respect to}} a policyholder's preference. However, from the viewpoint of an insurer, the orderings are not enough for the purpose of pricing. In this paper, by applying the equivalent utility premium principle, we study worst allocations of policy limits and <b>deductibles</b> for an insurer, which give rise to the maximum fair premiums. Closed-form solutions are derived. Then we present a result concerning the optimality in a general risk-sharing scheme, by which we obtain optimal allocations for policyholders directly from worst allocations for an insurer.
