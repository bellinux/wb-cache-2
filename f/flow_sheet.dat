The Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (CBHSSJB) diabetes registry was the initial phase {{in the development of}} a comprehensive program for diabetes in this region. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: The CBHSSJB diabetes registry was developed to provide a framework to track the prevalence of diabetes and the progression of diabetic complications. The database will also identify patients not receiving appropriate clinical and laboratory screening for diabetic complications, and will provide standardized clinical <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> for routine patient management. MAIN COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM: The CBHSSJB diabetes registry uses a system of paper registration forms and clinical <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> kept in the nine community clinics. Information from these sheets is entered into a computer database annually. The <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> serve as a guideline for appropriate management of patients with diabetes, and provide a one-page summary of relevant clinical and laboratory information.

40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of bed level motions and <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> {{processes in the}} lower swash are presented. The measurements are obtained during a large-scale wave flume experiment focusing on swash zone sediment transport induced by bichromatic waves. A new instrument (CCM+) provides detailed phase-averaged {{measurements of}} <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> concentrations, particle velocities, and bed level evolution during a complete swash cycle. The bed at the lower swash location shows a clear pattern of rapid erosion during the early uprush and progressive accretion during the middle backwash phase. <b>Sheet</b> <b>flow</b> occurs during the early uprush and mid and late backwash phases. <b>Sheet</b> <b>flow</b> sediment fluxes during these instances are highest in the pick-up layer. Sediment entrainment from the pick-up layer occurs not only during instances of high horizontal shear velocities but also in occurrence of wave–backwash interactions. As opposed to oscillatory <b>sheet</b> <b>flow,</b> the pivot point elevation of the <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> layer is time-varying during a swash event. Moreover, the upper <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> layer concentrations do not mirror the concentrations in the pick-up layer. Both differences suggest that in the lower swash zone {{the dynamics of the}} upper <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> layer are not only controlled by vertical sediment exchange (such as in oscillatory <b>sheet</b> <b>flows)</b> but are strongly affected by horizontal advection processes induced by the non-uniformity of the flow...|$|R

5000|$|The {{formation}} of the caldera coincided with the eruption of the Atana ignimbrite; the eruption was still underway when the terrain subsided {{to a depth of}} 2 - 3 km beneath the previous surface in the northwestern segment of La Pacana. Dates obtained on the Atana ignimbrite are between 3.8 ± 0.1 and 4.2 ± 0.1 million years ago, which is not clearly distinguishable from the dates of the Toconao ignimbrite seeing as {{there is no indication that}} a pause occurred between the eruption of the two ignimbrites. This ignimbrite is considerably larger than the Toconao ignimbrite, reaching a volume of [...] and a volcanic explosivity index of 8. This makes the Atana eruption the fifth-largest explosive eruption known and La Pacana a supervolcano. The Atana ignimbrite forms a <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> that extends from within the caldera to the outside in the form of a 30 - 40 m thick structure. This <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> originally probably covered a surface area of about 7700 km2, part of which was later eroded away. The Atana ignimbrite is fairly welded, rich in crystals and poor in lithics. It is underlaid by pumice and ash deposits. Pumice is also found as fragment within the ignimbrite, ranging from white rhyolite to gray andesite. After its eruption, wind and water driven erosion occurred on the Atana ignimbrite, carving valleys and yardangs into it.|$|E

This paper focuses on <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> during quasi-steady backwash events generated by infragravity motion when the effects of phase lags, surface-generated turbulence, and accelerations are small. The <b>sheet</b> <b>flow</b> sediment concentration profile has a linear shape in the lower section of the profile and a power-law shape in the upper section, with the transition occurring at sediment volume fractions of 0. 20 - 0. 30.

Durham explained:One of the most useful methods of describing the various steps in an operation is by means of “flow sheets.” These took their name from ore-concentrating processes, where they have been long used to describe the flow of ore, or of water through the mills. They closely resemble the old-fashioned family trees, where the relation of the different members to each other were shown, and <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> might well be called [...] "process trees."The principle of <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> is of wide application; in business, it can be used to show the organization of the staff and to whom each is responsible; in manufacturing, the passage of the material through the works, from department to department, and even the steps in each department, can be shown; in milling or metallurgical operations, the passage of the material from process to process and the resulting products and their disposal can be shown; in power distribution, the heat generated by coal under the boilers can be followed in its change to mechanical power and its application to various machines.Flow sheets are useful to give a picture of a technical operation, or process to a non-technical person, and, for such purposes, may be very simple, and details and minor parts of the operation may be omitted.

The plutonium handling facilities were cleared for operation in 1980. The reprocessing of irradiated thorium rods which {{was carried out}} during the period 1989 to 1992 in the concrete shielded cells, {{was the first major}} radioactive operation. The U-233 recovered during the operation was used in fabricating the fuel for the KAlpakkam MINI reactor (KAMINI). U-233 was also useful for the fuel development programme for carrying out the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor test fuel irradiation experiments in Fast Breeder Test Reactor. Apart from this, the operation aided in validating the equipment and design of system as well as the manpower training. Later a hot cell facility for reprocessing of Fast Breeder Test Reactor fuel was conceived which had the necessary features for delivering the product with all the uncertainties in the dissolution of irradiated fuel and process flowsheet. Added to this was the need for the deployment of the yet to be proven designs of centrifuge and centrifugal extractors without which the success of the PUREX process for fast reactor fuel reprocessing would be doubtful. With these minimal inputs, the hot cell facility, Lead Mini Cell (LMC) was created, which was later rechristened as CORAL (COmpact Reprocessing facility for Advanced fuels in Lead cells).
