25|$|The {{efforts of}} the male members of the Tagore family {{in the field of}} music, theatre and writing must have {{penetrated}} into the inner precincts of the Jorasanko Thakur Bari and touched a chord in Swarnakumari. When Jyotirindranath Tagore was involved with his experiments in music, plays and writing, he was assisted by Akshay Chandra Chaudhuri and Rabindranath. In his Jyotirindrasmriti (Reminiscence) he wrote, “With Janaki going to England and arrival of my younger sister Swarnakumari <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> we got another partner in our literary ventures.” While Gyanadanandini Devi took the lead for breaking down age-old restrictions on women in the house, Swarnakumari flourished in creativity.|$|E

He recalled he was [...] "lying on the sofa <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> listening to Yoko play... Suddenly, I said, 'Can you play those chords backward?' She did, and I wrote 'Because' around them." [...] The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix. The group considered the vocals to {{be some of the}} hardest and most complex they attempted. Harrison played the Moog synthesizer, and Martin played the harpsichord that opens the track.|$|E

In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, [...] "The life and happiness <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> {{came to an end}} the day I and Rajesh got married," [...] sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage [...] "a farce". Asked in Filmfare whether she would want to marry again, Kapadia replied, [...] "I'm very happy and content. Why do I need to get married again? Once was more than enough." [...] In 2010, reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that [...] "the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar. In a later interview she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her [...] "biggest high".|$|E

We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> We don't do that kind of thing." [...] Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: [...] "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election [...] especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adelson {{says that}} because of his {{upbringing}} in an immigrant family in an underprivileged neighborhood of Boston, [...] "it went without saying that we were Democrats". He attributed his family's loyalty to their belief that the Democratic Party of the 1930s and 1940s shared their commitment to charity, self-reliance, and accountability, as well as support for Jewish causes. In a 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled [...] "I Didn't Leave the Democrats. They Left me", Adelson specifies three reasons why he switched political parties to the Republicans. First, he cites foreign policy, pointing to a Gallup poll that suggests Republicans are more supportive of Israel than Democrats. Second, he cites statistics that suggest Republicans are more charitable than Democrats. To support this claim Adelson cites {{a report from the}} Chronicle of Philanthropy, which claims, after studying tax data from the IRS, that U.S. states that vote Republican are more generous to charities than those states that vote Democratic. [...] "My father, who kept a charity box for the poor <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> ... would have frowned on this fact about modern Democrats." [...] Third, he cites a nonpartisan study of Illinois's finances by the State Budget Crisis Task Force and political scientist Walter Russell Mead claiming that Democratic Party economic policies don't deliver on their promises of social justice and have wrecked one of the country's potentially most prosperous and dynamic states (Illinois).|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change your point of view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1862, senior {{political}} {{figures in the}} Tokugawa shogunate created the post of Kyoto Shugoshoku (Kyoto Military Commissioner), {{for the purpose of}} recovering public order in the city, which was under the influence of Sonnō Jōi militants. The post of Kyoto Shugoshoku was one that changed much of the dynamic that had theretofore existed in the city. Previously, the holder of the Kyoto shoshidai (...) position had held the highest power there, supervising affairs in the Kyoto-Osaka area as the representative of the Shogun. However, the successive Shoshidai, as well as the city magistrates under their charge, were increasingly unable to secure and maintain the public order, so the post of Shugoshoku was superimposed on the existing structure. Where the Shoshidai and magistrates had been unable to secure through civil law, the Shugoshoku was to achieve through the use of military force. After much deliberation, the choice for the Shugoshoku post came down to two domains: Echizen and Aizu. Of the two, Echizen's Matsudaira Yoshinaga already held high Shogunal office as President of Political Affairs ( [...] ; seiji sōsai-shoku), so all attention was then turned to Matsudaira Katamori. As Katamori was ill, Aizu's senior Edo-based councilor Yokoyama Tsunenori was summoned to Edo Castle instead, and given word of the assignment. Katamori sent a retainer back with a request for being excused: [...] "As this is a shogunal order, we not only {{have no choice but to}} accept. Furthermore, our domain's founder Lord [...] Masayuki laid down a direct command to do so <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> code. However, our lord Katamori is still young, and our men are in the north and unfamiliar with conditions in the Capital. If we were to accept this assignment without question, and a one in ten thousand chance of disaster were to strike, we of the Aizu domain could not possibly do it all alone; the Shogun would have to get involved, as would all of Japan. We would like to consider this carefully." [...] However, the Bakufu would not listen to this refusal. Matsudaira Yoshinaga traveled personally to the Aizu residence, and confronted Katamori with harsh words invoking Aizu's distinguished past as Shogunate functionaries: [...] "If [...] Lord Masayuki were still alive, he would accept without a second thought!" [...] Rumors began to circulate that Katamori refused the assignment out of a desire for self-preservation, to which Katamori is said to have responded, [...] "If people start talking like this, it will shame our domain. There is no way I could explain this to the generations of Aizu lords who have gone before me. I have no choice but to accept." ...|$|E
