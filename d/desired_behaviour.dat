The clicker is used as a 'bridge' between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy.

Once a behaviour is learnt and is on cue (command), the clicker and the treats are faded out.|$|E
500|$|Instruction {{provided}} to students {{was rooted in}} an institutional and European approach to education. It differed dramatically from child rearing in traditional knowledge systems that are generally based on 'look, listen, and learn' models. Unlike the corporal punishment and loss of privileges that characterized the residential school system, traditional approaches to education favour positive guidance toward <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{through the use of}} game-based play, story-telling, and formal ritualized ceremonies. While at school, many children had no contact with their families for up to 10 months at a time because of the distance between their home communities and schools, and in some cases had no contact for years. The impact of the disconnect from their families was furthered by students being discouraged or prohibited from speaking Indigenous languages, even among themselves and outside the classroom, so that English or French would be learned and their own languages forgotten. In some schools, they were subject to physical violence for speaking their own languages or for practicing non-Christian faiths.|$|E
2500|$|One very {{important}} subset of synapses {{are capable of}} forming memory traces by means of long-lasting activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength. [...] The best-known form of neural memory is a process called long-term potentiation (abbreviated LTP), which operates at synapses that use the neurotransmitter glutamate acting on a special type of receptor known as the NMDA receptor. [...] The NMDA receptor has an [...] "associative" [...] property: [...] if the two cells involved in the synapse are both activated at approximately the same time, a channel opens that permits calcium to flow into the target cell. [...] The calcium entry initiates a second messenger cascade that ultimately leads {{to an increase in}} the number of glutamate receptors in the target cell, thereby increasing the effective strength of the synapse. [...] This change in strength can last for weeks or longer. Since the discovery of LTP in 1973, many other types of synaptic memory traces have been found, involving increases or decreases in synaptic strength that are induced by varying conditions, and last for variable periods of time. [...] The reward system, that reinforces <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour</b> for example, depends on a variant form of LTP that is conditioned on an extra input coming from a reward-signalling pathway that uses dopamine as neurotransmitter. [...] All these forms of synaptic modifiability, taken collectively, give rise to neural plasticity, that is, to a capability for the nervous system to adapt itself to variations in the environment.|$|E

50|$|Token economies is a {{behaviour}} therapy technique where clients are reinforced with tokens {{that are considered}} a type of currency {{that can be used}} to purchase desired rewards, like being able to watch television or getting a snack that they want when they perform designated behaviours. Token economies are mainly used in institutional and therapeutic settings. In order for a token economy to be effective their must be consistency in administering the program by the entire staff. Procedures must be clearly defined so that there is no confusion among the clients. Instead of looking for ways to punish the patients or to deny them of rewards, the staff has to reinforce the positive behaviours so that the clients will increase the occurrence of the <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Over time the tokens need to be replaced with less tangible rewards such as compliments so that the client will be prepared when they leave the institution and won't expect to get something every time they perform a <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{situation}} of a decision-maker who aims to encourage the players of an evolutionary game theoretic system to follow certain <b>desired</b> <b>behaviours.</b> To do so, she can interfere in the system to reward her preferred behaviour patterns. However, this action requires certain cost (e. g., resource consumption). Given this, her main goal is to maintain an efficient trade-off between achieving the desired system status and minimising the total cost spent. Our initial numerical results reveal interesting observations, which in fact imply that further investigations in the future are required. ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{technique}} of behaviour therapy involves holding a client or patient accountable of their behaviours {{in an effort}} to change them. This is called a contingency contract, which is a formal written contract between two or more people that defines the specific expected behaviours that you wish to change and the rewards and punishments that go along with that behaviour. In order for a contingency contract to be official it needs to have five elements. First it must state what each person will get if they successfully complete the <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Secondly those people involved have to monitor the behaviours. Third, if the <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour</b> is not being performed in the way that was agreed upon in the contract the punishments that were defined in the contract must be done. Fourth if the persons involved are complying with the contract they must receive bonuses. The last element involves documenting the compliance and noncompliance while using this treatment in order to give the persons involved consistent feedback about the target behaviour and the provision of reinforcers.|$|E

40|$|Many new and {{exciting}} space mission concepts have developed around spacecraft formation flying, allowing for autonomous distributed systems that can be robust, scalable and flexible. This paper considers {{the development of a}} new methodology for the control of multiple spacecraft. Based on the artificial potential function method, research in this area is extended by considering the new approach of using bifurcation theory as a means of controlling the transition between different formations. For real, safety or mission critical applications it is important to ensure that <b>desired</b> <b>behaviours</b> will occur. Through dynamical systems theory, this paper also aims to provide a step in replacing traditional algorithm validation with mathematical proof, supported through simulation. This is achieved by determining the non-linear stability properties of the system, thus proving the existence or not of <b>desired</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Practical considerations such as the issue of actuator saturation and communication limitations are addressed, with {{the development of a new}} bounded control law based on bifurcating potential fields providing the key contribution of this paper. To illustrate spacecraft formation flying using the new methodology formation patterns are considered in low-Earth-orbit utilising the Clohessy-Wiltshire relative linearised equations of motion. It is shown that a formation of spacecraft can be driven safely onto equally spaced projected circular orbits, autonomously reconfiguring between them, whilst satisfying constraints made regarding each spacecraft...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{research}} in the area of applied behaviour analysis has led to a rich knowledge and understanding of the variables that influence human behaviour.

50|$|Based on the {{principles}} of social learning, model-rival training uses a model, or a rival for attention, to demonstrate the <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The method was used by Irene Pepperberg to train Alex the African Grey Parrot to label a large number of objects. McKinley and Young undertook a pilot study on the applicability of {{a modified version of the}} model-rival method to the training of domestic dogs, noting that the dog's origins as a member of large and complex social groups promote observational learning. The model-rival training involved an interaction between the trainer, the dog, and a person acting as a model-rival, that is, a model for <b>desired</b> <b>behaviour</b> and a rival for the trainer's attention. In view of the dog, a dialogue concerning a particular toy commenced between the trainer and the model-rival. The trainer praised or scolded the model-rival depending on whether the model-rival had named the toy correctly. It was found that the performance times for completion of the task were similar for dogs trained with either operant conditioning or the model rival method. In addition, the total training time required for task completion was comparable for both methods.A Hungarian dog training group called Népszigeti Kutyaiskola use a variation of model-rival training which they describe as the Mirror Method. The mirror method philosophy is that dogs instinctively learn by following the example of others in their social sphere. Core to the program is including the dog in all aspects of the owner's life and positive reinforcement of copying behaviors. Mirror method dog training relies on using a dog's natural instincts and inclinations rather than working against them.|$|E
