It represents a theoretical example that demonstrates a strategy based on <b>exploiting</b> <b>of</b> found <b>market</b> inefficiency. It is fundamental. Thus, what markets without this inefficiency should be is an open question. It is connected to fluctuating interest rates. In original paper it was shown {{that in some cases}} they allow creation arbitrage strategies. However, it is possible to create such cases artificially. ...|$|R

Thus, more than ever, {{in order to remain}} competitive, companies are forced to <b>exploit</b> this form <b>of</b> <b>marketing,</b> which essentially can bring huge benefits at low costs. The main form <b>of</b> digital <b>marketing</b> is the inbound marketing, which represents an organic marketing form, based on the close relationship between the company and its prospects or customers, who have expressed their interest in the company’s products voluntarily (based on subscription to newsletters, blog, social networks, etc.) and who have been attracted and involved by a high quality <b>of</b> the content <b>marketing...</b>|$|R

There are, however, important physical characteristics in electricity markets, such as the constraints imposed by the physical transmission infrastructure, that {{have the potential to}} undermine competition and provide opportunities for market participants to <b>exploit</b> temporary positions <b>of</b> <b>market</b> power. In this paper, the regional <b>market</b> <b>of</b> Queensland, Australia is analysed. It is found that strategic behaviour by generators exists and is closely related to the occurrence of the kind of extreme price events that characterise many deregulated electricity markets. In addition, rebidding behaviour by baseload generators immediately after extreme price events is shown to have negative impacts on the operation <b>of</b> the <b>market.</b> The key message is that promotion of competition in electricity markets can have undesirable consequences unless the regulatory policy is carefully designed to counter strategic behaviour by market participants...|$|R

40|$|A large {{theoretical}} literature {{focuses on}} the question: What determines firms' boundaries? Recently, Garicano and Santos and Holmstrom and Milgrom have proposed theories in which firms' boundaries reflect {{the division of labor}} across individuals. This paper discusses strategies for generating and testing empirical propositions from this emerging class of theories. We propose that variation in the returns to specialization is extremely useful to test and quantify the effect of the division of labor on firms' boundaries. We discuss the use of two shifters to the returns to specialization, and relate how we <b>exploit</b> one <b>of</b> these, <b>market</b> size, in preliminary work on the determinants of law firms' boundaries in the United State...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} {{interactions}} of product and labor market institutions in a model characterized by a three-states representation <b>of</b> the labor <b>market.</b> Firms bargain with unions over wages and employment levels. This generates unemployment. Households take the associated unemployment risk as given in making their participation decisions. Unemployment inserts a wedge between labor supply (participation) and employment. Employment matters because it determines output. I uncover two feedback mechanisms, each reinforced by endogenous participation. The firt <b>exploits</b> the endogeneity <b>of</b> the number of firms to amplify the adverse effects on output of regulations and frictions that raise labor costs, work practice rigidities and the bargaining power of workers. The second <b>exploits</b> the endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>market</b> size to amplify the adverse effects <b>of</b> product <b>market</b> frictions that raise the costs of entry or of operation for firms. The multiplier effects due to these feedback mechanisms have interesting implications for the current policy debate. Labor market reforms that {{reduce the cost of}} labor are actually more attractive when one considers the endogenous structure <b>of</b> the product <b>market.</b> Similarly, pro-competitive product market reforms are more attractive when one considers the positive feedback on market structure that runs through the labor market...|$|R

We {{show that there}} exist wide divergences in many commonly used estimates of GDP growth and discuss the sources of those differences. We show that the choice of base year and linking techniques are crucial for the diagnosis of economic growth, and argue that the aggregate GDP and TFP growth numbers are distorted by cuts in oil production that came about {{as a result of}} the country adopting the OPEC strategy <b>of</b> <b>exploiting</b> <b>market</b> power during the 1970 s.

40|$|Governments and {{international}} organizations are promoting or drafting programs to undertake Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) of {{hundreds of millions of}} hectares of degraded tropical landscapes to support the provision of ecosystem goods and services. But the challenge to recover economic and ecological functionality could be far beyond their financial capacity. Here, we explore the potential <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> and their interaction with policies to leverage investment for FLR in the tropics. We first review the challenges and opportunities <b>of</b> <b>exploiting</b> <b>market</b> forces for FLR, which can be essential for kick-starting the implementation of programs globally. We identify four key opportunities for regulating markets to promote FLR: economic mechanisms; technological, educational or infrastructural investment; legal and enforcement mechanisms; and market-led standards and certification schemes. Finally, we present five pitfalls that may arise when relying on markets to promote FLR. Governments will need to {{play a critical role in}} establishing appropriate policy frameworks and institutional arrangements to leverage investments when market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in traditional land use or farming practices, or to regulate reforestation activities when market signals become so strong that they overwhelm all other land-use activities, leading to a transformed and homogenized landscape...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how private {{information}} is incorporated into prices, using a unique setting from the 18 th century that, in many dimensions, is simpler {{and closer to}} stylized models of price discovery than modern-day markets. Speci 8 ̆ 5 cally, the paper looks {{at a number of}} English securities that were traded in both London and Amsterdam. Relevant information about these securities originated in London and was sent to Amsterdam on board of o ¢ cial mail packet boats. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these ships carried both public news and {{private information}}. They sailed only twice a week, and in adverse weather could not sail at all. The paper <b>exploits</b> periods <b>of</b> exogenous <b>market</b> segmentation to identify the impact of private information. The evidence is consistent with a Kyle (1985) model in which informed agents trade strategically. Most importantly, the speed of information revelation in Amsterdam depended on how long insiders expected it would take for the private signal to become public. As a result of this strategic behavior, private information was only slowly revealed to the market as a whole. This price discovery was economically important: private signals had almost as much impact on prices as public information shocks...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{transaction}} cost economics in developing research in {{strategy has been}} a hotly debated topic over the last decade. This paper presents the radical argument that {{transaction cost}} insights are more than merely useful complements to existing approaches to strategy. Rather, they are necessary for adequately understanding the nature of strategizing. This is because transaction costs are essential aspects of processes of creating, capturing and protecting value. If transaction costs are zero, these processes do not pose any strategic problems; strategizing is trivialized in such a world. When transaction costs are positive, on the other hand, opportunities for value creation through the reduction of inefficiencies caused by transaction costs exist, and protecting and appropriating value are costly activities that dissipate value. Also, contracting and expectations enter as central aspects of strategizing. Arguments are provided for why economizing (with transaction costs) is more fundamental than strategizing (in the sense <b>of</b> <b>exploiting</b> <b>market</b> power). Thus, the paper argues that models in which the fullest possible account of transaction costs is made {{be used as the}} proper foundations and benchmarks for economics-based strategy research, rather than the patched-up competitive equilibrium model...|$|R

40|$|The {{ornamental}} aquaculture comprises both outdoor and {{indoor keeping}} of aquatic {{animals and plants}} for ornamental purpose {{which is a very}} popular hobby with many followers worldwide. It is also commercially profitable for specialized producers and vendors. Associated environmental risks include particularly introduction of non-native species, biological invasions and intensive field capture <b>of</b> <b>exploited</b> and <b>marketed</b> species. Since subsequent regulation, mitigation and eradication of naturalised alien species is very difficult and ineffective in many cases, the most important above all is to prevent new introductions. This trend is accented with a short delay in European legislature. The European Union (EU) currently initiates formation of list of the most invasive alien species. Although invasive potential of certain ornamental species such as red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is well known, the vast majority of traded species has never been tested and analysed from this point of view. Publications attached to this thesis are focused on monitoring and survey <b>of</b> <b>market</b> with ornamental animals, such as fishes and crayfishes, with special emphasis on list of advertised species, size classes, prices, origin and availability on <b>market.</b> With use <b>of</b> predictive models the probability of naturalisation and potential invasiveness of mentioned ornamental species were estimated. These information are supported by analysis of hobbyist behaviour. Results in present thesis highlight known environmental risks associated with ornamental aquaculture and also show detailed information about overlooked risks from the Czech Republic's as well as from EU perspective. Therefore this thesis should to help formation of aforementioned list of the undesirable species...|$|R

40|$|Research PaperCanned tuna is {{a typical}} {{international}} Agribusiness-based product. The most representative flow of the product is such that the tuna is processed in a firm in the developing country of the tropical area where the canned material, namely tuna and skipjack, is caught and landed. Canned products furnish standardized features in their size, the way of cooking, added flavors and quality {{so as to be}} exported either to Europe or North America where they are used as one of the cooking material. In the end of 1990 ’s, however, a new stream of production and consumption pattern emerged in the Philippines and Thailand. Tunas are cooked by local ways with local flavors before they are canned. The products are sold in ready-to-eat styles and consumed in the produced countries. Moreover and more recently, producers started to open up a new market in China as they tries to cook tuna in Chinese way. Transnational Agribusinesses sometimes develops {{in such a way that}} a product, that used to be produced solely for the export, gradually disseminates locally as per-capita-income of the producing country increases. On the other hand, such a transformation of consumption pattern could be recognized as a result of the targeted business strategy of transnational firms: they start <b>exploit</b> the <b>market</b> <b>of</b> the less developed countries after the saturation <b>of</b> the <b>market</b> <b>of</b> developed countries. In this paper, we carefully examine the reason of the transformation of production and consumption pattern of canned tuna products referring to the Agribusiness development...|$|R
