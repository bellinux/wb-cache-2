Andretti finished second in the 1981 Indianapolis 500 by <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> behind Bobby Unser. The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag, and Andretti was declared the winner. Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards' decision. USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later, and penalized Unser with a $40,000 fine.|$|E

The {{leader of the}} general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses {{for the first three}} finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.

5|$|American Greg LeMond {{became the}} first non-European to win the Tour in 1986. LeMond missed out in 1987 and 1988, but {{returned}} in 1989 to win the Tour by finishing <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> ahead of Laurent Fignon, the smallest winning margin in the Tour's history. LeMond also won in 1990. In 1991, Spaniard Miguel Indurain won his first Tour. Indurain came to dominate the Tour, winning four more Tours consecutively—making him {{the first person to}} win five consecutive Tours. He tried to win a record-high sixth Tour in 1996, but was beaten by Bjarne Riis, who later admitted to using Erythropoietin. Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani won in 1997 and 1998, respectively; however, Pantani's victory was overshadowed by doping scandals.|$|E

5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in <b>eight</b> <b>seconds.</b> They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, twenty points ahead of Newman in second place. Kahne's seventh-place finish allowed him to advance into third place, sixteen points in front of Harvick, who also moved up three positions. Biffle was in fifth place on 427 points. Burton, Edwards, Truex, Sadler, Earnhardt, Stewart and Kurt Busch rounded out the top twelve. Ford moved into {{the lead of the}} Manufacturers' Championship, five points ahead of Dodge. Chevrolet moved three points clear of Toyota. The event had a television audience of 12.1 million viewers; it took three hours, eight minutes, and <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> to complete the race, and the margin of victory was 0.504 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E

5|$|At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3min 59.43s in the 400m was <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> {{faster than}} his {{previous}} personal best; {{it made him}} the first 14-year-old to cover the distance {{in less than four}} minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3min 53.44s. The time was a world record for his age group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein {{received}} a universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics.

At the 2012 Olympics, {{she was one of}} three athletes to compete for Liechtenstein. She swam the 400 and 800 freestyles, finishing twenty-seventh in the 400 and 17th in the 800. Meier finished eighth in his heat and twenty-second overall with a time of 4:19.19 seconds, which set a national record but did not qualify him for the finals. Hassler started in the second lane. She came second in her heat and twenty-first overall with a time of 8:38.19 seconds. Hassler was <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> off the slowest qualifying time of 8:25.55 seconds by Mireia Belmonte of Spain.|$|E

5|$|On lap 47, Massa made a {{pit stop}} for new tyres from fifth place, {{retaining}} his position ahead of Fernando Alonso. All the while, Räikkönen {{was able to}} close the gap to Hamilton ahead of him to <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> on lap 49. On the next lap, Button passed Sainz for tenth and Ricciardo moved ahead of Palmer for 12th another lap later. Rosberg crossed the line to take his seventh consecutive victory, a feat to that point only achieved by Alberto Ascari, Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen rounded up the podium ahead of the two Williams drivers, Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa. Rosberg recorded the first Grand Slam of his career, meaning he won the race, recorded the fastest lap, achieved pole position and led every lap. He was the 24th driver in history to achieve the feat.|$|E
5|$|While Räikkönen {{closed on}} Verstappen at the front, Fernando Alonso's home race ended on lap 47, pulling {{over to the}} side of the track at turn three. Räikkönen managed to get into the one-second window to {{activate}} the drag reduction system (DRS), as Vettel was <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> behind him with Ricciardo closing on him in fourth place. By lap 57, Ricciardo was close enough to use DRS as well, but unable to pass. Three laps later, Ricciardo made an attempt at overtaking into turn one, but braking too late left him running wide, allowing Vettel back through. As the front runners lapped backmarkers, Kvyat, after scoring the first fastest lap for himself and Toro Rosso, overtook Gutiérrez for tenth place. Two laps from finish, Ricciardo suffered a puncture and was forced to pit, but retained fourth place ahead of Bottas. On the last lap, Renault drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer collided, but both made it to the finish. As Verstappen crossed the finish line, he became the youngest ever and first Dutch race winner in Formula One.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} got under way, Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari {{remained}} motionless {{on the spot}} and only started after all other cars had passed the Finn. Meanwhile, Hamilton got through the first chicane in front of Vettel, but his teammate Rosberg had to avoid Räikkönen's car and lost two places to the two Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Both Lotus drivers were forced to retire {{before the end of}} the second lap, Grosjean due to contact with another car, while Maldonado damaged his chassis when he went over a kerb. While Räikkönen charged through the field to get back up to twelfth place by lap three, Lewis Hamilton quickly increased his advantage over Vettel and moved out of the one-second DRS window. Nico Rosberg was unable to pass Bottas on track and was told by his team to cool his brakes. Further back, the Red Bull sponsored cars moved up the order as well, with Carlos Sainz Jr., Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat fighting for tenth position. Sainz yielded his place on lap 11, when he needed to go into the pit lane for a five-second penalty handed to him for cutting the chicane at the start. By lap 14, Hamilton led Vettel by over <b>eight</b> <b>seconds,</b> with Rosberg still behind both Williams in fifth place, pushing Bottas by enabling DRS on the long straights. Behind the German were the two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg.|$|E

5|$|Brazil's {{substitution}} of Paulinho for Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk {{resulted in an}} improvement in their play after the restart; Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved shots in quick succession from Oscar, Paulinho and Fred. By the 60th minute, though, the Germans came close to scoring again, with Júlio César denying Müller twice. Another German goal indeed came in the 69th minute – Lahm's low cross found substitute André Schürrle, who side-footed {{the ball into the}} net from close range. 10 minutes later, Schürrle ran onto Müller's cross from the left and hit a powerful shot over Júlio César at the near post. At this point with the score at 7–0, the remaining home fans gave the Germans a standing ovation, applauding both Schürrle's goal and Germany's overall performance. Close to the end, Özil received a through ball but just missed the chance to make it <b>eight.</b> <b>Seconds</b> later, Oscar received a long ball and scored in the 90th minute to make it 7–1. The final score matched Brazil's worst ever loss (6–0 to Uruguay in 1920) and ended a run of 62 competitive home matches unbeaten for Brazil. The Brazilian players left the pitch in tears to a chorus of boos.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 season, Webber was {{approached}} by Mercedes-AMG to compete in sportscar racing. Although he initially declined the offer he was persuaded {{at the end of}} the year when invited to participate in a test session for the team at the A1-Ring in Austria. Mercedes-AMG were suitably impressed with Webber, and he was signed as the official Mercedes works junior driver for the 1998 FIA GT Championship, alongside reigning champion Bernd Schneider. Travelling around the world, including the United States, Japan and Europe, the pair won five of the ten rounds on their way to second in the overall standings, beaten to the Championship by teammates Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta by just <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> in the final race at Laguna Seca. Webber remained with the Mercedes-AMG team for 1999, and was promoted to his own race car for the season. However, his sportscar career came to an early end after he flipped twice on the Mulsanne Straight during practice for the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans race. An aerodynamic fault on the team's Mercedes-Benz CLRs caused Webber to become spectacularly airborne during both practice and race-day warm up, with the same fate befalling teammate Peter Dumbreck five hours into the race. Both drivers escaped uninjured, but the crashes forced Mercedes to shelve their sportscar program for the year and Webber to reconsider a return to open wheel racing.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2007, the Raptors {{won their}} first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 {{victory over the}} New Jersey Nets, but lost the series 4–2. The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court {{advantage}} in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets {{took charge of the}} series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with <b>eight</b> <b>seconds</b> left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.|$|E
