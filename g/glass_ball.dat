25|$|Balls {{of solid}} glass {{occasionally}} {{were used in}} a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, {{there must be something}} about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid <b>glass</b> <b>ball</b> in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.|$|E

60|$|This is how glass bottles, vases, etc., are made.

This he passes quickly to another man, who dips it once more, and, having twirled the tube around so as to lengthen the <b>glass</b> <b>ball</b> at the end, gives it to a third man, who places this <b>glass</b> <b>ball</b> in an earthen mould, and blows into {{the other end of the}} tube, and soon the shapeless mass of glass becomes a bottle. But it is not quite finished, for the bottom has to be completed, and the neck to have the glass band put around it. The bottom is finished by pressing it with a cone-shaped instrument as soon as it comes out of the mould. A thick glass thread is wound around the neck. And, if a name is to be put on, fresh glass is added to the side, and stamped with a seal.|$|E

40|$|Summary: This article {{describes}} {{a comparison between}} adsorption arid covalent binding of protein-conjugates (bovine serum albumin-diazoluminol), antibodies (sheep anti-human thyrotropin) and haptens ([I 25]thyrox-ine) to polystyrene, nylon and <b>glass</b> <b>balls.</b> Different eombinations of adsorption and covalent binding were used; these varying with the solid phase in question. Polystyrene balls were preactivated by adsorption of a copolymer of phenylalanine and lysine (poly phe-lys) from aqueous solution. The treated balls were then in most cases chemically activated with pentane- 1, 5 -dial before coupling the substance under test. Polystyrene balls were directly chemically activated by nitration followed by reduction and diazotisation. Nylon balls were eifher used äs received or partially hydrolysed with either hydrochlöric acid or sodium hydroxide before further use. Chemical activation was carried out using either carbodiimides or pentane- 1, 5 -dial, the latter proving to be unsuitable because of crossJinking between amino groups on the <b>ball</b> surface. <b>Glass</b> <b>balls</b> were coäted with organofunctional aminosilänes followed by chemical activation with pentane- 1, 5 -dial. The best results were obtained using nylon balls activated with carbodiimides and with polystyrene balls coated with poly phe-lys and chemically activated with pentane-l, 5 -dial. <b>Glass</b> <b>balls</b> proved to be unsuit-able äs the coatiijg precision was poof under laboratory conditions.

60|$|In the Introductory Chapter it was {{observed}} that the phenomena which apparently point to some unaccountable supernormal faculty of acquiring knowledge are 'trivial.'
