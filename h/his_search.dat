5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during <b>his</b> <b>search</b> for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930.

This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground.

With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in <b>his</b> <b>search</b> for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly {{what they wanted to}} hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism.|$|E

5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses.
