50|$|TIFF {{was created}} {{as an attempt}} to get desktop scanner vendors of the mid-1980s to agree on a common scanned image file format, in place of a {{multitude}} of proprietary formats. In the beginning, TIFF was only a binary image format (only two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to accommodate grayscale images, then color images. Today, TIFF, along with JPEG and PNG, is a popular format for <b>deep-color</b> images.|$|E

40|$|A pulse-gating Raman {{spectroscopy}} setup {{was developed}} in this project. The setup was capable of performing in-situ high-temperature Raman measurements for glasses at temperatures as high as 1412 C. In the literature, high-temperature Raman measurements have only been performed on thin films of glass to minimize black-body radiation effects. The pulse-gating Raman setup allows making high-temperature measurements for bulk melts while effectively minimizing black-body radiation effects. A good correlation was found between certain Raman characteristic parameters and glass melt temperature for sodium silicate glasses measured in this project. Comparisons were made between the high-temperature Raman data from this study and literature data. The results suggest that an optimization of the pulse-gating Raman setup is necessary to further improve data quality (i. e., to obtain data with a higher signal-to-noise ratio). An W confocal Raman microspectrometer with continuous wave laser excitation using a 325 nm excitation line was evaluated selectively using a transparent silicate glass ad a deep-colored high-level waste glass in a bulk quantity. The data were successfully collected at temperatures as high as approximately 1500 C. The results demonstrated that the UV excitation line {{can be used for}} high-temperature Raman measurements of molten glasses without black-body radiation interference from the melt for both transparent and <b>deep-color</b> glasses. Further studies are needed to select the best laser system {{that can be used to}} develop high-temperature Raman glass databases...|$|E

30|$|The {{reaction}} of azo coupling, taking place between diazonium salts (DS) and aromatic amines, phenols, or naphthols, results in <b>deep-colored</b> products (azo dyes). Therefore, {{it is widely}} used for photometric analysis of organic pollutants [18 – 20]. However, due to modest selectivity and insufficient sensitivity, the azo coupling is not fully applicable on environmental samples. This limitation can be overcome if the procedures of pre-concentration and analysis are combined in one solid-phase analytical reagent (SPAR). To develop such a SPAR, we propose immobilization of azo coupling reagent on the silica gel surface.|$|R

The name raboxo in the native Venetian language means [...] "angry", because angry is the sensation in the mouth when this wine is drunk young. Raboso was in the past the most cultivated grape variety of eastern Veneto; it was the favored wine for the Venetian navigators around the world; they called it vin de viajo [...] "wine of travel", because it was the most resistant to aging and transport. Its popularity decreased in the 20th century, and today the vineyards of Raboxo are just 1-2% of the total amount of vineyards in Veneto.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between lifestyle factors including nutrition intake and the incidence of fall-related fragility fractures in postmenopausal women. Methods: A total of 1169 female volunteers were recruited from participants at the morning health examinations held at each local public health center in the West Chiayi County of Taiwan {{at the beginning of the}} study. Laboratory examinations, anthropometric measurements, and questionnaire interviews inquiring about lifestyle factors, including weekly nutrition intake, were performed. Subsequently, four follow-up telephone interviews at intervals of about 6 – 12 months were performed to inquire about instances of falls and fractures. Results: Nine hundred and fifty-three subjects responded at least once to the four telephone interviews, and there were 183 postmenopausal women, with a mean age of 68. 8  ±  8. 3 (49 – 87) years, reporting falls. Of the 183 women, 25 had incurred new fractures from low-energy impacts. Statistical analysis revealed that older age and hypertension were associated with increased risks of falling. Intake of other <b>deep-colored</b> (nondark-green) vegetables and light-colored vegetables as well as total vegetable intake were associated with reduced risk of fall-related fragility fracture. Conclusion: Among postmenopausal women, older age and the presence of hypertension were associated with increased risks of falls.

40|$|The employ {{of thermal}} {{insulation}} {{is one of}} the most effective ways of building energy conservation for cooling and heating. Therefore, the selection of a proper insulation material and the determination of optimum insulation thickness are particularly vital. Four typical cities of Shanghai, Changsha, Shaoguan and Chengdu are selected to represent A, B, C and D subzone of hot summer and cold winter zone in China, respectively. The optimum thicknesses of five insulation materials including expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, foamed polyurethane, perlite and foamed polyvinyl chloride are calculated with a typical residential wall using solar-air cooling and heating degree-days analysis and P 1 -P 2 economic model. And then, life cycle total costs, life cycle savings and payback periods are calculated based on life cycle cost analysis. Considering different orientations, surface colors, insulation materials and climates, optimum thicknesses of the five insulations vary from 0. 053 to 0. 236 Â m, and the payback periods vary from 1. 9 to 4. 7 Â years over a lifetime of 20 Â years. The maximum life cycle savings are 54. 4 Â $/m 2 in Shanghai, 54. 8 Â $/m 2 in Changsha and 41. 5 Â $/m 2 in Shaoguan (with a <b>deep-colored</b> northeast wall), and 39. 0 Â $/m 2 in Chengdu (with a light-colored northwest wall).

Methods: Four hundred and thirteen patients {{were included in the}} clinical trial from 9 clinical centers. They were randomly divided into Western medicine-treated group with 204 cases and Chinese herbal drug-treated group with 209 cases. Eighteen clinical symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. The Western medicine therapy included voltaren extended release tablets, methotrexate and sulfasalazine. The Chinese herbal drug therapy included glucosidorum Tripterygii totorum tablets and Yishen Juanbi Tablets combined with treatment based on syndrome differentiation. The American college of rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) was used as efficacy evaluation criteria. Results: In the Chinese herbal drug-treated group, clinical symptoms such as arthralgia and tenderness of joints were positively correlated with the efficacy after 12 -week treatment, while frequent urination at night was negatively correlated. In the same group, tenderness of joints and fever were positively correlated with the efficacy after 24 -week treatment, while <b>deep-colored</b> and turbid urine was negatively correlated. In the Western medicine-treated group, tenderness of joints and thirst were positively correlated with the efficacy after 12 -week treatment, while vertigo was negatively correlated. And in the same group, tenderness of joints was positively correlated with the efficacy after 24 -week treatment, while heaviness of limbs was negatively correlated to the efficacy. The statistical results showed that the treatment efficacy was improved when the correlated symptoms were included in the indications.

40|$|Soy-sauce is the Japanese {{condiment}} and Mirin is the Japanese sweet alcoholic beverage. There are {{two kinds}} of Soy-sauce, namely, <b>deep-colored</b> and pale-colored one. (Usukuchi and Kokuchi Shoyu) This pale-colored Soy-sauce should be the same as <b>deep-colored</b> Soy-sauce. When Soy-sauce is stored, its color is getting deeper and change of its taste and flavor is getting larger. Similar phenomenon is observed in Mirin. Therefore, browning phenomenon is occuring in Soy-sauce and Mirin. This phenomenon is seemed to affect on their qualities profoundly. This browning phenomenon of Soy-sauce and Mirin was studied spectroscopically and chromatographically. Following results were obtained. I. On the color change of Soy-sauce and Mirin The color of Soy-sauce was studied by Hardy's self-recording spectrophotometer in the region of visible spectrum ranging from 400 mμ to 700 mμ and the color of Mirin was studied by Beckmann's spectrophotometer in the region of visible spectrum ranging from 400 mμ to 660 mμ. Their color was expressed by the C. I. E method. [table] Soy-sauce has stronger absorption in the shorter wave length and weak one in the longer wave length in the visible spectrum. The form of its transmittance curve remains unchanged even when the process of its preparation is varied. The degree of color deepness dependes upon the kind of Soy-sauce. If compared on the basis of total nitrogen content reduced to 1 %, color deepness may be arranged in the following order: [table] II. On the factors causing the browning reaction during storage. The browning reaction of Soy-sauce and of Mirin is not due to the enzymatic reaction. On the Soy-sauce, the action of Air is the most effective and action of Temperature and Ray is unremarkable. This shows that Air-oxidation is the principal cause. When the color of Soy-sauce is deepened by aeration, the form of transmittance curve differs no remarkable change. On the Amino acid condiment, similar phenomenon is observed. On the Mirin, the action of Air, Ray and Temperature is very effective. III. On the substances affecting the browning reaction A. On the Carbonyl compounds. The compounds which affect the browning in Soy-sauce, Amino acid condiment and in Mirin were separated as 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives and characterized by paper-and column chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectrum. Carbonyl compounds promote to darkening of Soy-sauce, Amino acid condiment and Mirin. On the Soy-sauce, these carbonyl compounds were composed of 13 aldehydes and 4 ketonic acids. Acetaldehydes was recognized, Crotonaldehyde, Diacetyl and Levulinic acid were presumed, still unknown 10 aldehydes and 3 ketonic acids were gained. On the Amino acid condiment, 16 carbonyl compounds were separated. (13 aldehydes and ketones, 3 ketonic acids). Of these compounds, Benzaldehyde, Formaldehyde, Levulinic acid and Acetoacetic acid were recognized. Other 12 carbonyl compounds were unknown. On the Mirin, many saturated and a few unsaturated carbonyl compounds were separated. Known compounds of them were Acetaldehyde, Crotonaldehyde, Diacetyl, Acetoin and Hydroxymethylfurfural. Ketonic acid was not formed. 4 carbonyl compounds produced during storage for 3 months were separated, but their structure was not determined. The number and amount of the carbonyl compounds were affected by the condition of storage. As the mechanism of carbonyl compounds formation during storage, the Strecker Degradation was suggested, namely, Alanine+Diacetyl=Acetaldehyde+CO_ 2 +Amino-keto acid many unknown carbonyl compounds was produced by the Strecker Degradation during storage. B. On the effect of Furfual Variation of Furfural contents during brewing of Soy-sauce and the effect of it on the browning reaction was studied. Amounts of Furfural in raw-material decreases a little at later stage of brewing and increase by pasteurization. H. M. F is made secondarily by pasteurization, The occurrence of Furfural increses color degree of Soy-sauce. Mechanism of color-making from Furfural is not by autooxidation of Furfural, simple reaction of Furfural-amino acid and Furfural-aldehyde. On the Amino acid condiment, Furfural contents are large. But Furfural was not observed in Mirin. C. On the effect of Reductone Reductones (2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol reducing substances) were observed in Soy-sauce and Mirin. Considerable variation of Reductone quantity, for example, ascorbic acid, was observed during brewing of Soy-sauce. The existance of A. A. surely gives an influence on the color of Soy-sauce and its activity is as follows. [table] A. A. or D. A. A. makes browning reaction with the amino acids of Soy-sauce. The reaction activity of tyrosine is large. Mechanism of browning reaction is as follows: [table] D. On the trace element. Iron in the brewing-water promote the browning reaction, namely, iron accelerate the reaction activity of tyrosine with A. A. IV. On the browning reaction of Koji. Browning reaction of Koji is not enzymatic. Sugar, amino acid, reductone and carbonyl compounds play an important role but phenol is not important...|$|R
6000|$|The {{first act}} of Captain Manual, after landing once more on his native soil, {{was to make}} {{interest}} to be again restored {{to the line of}} the army. He encountered but little difficulty in this attempt, and was soon in possession of the complete enjoyment of that which his soul had so long pined after, [...] "a steady drill." [...] He was in time to share in all the splendid successes which terminated the war, and also to participate in his due proportion of the misery of the army. His merits were not forgotten, however, in the re-organization of the forces, and he followed both St. Clair and his more fortunate successor, Wayne, in the western campaigns. About the close of the century, when the British made their tardy relinquishment of the line of posts along the frontiers, Captain Manual was ordered to take charge, with his company, of a small stockade on our side of one of those mighty rivers that sets bounds to the territories of the Republic in the north. The British flag was waving over the ramparts of a more regular fortress, that had been recently built, directly opposite, within the new lines of the Canadas. Manual was not a man to neglect the observances of military etiquette; and understanding that the neighboring fort was commanded by a field- officer, he did not fail to wait on that gentleman, in proper time, with a view to cultivate the sort of acquaintance that their mutual situations would render not only agreeable, but highly convenient. The American martinet, in ascertaining the rank of the other, had not deemed it at all necessary to ask his name; but when the red-faced, comical- looking officer with one leg, who met him, was introduced as Major Borroughcliffe, he had not the least difficulty in recalling to recollection his quondam acquaintance of St. Ruth. The intercourse between these worthies was renewed with remarkable gusto, and at length arrived to so regular a pass that a log cabin was erected on one of the islands in the river, as a sort of neutral territory, where their feastings and revels might be held without any scandal to the discipline of their respective garrisons. Here the qualities of many a saddle of savory venison were discussed, together with those of sundry pleasant fowls, as well as of divers strange beasts that inhabit those western wilds, while, at the same time, the secret places of the broad river were vexed, that nothing might be wanting that could contribute to the pleasures of their banquets. A most equitable levy was regularly made on their respective pockets, to sustain the foreign expenses of this amicable warfare; and a suitable division of labor was also imposed on the two commandants, in order to procure such articles of comfort as were only to be obtained from those portions of the globe where the art of man had made a nearer approach to the bounties of nature than in the vicinity of their fortifications. All liquids in which malt formed an ingredient, as well as the <b>deep-colored</b> wines of Oporto, were suffered to enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and were made to find their way, under the superintendence of Borroughcliffe, to their destined goal; but Manual was solely entrusted with the more important duty of providing the generous liquor of Madeira, without any other restriction on his judgment than an occasional injunction from his coadjutor that it should not fail to be the product of the [...] "south side"! ...|$|R
