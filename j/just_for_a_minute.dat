6000|$|MABEL. Will {{you wait}} a minute, please? Returning. It's De Levis--to see you. [In a low voice] Let me see him alone first. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute!</b> Do! ...|$|E
6000|$|Joy, darling! It's so awful, you 'll make {{yourself}} ill, {{and it is}} n't worth it, really. I 'd do anything to save you pain--won't you stop <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. I do {{wonder at}} you, John, letting him talk {{like this before}} everybody. [Turning rather tartly to Lina] Would you mind going away to the drawing-room <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> Miss Chipenoska. This is a private family matter, if you dont mind.|$|R

60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little <b>minute</b> Danny Meadow Mouse {{wanted to}} cry. Then he remembered old Mr. Toad and instead began to laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're going. Harry's outside. I {{told him}} you didn't want to see him, so he's kept out of your way. But {{he wants to know}} if he can come in <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to say good-bye to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What's the matter, Mr. Turtle?' I asked, {{for even}} though I don't {{like the old}} fellow any too well it pays to be polite, and really, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> I was afraid he'd {{make up his mind}} to die.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're talking I.W.W. rot," [...] whispered Kurt, {{shaking with}} the effort to subdue his feelings. [...] "Anderson is fine, big, square--a {{developer}} of the Northwest. Not an enemy! He's our friend. Oh! if only you had an American's eyes, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute!...</b> Father, I want that money for Anderson." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thorne," [...] said Sir Roger once more. [...] "Thorne, <b>just</b> {{come back}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> You wouldn't let me send a present would you,--fifty pounds or so,--just {{to buy a}} few flounces?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't trouble {{yourself}} to answer. <b>Just</b> shut up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. You were rather a soft green youth then, and you don't {{seem to be}} much harder or less verdant now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another venture {{cut short}} by the inevitable," [...] said Forster. [...] "Is there a {{conundrum}} without an answer in the next number? But let's hold to our subject <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, if you will. It isn't often that I meet a man who understands the flaws I pick in existence. I am {{engaged to be married}} a month from to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} the old {{butternut}} tree he was all out of breath. He was puffing and blowing {{and he was so}} warm that he wished <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> a single little minute, that he could swim like Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter, so that he could jump into the Smiling Pool and cool off.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had such}} a {{capacity}} for keeping her word that this alarmed him, and {{he did his best}} to extinguish his lights. [...] "I'm no masterful, Grizel," [...] he said, [...] "and I dinna want to be, it was <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> that I liked the thought." [...] She shook her head, but his next words had more effect. [...] "If I had been that kind, would I have teached you Elspeth's prayer?" ...|$|E
60|$|EMMY [coaxing] Come now: <b>just</b> see her <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{to please}} me: theres a good boy. She's given me half-a-crown. She thinks it's {{life and death}} to her husband {{for her to see}} you.|$|R
5000|$|... Defense Minister Naoki Tanaka said [...] "We have {{confirmed}} that a certain flying object has been launched and fell after flying <b>for</b> <b>just</b> over <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> {{and there was no}} impact on Japanese territory".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} an anxious day, but this makes up for everything," [...] he said. [...] "Now--and it is so long since I have seen you--can't we, <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> forget our troubles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would really}} have done your heart {{good if you}} could have seen how I skipped over the ground, with that red-mouthed old fellow so close behind that his breath {{actually}} ruffled the fur on my back. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> I began to think that I had taken too many chances, and would really go home with the villain, for one of his strides was equal to three or four of mine, and he was putting in his best licks, as I knew only too well, having been chased by him many a time before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> I {{thought the}} smell of young Mr. Fox was in the air. When I got rid of that fellow's {{grandfather}} I said to Mrs. Bunny that a full half of all our troubles had disappeared out of the big woods, with {{the evidence of the}} good fortune nailed up on Mr. Man's barn; but I had entirely forgotten that the old rascal left behind him a regular gang of children and grandchildren, and I truly believe they are the worst to be found anywhere in this world, to say nothing of their being able to run twice as fast as their grandfather ever could even in his best days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{throw it}} too far, Charles," [...] said his wife. [...] "He doesn't swim awfully well," [...] she continued, turning to me, [...] "and I'm always afraid {{he might get}} out of his depth. Last week he was ever so nearly drowned. Mr. Van Toy was in swimming, and he had on a dark blue suit (dark blue seems simply to infuriate Weejee) and Weejee just dashed in after him. He don't MEAN anything, you know, it was only the SUIT made him angry,--he really likes Mr. Van Toy,--but <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> we were quite alarmed. If Mr. Van Toy hadn't carried Weejee in I think he might have been drowned.|$|E
60|$|It {{was some}} time later {{when they came back}} to the store, and <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> Grant saw Hetty alone. She was dressed very plainly in new garments, and blushed when he looked gravely down on her.|$|R
60|$|Then old Mr. Toad {{once more}} opened his big mouth {{and began to}} laugh harder than ever. Jimmy Skunk looked at him <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and he looked so funny that Jimmy Skunk began to laugh too.|$|R
60|$|Peter Rabbit yawned again. Then {{he closed}} his eyes <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> When he opened them there was Striped Chipmunk on the old log just as before, and the pockets in both cheeks were so full that it seemed as if they would burst.|$|R
60|$|So {{far as the}} wasps' nest went, {{they found}} their task {{exceptionally}} easy--astonishingly easy. Except {{that it was a}} longer labour, it was no graver affair than any common wasps' nest might have been. Danger there was, no doubt, danger to life, but it never so much as thrust its head out of that portentous hillside. They stuffed in the sulphur and nitre, they bunged the holes soundly, and fired their trains. Then with a common impulse all the party but Cossar turned and ran athwart the long shadows of the pines, and, finding Cossar had stayed behind, came to a halt together in a knot, a hundred yards away, convenient to a ditch that offered cover. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two the moonlit night, all black and white, was heavy with a suffocated buzz, that rose and mingled to a roar, a deep abundant note, and culminated and died, and then almost incredibly the night was still.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning, however, I went into papa's study to write my letters, and got through them {{more easily than}} I had expected. Polly came in {{from time to time}} to see that I was not agitating myself too much, only staying <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two to kiss me, and say some little word of consolation and love. My first letter was to Percy. I told him what had happened, and that all hope which I might previously have entertained of finding the will, was now entirely extinguished. I told him that I knew he loved me for my own sake; and no unworthy doubt that this would make any difference in him had ever entered my mind; but I frankly said that I feared Lady Desborough would no longer give her approval and consent, and that I foresaw painful times in store for us, for it was of course out of the question that we could marry in the face of her determined opposition. Putting aside pecuniary considerations, which even lovers could not entirely ignore, I could not consent to marry into a family where my presence would be the cause of dissension and division between mother and son. I said this was my fixed determination, and begged him to acquiesce in it, and not pain me by solicitations--to which I could not yield--to do otherwise than what I felt to be right, in the event of his mother's insisting on his breaking off his engagement with me.|$|E
6000|$|Lizzie put off {{her journey}} to Scotland {{from day to}} day, though her cousin Frank {{continually}} urged upon her the expediency of going. There were various reasons, he said, why she should go. Her child was there, and it was proper {{that she should be}} with her child. She was living at present with people whose reputation did not stand high,--and as to whom all manner of evil reports were flying about the town. It was generally thought,--so said Frank,--that that Lord George de Bruce Carruthers had assisted Mr. Benjamin in stealing the diamonds, and Frank himself did not hesitate to express his belief in the accusation. [...] "Oh no, that cannot be," [...] said Lizzie, trembling. But, though she rejected the supposition, she did not reject it very firmly. [...] "And then, you know," [...] continued Lizzie, [...] "I never see him. I have actually only set eyes on him once since the second robbery, and then <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Of course, I used to know him,--down at Portray,--but now we are strangers." [...] Frank went on with his objections. He declared that the manner in which Mrs. Carbuncle had got up the match between Lucinda Roanoke and Sir Griffin was shameful,--all the world was declaring that it was shameful,--that she had not a penny, that the girl was an adventurer, and that Sir Griffin was an obstinate, pig-headed, ruined idiot. It was expedient on every account that Lizzie should take herself away from that [...] "lot." [...] The answer that Lizzie desired to make was very simple. Let me go as your betrothed bride, and I will start to-morrow,--to Scotland or elsewhere, as you may direct. Let that little affair be settled, and I shall be quite as willing to get out of London as you can be to send me. But I am in such a peck of troubles that something must be settled. And as it seems that after all the police are still astray about the necklace, perhaps I needn't run away from them for a little while even yet. She did not say this. She did not even in so many words make the first proposition. But she did endeavour to make Frank understand that she would obey his dictation if he would earn the right to dictate. He either did not or would not understand her, and then she became angry with him,--or pretended to be angry. [...] "Really, Frank," [...] she said, [...] "you are hardly fair to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon this intrusion, Miss Moss. I {{really did}} not know you were in this {{neighbourhood}} till <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> ago," [...] said Barret, sitting down on the heather beside her. [...] "I accidentally observed you, and I have been so very fortunate in finding rare plants this morning, that I thought I might venture, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> to interrupt the privacy of your picnic. See, here!" [...] he added, taking off the botanical box and opening it; [...] "just look at all this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Reuben, {{you must}} <b>just</b> come up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> on the poop. The other {{passengers}} are all waiting to shake {{you by the}} hand, {{and they would not}} forgive me if I were to let you run off, as I know you are wanting to do, without a word." ...|$|R
30|$|Such {{changes have}} risen {{out of the}} {{necessity}} for efficiency and improved healthcare. In a hospital/clinic, the concentration of medical expertise, equipment and sanitized environment improves the quality of healthcare over house-visits. Nonetheless, both models of consultation have their own disadvantages. In house visits, the physician’s travelling time slows down the immediacy of care and compromises diagnostic accuracy without the necessary medical equipment (e.g. X-Ray machine). On the other hand, we have the very real problem of long patient waiting hours <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> of consultation or the collection of test results.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{questions}} have been raised about diary-based data collection methods. The expectation that diarists participating in the radio sample will accurately record their listening at 15 minute intervals has been challenged by many analysts. Many analysts suspect that diarists only fill in their diaries {{at the end of each}} week, or perhaps less often which forces them to recall their radio usage thereby raising concerns about reliability. In addition the diary based method appears to inflate average audience size, because the total audience is captured by recording any person who was listening during a quarter-hour counts as listening for the entire duration, even if the actual time was <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{opens with}} Miss Brill delighting in her {{decision}} to wear her fur. She notices {{that there are more}} park-goers than there were last Sunday, and that the band is more enthusiastic because the Season has commenced. Miss Brill observes facets of the lives around her, [...] "listening as though she didn't listen, ...sitting in other people's lives <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> while they talked round her". She sees the world as a play: as though her surroundings are a set and she and her fellow park-goers actors. She imagines that the band's performance corresponds with and highlights the park's happenings. When the band strikes up a new song, Miss Brill envisions everyone in the park taking part in the song and singing. She begins to cry at the thought.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{story about}} a pure and pretty country girl, Xiangxue, [...] "fragrant snow" [...] in Chinese. Xiangxue lives in a village in the {{mountains}}. Every day, a train from outside the mountains stops at the village <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Xiangxue and other country girls each take a small basket of eggs to the train when it stops and exchange them for things they want, because they cannot get what they need in the village. Xiangxue carries the basket onto the train, and when she sees a pencil box beside a city girl of her age, she immediately wants it. She offers her for it a full basket of eggs; the exchange is made. It opens up a door to the outside world for her. The story shows the country girl's simplicity and her yearning for civilization.|$|E
5000|$|... "Most mobile TV viewing is <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> To be commercially successful, {{you have}} to provide a {{combination}} of live news, sports updates and video-on-demand made-for-mobile content which is instantly engaging. Simply broadcasting linear TV to mobiles is not the answer," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|Volunteer {{nurse and}} former Ebola patient William Pooley {{delivered}} the 2014 message on Christmas Day. Mr Pooley, {{who attended the}} University of East Anglia, hit the headlines after contracting the virus earlier this year. After making a full recovery, Pooley {{decided to return to}} Sierra Leone to continue his work there as a nurse. He used the broadcast to appeal for support, saying: [...] "I don’t want to make you feel guilty, but I would like you to think <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> about what you could do to help. What a wonderful Christmas present that would be." ...|$|R
50|$|The most used sound {{structure}} is the open form, since {{the public can}} decide to experience <b>a</b> sound installation <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> or <b>for</b> <b>a</b> longer period of time. This obliges the artist to construct a sound organization {{that is capable of}} working well in both of the two cases.|$|R
