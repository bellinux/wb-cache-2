40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the very {{progressive}} branch of the automotive industry, hybrid and electric vehicles. Based on the configuration the hybrid and electric vehicles are using an electric motor for the converting of the electrical energy into the mechanical energy, which {{is used for the}} vehicle moving. The main limit of these vehicles especially pure electric vehicles is limited range. One way how to extend the range is to add other battery cells, which increases the price of the vehicle, or to use optimization methods in cooperation with advanced driver assistance systems. The proposal of the optimization method is the main goal of this thesis.

40|$|Driving cycles are {{important}} components for evaluation {{and design of}} vehicles. They determine the focus of vehicle manufacturers, and indirectly they affect {{the environmental impact of}} vehicles since the vehicle control system is usually tuned to one or several driving cycles. Thus, the driving cycle affects the design of the vehicle since cost, fuel consumption, and emissions all depend on the driving cycle used for design. Since the existing standard driving cycles cannot keep up with the changing road infrastructure, the changing vehicle fleet composition, and the growing number of vehicles on the road, which do all cause changes in the driver behavior, the need to get new and representative driving cycles are increasing. A research question is how to generate these new driving cycles so that they are both representative {{and at the same time}} have certain equivalence properties, to make fair comparisons of the performance results. Besides generation, another possibility to get more driving cycles is to transform the existing ones into new, different, driving cycles considering equivalence constraints. With the development of new powertrain concepts the need for evaluation will increase, and an interesting question is how to utilize new developments in dynamometer technology together with new possibilities for connecting equipment. Here a pedal robot is developed to be used in a vehicle mounted in a chassis dynamometer and the setup is used for co-simulation together with a moving base simulator that is connected with a communication line. The results show that the co-simulation can become a realistic driving experience and a viable option for dangerous tests and a complement to tests on a dedicated track or on-road tests, if improvements on the braking and the vehicle feedback to the driver are implemented. The problem of generating representative driving cycles, with specified excitation at the wheels, is approached with a combined two-step method. AMarkov chain approach is used to generate candidate driving cycles that are then transformed to equivalent driving cycles with respect to the mean tractive force components, which are the used measures. Using an optimization methodology the transformation of driving cycles is formulated as a nonlinear program with constraints and a cost function to minimize. The nonlinear program formulation can handle a wide range of constraints, e. g., the mean tractive force components, different power measures, or available <b>energy</b> for <b>recuperation,</b> and using the vehicle jerk as cost function gives good drivability. In conclusion, methods for driving cycle design have been proposed where new driving cycles can either be generated from databases, or given driving cycles can be transformed to fulfill certain equivalence constraints, approaching the important problem of similar but not the same. The combination of these approaches yields a stochastic and general method to generate driving cycles with equivalence properties that can be used at several instances during the product development process of vehicles. Thus, a powerful and effective engineering tool has been developed...|$|R

50|$|The driver {{can also}} select several driving modes: SPORT, COMFORT and ECO PRO. Using the gear selector, the driver can either select {{position}} D for automated gear selection or can switch to SPORT mode. SPORT mode offers manual gear selection {{and at the}} same time switches to very sporty drive and suspension settings. In SPORT mode, the engine and electric motor deliver extra performance, accelerator response is faster and the power boost from the electric motor is maximized. And to keep the battery topped up, SPORT mode also activates maximum <b>energy</b> <b>recuperation</b> during overrun and braking as the electric motor’s generator function, which recharges the battery using kinetic energy, switches to a more powerful setting. The Driving Experience Control switch on the center console offers a choice of two settings. On starting, COMFORT mode is activated, which offers a balance between sporty performance and fuel efficiency, with unrestricted access to all convenience functions. Alternatively, the ECO PRO mode can be engaged, which, on the BMW i8 as on other models, supports an efficiency-optimized driving style. On this mode the powertrain controller coordinates the cooperation between the gasoline engine and the electric motor for maximum fuel economy. On deceleration, the intelligent energy management system automatically decides, in line with the driving situation and vehicle status, whether to recuperate braking energy or to coast with the powertrain disengaged. At the same time, ECO PRO mode also programs electrical convenience functions such as the air conditioning, seat heating and heated mirrors to operate at minimum power consumption, but without compromising safety. The maximum driving range of the BMW i8 on a full fuel tank and with a fully charged battery is more than 500 km in COMFORT mode, which can be increased by up to 20% in ECO PRO mode. The BMW i8’s ECO PRO mode can also be used during all-electric operation. The vehicle is then powered solely by the electric motor. Only if the battery charge drops below a given level, or under sudden intense throttle application such as kickdown, is the internal combustion engine automatically activated.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, dynamic {{development}} of electric drives in automotive applications has taken place.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>recuperation</b> in fully {{electric}} vehicles is mainly {{limited by the}} requirement to preserve vehicle stability {{but it is also}} dependent on the brake system design and the ability of the control system. The boundaries of vehicle stability are difficult to assess, and must be approached with care, e. g. when maximizing the regenerative braking during cornering on slippery surfaces. Model based predictive control (MPC) is used in this paper to account for the main vehicle dynamics behaviour and to optimize the regenerative braking. A state estimator is also used to estimate the states fed back to the controller and other vehicle and road parameters used in the MPC problem formulation. The state estimation is capable of predicting road friction and accurately provides the current driving condition to the controller also under challenging braking conditions such as mu-split braking. The MPC controller shows a clear compromise between vehicle stability and the <b>energy</b> <b>recuperation</b> potential. The developed MPC concept together with the state estimator is a versatile method that can adapt to various brake designs and tuning objectives.
