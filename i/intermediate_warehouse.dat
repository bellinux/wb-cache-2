Examples of mathematics models building and effective algorithm development for quasi-optimal management of informational servicing logistic systems are presented. Keywords Logistics, logistic information management, computerized administratorcoordinator, computer logistic, mathematical models, structure. The logistic systems concept The logistics, as a cognition form, is known from the great antiquity. Originally, the art of rational measuring, skilled computing and logical conclusions were in its competence [1]. The logistic systems are creating {{for the purpose of}} the industrial and economic activity and the finance-economic activity coordination, based on the united coordinated organizational, informational, hardware and software maintenance, aggregate of interconnected sub-units of integrated systems. The logistic system of an organizationtechnological type includes: maintenance supply, stuff and component keeping, finished commodity production, goods shipping to <b>intermediate</b> <b>warehouse,</b> final sale and use of finished commodity...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-stage}} hybrid flow-shop {{production system}} is considered. The first stage {{is a process}} production system and the second stage is a job-shop production system. The two stages are separated by an <b>intermediate</b> <b>warehouse</b> to introduce flexibility (some independence) in the planning of production at both stages. The inventory level at the warehouse should be optimized to provide a trade-off between the cost of carrying the inventory of the semi-finished products, the minimum batch size requirement in the first stage, and the required service level at the second stage. An integrated model for planning the production in these hybrid flow-shop production systems types is developed. The objectives of optimizing the production and inventory costs at the two stages of the system, including the warehouse, while satisfying customer demands, are considered. An algorithm to solve the suggested model is described in detail, and a solution is provided for a real world case, which has inspired the study. A computational study to measure {{the performance of the}} approach was also carried out and the results are reported...|$|E

With the use this method is possible to solve design problems between seasons storage of firewood without capital construction costs, the definition of load-store and used machines for a year...|$|R
50|$|In 1957, a {{plan was}} drawn up to re-build {{virtually}} {{the whole of}} the site. The project involved {{the construction of a new}} triphenylmethane dyes plant (building 75), a new laboratories block (building 80), a milling and blending plant (building 81), an intermediates plant (building 74) and a new azo dyes plant (building 48). An additional azo dyes plant (building 46) was added to the scheme in 1965 to replace (building 187). Extra warehousing was also added to the site including a new <b>intermediates</b> <b>warehouse</b> (building 71) and a new raw materials warehouse (building 50).|$|R
30|$|The Spatial Logistic Appended Module (SLAM) is {{integrated}} in the European model SCENES (trans-boundary macroscopic {{model for the}} EU). During the development, basic ideas and experiences from the Dutch model SMILE were consulted. SLAM is designed to evaluate the effects of changes in logistics and in the transport system across Europe. Therefore, a major application is the detection and location of distribution centres in Europe. Accordingly, SLAM ought to give a more accurate picture of transport flows involving logistical matters. The model considers changes in distribution structures (e.g., number and location of utilized <b>intermediate</b> <b>warehouses</b> for distribution) and incorporates them into the distribution flows [11, 16, 43].|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{manufacturers}} are adopting the so-called supermarket strategy to supply components to the production system. Supermarkets are decentralized storage areas used as <b>intermediate</b> <b>warehouses</b> for parts required by the production system (typically assembly lines). Such a feeding system is widely used in the automotive industry where assembly stations in multiple mixed-model assembly lines are usually refilled {{by means of a}} systematic part replenishment driven by Kanban systems, adopting small trucking vehicles towing some wagons (tow trains). The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a simple but robust framework in order to design the supermarket/feeding system dedicated to complex multiple mixed-model assembly lines. This framework proposes an integrated approach both for long-term (static analytical model) and short-term (dynamic simulation) problems dealing with Kanban and Supermarket systems dedicated to assembly lines, and the tow train fleet sizing and management. This proposed methodology is applied to a case study derived from the Italian automotive industry, and the results highlight the high interrelation between the long and the short term variables that can be evaluated only by an integrated approach that considers both static and dynamic aspects of the problem. The results of this study are then presented and widely discussed...|$|R
30|$|Hämäläinen [36] {{addressed}} {{that there}} are heavy fluctuations in paper deliveries at customer levels, and these variations make logistics planning rather difficult. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>warehouses</b> must be utilized, which is probably one reason for long warehousing times [40, 39]. However, observed from the logistics point of view, the Nordic countries have built well-functioning transportation systems when compared with many other countries located in Europe (World [64]). A probable {{reason for this is}} the long tradition of sea freight transportation in the Nordic countries year-around, from icy to free water conditions. The value of forest products was approximately half of the total exports in 1995, and in 2013, it was still around 20 percent [27]. In many Finnish rural areas, timber harvesting companies together with local paper mills are still some of the most significant employers. The mills are located mainly in the southern parts of Finland and close to ports, and they need multimodal transportation means to transport paper products to the European markets. The EU market is fairly large, immensely concentrated, and behind a short sea route when analyzed from the Nordic logistics perspective. The Nordic paper mills are normally integrated sites, which consist of pulp processing, paper manufacturing, and a complex mixture of converting, warehousing, transportation and cost management functions. This value chain covers the process functions from timber yard to end customers ([35, 36] and c).|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the role}} of the economy in various spheres among food is on the rise. Fuzzy supply chain {{management}} is one of the modern attitudes that lead to reduce system costs, food spoilage, losses in shipping products and to reduce inventory levels. Management of fixed costs including the cost of distribution centers construction and variable costs such as transportation costs, maintenance, shortages, manpower, deterioration of food products and others will be concluded. Queue model structure which used in this study obeys from M/G/ 1 queue that arrival rate Poisson probability distribution function and the service rate have the general probability distribution function. In this study, fuzzy supply chain has been analyzed in three levels. The suppliers are in first level, the distribution centers are in second level and the local warehouse (consumer) is located in third level. The structure of objective function of the presented optimization model is based on the profit maximization which the resulted benefit from products sale obtained from the difference between total revenues and total costs. The appropriate results can be obtained from the model analysis. To determine the transfers volume of suppliers to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>warehouses</b> (distribution centers) as well as determining the volume of transfers from the central warehouse to local warehouse. The model is solved by using Maple 12 software. Finally, the proper results are stated. This approach causes the appropriate management of market, increasing of custome...|$|R

In this paper, we proposed utilities made available in Linux to make use in pattern matching. With this approach, the grep family utilities are proposed to apply on data warehouse, and to warehouse the result into a temporary file. This <b>intermediate</b> or temporary <b>warehouse</b> can be used to mine the knowledge and hence to practice decision...|$|R
