Until now and in several industrial applications radiographic film analysis are done exclusively by the radiograph inspector who is required to visually inspect each film and detect the presence of possible defects. Consequently the automatization of such a procedure becomes necessary. The new proposed method allows to automatically detect the possible defects through enhancing and sharpening the radiographic images. The multiple simulations carried out show good performance of the proposed detection scheme.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{bacterial}} morphology on virulence and transmission attributes of pathogens is poorly understood. The prevalent enteric pathogen Campylobacter jejuni displays a helical shape postulated {{as important for}} colonization and host interactions. However, this had not previously been demonstrated experimentally. C. jejuni is thus a good organism for exploring the role of factors modulating helical morphology on pathogenesis. We identified an uncharacterized gene, designated pgp 1 (peptidoglycan peptidase 1), in a calcofluor white-based screen to explore cell envelope properties important for C. jejuni virulence and stress survival. Bioinformatics showed that Pgp 1 is conserved primarily in curved and helical bacteria. Deletion of pgp 1 resulted in a striking, rod-shaped morphology, making pgp 1 the first C. jejuni gene shown {{to be involved in}} maintenance of C. jejuni cell shape. Pgp 1 contributes to key pathogenic and cell envelope phenotypes. In comparison to wild type, the rod-shaped pgp 1 mutant was deficient in chick colonization by over three orders of magnitude and elicited enhanced secretion of the chemokine IL- 8 in epithelial cell infections.

In addition, double mutants with either dim 1 -delta or dim 2 - 1 and the endocytosis mutants end 4 - 1 or act 1 - 1 displayed synthetic growth defects, indicating that the DIM gene products function in a common or parallel endocytic pathway. Complementation cloning of the DIM genes revealed identity of DIM 1 to SHE 4 and DIM 2 to PAN 1. Pan 1 p shares homology with the mammalian clathrin adaptor-associated protein, eps 15. Both proteins contain multiple EH (eps 15 homology) domains, a motif proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions. Phalloidin labeling of filamentous actin revealed profound defects in the actin cytoskeleton in both dim mutants. EM analysis revealed that the dim mutants accumulate vesicles and tubulo-vesicular structures reminiscent of mammalian early endosomes. In addition, the accumulation of novel plasma membrane invaginations where endocytosis is likely to occur were visualized in the mutants by electron microscopy using cationized ferritin as a marker for the endocytic pathway.

40|$|One {{key issue}} in {{optimizing}} critical current density (J,) in MgB 2 {{is to determine}} which structural features are the relevant pinning centers. Likely sources of vortex pinning include grain boundaries and intra-grain <b>defects.</b> <b>Detailed</b> studies of the field (H) and temperature (T) dependence of pinning in microstructurally well-characterized samples are required to clarify this point. In this work we {{explore the influence of}} microstructures on the vortex dynamics of MgB 2 bulk samples prepared either at ambient or at high pressure (HIP). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicate the presence of several types of defects. Both un-HIPed and HIPed samples contain a large number of intra-grain Mg(B, 0) 2 precipitates coherent with the matrix, with sizes ranging from 5 nm to 100 nm, which are very well suited to act as pinning centers. The HIP process further improves flux pinning by eliminating the porosity, dispersing the MgO present at the grain boundaries of the un-HIPed samples, and generating dislocations. We also present a detailed study of the T, H and current density (J) dependence of the normalized time relaxation rate, S=dlnJ/dlnt. The intermediate transition temperature T, - 39 K makes MgB 2 attractive for exploring vortex dynamics in a regime of intermediate influence of thermal fluctuations. At low T, we observe a linear S(T), from which we extract a pinning energy U, that is weakly T dependent and decreases monotonically with H. The extrapolations to T=O indicate that the quantum creep rate is small. At higher T, the activation energy U(J) shows the divergent behavior at J -> 0 that characterizes the glassy phases. The results are contrasted with the expectations of various collective creep scenarios to extract information on the characteristics of the pinning centers...|$|R
