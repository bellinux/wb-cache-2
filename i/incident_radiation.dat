Thus the stopping voltage increases. The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy. If the intensity of the <b>incident</b> <b>radiation</b> of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.|$|E

40|$|The {{high-resolution}} {{measurements of}} the spectral solar irradiance {{at the top of}} the Earth's atmosphere by the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite suggest significant deviation of solar radiation from the commonly assumed blackbody radiation. Here, we use these spectral irradiance measurements to estimate the Earth's <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> entropy flux, and examine the importance of a proper estimation approach. The Earth's <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> entropy flux estimated by directly applying the observed spectral solar irradiance into the most accurate Planck expression is compared with that estimated with a conventional approach that uses the Sun's brightness temperature under the assumption of a blackbody Sun. The globally averaged non-blackbody <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> entropy flux {{at the top of the}} Earth's atmosphere equals 0. 31 W m− 2 K− 1 . This value is about 4 times larger than that estimated from the conventional blackbody approach, with the difference comparable to the typical value of the entropy production rate associated with atmospheric latent heat process. Further analysis reveals that the decrease of spectral solar radiation entropy flux with radiation traveling distance, unlike the decrease of spectral solar radiation energy flux with radiation traveling distance, is wavelength dependent, and that the difference between the two estimates can be attributed to the fact that the conventional approach ignores the influence of radiation traveling distance on the spectral solar radiation entropy flux. Moreover, sensitivity study further shows that the distribution of top-of-atmosphere spectral solar irradiance could significantly impact the magnitude of the estimated Earth's <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> entropy flux. These results together suggest that the spectral distribution of <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> is critical for determining the Earth's <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> entropy flux, and thus the Earth's climate...|$|R

25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect helped to propel the then-emerging concept of wave–particle duality {{in the nature}} of light. Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the circumstances. The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light, as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the <b>incident</b> <b>radiation.</b> Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.|$|E
25|$|If the {{frequency}} {{and the intensity of}} the <b>incident</b> <b>radiation</b> are fixed, the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected. The photoelectric current attains a saturation value and does not increase further for any increase in the positive potential. The saturation current increases with the increase of the light intensity. It also increases with greater frequencies due to a greater probability of electron emission when collisions happen with higher energy photons.|$|E

40|$|<b>Incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> is {{influenced}} by many factors, including distance from the equator, altitude, time of year, and season. Absorption of radiation and its scattering are connected with the properties of atmospheric compounds. Cloud cover and air pollution are connected with tropospheric properties. Using our data, the influence of weather changes on the dose of solar irradiance reaching the Earth’s surface and its spectral composition are described. Solar radiation components were measured continuously by a system of sensors situated in the Botanical Garden of the University of Ostrava, Czech Republic. Data for 2014 were chosen for analyses. Days were divided into categories of sunny days and cloudy days according to weather conditions and daily radiation patterns. Percent differences in received solar radiation between sunny and cloudy days were calculated for eight months (Jan, Feb, Mar, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, and Dec). Differences in received solar radiation between clean and polluted days were calculated for sunny and cloudy days in December 2014. Mean <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> during cloudy days was reduced by 61 % from the value for sunny days (in summer months) and by 64 % from the value for sunny days in winter months. The largest influence of clouds on received solar radiation was during September and the smallest was during June. There was a reduction in <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> caused by the atmospheric pollutant PM 10 during winter months.

25|$|Diffuse sky {{radiation}} is solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface {{after having been}} scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the atmosphere.

Concurrent behavioural observations revealed that eland, blue wildebeest and impala did not preferentially orientate north/south during warm summer or cool winter conditions. Instead, all three species preferred to orientate perpendicular to <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> during winter and parallel to <b>incident</b> solar <b>radiation</b> during summer, throughout the day.
