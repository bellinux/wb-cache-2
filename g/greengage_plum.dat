50|$|Sausage, both link and patties, {{and usually}} flavored with sage, {{constitutes}} {{an important aspect}} to a traditional Virginian breakfast. Virginia is also well known for its peanuts which are prepared by either roasting or boiling them. A traditional Virginian dish is peanut soup which has been present in the cuisine since the colonial era. Historically, <b>Greengage</b> <b>plums</b> were common in Virginian cuisine, but their cultivation has been in decline since the eighteenth century, although it can still be found in Virginia occasionally. Instead Damson plums are more often found in Virginian cuisine. It is often used in jams, jellies, preserves, and desserts.|$|R

The pits of <b>greengage</b> <b>plums</b> they cracked between their teeth for the kernels inside. They picked up stray bits of bread the size of peas, apple cores so black and dirty one would not take them to be apple cores, and these things these two men took into their mouths, and chewed them, and {{swallowed}} them; and this, between six and seven o'clock in the evening of August 20, year of our Lord 1902, {{in the heart of}} the greatest, wealthiest, and most powerful empire the world has ever seen.|$|R

50|$|The tourist {{industry}} in Alanya is worth just under 1.1 billion euros per year, {{and is therefore}} the principal industry. The area is further known for its many fruit farms, particularly lemons and oranges, and large harvests of tomatoes, bananas and cucumbers. About 80,000 tonnes of citrus fruits were produced in 2006 across 16840 ha.

40|$|Pectin methylesterase (PME) from <b>greengage</b> <b>plums</b> (Prunus domestica) {{has been}} {{extracted}} and purified using affinity chromatography. Only one band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was obtained, {{with an estimated}} molecular weight of 31 kDa. On isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, two bands with neutral isoelectric points (6. 8 and 7. 0) were detected. The optimal pH and temperature for plum PME activity were 7. 5 and 65 C, respectively. A study of purified plum PME thermostability was performed at pH 7. 5 and 4. 0, indicating a higher thermostability at pH 7. 5 than at pH 4. 0. A biphasic inactivation behavior was observed for thermal treatments (54 - 70 C), whereas its pressure inactivation could be described by a first-order kinetic model in a pressure range of 650 - 800 MPa at 25 C. Purified plum PME {{was found to be}} relatively stable to thermal and pressure (</= 600 MPa) treatments, compared to PME from other fruits...|$|R
5000|$|Greengage fruit are {{identified}} by their round-oval shape and smooth-textured, pale green flesh; {{they are on}} average smaller than round plums but larger than mirabelle plums (usually between 2 and 4 cm diameter). The skin ranges in colour from green to yellowish, with a pale blue [...] "blush" [...] in some cultivars; a few Reine Claudes [...] - [...] such as 'Graf Althanns' [...] - [...] are reddish-purple due to crossbreeding with other <b>plums.</b> <b>Greengages</b> are grown in temperate areas and are known for the rich, confectionery flavour. They {{are considered to be}} among the finest dessert plums.|$|R
5000|$|He {{starts off}} the class with passionfruit, {{but the whole}} class {{complains}} that they've already done passionfruit, in addition to oranges, apples, grapefruit (whole and segmented), pomegranates, <b>greengages,</b> grapes, lemons, <b>plums,</b> mangoes in syrup, and cherries (red and black). The teacher then hits upon the fact {{he has yet to}} teach them about bananas. He tells them, to defend themselves against a man armed with a banana, first, he has to be forced to drop the banana, then the banana has to be eaten, thus disarming him and rendering him helpless. When another student (Michael Palin) asks about a man armed with a bunch of bananas, the teacher tells him to shut up. He demonstrates by asking a student called Mr. Harrison (Graham Chapman, whom the teacher calls Mr. Apricot), to attack him with a banana, but just as Harrison is about to attack him, the teacher shoots him dead, and eats the banana.
