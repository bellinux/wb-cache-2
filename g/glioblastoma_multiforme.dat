40|$|Background/Aim. Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is a key}} modality not only for lesion diagnosis, but also to evaluate the extension, type and grade of the tumor. Advanced MRI techniques provide physiologic information that complements the anatomic information available from conventional MRI. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether there is a correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of intracranial glial tumors and histopathologic findings and whether ADCs can reliably distinguish lowgrade from high-grade gliomas. Methods. This retrospective study included 25 patients with MRI examination up to seven days before surgery, according to the standard protocol with the following sequences: T 1 WI, T 2 WI, FLAIR, DWI and post contrast T 1 WI. Data obtained from DW MRI were presented by measuring the value of ADC. The ADC map was determined by utilizing Diffusion-Perfusion (DP) Tools software. All the patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Histological diagnosis of tumors was determined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The ADC values were compared with the histopathologic findings according to the WHO criteria. Results. The ADC values of astrocytomas grades I (0. 000614 ± 0. 000032 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher (< 0. 001) than the ADC values of anaplastic astrocytomas (0. 000436 ± 0. 000016 mm 2 /s) and the ADC values of <b>glioblastomas</b> <b>multiforme</b> (0. 000070 ± 0. 000008 mm 2 /s). The ADC values of astrocytomas grades II (0. 000530 ± 0. 000114 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher (< 0. 001) than the ADC values of anaplastic astrocytomas (0. 000436 ± 0. 000016 mm 2 /s) and <b>glioblastomas</b> <b>multiforme</b> (0. 000070 ± 0. 000008 mm 2 /s). The ADC values of anaplastic astrocytomas (0. 000436 ± 0. 000016 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher (< 0. 001) than the ADC values of <b>glioblastomas</b> <b>multiforme</b> (0. 000070 ± 0. 000008 mm 2 /s). The ADC values in the cystic part of the tumor for astrocytomas grades I (0. 000775 ± 0. 000023 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher (< 0. 001) than the ADC values of anaplastic astrocytomas (0. 000119 ± 0. 000246 mm 2 /s) and <b>glioblastomas</b> <b>multiforme</b> (0. 000076 ± 0. 000004 mm 2 /s). The ADC values astrocytomas grades II (0. 000511 ± 0. 000421 mm 2 /s) were significantly higher (< 0. 001) than the ADC values of <b>glioblastomas</b> <b>multiforme</b> (0. 000076 ± 0. 000004 mm 2 /s). Concluson. DWI with calculation of ADC maps can be regarded as a reliable useful diagnostic tool, which indirectly reflects the proliferation and malignancy of gliomas. The ADCs maps can both predict the results of histopathological tumor and distinguish between low- and high-grade gliomas, and provide significant information for presurgical planning, treatment and prognosis for patients with highgrade astrocytomas...|$|R
40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: Telomerase is {{an enzyme}} that is {{expressed}} in most human neoplasms and is associated with tumour immortality. Determination of the point in neoplastic transformation at which telomerase is expressed may aid the understanding of tumour pathogenesis and progression. Despite numerous reports on telomerase, few studies have investigated its expression in high grade glial tumours. These studies, performed on archival banked, single brain tumour specimens, have shown conflicting results for oligodendrogliomas and unexpectedly negative results for telomerase expression in high grade astrocytomas, with one third to one half of <b>glioblastoma</b> <b>multiformes</b> being negative. METHODS: 34 rapidly banked glioma specimens taken from patients undergoing gross total surgical resection of their tumours were studied. Telomerase expression was assessed across 3 - 8 sampled regions from each tumour by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Matched mirror image tissue samples were taken for histological analysis of tissue adequacy, statistical correlation of telomerase with tumour histological features, Mib- 1 (a marker for cell cycling) labelling, and p 53 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All five well differentiated oligodendrogliomas were homogeneously telomerase negative and two of three untreated anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were homogeneously positive. In contrast, 10 of 14 high grade astrocytomas showed heterogeneity for telomerase expression across the multiple regions sampled. All <b>glioblastoma</b> <b>multiformes</b> and two of three anaplastic astrocytomas showed at least one region positive for telomerase. When test samples were individually assessed in both oligodendrogliomas and high grade astrocytomas, telomerase expression was associated with Mib- 1 labelling (p < 0. 001). For the entire group, telomerase expression was associated with grade of tumour, age of patient, and vascular endothelial proliferation (all p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: This regional study clarifies that all <b>glioblastoma</b> <b>multiformes</b> are at least focally positive and that telomerase expression correlates with tumour grade in oligodendrogliomas. Homogeneity versus heterogeneity for telomerase expression across multiple regions of oligodendrogliomas versus high grade astrocytomas may provide important preclinical data {{on the use of}} antitelomerase agents in these adult glial tumours...|$|R

These mutations are known to produce (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate from alpha-ketoglutarate. (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to very high concentrations which inhibits the function of enzymes that are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate. This leads to a hypermethylated state of DNA and histones, which results in different gene expression that can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor-suppressor genes.
