Series {{background}} designer Kenny Pittenger said that [...] "the only real difference between the way we draw now {{and the way we}} drew then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season." [...] The crew began the shift while they were working on the episode. Pittenger said that [...] "it was while we were working on 'Pest of the West', one of the half-hour specials, that we made the switch… did you notice?"

Pittenger said [...] "Many neo-Luddites—er… I mean, many of my cohorts—don't like working on them, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> useful. There's no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Impressed by {{her work}} in Dick, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman cast Williams in his directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, {{alongside}} Philip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson. A box office bomb, it was praised in the media, appearing on many top ten critics' lists for 2008. Wendy and Lucy, an acclaimed small-budget, low-key drama directed and co-written by Kelly Reichardt, follows Wendy, a drifter looking {{to start a new}} life, searching for her dog Lucy after a series of setbacks. Unlike others, including the director, Williams did not find the film depressing. [...] "Personally I like seeing those kinds of movies. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> comforting because they make me feel less alone." [...] As the lead actress of Wendy and Lucy, she enjoyed the documentary style of the film. Houston Chronicle writer Amy Biancolli said her performance, [...] "a bare-bones accomplishment of no small heft," [...] was the [...] movie's key. The Toronto Film Critics Association Awards named Williams as the Best Actress, and the film as 2008's Best Movie.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{who have}} {{summarised}} {{the plot of}} Finnegans Wake include Joseph Campbell, John Gordon, Anthony Burgess, William York Tindall, and Philip Kitcher. While no two summaries interpret the plot in the same way, {{there are a number}} of central [...] "plot points" [...] upon which they find general agreement. A number of Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text. As Bernard Benstock highlights, [...] "in a work where every sentence opens a variety of possible interpretations, any synopsis of a chapter is bound to be incomplete." [...] David Hayman has suggested that [...] "For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold." [...] The book's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of [...] "boiling down" [...] Finnegans Wake into [...] "insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases." [...] Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying [...] "we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know. I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest." ...|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret {{to have to say}} I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. While most episodes consisted of two shorts that were about eleven minutes long or specials that lasted the whole episode, certain episodes were made of one full eleven-minute episode, and two shorts, one of which was seven minutes long and the other only four minutes long. The animation was handled overseas in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Throughout the series run, from 1999 to 2008, SpongeBob SquarePants was drawn and animated using pencils. In 2008, the crew shifted and used Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings, instead of pencils. The episode [...] "Pest of the West" [...] was the first episode in the series that the crew used it.

2500|$|Gershwin was {{influenced}} by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn Maurice Ravel was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, [...] "Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> intriguing." [...] The orchestrations in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem {{similar to those of}} Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Paquin (Sookie), Stephen Moyer (Bill), and Alexander Skarsgård (Eric) {{appeared}} on the August 2010 cover of Rolling Stone covered in blood and completely naked. This cover drew criticism due to the image's supposed promotion of sexuality and violence. The show's creator, Alan Ball, stated in the magazine, [...] "To me, vampires are sex...

2500|$|In a bid {{to inject}} an American flavour to the album and bolster its {{commercial}} appeal, Warner Bros. invited singer-songwriter Andrew Gold {{to contribute to a}} revised North American version of the LP. Gold wound up co-writing and playing on three new tracks which appeared on the North American release of Ten Out of 10. [...] This ultimately led to an offer from Gouldman and Stewart to officially join 10cc; an offer Gold declined because of other commitments. Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity. [...] "We should either have tried to change direction, which we didn't, or got someone else in the band, which we almost did. The albums weren't really bad, there was always the integrity, and the production values, but in retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> rather dour, rather lacklustre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is {{the first}} {{official}} portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. [...] "Slowly" [...] he says he realized {{the importance of the}} project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. He was keen to capture Catherine's [...] "charm, serenity and intelligence" [...] and [...] "sparkling green eyes". The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as [...] "quite amenable". According to Emsley, Catherine had asked for herself to be painted naturally, as opposed to her official self." [...] It shows Catherine wearing a bottle green pussy bow blouse, looking straight out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may [...] "look like caricatures". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen {{to draw attention to the}} rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, [...] "I don't have lots of things in the background. I do like large faces, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To have anything else in there is really just an interference." [...] As Catherine's image [...] "is so pervasive", he told the media he needed to go past the image on his mind.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{article in}} Reason magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be {{defeated}} and that [...] "we {{are at war}} with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars." [...] She said, [...] "Islam, period. Once it's defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It's very difficult to even talk about peace now. They're not interested in peace...There comes a moment when you crush your enemy." [...] She reiterated her position that the problem isn't just a few [...] "rotten apples" [...] in the Islamic community but [...] "I'm saying it's the entire basket." [...] She stated {{that the majority of}} Muslims aren't [...] "moderates" [...] and they must radically alter their religion. Max Rodenbeck, writing in The New York Review of Books, notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and [...] "mellowed," [...] as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls [...] "Medina Muslims", meaning the fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims, who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: [...] "These men, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>them</b> to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, than the way either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or Maajid Nawaz says he sees it." [...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E
