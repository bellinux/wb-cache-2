This was calculated by logistic regression analysis. Factors associated with an increased/decreased <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> included position of the cup relative to Kohler’s line, increase in abduction angle of the cup, traumatic and inflammatory arthritis as a primary diagnosis, and patient height. Severe acetabular bone defects were predicted by an increased <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> (odds ratio, OR[*]=[*] 5. 782 for <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> above 200  mm 3 /y), and increased height of the patient (OR[*]=[*] 0. 905 per each centimetre). Predictors of severe bone defects in the femur were the increased <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> (OR[*]=[*] 3. 479 for <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> above 200  mm 3 /y) and placement of the cup outside of the true acetabulum (OR[*]=[*] 3. 292). Variables related to surgical technique were the most predictive of polyethylene <b>wear</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
