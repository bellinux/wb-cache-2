500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask.</b> Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics.

500|$|... "Dances with Smurfs" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on November 11, 2009, in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode marked the final appearance of Gordon Stoltski, the third grade student who read the morning announcements for South Park Elementary. The day after [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] was originally broadcast, four T-shirts based on the episode were made available at South Park Studios, the official South Park website. All four featured Cartman wearing a suit and tie, saying a quote from the episode. These included [...] "I'm not some dog on a leash", [...] "We're in the poop box, my friends", [...] "I'm a normal kid... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> questions", and [...] "I ask questions".|$|E
2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the films}} {{were being made}} as the novels were being published, the filmmakers {{had no idea of}} the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his {{relationship}} with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, [...] "The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'" [...] Kloves also said, [...] "I don't know what compelled me to say this , but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> - how is this possible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then if mother's adorable why {{give her}} up? This I don't mind admitting she did, the day I speak of, {{let me see}} that she feels you've done; but without {{suggesting}} either--not a scrap, please believe--that I should make you any sort of scene about it. Of course in the first place she knows perfectly that anything like a scene would be no use. You couldn't make out even if you wanted," [...] Nanda went on, [...] "that THIS is one. She won't hear us--will she?--smashing the furniture. I didn't think for a while that I could do anything at all, and I worried myself with that idea half to death. Then suddenly it came to me that I could do just what I'm doing now. You said a while ago that we must never be--you and I--anything but frank and natural. That's what I said to myself also--why not? Here I am for you therefore as natural as a cold in your head. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> you--I even press you. It's because, as she said, you've practically ceased coming. Of course I know everything changes. It's the law--what is it?--'the great law' of something or other. All sorts of things happen--things come to an end. She has more or less--by his marriage--lost Mitchy. I don't want her to lose everything. Do stick to her. What I really wanted to say to you--to bring it straight out--is that I don't believe you thoroughly know how awfully she likes you. I hope my saying such a thing doesn't affect you as 'immodest.' One never knows--but I don't much care if it does. I suppose it WOULD be immodest if I were to say that I verily believe she's in love with you. Not, for that matter, that father would mind--he wouldn't mind, as he says, a tuppenny rap. So"--she extraordinarily kept it up--"you're welcome to any good the information may have for you: though that, I dare say, does sound hideous. No matter--if I produce any effect on you. That's the only thing I want. When I think of her downstairs there so often nowadays practically alone I feel as if I could scarcely bear it. She's so fearfully young." ...|$|E

"Yes; {{one or two}} {{repeated}} the very words of the circular to me," [...] said Laura Hilton; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>asked</b> them if they considered the United States able to pay its bonds and {{they were forced to}} admit it was a safe investment, however the money might be used." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 7. Morning. Your new Lord Chancellor(9) {{sets out}} to-morrow for Ireland: I never saw him. He carries over one Trapp(10) a parson as his chaplain, {{a sort of}} pretender to wit, a second-rate pamphleteer for the cause, whom they pay by sending him to Ireland. I never saw Trapp neither. I met Tighe(11) and your Smyth of Lovet's {{yesterday}} by the Exchange. Tighe and I took no notice of each other; but I stopped Smyth, and told him of the box that lies for you at Chester, because he says he goes very soon to Ireland, I think this week: and I will send this morning to Sterne, to take measures with Smyth; so good-morrow, sirrahs, and let me rise, pray. I took up this paper when I came in at evening, I mean this minute, and then said I, [...] "No, no, indeed, MD, you must stay"; and then was laying it aside, but could not for my heart, though I am very busy, till <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> you how you do since morning; by and by we shall talk more, so let me leave you: softly down, little paper, till then; so there--now to business; there, I say, get you gone; no, I will not push you neither, but hand you on one side--So--Now I am got into bed, I'll talk with you. Mr. Secretary St. John sent for me this morning in all haste; but I would not lose my shaving, for fear of missing church. I went to Court, which is of late always very full; and young Manley and I dined at Sir Matthew Dudley's.--I must talk politics. I protest I am afraid we shall all be embroiled with parties. The Whigs, now they are fallen, are the most malicious toads in the world. We have had now a second misfortune, the loss of several Virginia ships. I fear people will begin to think that nothing thrives under this Ministry: and if the Ministry can once be rendered odious to the people, the Parliament may be chosen Whig or Tory as the Queen pleases. Then I think our friends press a little too hard on the Duke of Marlborough. The country members(12) are violent to have past faults inquired into, and they have reason; but I do not observe the Ministry to be very fond of it. In my opinion {{we have nothing to}} save us but a Peace; and I am sure we cannot have such a one as we hoped; and then the Whigs will bawl what they would have done had they continued in power. I tell the Ministry this as much as I dare; and shall venture to say a little more to them, especially about the Duke of Marlborough, who, as the Whigs give out, will lay down his command; and I question whether ever any wise State laid aside a general who had been successful nine years together, whom the enemy so much dread, and his own soldiers cannot but believe must always conquer; and you know that in war opinion is nine parts in ten. The Ministry hear me always with appearance of regard, and much kindness; but I doubt they let personal quarrels mingle too much with their proceedings. Meantime, they seem to value all this as nothing, and are as easy and merry as if they had nothing in their hearts or upon their shoulders; like physicians, who endeavour to cure, but feel no grief, whatever the patient suffers.--Pshaw, what is all this? Do you know one thing, that I find I can write politics to you much easier than to anybody alive? But I swear my head is full; and I wish I were at Laracor, with dear, charming MD, etc.|$|E

40|$|Politeness is of {{particular}} importance in health care contexts, where a number of international agreements and consensus statements formulated by policy makers demand that accord should be maintained, agreement should be solicited, and an attitude of respect be sustained especially when burdensome or intimate matters are being discussed. This paper explores the patterns of politeness in a corpus of material from a UK study of telephone encounters between NHS Direct health advisers and callers presenting with a need for advice over medication. In the opening sequences of interaction the questions that advisers asked the callers often included multiple politeness markers, for example through terms such as "may" and "just", as in "may <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> you?". Politeness markers were often multiply layered, falling into three part structures which occurred when mundane information such as callers' names and telephone numbers were being elicited. Where more intimate ! matters were at stake, advisers minimised imposition and, arguably, undertook rapport building by means of preambles to the question such that the impending intrusion is accounted for, explained or mitigated. A potentially problematic question could also be followed up by further relational work and humour. There are important implications here for understanding politeness itself, especially where it is displayed by an institutionally more powerful or symbolically credentialed interactant towards one who is less advantaged...|$|E
