When the summer solstice has passed, the progressive change in the cause begins to take place the reverse way, but, for some time, the accumulating effect of the mere continuance of the cause exceeds the effect of the changes in it, and the temperature continues to increase.|$|E

The sea breeze exhibits a marked <b>diurnal</b> clockwise <b>rotation</b> {{as a result of}} the Coriolis effect along the unobstructed coastline. The marine advective effect is shown to depend on gradient wind direction. With northwesterly upper level flow the sea breeze tends to be northeasterly in direction and is associated with decreased temperatures and vapor pressure deficits (VPD). With southwesterly upper level flow the sea breeze tends to have a southeasterly direction and less effect on temperatures and VPD. This is attributed to shorter residence times of air parcels over water. For two cases, Colorado State University mesoscale model simulations show good agreement with surface wind observations and suggest that under northwesterly gradient flow, Bowen ratios are increased in the onshore flow along western James Bay, while during southwesterly gradient flow these effects are negligible.

40|$|The ultra-high {{contrast}} capability {{required to}} form images of other solar systems {{is arguably the}} highest-profile challenge in astronomy today. The current high-contrast imaging efforts all require background subtraction to separate the planetary image from {{the image of the}} host star. Background estimation is difficult due to the presence of non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) that change with time. The only major source of information that is not being utilized by current efforts is the random encoding of the planetary image and the NCPAs by the atmosphere on millisecond time-scales. Here, a method that utilizes this information in order to avoid background subtraction altogether is proposed. This new paradigm will allow simultaneous estimation of the time-dependent NCPAs and the planetary image via rigorous statistical inference procedures. These procedures are fully compatible with other information sources, such as <b>diurnal</b> field <b>rotation</b> and spectral diversity. Given the open-ended nature of the background subtraction issues, the ideas explained herein may well the key to imaging habitable planets with Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for the incorporation of the wavefront sensor measurements {{in the context of}} observing modes in which the science camera takes millisecond exposures. In this formulation, the wavefront sensor measurements provide a means to jointly estimate the static speckle and the planetary signal. The ability to estimate planetary intensities in as little as few seconds has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of exoplanet search surveys. Unlike currently used methods, in which increasing the observation time beyond a certain threshold is useless, this method produces estimates whose error covariances decrease more quickly than inversely proportional to the observation time. This {{is due to the fact}} that the estimates of the quasi-static aberrations are informed by a new random (but approximately known) wavefront every millisecond. The method can be extended to include angular (due to <b>diurnal</b> field <b>rotation)</b> and spectral diversity. Numerical experiments are performed with wavefront data from the AEOS Adaptive Optics System sensing at 850 nm. These experiments assume a science camera wavelength λ of 1. 1 μ, that the measured wavefronts are exact, and a Gaussian approximation of shot-noise. The effects of detector read-out noise and other issues are left to future investigations. A number of static aberrations are introduced, including one with a spatial frequency exactly corresponding the planet location, which was at a distance of ≈ 3 λ/D from the star.

The salivary cortisol and ratings of stress, sleepiness and fatigue were followed at three hour intervals in 25 sound engineers: 13 working very fast forward-rotating shifts and 12 working very fast backward-rotating shifts. Cortisol was assessed with radioimmunological kits. The participants reported for stress symptoms and filled sleep diary. Cortisol retained the typical <b>diurnal</b> pattern.

40|$|International audienceIcy {{and rocky}} {{satellites}} {{of our solar}} system display a diverse range of geological defor- mation on their surfaces. Some moons appear old and heavily cratered showing little evidence for recent tec- tonism while other moons are sparsely cratered and young, some showing ongoing geologic activity. The deformation can take the form of small cracks in the surface, large double ridges that can extend for thou- sands of kilometers, and mountain ranges that can reach heights of several kilometers. A key source of stress that can deform satellite surfaces is the diurnal tidal deformation of the moons as they orbit their par- ent planets. Other secular sources of global-scale stress include: volume change induced by the melting or freezing of a subsurface liquid layer, change in the orbital parameters of the moon, a tilt in the axis of ro- tation (obliquity), or rotation of the outer shell of the satellite relative {{to the rest of the}} body (nonsynchro- nous rotation or true polar wander). We turn to computer modeling to correlate ob- served structural features to the possible stresses that created them. A variety of modeling programs exist and generally assume a thin ice shell and/or a multi- layered viscoelastic satellite. The program SatStress, which was developed by Zane Crawford and docu- mented in Wahr et al. [1], computes diurnal and non- synchronous rotation stresses on a satellite. It was later modified into a more user-friendly version with a graphic user interface (SatStressGUI) by Kay and Kat- tenhorn [2].

40|$|The {{surface of}} Europa is {{crosscut}} by a dense network of fractures {{and there are}} many candidate faults for studying past tectonic activity. To better understand the role of tidal stress sources and implications for faulting on Europa, we investigate the relationship between shear and normal stresses at four fault zones: Agenor Linea, Rhadamanthys Linea, Conamara Chaos (Agave/Asterius Linea), and Astypalaea Linea, offering a unique comparison of geological activity of fractures residing in geographically diverse locations of Europa. Assuming tidal <b>diurnal</b> and non-synchronous <b>rotation</b> (NSR) stresses are the primary mechanisms for strike-slip tectonism, here we investigate the mechanics of Coulomb shear failure on Europa. We consider a range of friction coefficients (µf = 0. 2 - 0. 6) and fault depths (0 - 6 km) to evaluate how the failure varies as a function of depth and its dependency on ice friction, geographic location, and fault geometry. Our results indicate that the conditions for failure are not met for any of the lineae subject to diurnal stresses only. Alternatively, models that include both diurnal and NSR stress readily generate shear and normal stress magnitudes that could give rise to shear failure. In general, failure seems to be confined to depths 3 ̆c 6 km for all four linea. Failure is easily activated and extends to depths ranging from 3 - 6 km on all four linea systems when a low coefficient of friction (µf = 0. 2) is applied, but is generally limited to depths 3 ̆c 3 km when a high coefficient of friction (µf = 0. 6) is applied. Based on these results, we infer that the conditions for shear failure are met along at least these four studied linea, and possibly others, on Europa when NSR is adopted as a driving stress mechanism. ...|$|R
3000|$|Equation (25) through (28) collectively {{suggest that}} a faster {{rotational}} speed causes less heat to be conducted into the ground under steady-state conditions. This {{is due to a}} reduction of the vertical temperature gradient at the surface, which is a key factor controlling the magnitude of instantaneous ground heat fluxes (Eq.  21). The vertical gradient ∂T/∂z reaches maximum for a particular illumination when the incident solar flux changes slow enough to stay in equilibrium with the outgoing infrared flux. Increasing the rotational speed causes incident solar radiation to vary faster than the rate of ∂T/∂z formation set by the regolith thermal inertia. As a result, the temperature gradient begins to deviate from its potential strength. The faster the rotation, the greater the deviation of ∂T/∂z would be for a given ground thermal inertia. Thus, increasing a planet’s angular velocity decreases the average ground heat flux via reduction of instantaneous heat fluxes. This causes the ratio in Eq. (24), i.e. the solar flux fraction stored into the ground to remain conservative across planet spin rates. The Law of Energy Conservation dictates that a change in rotational speed may only affect the magnitude of the diurnal temperature amplitude at the surface but not the <b>diurnal</b> mean, i.e. <b>rotation</b> solely acts to redistribute the total available energy between daytime and nighttime hemispheres through the planet’s thermal inertia. As the rotation frequency increases beyond a certain threshold, the surface temperature amplitude begins to shrink, thus flattening the diurnal heat wave without affecting the diurnal mean. This frequency threshold depends on the absolute magnitude of the surface thermal inertia, i.e. the greater the inertia the slower the rotational speed, at which the diurnal temperature amplitude becomes affected. Since regolith-covered ASCOs such as the Moon are expected to have a very small thermal inertia due to a low thermal conductivity of the regolith in vacuum, it takes a rather fast axial rotation to noticeably impact the diurnal temperature amplitude at the surface. This analysis suggests that ω cannot affect η [...]...|$|R
