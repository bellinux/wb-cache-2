500|$|Reimer {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending. Observers have attributed Reimer's success during the 2010–11 season to his ability to maintain his focus and confidence. [...] Reimer tries {{to focus on the}} basics of playing goal, feeling that the fundamentals of goaltending are the key to success, saying [...] "It’s not about making the great save, or making a diving save or playing outside yourself. It’s all about pushing, stopping, and being square and just relying on that. Most of the time <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> out a rebound the defenceman is there so it’s more about being solid fundamentally." ...|$|E
500|$|R. Kelly, portraying [...] "The Remix Killer", {{released}} an unofficial remix {{of the song}} in April 2008. During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me, I'm gonna touch it / But if I touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E
500|$|... "Mother's Day" [...] {{has been}} the subject of several {{retrospective}} reviews of the series. Philip Lewis of Arts.Mic praised the episode as an example of Nickelodeon's potential to cover a serious subject, noting its treatment of [...] "the loss of a parent" [...] as one of the series' most memorable moments. Moviepilot's Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as [...] "ew would have expected to be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies". In their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim, authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could [...] "hit you like a truck <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> it".|$|E

In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Dark Horse LP, the two face labels {{similarly}} alternated {{between a}} picture of Harrison and one of Arias. Combined with the positioning of [...] "Ding Dong" [...] as the opening track on side two, this detail gave {{the impression that the}} song represented Harrison's ushering-in of his future wife and a farewell to Boyd. In the album's inner-sleeve credits, Harrison listed one of the guitarists on the track as [...] "Ron Would <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> him", a reference to Wood's brief affair with Boyd before she took up with Eric Clapton. He also acknowledged Frank Crisp for having provided [...] "spirit" [...] on the recording. In another farewell to the past, Harrison signed the so-called [...] "Beatles Agreement" [...] papers in New York on 19 December, further severing the four former bandmates from the group's legal identity.|$|E
500|$|Describing [...] "Lay You Down" [...] {{as one of}} {{the more}} sensual songs on Versus, Mark Nero of About.com wrote [...] "the best of which might be the piano-laced 'Lay You Down,' on which Usher sings: 'This ain't bump 'n grind, I'll show you what love is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> me lay you down. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe commended Usher's use of falsetto, whilst writing that the song [...] "is an urgent boudoir jam that draws a neat line"– she also commented on how it takes {{inspiration}} from both Prince and Marvin Gaye. Los Angeles Timess Jeff Weiss also pointed out the influence from pop musician Prince, and how Usher is [...] "unctuously cooing about wanting to be the: one who keeps your body warm." [...] "Lay You Down" [...] entered the R/Hip-Hop Songs chart on the week ending November 13, 2010, and peaked at number fifty-six, due to strong radio play.|$|E

500|$|Dark Horses {{inner sleeve}} notes {{were all the}} work of Harrison himself, written on a plane {{at the start of}} the tour. Along with the first Harrison-album credit for FPSHOT, and the now-familiar [...] "All glories to Sri Krsna" [...] dedication, his purple pen records various in-jokes while listing the many {{contributing}} musicians. As well as the confusing inclusion of Boyd and Clapton's names (leading to the assumption that they had actually contributed to the track), the song title [...] "Bye Bye, Love" [...] is juxtaposed with the words [...] "Hello Los Angeles", while [...] "OHLIVERE" [...] would appear to be a reference to Harrison's new lover and future wife, Dark Horse Records secretary Olivia Arias. The latter is also included among the title track's musician credits – her contribution being [...] "Trinidad Blissed Out". Under [...] "Ding Dong", aside from the appearance of [...] "Ron Would <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Let</b> Him" [...] on guitar, Friar Park's original owner, Sir Frank Crisp, is credited for providing [...] "Spirit". Arias's face, in a photo taken by tour photographer Henry Grossman, appeared on the record's side-two face label, while a corresponding picture of Harrison appeared on side one.|$|E
500|$|Wounded by Harrison's {{frequent}} infidelities, Boyd {{left him}} for Eric Clapton in July 1974, having previously {{had an affair}} with another of her husband's guitar-playing friends, Ron Wood of the Faces. Both of these dalliances would also receive attention on the Dark Horse album, which Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, has described as [...] "a musical soap opera, cataloguing rock-life antics, marital strife, lost friendships, and self-doubt". In his rewrite of the Everly Brothers' [...] "Bye Bye, Love", Harrison declared: [...] "There goes our lady, with a-you-know-who / I hope she's happy, old Clapper too"; while his handwritten liner notes listed one of the guest musicians on [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] as [...] "Ron Would <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Let</b> Him". For his part, Harrison had taken up with Starr's wife, Maureen Starkey, and the UK tabloids soon reported him as being romantically involved with model Kathy Simmons (ex-girlfriend of Rod Stewart) as well as Krissy Wood (wife of the Faces guitar player). Shortly before Dark Horses release, Harrison would dodge reporters' questions regarding his private life with a suggestion that people wait for the new album, saying, [...] "It's like Peyton Place." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1988, the State of California Board of Medical Quality charged Landy with {{ethical and}} license code {{violations}} {{stemming from the}} improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients, citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient, along with Wilson's psychological dependency on Landy. Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted {{to one of the}} seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: [...] "was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle." [...] Landy and his colleagues claimed that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 {{at the request of the}} state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson. Others witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Samuels believed, [...] " [...] still has an oral drive.

2500|$|By 1980, when All Shook Up was released, Cheap Trick was {{headlining}} arenas. All Shook Up, {{produced by}} former Beatles producer George Martin, reached No.24 {{on the charts}} and was certified gold, but the album's high-class background did not save it from descriptions like [...] "Led Zeppelin gone psycho". Many fans of the band's earlier albums saw All Shook Up as too weird and experimental. One song from the sessions, [...] "Everything Works <b>if</b> <b>You</b> <b>Let</b> It", appeared on the soundtrack of the film Roadie. This, and [...] "Stop This Game" [...] both missed the top 40, peaking at #44 & #48, respectively. A later reissue of All Shook Up included [...] "Everything Works" [...] as a bonus track.|$|E

Club praised the album as [...] "one {{of the most}} musical and inventive to fly the electronica banner in years," [...] and a [...] "hybridized work that challenges others to follow its dazzling blueprint". Robert Christgau, writing for MSN Music, wrote that [...] "part of its delight is how naturally the disparate parts fit together, but another part is how they add up to phantasmagoria <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> your attention wander (and don't be a tight-ass—you should)". William Rauscher of Resident Advisor noted that the album's [...] "sheer amount of diversity" [...] makes it a [...] "much more challenging affair" [...] than its predecessor, Los Angeles.|$|E

I've done that in the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.” He said that “For thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today we are called by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe.

2500|$|Blackman is {{a rarity}} {{as a female}} jazz percussionist. [...] "In the past, {{there were a lot}} of stigmas {{attached}} to women playing certain instruments", Blackman says. [...] "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway." [...] However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter her. [...] "God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do", says Blackman. [...] "Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> somebody stop you because of their opinions, then the only thing you're doing is hurting yourself.

2500|$|However, the Fu Zi gave a {{completely}} different account of Guo's advice to Cao Cao {{on how to handle}} Liu Bei.

From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, 'If you let the enemy off today, they will become a threat to you for a long time.' You should settle (Liu Bei) soon." [...] At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia's advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, [...] "Liu Bei will rebel <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>let</b> him go!" [...] By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao.
