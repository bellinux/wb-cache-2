States and firms established and implemented policies and strategies <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> as one route to achieving sustainable development. Eco-innovation has been facilitated in developed countries, specifically OECD members and European countries, through action plans. Recently, eco-innovation policies have emerged in developing countries. Thus, this study analyzes eco-innovation policies in Asian countries. Policies related to eco-innovation in 17 Asian countries were investigated using policy instrument categories. National policies <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> were interpreted and compared with development stage classifications. The results indicate that there are similar and different policy approaches to eco-innovation in Asian countries. Given the balance between a technology push (supply side) and a market pull (demand side) in policy instruments <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation,</b> 17 countries were identified by four categories: leaders, followers, loungers, and laggards. The results provide insight for designing national strategies <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> in Asia’s developing countries. Therefore, this research contributes to facilitating and diffusing eco-innovation toward sustainability in Asia...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to understand the role of luxury brands in the diffusion of eco-innovations through the fashion industry, and whether the trickle-down theory applies. Methodology: Structured qualitative interviews were carried out with 13 individuals working in luxury, mass and value market fashion brands to understand the perceptions of how innovation and eco-innovation were generated and diffused through the fashion industry. Rogers’ theory of innovation diffusion was used to analyse and explore interview responses. Findings: The results of the research suggest the interviewees perceived the trickle-down effect as less relevant <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovations</b> than <b>for</b> aesthetic innovations (newness in style, design or colour). It was found that suppliers, competitors and senior management play a more important role in diffusion of eco-innovation. A five point model <b>for</b> successful <b>eco-innovation</b> diffusion within a fashion business was established from the research. Limitations: As the first stage of a larger project, this research focused on one interviewee from the product design and development team within each brand. Further research will be carried out to explore the perceptions of <b>eco-innovations</b> <b>for</b> other functions within the brands. Implications: Fashion brands wishing to adopt eco-innovations can use the five point model to help them establish the right conditions for successful adoption within their business. Originality/value: This research extends existing work on the adoption of sustainability within the fashion industry by exploring the adoption routes <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> and using Rogers’ framework to create a five point model for innovation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to define to which extent {{eco-innovation}} is implemented in the strategies of Nordic cleantech companies and to determine the main drivers for ecoinnovation in this sector. Eco-innovation is a rather new field and most of the research on this subject originates from the book “Driving Eco-Innovation - A breakthrough discipline for innovation and sustainability” published by Fussler and James in 1996. Eco-innovation has been researched through case studies in large and small sized companies (E. Jones, 2001; Popoff & DeSimone 1997 et al.), but not in cleantech companies. My purpose was to study how the concept of eco-innovation is perceived in companies producing clean technology by conducting ten focused interviews with Nordic cleantech companies chosen from the Nordic Cleantech 50 list. The results of the interviews show that the Nordic cleantech companies interviewed for this study have insufficient knowledge of eco-innovation. None of the companies confirmed consciously implementing eco-innovation in their strategies. The study suggests that the drivers <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> listed by the interviewees, including the end-user perspective, are somewhat similar to the drivers for broader innovation. The only driver which is specifically typical <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation,</b> is the goal to save the planet and to play a part in the pollution reduction process. The regulations were not considered as an essential barrier <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation,</b> rather as a framework which ensured a healthy competition environment. In order to remain competitive in the global market, Nordic cleantech companies should implement sustainability in the entire value chain of their products. </p...|$|R

40|$|Eco-innovation {{continues}} to gain support as {{a driving force}} for sustainable development. In this regard, pressing questions include how to stimulate the development, diffusion and use of eco-innovations. Often, firms engaged with eco-innovation need to connect to intermediary organizations (e. g. business development organizations, regional clusters, universities, financers, incubators) {{to get hold of}} necessary resources to tackle the challenges in the innovation process. This article analyses the functions of such intermediary organizations <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> by focusing on public–owned business development organizations and cluster initiatives in the Region Scania, Sweden and North Rhine Westphalia, Germany.   We synthesise at least eight functions of intermediaries <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> as: (i) forecasting and road mapping (ii) resource mobilization (iii) networking and partnerships (iv) commercialization (v) technical consulting (vi) information scanning and distribution (vii) sector branding and legitimation (viii) prototyping and piloting.   The support functions often take a “one-size-fits-all” approach with few initiatives particularly tailored <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovations.</b> This {{can be explained by the}} market complementarity roles of public intermediaries, their resource constraints and the cross-sectoral nature of eco-innovation. Even though, intermediary functions are often appreciated by clients and financers, it is often difficult to establish a causal relation between the support and eco-innovation outcomes, a challenge which undermines the existence of intermediaries themselves. Despite these challenges, potential good practices point to a mix between general “one-size-fits-all” and tailored support activities for different types of eco-innovations and firms. Furthermore, interaction between various types of intermediaries is important since there are often numerous actors and initiatives working with eco-innovation which can confuse firms. When it comes to stimulating radical eco-innovations, a proactive approach to intermediation is particularly important.  SHIF...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{fertilizers}} {{has enabled}} a massive increase in crop production yields. However, this has come with severe negative externalities (e. g., greenhouse gas emission; eutrophication of non-agricultural ecosystems). Eco-innovations are one option {{to reduce the}} environmental impact of fertilizers without compromising fertilizer productivity. Although numerous eco-innovations in the domain of fertilizers are available, they have not yet seen a sufficient adoption rate. In this paper we explore main drivers <b>for</b> adoption of <b>eco-innovations</b> in the German fertilizer supply chain based on empirical investigations at three levels of the fertilizer supply chain: producers, traders, and farmers. We strive to take a "chain perspective" on environmental concerns and knowledge of fertilizer specific eco-innovations. The study was carried out in two steps: initially we conducted exploratory expert interviews with eight actors of the fertilizer supply chain. The statements generated thereby fed into a questionnaire answered by 57 participants stemming from fertilizer production (n = 12), traders (n = 34) and farmers (n = 11) level. Findings suggest that drivers <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovations</b> are perceived differently by the various actors in the fertilizer supply chain. Overall knowledge on eco-innovations decreases downstream the chain. By taking a chain perspective on the adoption of eco-innovation, our paper contributes to the emerging body of literature on drivers <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation,</b> and also maps out managerial implications of fostering the implementation of eco-innovations in the fertilizer supply chain. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{deployment}} of eco-innovations {{in developing countries}} is a key driver of their contribution to efficiently addressing global environmental challenges. It is also a key driver of markets <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> and sustainable economic development. This report explores the barriers developing countries face in accessing markets <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation.</b> It outlines the key considerations policy needs to address to overcome these barriers and discusses {{the extent to which}} selected existing policy mechanisms and organisation have achieved this. The key finding of the report is that the majority of existing policy mechanisms fails to recognise the critical importance of developing indigenous eco-innovation capabilities amongst developing country firms. Indigenous eco-innovation capabilities are essential to facilitating both the diffusion of existing ecoinnovations within developing countries and sustainable economic development based on the adoption, adaption and development of environmentally sound technologies that fit with the bespoke conditions faced by developing countries. Building up eco-innovation capabilities in developing countries requires a shift away from the current focus on large project based approaches which emphasise the transfer of the hardware aspects of clean technologies, towards approaches that emphasise flows of codified knowledge (know-how and know-why) and tacit knowledge. Policy also needs to be improved to better respond to the context-specific technological and cultural requirements which vary inter- and intra-nationally...|$|R

40|$|Many recent papers {{deal with}} {{exploring}} and explaining {{the determinants of}} <b>eco-innovations</b> <b>for</b> different countries supporting the formulation of efficient policy measures to trigger eco-innovation activities of firms. Unfortunately, {{there is still a}} lack of cross-country analyses allowing recognizing “international” stylized facts, but also regional characteristics of eco-innovations. Based on data from the fourth Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for France and Germany, the present paper tries to contribute to fill this gap. Using econometric methods, we are able to detect remarkable similarities between the different determinants of eco-innovation in the two countries. The results confirm the central role of regulation and cost savings as motivations <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation.</b> Furthermore, eco-innovative activities seem to require more external sources of knowledge and information than innovation in general.

40|$|Empirical {{analyses}} of the determinants of environmental innovations were rarely able to distinguish between different areas of environmental impacts. The paper tries to close this gap by employing a new and unique dataset based on the German Community Innovation Survey conducted in 2009. The main purpose of the paper is to test whether different types of eco-innovations (according to their environmental impacts) are driven by different factors. Besides {{a complex set of}} different supply, firm specific and demand factors, the literature on the determinants of environmental innovations accentuates the important role of regulation, cost savings and customer benefits. We find that current and expected government regulation is particularly important for pushing firms to reduce air (e. g. CO 2 ̆ 082, SO 2 ̆ 082 or NO 2 ̆ 093) as well as water or noise emissions, avoid hazardous substances and increase recyclability of products. Cost savings are an important motivation for reducing energy and material use, pointing to the role of energy and raw materials prices as well as taxation as drivers <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovation.</b> Customer requirements are another important source <b>for</b> <b>eco-innovations,</b> particularly with regard to products with improved environmental performance and process innovations that increase material efficiency, reduce energy consumption and waste and the use of dangerous substances.
