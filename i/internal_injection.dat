40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} model studies of stimulated L&# 8594;H transitions. These studies use a novel reduced {{mesoscale}} model. Studies reveal that L&# 8594;H transitions can {{be triggered by}} particle injection into a subcritical state (i. e., P<PThresh). Particle injection alters the edge mean flow shear via changes of density and temperature gradients. The change of edge mean flow shear is critical to turbulence collapse and the subsequent stimulated transition. For low ambient heating, strong injection is predicted to trigger a transient turbulence collapse. We predict that repetitive injection can maintain the turbulence collapse and so sustain a driven H-mode-like state. The total number of particles required to induce a transition by either injection or gas puffing is estimated. Results indicate that {{the total number of}} injected particles required is much smaller than that required for inducing a transition by gas puffing. Thus, we show that <b>internal</b> <b>injection</b> is more efficient than gas puffing of comparable strength.

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the {{dispersion}} of substances in the Great Salt Lake is a requisite towards making responsible management decisions relating to uses of the lake. The lake is a complex terminal body of water and will require a fairly sophisticated mathematical model to properly simulate the dispersion process in the lake. This finite element convection-dispersion model {{is a first step}} towards developing a comprehensive model. The model provides a finite element solution to the two-dimensional convection-dispersion equation and is capable of simulating steady or unsteady-state situations. It utilizes a known velocity field, dispersion coefficients, an introduced substance concentration, substance decay rates, and the region geometry to produce a solution to a given convection-dispersion problem. At the present time, a quantitative verification of the model has not been done, but qualitative use of the model indicates that it yields reasonable solutions satisfying continuity to convection-dispersion problems. Problems tested utilize a uniform flow field and various methods of introducing a substance, such as <b>internal</b> <b>injections,</b> established concentration gradients, and diffusers. This model affords the options in the approximating techniques of linear or quadratic interpolation functions, the Galerkin or 2 ̆ 2 upwinding 2 ̆ 2 methods of weigh ted residuals, and a linearly or quadratically varying velocity field. The model must use a continuous flow field to produce a credible solution. The model does need improvement in its ability to conserve mass in unsteady-state problems when introducing a substance into the modeled region and allowing dispersive transport at the boundaries.

40|$|A magnetron-driven {{microtron}} injector {{has been}} developed for a terahertz free electron laser (FEL). An <b>internal</b> <b>injection</b> system was chosen for the microtron to achieve a compact and inexpensive design. The system provides acceleration of electrons with low emittance and energy spread that is highly important for the FEL. However, the intrapulse instabilities of the accelerated current and the bunch repetition rate inherent to the injection system make problems for the FEL operation. Simulations of the beam dynamics and the transient process allow one to compute the load characteristic of the accelerating cavity and the time-dependent accelerated current. The simulation techniques also allow one to calculate time-dependent deviations of the magnetron frequency in the coupled system of the accelerating and magnetron cavities, as well as deviations in the bunch repetition rate. The computations validate proposed concepts for increasing the intrapulse current stability with appropriate time-dependent variation of the magnetron power and decreasing the bunch repetition rate instability through a simple microwave scheme utilizing the microtron accelerating cavity concurrently as an external stabilizing resonator for the magnetron. The realized concepts and optimization of the microtron regimes using the simulated phase motion of the accelerated bunch provide stable operation of the terahertz FEL, tunable {{in the range of}} 1 – 3  THz with extracted macropulse power up to 50  Watts at the macropulse energy of ∼ 0. 2 [*][*]mJ...|$|E

One class of petroleum hydrocarbon is Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are made up of large group of compounds but semi volatile comprising of 2 to 7 rings are considered toxic to human health. There are 16 semi-volatile PAHs classified as priority pollutants by USEPA some of which have been shown to disrupt endocrine systems in human. Twenty surface sediments were collected along South and North of Penang Bridge (Prai Straits) covering industrial, urban, shipping lane, tourism attraction and fishing grounds.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{quinidine}} on the fast, the delayed, and the Ca 2 +-activated K ' outward currents, {{as well as}} on Na ' and Ca 21 inward currents, were studied at the soma membrane from neurons of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. External quinidine blocks these current components but to different degrees. Its main effect is on the voltage-dependent, delayed K+ current, and it resembles the block produced by quaternary ammonium ions (Armstrong, C. M., 1975, Membranes, Lipid Bilayers and Biological Membranes: Dynamic Properties, 3 : 325 - 358). The apparent dissociation constant is 28 uM at V = + 20 mV. The blocking action is voltage and time dependent and increases during maintained depolarization. The data are consistent with the block occurring ^- 70 - 80 % through the membrane electric field. <b>Internal</b> <b>injection</b> of quinidine has an effect similar to that obtained after external application, but its time course of action is faster. External quinidine may therefore have to pass into or through the membrane to reach a blocking site. The Ca"-activated K+ current is blocked by external quinidine at concentrations 20 - 50 -fold higher compared with the delayed outward K+ current. In addition, it prolongs the time course of decay of the Ca 2 '-activated K+ current. Na ' and Ca " inward currents are also blocked by external quinidine, but again at higher concentrations.

40|$|Rock is a {{heterogeneous}} geological material. When rock {{is subjected to}} internal hydraulic pressure and external mechanical loading, the fluid flow properties will be altered by closing, opening, or other interaction of preexisting weaknesses or by induced new fractures. Meanwhile, the pore pressure can influence the fracture behavior on both a local and global scale. A finite element model that can consider the coupled effects of seepage, damage and stress field in heterogeneous rock is described. First, two series of numerical tests in relatively homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks were performed to investigate the influence of pore pressure magnitude and gradient on initiation and propagation of tensile fractures.

In addition, the heterogeneity of rock, the initial in situ stress ratio (K), the distance between two injection holes, and the difference of the pore pressure in the two injection holes all play important roles in the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures.

However, in many cases, an erroneous response does not necessarily lead to a failure at the application level, even when the discrepancy with the nominal behavior has a long duration. An accurate but high-level modeling of the complete system is therefore required to discriminate real failure conditions from non-critical errors.

By using a negatively biased ring electrode, radial electric field of up to ~ 2 kV·m- 1 was generated in a broad region between the vessel wall and the electrode. The corresponding toroidal E × B drift speed ~ 105 m·s- 1 is comparable to ion sound speed. In contrast, when electrons were injected into a plasma from an electron gun, potential gradient was not effectively generated, due to electron loss.
