Except in isolated cases, the Germans lacked the manpower to enforce a 'food blockade' of the Soviet cities; neither could they confiscate all the food for their own purposes.

5000|$|In {{the light}} of the priory's legal {{foundation}} by St Paul's, the friendship between Christina and Geoffrey seems likely {{to go back to a}} fiction by Matthew Paris (c. 1200 - 1259), who alleged in his chronicle that St Alban's Abbey had clerical competence over the nuns of Markyate. [...] "It would almost seem that in the Gesta Abbatum the origins of Markyate and Sopwell have been confused. There Markyate Priory is said to have arisen through the occupation of the hermitage of Roger, a former monk of St. Albans, by a saintly recluse called Christina, for whom abbot Geoffrey built a house. But in reality Markyate was not dependent on St. Albans, as it would have been if founded by the abbot, and as Sopwell was." [...] "It is therefore altogether very possible that what we are <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>here</b> is a later piece of fiction from a monastic chronicler." [...] A medieval cult of the anchoress Christina is not substantiated by liturgical or historical sources. The existence of the Vita and references to Christina in the Gesta Abbatum Monasterii Sancti Albani still suggest some interest in instigating such a cult in the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E

5000|$|Buford T. Justice is an archetypal (approaching cliche) {{southern}} sheriff: confrontational, foul-mouthed, short-tempered, stubborn, strict, hypocritical, emotional, rough, impatient, fussy, fearless, bold, understanding, feisty, offensive, rowdy, dignified, temperamental, polite, judgmental, ungenerous, silly, thoughtful, intellectual, cranky, {{educated and}} determined. While {{he can be}} charming and professional, his pursuit of the Bandit is a deeply personal affair (compounded by the fact the Bandit absconded with his son Junior's fiancee, embarrassing the Justice family as a whole). Justice tends to take his hunt for the Bandit to the extremes and quite often {{this leads to the}} wrecking of his Squad Cars. He nonetheless remains behind the wheel of the wrecked cars and refers to them as [...] "evidence." [...] He shuns help from other law enforcement departments, often alienating them, so that he can personally apprehend the Bandit. Sheriff Justice is chivalrous towards women and the elderly, yet he has no problem casually roughing up suspects (especially [...] "young punks") to make a point. Indeed, he kicks a would-be tire thief in the backside as [...] "an attention-getter," [...] and he knees another in the groin. When Justice does have someone in custody, he smugly draws the affair out, obviously relishing the fact he is making things as unpleasant as possible for the suspect. Justice takes any skirting of the law very personally, and says emphatically, [...] "What we’re <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>here</b> is a complete lack of respect for the Law!" ...|$|E
50|$|Now, {{because the}} {{systematic}} {{statement of the}} mind’s experience embraces merely its ways of appearing, it may well seem that the advance from that to the science of ultimate truth {{in the form of}} truth is merely negative; and we might readily be content to dispense with the negative process as something altogether false, and might ask to be taken straight to the truth at once: why meddle with what is false at all? The point formerly raised, that we should have begun with science at once, may be answered here by considering the character of negativity in general regarded as something false. The usual ideas on this subject particularly obstruct the approach to the truth. The consideration of this point will give us an opportunity to speak about mathematical knowledge, which non-philosophical knowledge looks upon as the ideal which philosophy ought to try to attain, but has so far striven in vain to reach. Truth and falsehood as commonly understood belong to those sharply defined ideas which claim a completely fixed nature of their own, one standing in solid isolation on this side, the other on that, without any community between them. Against that view it must be pointed out, that truth is not like stamped coin that is issued ready from the mint and so can be taken up and used. Nor, again, is there something false, any more than there is something evil. Evil and falsehood are indeed not so bad as the devil, for {{in the form of the}} devil they get the length of being particular subjects; qua false and evil they are merely universals, though they have a nature of their own with reference to one another. Falsity (that is what we are <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>here)</b> would be otherness, the negative aspect of the substance, which substance, qua content of knowledge, is truth. But the substance is itself essentially the negative element, partly as involving distinction and determination of content, partly as being a process of distinguishing pure and simple, i.e. as being self and knowledge in general. Doubtless we can know in a way that is false. To know something falsely means that knowledge is not adequate to, is not on equal terms with, its substance. Yet this very dissimilarity is the process of distinction in general, the essential moment in knowing. It is, in fact, out of this active distinction that its harmonious unity arises, and this identity, when arrived at, is truth. But it is not truth in a sense which would involve the rejection of the discordance, the diversity, like dross from pure metal; nor, again, does truth remain detached from diversity, like a finished article from the instrument that shapes it. Difference itself continues to be an immediate element within truth as such, in the form of the principle of negation, in the form of the activity of Self.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new application of robust filtering {{in the field}} of robotic rehabilitation. A robust filter is used in a sensor fusion strategy for estimation of the absolute position of an active ankle-foot orthosis, which is part of an exoskeleton being constructed for lower limbs. The signals of a gyroscope, an accelerometer and three force sensitive resistors are used in the sensor fusion strategy. The filter algorithm considers parametric uncertainties in the dynamic matrices, a common characteristic of robotic systems like the active orthosis we are <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>here.</b> Thence, the uncertainty present in the gyroscope model is included in the state-space robust filter to guarantee the reliability of the position estimation. Experimental results obtained from the orthosis are used to validate the proposed estimation procedure based on sensor fusion and robust filtering...|$|E
