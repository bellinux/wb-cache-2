25|$|Sulfatide {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the myelin. Myelin acts as an <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> that surrounds many nerve fibers and increases the speed at which impulses are conducted. When sulfatide is not distributed properly, it can affect the normal physiological conduction of electrical impulses between nerve cells.

Myelin, an <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> surrounding nerve axons, expedites electrical impulses along nerves throughout the nervous system. Thinning of the myelin sheath on the auditory nerve significantly slows the transmission of electrical signals from hair cell to auditory cortex, reducing comprehension of auditory stimuli by delaying auditory perception, particularly in noisy environments.|$|E

25|$|Thin neurons and axons {{require less}} {{metabolic}} expense {{to produce and}} carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have <b>insulating</b> <b>sheaths</b> of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in {{the central nervous system}} and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|R

Four linear arrays (101) extend from a sample holder (102), which houses an elongated, {{transparent}} sample container which is open at both ends, to an end port (103). The distal end of the endport (104) is inserted into an end port assembly (200). The linear arrays (101) comprise a plurality of optical fibers having a first end and a second end, the plurality of optical fibers optionally surrounded by a protective and/or <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath.</b> The optical fibers are linearly arranged, meaning that they are substantially coplanar with respect to one another so as to form an elongated row of fibers.|$|E
50|$|Once {{this initial}} action {{potential}} is initiated, principally at the axon hillock, it propagates {{down the length}} of the axon. Under normal conditions, the action potential would attenuate very quickly due to the porous nature of the cell membrane. To ensure faster and more efficient propagation of action potentials, the axon is myelinated. Myelin, a derivative of cholesterol, acts as an <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> and ensures that the signal cannot escape through the ion or leak channels. There are, nevertheless, gaps in the insulation (nodes of ranvier), which boost the signal strength. As the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier, it depolarises the cell membrane. As the cell membrane is depolarised, the voltage-gated sodium channels open and sodium rushes in, triggering a fresh new action potential.|$|E
50|$|Canine {{degenerative}} myelopathy, {{also known}} as chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy, is an incurable, progressive disease of the canine spinal cord that is similar in many ways to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Onset is typically {{after the age of}} 7 years and it is seen most frequently in the German shepherd dog, Pembroke Welsh corgi, and boxer dog, though the disorder is strongly associated with a gene mutation in SOD1 that has been found in 43 breeds as of 2008, including the wire fox terrier, Chesapeake Bay retriever, Rhodesian ridgeback, and Cardigan Welsh corgi. Progressive weakness and incoordination of the rear limbs are often the first signs seen in affected dogs, with progression over time to complete paralysis. Myelin is an <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> around neurons in the spinal cord. One proposed cause of degenerative myelopathy is that the immune system attacks this sheath, breaking it down. This results in a loss of communication between nerves in lower body of the animal and the brain.|$|E

Color code: black=overall <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath,</b> tan=conductor, white=dielectric, green=current into the diagram, blue=current {{coming out of the}} diagram, dashed black lines with arrowheads=magnetic flux (B). The width of the dashed black lines is intended to show relative strength of the magnetic field integrated over the circumference at that radius. The four stages, A, B, C, and D are: non-energized, low frequency, middle frequency and high frequency respectively. There are three regions that may contain induced magnetic fields: the center conductor, the dielectric and the outer conductor. In stage B, current covers the conductors uniformly and there is a significant magnetic field in all three regions. As the frequency is increased and the skin effect takes hold (C and D) the magnetic field in the dielectric region is unchanged as it is proportional to the total current flowing in the center conductor. In C, however, there is a reduced magnetic field in the deeper sections of the inner conductor and the outer sections of the shield (outer conductor). Thus there is less energy stored in the magnetic field given the same total current, corresponding to a reduced inductance. At an even higher frequency, D, the skin depth is tiny: all current is confined {{to the surface of the}} conductors. The only magnetic field is in the regions between the conductors; only the [...] "external inductance" [...] remains.|$|E

25|$|Demyelination is {{the act of}} demyelinating, or {{the loss}} of the myelin <b>sheath</b> <b>insulating</b> the nerves.

Diffusion around the edge of the <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> was found to have a pronounced effect on the approach curves. In contrast to the findings of earlier studies, tip currents for conducting substrates were found to significantly depend on the tip geometry. The parameters of functions used to describe approach curves in the SECM literature were studied for several tip geometries commonly used experimentally. Simulated results were also used to assess the topographical sensitivity (the rate of change of tip current with respect to tip-substrate distance) and spatial resolution (the ability of the microdisk to distinguish two conducting islands inlaid into an insulating substrate) of the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{implantation}} of electrodes for deep brain stimulation or microelectrode probes for the recording of neuronal activity is always accompanied by the response of the brain’s immune system leading to the formation of a glial scar around the implantation sites. The implanta- tion of electrodes causes massive release of adenosine- 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) and different cytokines into the extracellular space and activates the microglia. The released ATP and the products of its hydrolysis, such as ADP and adenosine, become the main elements mediating chemotactic sensitivity and motility of microglial cells via subsequent activation of P 2 Y 2, 12 as well as A 3 A/A 2 A adenosine receptors. The size and density of an <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> around the electrode, formed by microglial cells, are important criteria for the optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio during microelectrode recordings or parameters of electrical current delivered to the brain tissue. Here, we study a purinergic signaling pathway underlying the chemotactic motion of microglia towards implanted electrodes as well as the possible impact of an anti-inflammatory coating consisting of the interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist. We present a model describing the formation of a stable aggregate around the electrode due to the joint chemo-attractive action of ATP and ADP and the mixed influence of extracellular adenosine. The bioactive coating is modeled as a source of chemo-repellent located near the electrode surface. The obtained analytical and numerical results allowed us to reveal the dependences of size and spatial location of the <b>insulating</b> <b>sheath</b> on the amount of released ATP and estimate the impact of immune suppressive coating on the scarring process...|$|E

50|$|Another hazard, {{susceptibility}} of {{the brain}} to shearing forces, plays a role primarily in injuries that involve rapid and forceful movements of the head, such as in motor vehicle accidents. In these situations rotational forces such as might occur in whiplash-type injuries are particularly important. These forces, associated with the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the head, are smallest {{at the point of}} rotation {{of the brain}} near {{the lower end of the}} brain stem and successively increase at increasing distances from this point. The resulting shearing forces cause different levels in the brain to move relative to one another. This movement produces stretching and tearing of axons (diffuse axonal injury) and the <b>insulating</b> myelin <b>sheath,</b> injuries which are the major cause of loss of consciousness in a head trauma. Small blood vessels are also damaged causing bleeding (petechial hemorrhages) deep within the brain.|$|R
