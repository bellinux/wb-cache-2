5|$|NY275 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern alignment between the village of Bolivar and the hamlet of <b>Friendship.</b> At the time, NY275's northern terminus was at its intersection with West Main Street (now CR20) in <b>Friendship,</b> then part of NY63 and later NY408. In the early 1970s, the portion of the Southern Tier Expressway near <b>Friendship</b> was completed and opened to traffic. However, NY275 continued to end at NY408 in <b>Friendship</b> until the mid-1970s when NY408 was truncated to Nunda. As a result, NY275 was extended a short distance northward to meet the Southern Tier Expressway at exit29.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} has indicated that shy adolescents are more motivated to form <b>friendships</b> online than to form <b>friendships</b> offline. Little is known about whether having <b>friendships</b> found exclusively online may impact self-esteem and forming offline <b>friendships</b> for these adolescents. This study therefore aimed to provide insight into the moderating role of shyness in the longitudinal interplay between <b>friendships</b> in online and offline contexts in early adolescence. Adolescents and their friends (193 girls, 196 boys; Mage[*]=[*] 13. 29) were followed with three consecutive measurements with intervals of eight months. Results showed that particularly for shy adolescents, having friends exclusively online predicted increases in self-esteem. Self-esteem, in turn, was found to predict forming more <b>friendships</b> found both offline and online and forming more <b>friendships</b> found exclusively offline. Thus, findings supported the social compensation perspective that shy adolescents may benefit from having friends exclusively online, as these <b>friendships</b> may increase self-esteem, thereby facilitating the formation of <b>friendships</b> found partially and completely offline...|$|R
40|$|Cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> {{are likely}} to {{constitute}} an important feature of children’s social world in multiethnic educational settings such as London secondary schools, which are now more ethnically diverse than ever. This thesis extends current knowledge on cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> by examining the prevalence and effects of such <b>friendships</b> on various developmental outcomes among ethnic majority and minority status children attending multiethnic schools. While Chapter 1 presented {{an overview of the}} literature on cross-ethnic <b>friendships,</b> following empirical chapters (Chapters 2 - 6) demonstrated findings from a comprehensive 3 -wave school study conducted in London schools. Chapter 2 focused on patterns of cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> and showed specific relationships between ethnic diversity, ethnic group and cross-ethnic <b>friendships.</b> Chapter 3 indicated that cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> are related to positive outcomes such as psychological well-being, resilience and academic outcomes and moderate the negative effects of discrimination. Chapter 4 showed that interpersonal processes of self-disclosure and ideal self affirmation mediated the associations between cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> and well-being measures. Chapter 5 examined anxiety and intimate self-disclosure in both same- and cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> and indicated that reduced anxiety is a unique process whereby cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> relate to positive outcomes. Chapter 6 revealed longitudinal associations between cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> and positive outcomes and showed that these associations are stronger in classrooms with lower classroom racial tension. Finally, Chapter 7 investigated cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> in the light of motivational outcomes; results of two experimental studies indicated that mental representations of cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> may have effects on future career and academic choices of ethnic minority young adolescents. Overall, findings show that cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> are important resources for children, providing benefits for the development of psychological, academic and motivational outcomes among children. The role of cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> on positive development is discussed in the light of ethnic group differences and implications for school policies in multiethnic settings (Chapter 8) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a project {{exploring}} the <b>friendships</b> of children and adults in ‘super-diverse’ (Vertovec, 2007) localities in London, England, examining whether and how <b>friendships</b> are made and maintained across ethnic and social class differences. The aim is to identify what <b>friendships</b> reveal {{about the nature and}} extent of ethnic and social divisions in contemporary multicultural society. Drawing on interviews with children and their parents, this paper analyses affective parental responses to their children’s <b>friendships,</b> identifying instances where parents seek to manage these <b>friendships.</b> We identify the importance of the ‘ease of similarity’ for many parents concerning their children’s <b>friendships,</b> and the relative lack of concrete practices amongst parents to support their children’s <b>friendships</b> across difference. However, we also note parental support for living in super-diverse localities and children attending schools therein. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} how Swarthmore men’s entitlement is sustained through {{their experience of}} emotional homosocial <b>friendships.</b> Most research on young heterosexual men’s <b>friendships</b> focus on how they align with conventional understandings of hegemonic masculinity. The pervasive trope on men’s <b>friendships</b> {{is that they are}} fraught with competition, homophobia, and tend to suppress non-hegemonic meanings. As a result, men are attributed to having <b>friendships</b> that involve the doing of things and not experiencing intimate <b>friendships</b> through talking. Emergent research points to a shift in millennium men’s masculinities, that are premised on negotiating the appropriation of non-hegemonic practices as opposed to negating them. This study locates the hybridization of hegemonic masculinity in men’s <b>friendships</b> on Swarthmore’s campus. Through in-depth interviews and participant observation I find that Swarthmore men’s <b>friendships</b> possess emotive qualities that challenge their conventional understandings. Unfortunately, these <b>friendships</b> are used to escape the disciplinary power of the Swarthmore community and simultaneously, to create spaces where they can legitimize male entitlement and reproduce gender inequality...|$|R

40|$|For decades, social {{scientists}} have investigated how children make friends across social group divides (Graham, Taylor, & Ho, 2009; Howes, 2009).

In the current study, I extend this paradigm and investigate <b>friendships</b> across socioeconomic lines.

40|$|Provocative {{ideas about}} the nature, development, and effects of children’s <b>friendships</b> were {{included}} in the lectures of Harry Stack Sullivan, which were edited and published in the 1950 s. Sullivan emphasized the love, intimacy, and collaboration found in the close <b>friendships</b> that children form around 8 to 10 years of age. Later research has shown that close <b>friendships</b> have both a positive dimension, with features such as intimacy, and a negative dimension, with features such as rivalry. However, close <b>friendships</b> do not emerge suddenly at 8 to 10 years of age. Rather, the closeness of children’s <b>friendships</b> increases gradually during middle childhood and adolescence. Recent studies suggest that having close, high-quality <b>friendships</b> increases children’s success in the peer social world. Having high-quality <b>friendships</b> could magnify the positive or negative influence of friends with positive or negative characteristics, but this hypothesis needs to be evaluated more thoroughly in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{hypothesized}} that extended intergroup <b>friendships</b> improve outgroup attitudes in particular {{for people with}} initially unfavorable outgroup attitudes, and for those without direct intergroup <b>friendships.</b> In contrast, building on structural balance theory, {{it was hypothesized that}} extended contact in small social settings may also be related to less favorable outgroup attitudes. Hypotheses were tested longitudinally among Dutch students (n = 661) who just entered multiethnic middle schools. Adopting concepts from social network analysis, an extended intergroup <b>friendships</b> measure was proposed which excludes direct intergroup <b>friendships.</b> Multilevel panel analyses showed that the effect of extended intergroup <b>friendships</b> with Turkish peers did not depend on whether adolescents had direct Turkish friends. Extended intergroup <b>friendships</b> were only related to improved outgroup attitudes for students with relatively unfavorable outgroup attitudes. Additional analyses show, in line with structural balance theory, that extended <b>friendships</b> within classrooms can also be related to outgroup attitudes negatively for students with favorable initial attitudes...|$|R

5000|$|William Rawlins has {{examined}} the role of relational dialectics in regard to <b>friendships.</b> The tension of instrumentality v. affection {{was found to be}} the most central to this type of relationship. Within <b>friendships,</b> importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for [...] "real" [...] <b>friendships</b> opposed to instrumentality for [...] "fake" [...] <b>friendships.</b> Aristotle's [...] "friendship of virtue" [...] notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point. The dichotomy of instrumentality v. affection cannot be ignored within <b>friendships,</b> as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends. This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of <b>friendships.</b> While this remains true, the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v. affection is applied.|$|R
