40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} general {{problem of how}} one comes to know culturally distinct patterns of communication. Building on earlier cultural pragmatic work that is both derivative of, and informed by Dell Hymes 2 ̆ 7 (“Models”) assumptive base in thinking about communication as systematic, social, and culturally distinct, this study examines the Finnish term asia [matter-of-fact] as a cultural term for talk. This study asks: how do participants conceive and identify through the asia term, and enact their world of communication? ^ Through applying the terms for talk framework (Carbaugh, “Fifty”) this study is organized generally to explore reports and enactments of communication practice in some Finnish adult education scenes. This is done through an examination of nonverbal acts, norms, ritual, and a vacillating form. This study proceeds to examine “listenership” in which a set of nonverbal acts such as keeping the face straight, minimal gestures, and maintaining a diverted or shifted gaze are acts deemed proper conduct to the asia [matter-at-hand]. Speech deemed {{to be of the}} asia style must be direct, factual, goal-directed, controlled and unemotional, and not be “personal face” but “informational face. ” Asia talk as a sequence of acts and its ritualized event structure show infocentrism to be the sacred principle celebrated in asia talk. ^ Central findings of this dissertation point to infocentrism as a Finnish culturally based (a) relational code with a preference for an informational face, (b) idea of clearness where persons are motivated to understand, (c) an aesthetic of simplicity in expression describing the necessary degree of performability in speech. ^ Two models for identifying are found in a vacillating form, one infocentric, and the other personalistic. The principle finding shows how asia, as a Finnish cultural term for talk, constructs a sense of infocentric communication, sociality, and personhood that, in some <b>educational</b> <b>scenes,</b> places informational concerns over, and against, personalistic and expressive concerns. ^ Through a comparative examination of other cultures we see how cultural terms for talk enter as resources for understanding cultural variability in communication conduct. This study further points to how educators and students can be prepared for studies abroad or teaching in multicultural contexts. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper I have {{examined}} the content of Henry Caldwell Cook's original teaching method, "Play Way" in order to explore how effectively drama {{can be used in}} language education. Cook developed W. H. D. Rouse's Latin and Greek teaching in Direct Method and introduced theatre into English education {{for the first time in}} England and Wales in the 1910 's. Cook attempted to make the best use of drama as an educational means, recognizing its nature and advantages to reap the fruits. His teaching method exerted a far-reaching influence on the subsequent <b>educational</b> <b>scenes</b> in England and Wales, named as "The Play Way Method," in which all subjects were systematically dramatized. From the very beginning Cook used drama for English (as a first language) teaching. However, Cook never restricted the function of his "Play Way" to only an English teaching medium. Students performed written literary works so as to truly appreciate them, but at the same time the theatrical experience itself was significant in helping them prepare to be good citizens in society. Here drama is "the one means that is an end itself" for English education. Cook's "Play Way" comes from his belief of the theatricality of human existence. Teachers in English education as a foreign language in Japan are paying less attention to holistic aspects of learners as human beings and more to superficial communication-oriented teaching focusing on learners' practical needs. The application of Cook's theatrical method "Play way" to English education in Japan must be stimulating and effective in saving the present problematic situations. On one hand, teachers should attempt to have students appreciate literary texts containing the highest level of rhetoric which must be stimuli for their language learning : on the other hand, teachers must have students experience acting and performances which will contribute to their future social lives based on theatricality. In that case it is needless to say that the teachers are required to correctly understand the nature of theatre, including the two-layers of meaning in theatre at the dramatist's and the characters' levels. It is in the very two-layer structure of meaning that lies the strong point of theatre which teachers use in language education. この論文は， Henry Caldwell Cookの独自の教授法である“PlayWay"の内容を吟味し，いか に効果的に演劇を言語教育に利用できるかを探るものである. Cookは， 1910 年代のイギリスCEnglandand Wales) において， W. H. D. RouseのDirectMethod によるラテン・ギリシャ語教育を発展させ，はじめて国語(英語) 教育に演劇を導入した. Cookは， その本質と効果を認識した上で，演劇を一つの教育的手段として最大限に利用しようとした. 彼の 教育法は，劇形式をすべての教科の指導に使用する“ThePlay Way Method"として，イギリスのそ れ以降の教育に多大な影響を与えた. 最初から， Cookは演劇を英語(国語) 教育のために使った. それにもかかわらず， Cookは“PlayWay"の働きをただ単に国語教育の手段に限定したわけではな い. 学習者たちに文学作品を真に鑑賞する力を身につけさせるために，実際にそれを演じるという 方法で学ばせたが，その演劇的な経験は同時に，彼らがよき市民になるための準備を手助けすると いうことにおいて意味をもった. つまりは，演劇は，国語教育において， I手段であると共にそれ自 体目的」でもあった. この教育における「それ自体目的」とするCookの演劇観は人間存在の演劇性 についての彼の信念にからきているように思われる. 日本における外国語としての英語教育は，学習者の人間としての総体性よりも，むしろ学習者の 実用的ニーズを優先したコミュニケーション中心の教育に実りなく終始してきた. Cookの提唱し た演劇的手法である“PlayWay"を日本の英語教育に応用することは，そのような問題をはらんだ 現在の状況を打開するのに効果的で、あるにちがいない指導者は，外国語学習のために最大の刺激 となるはずのレトリックをもっ文学作品を学習者に真に鑑賞させると同時に，演劇性に基づいた社 会生活に貢献するものとして，実際にそれを演じる経験をさせなければならない. その際指導者に は，劇作家と登場人物レヴェルの意味の二重構造を含む，演劇の本質の正しい把握が求められるこ とは言うまでもない. その本質の理解があってはじめて，言語教育において演劇が十全に利用でき ると考えられるからである...|$|R

50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, rhetoric was fast losing the remains of its former importance, and eventually was taken out of the school curriculum altogether {{at the time of the}} Separation of State and Churches (1905). Part of the argument was that rhetoric remained the last element of irrationality, driven by religious arguments, in what was perceived as inimical to Republican education. The move, initiated in 1789, found its resolution in 1902 when rhetoric was expunged from all curricula. At the same time, Aristotelian rhetoric, owing to a revival of Thomistic philosophy initiated by Rome, regained ground in what was left of Catholic education in France, in particular at the prestigious Faculty of Theology of Paris, now a private entity.

40|$|For SAR {{education}} {{a combination}} of theoretical lectures and practical image analysis is advisable. Using podcasts for assisting the dissemination of background knowledge and retail video gaming consoles for the practical lectures in combination is proposed. SAR simulators are widely used for teaching SAR image analysis, because they can deliver pre-defined SAR images. Even more, they can provide thousands of different images of the same object. Learning by using these training databases of simulated images is normally not very effective, due to the monotonous presentation of the data.

Geography in Egypt has been the center of these waves and fluctuations for more than fifteen years, although it takes about half this time in other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and even the United States of America. The result of this negligence of learning geography in the secondary schools in Egypt is reflected in the level of students and its effect on their knowledge about the geography of their country when they joined (present and not past) the university.
