The Holkham Estate, had been built up by Sir Edward Coke, the founder of his family fortune.

His fourth son, John, inherited the land and married heiress Meriel Wheatley in 1612. They made Hill Hall their home and by 1659 John had complete ownership of all three Holkham manors.

6000|$|I {{have now}} to make one or two {{comments}} on the impressions conveyed by the style of your narrative. Sufficient prominence has not, in my opinion, {{been given to the}} extraordinary destiny of my father, the true hero of a nineteenth century romance. I, who have seen society reluctantly accepting works of genius for nothing from men of extraordinary gifts, {{and at the same time}} helplessly paying my father millions, and submitting to monstrous mortgages of its future production, for a few directions as to the most business-like way of manufacturing and selling cotton, cannot but wonder, as I prepare my income-tax returns, whether society was mad to sacrifice thus to him and to me. He was the man with power to buy, to build, to choose, to <b>endow,</b> <b>to</b> sit on committees and adjudicate upon designs, to make his own terms for placing anything on a sound business footing. He was hated, envied, sneered at for his low origin, reproached for his ignorance, yet nothing would pay unless he liked or pretended to like it. I look round at our buildings, our statues, our pictures, our newspapers, our domestic interiors, our books, our vehicles, our morals, our manners, our statutes, and our religion, and I see his hand everywhere, for they were all made or modified to please him. Those which did not please him failed commercially: he would not buy them, or sell them, or countenance them; and except through him, as [...] "master of the industrial situation," [...] nothing could be bought, or sold, or countenanced. The landlord could do nothing with his acres except let them to him; the capitalist's hoard rotted and dwindled until it was lent to him; the worker's muscles and brain were impotent until sold to him. What king's son would not exchange with me--the son of the Great Employer--the Merchant Prince? No wonder they proposed to imprison me for treason when, by applying my inherited business talent, I put forward a plan for securing his full services to society for a few hundred a year. But pending the adoption of my plan, do not describe him contemptuously as a vulgar tradesman. Industrial kingship, the only real kingship of our century, was his by divine right of his turn for business; and I, his son, bid you respect the crown whose revenues I inherit. If you don't, my friend, your book won't pay.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{understand}} how entrepreneurial founders of born global firms acquire, transform and deploy new knowledge resources for early internationalization. Adopting a dynamic capabilities view and using a sample of high-tech B-to-B firms, we report that the new firm’s early entry into international markets is executed through three transitionary phases. Founders transform the operational capabilities they <b>endow</b> <b>to</b> the firm, develop dynamic capabilities for use in opportunity exploitation, and deploy these to develop knowledge-intensive products that they take to chosen niche markets. The paper contributes to the B-to-B global marketing literature by uniting it with born global and INV internationalization research, and elucidating the three phases through which founders manage early internationalization. The roles played by entrepreneurial founders and particular capabilities are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} of an originally non-porous 1 D coordination polymer as monolithic gel, xerogel and aerogel is reported {{as an alternative}} method to obtain novel metal-organic porous materials, conceptually different to conventional crystalline porous coordination polymer (PCPs) or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Although the work herein reported is focused upon {{a particular kind of}} coordination polymer ([M(μ-ox) (4 -apy) 2]n, M: Co(II), Ni(II)), the results are of interest in the field of porous materials and of MOFs, as the employed synthetic approach implies that any coordination polymer could be processable as a mesoporous material. The polymerization conditions were fixed to obtain stiff gels at the synthesis stage. Gels were dried at ambient pressure and at supercritical conditions to render well shaped monolithic xerogels and aerogels, respectively. The monolithic shape of the synthesis product is another remarkable result, as it does not require a post-processing or the use of additives or binders. The aerogels of the 1 D coordination polymers are featured by exhibiting high pore volumes and diameters ranging in the mesoporous/macroporous regions which <b>endow</b> <b>to</b> these materials the ability to deal with large-sized molecules. The aerogel monoliths present markedly low densities (0. 082 – 0. 311 g·cm− 3), an aspect of interest for applications that persecute light materials...|$|E
40|$|Aboriginality, Race and the State: The Minority Debate and National Hegemony in Australia. A. A. Yengoyan. This paper {{examines}} {{the status of}} Aboriginal Australians in relation to post-contact history {{and the development of}} the national Australian State. Traditional Aboriginal essentialisms of blood and land persist across this time span and define critical arenas in which cultural, economic and political aspects of the contemporary minority debate occur. The long standing silence {{on the role of the}} Aboriginal populations within this history of Aboriginal and European contact is being broken by both Aboriginals and scholars. It is argued here that blood (race), and the spirituality which Aboriginals <b>endow</b> <b>to</b> place and space—land—are traditional cultural foundations that provide the basis of Aboriginality as an ideology and a highly visible political culture. Blood is a pivotal, essential and irreductible factor in what constitutes Aboriginality; land is the source of all being and existence, and the return to ancestral lands and tracks is vital for all Aboriginal peoples. Thus, land rights issues and policies, most recently the "Marbo " decisions, are at the center of the assertion of Aboriginal identity and political activism and are manifest at local, national, and global levels, and it is local essentialisms, such as blood and land, which cement and bind societies to their past and define their future.

40|$|Motivation and Aim: Huge sets of gene {{expression}} pro fi les (GEP) data, in particular for farm animals, collected {{over the last}} two decades. The main aim of such data-sets is to search for {{gene expression}} differences associated with economically valuable traits. In an earlier article we showed subdivision of GEP into constitutive and variable part according to the individual changes in gene expression. Interesting, that difference in expression of genes from the second group can be possibly explained by effect of paratypic component [1]. In a present research we checked a possible in fl uence of genetic component on association between regulation of gene expression and development of economically valuable traits. It was done by association analysis of mononuclear promoter polymorphisms in key genes of lipid metabolism, control of myogenesis and meat and fat characteristics of two different industrial pig crosses. Methods and Algorithms: Polymorphic promoter regions of Acyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) [- 233 T/C], Leptin (LEP) [- 11606 C/T; - 12109 T/A], Myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD) [- 38 G/A], Myogenic factor 6 (MYF 6) [- 375 T/C], Osteopontin (OPN) [- 24 G/A] were genotyped with KASPar system directly from genomic DNA of two- and three-breed pig crosses of Italian selection. Phenol – chloroform extraction was used to isolate DNA from muscle tissue. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 17. 0 software (SPSS statistics; 2008) Statistica 7. 0 (StatSoft Inc, 2004), MedCalc Software 12. 0. 3, Microsoft Excel. Results: The frequencies of alleles and genotypes showed noticeable differences for all studied SNPs. Among all genes except Lep two-breed cross differ from three- breed cross with higher level of heterozygosity. Most of associations (P< 0, 05) were observed for promoter SNP of Opn gene and back fat, characteristics of meat production of two-breed cross. Interesting, that revealed associations of production traits and SNP genotypes in promoter region are breed and sex-dependent. Associations between all SNP genotypes and average daily gain in different periods of ontogenesis were observed only for three-breed cross pigs (P < 0, 05,P < 0, 01,P < 0, 001). Conclusion: Received data demonstrates that associations between genotypes in promoter region of key genes of lipid metabolism, genes controlling myogenesis and production traits among analyzed groups of pigs depend on sex, genetic background (two- and three-breed crosses) and stages of development. Obviously complicated character of genetic component in fl uencing regulation of the key genes of economically valuable production traits can <b>endow</b> <b>to</b> variable part of GE...|$|E
