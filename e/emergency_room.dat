50|$|The senior {{emergency}} department {{is a recent}} hospital innovation to build separate geriatric <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> for older adults akin to pediatric <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> designed for children. The trend comes {{in response to the}} nation's rapidly growing population of older adults and overcrowding of {{emergency department}}s. Typically, geriatric <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> are designed to reduce anxiety, confusion and the risk of falling. This includes elder-friendly lighting, softer colors, noise abatement features, handrails and non-reflective flooring to reduce missteps. Research has found that the noise, chaos and crowding of typical <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> has a negative impact on older patients.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze {{neighborhood}} variations {{in the use of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> (ERs) as settings for primary care within Oklahoma County, part of the Oklahoma City MSA. The location of patients taken from a sample of ER records in four large hospitals were aggregated to census tracts. Tract visition rates were estimated and related to the socio-economic character and the relative location of the tracts for two periods [...] 'physicians' office hours' and 'non-office hours'. The results show that for the city as a whole primary care use in <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> is associated with the socio-economic status and relative location of a residential area. Tracts with lower socio-economic status have higher rates of <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> use for primary care than those of higher status. This relationship is true both during physicians' office hours as well as during the times their offices are closed. When visitation rates are analyzed separately for individual hospitals, location rather than neighborhood socio-economic characteristics is paramount. It was concluded that while primary care visits to <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> are higher in lower socio-economic status neighborhoods, and that this {{is a function of the}} more accessible location of <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> to these neighborhoods as well as to socio-economic effects on use. ...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{place of}} first {{complaint}} to a physician is a hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> Up to 94% of those suffering from SCSFLS are initially misdiagnosed.

5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} rates of sudden cardiac death in US Hispanics and African Americans. METHODS: Data on coronary deaths occurring outside of the hospital or in <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> were examined for 1992. RESULTS: In 1992, 53 % (8194) of coronary heart disease deaths among Hispanic Americans 25 years of age and older occurred outside of the hospital or in <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms.</b> The percentage was lower among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks. Age-adjusted rates per 100, 000 were lower in Hispanics than in non-Hispanic Whites or Blacks (Hispanic men, 75; White men, 166; Black men, 209; Hispanic women, 35; White women, 74; Black women, 108). The percentages dying outside of the hospital or in <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> were higher in young persons, those living in nonurban areas, and those who were single. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage and rate of coronary deaths occurring outside of the hospital or in <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> were lower in Hispanics than in non-Hispanics; African Americans had the highest rates. Further research is needed on sudden coronary death in Hispanic Americans and African Americans...|$|R

5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the {{resources}} to deal with large increases {{in the number of}} patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> visits {{a year in the}} United States.

Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E

5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E

5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain.
