5|$|Wentworth Arthur Matthew {{founded the}} Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919. Matthew was {{influenced}} by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> in North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular. When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartheid}} government greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> However, {{it did not}} have the resources to effectively enforce censorship of written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it. Less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s. Thus music and performance {{played an important role in}} propagating subversive messages.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although {{attempts have been made}} to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{researchers}} {{claim that}} the spirituals sung by followers of Blue 'Oss in advance of May Day originate in the groundswell of support <b>for</b> American <b>black</b> <b>people</b> that was extremely strong {{in areas of the}} UK where Methodism was predominant. Among other events, this led to the Manchester textile workers voting to refuse to make uniforms for the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. Minstrel songs and spirituals were performed to gain support <b>for</b> American <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> and the researchers claim the [...] "blacking up" [...] of traditional guise dancing was adapted to show this support.|$|R
25|$|Previously Houston {{had only}} one {{secondary}} school <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> Colored High School. In 1925 the school board stated that it would build a new black high school due to the increasing black population. The Houston Informer stated that the schools need to be named after prominent black people from the city and/or other successful black persons. The new high school was to be named after Jack Yates, a prominent black Houstonian, and the original colored high school was renamed Booker T. Washington High School.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the riot}} the next day, the {{governor}} had sent in thousands of militia to restore order. At least seven people died, there was US $200,000 in property damage--mostly to the Black neighborhoods--and the riot caused a Black exodus from Springfield. Four people {{died as a result of}} the riots: two black residents were the victims of lynching, and two white residents who were attempting to engage in the lynchings died after being shot by either the National Guard or armed African Americans acting in self defense. It is believed that more African Americans died during the violence, but only the two victims of public lynching are documented. The riot was a factor in the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) by both Blacks and Whites. Its goal was to improve civil rights <b>for</b> <b>Black</b> <b>people,</b> and to educate all the populace and improve race relations.|$|E

500|$|In {{his speeches}} at the Militant Labor Forum, which was {{sponsored}} by the Socialist Workers Party, MalcolmX criticized capitalism.

He rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, expressing the opinion that black people should defend and advance themselves [...] "by any means necessary".

500|$|Essentially a ballad, [...] "Respect" [...] is an uptempo and {{energetic}} song, which took [...] "a day to write, 20 minutes to arrange, and one take to record", according to Redding. Aretha Franklin covered this song in 1967 {{and with it}} topped the Billboard R and Pop charts. Redding shouted to a woman for more respect, while Franklin ironically countered the song and transformed it into a [...] "feminist hymn". The next song is an energetic version of Sam Cooke's ballad, [...] "Change Gonna Come"; a protest against racial segregation and disrespect <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> [...] "Down in the Valley" [...] is a funky cover of Solomon Burke's original, with whom Redding toured before the recording.

He played for the club with [...] distinction between 1929 and 1938, while continuing as a member of the West Indies Test team in tours of England and Australia. Although his record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than in other cricket, he helped to establish a uniquely West Indian style of play.

[...] Under Christophe's rule it was also possible <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> to rent their own land or work in government, and agricultural workers on plantations could make complaints to the royal administration about working conditions. These ex-slaves may also have sometimes had a choice about what plantation they would work on—but they could not choose not to work, and they could not legally leave a plantation they were [...] "attached" [...] to.

500|$|Prior to the {{legislative}} accomplishments of the Civil Rights Movement, black travelers in the United States faced major problems unknown to most whites. White supremacists had long sought to restrict black mobility, and were uniformly hostile to black strangers.

They were subjected to racial profiling by police departments ("driving while black" [...] or [...] "DWB"), sometimes seen as [...] "uppity" [...] or [...] "too prosperous" [...] just for the act of driving, which many whites regarded as a white prerogative.

He praises Asher for his [...] "skillful understanding of film aesthetics", calling particular attention to Asher's choice of camera angles in the scene in which Mr. Brockway first meets Lisa. Metz argues that the Stephens' foyer is an important location in the series, and that this importance is exemplified in the episode both by the scene of Mr. Brockway's first encounter with Lisa {{as well as in}} the epilogue when Mr. Brockway revisits the house and apologizes for his prior racism. Metz criticizes Mr. Brockway's [...] "magically found soft-heartedness" [...] as a [...] "paternalistic approach to liberal racial tolerance [...] implies that only white patriarchs have the cultural authority to declare that racism is wrong." [...] Metz further argues that the episode problematically figures Samantha as the protector and provider <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> a role that he says Samantha also fills in [...] "Samantha at the Keyboard", another Bewitched episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its social implications, the musical integration of soul and country into popular format by Charles changed and revolutionized racial boundaries and restraints in music, {{and contributed to the}} historical Civil Rights Movement.

[...] In paying tribute to the magazine's selection of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, which had selected Charles at #2, singer-songwriter Billy Joel noted the album's racial and social impact in an article for Rolling Stone, stating [...] "here is a black man giving you the whitest possible music in the blackest possible way, while all hell is breaking loose with the civil rights movement." [...] Another article for Rolling Stone, written in honor of Charles and his achievements, later stated that through his Modern Sounds recordings, Ray Charles [...] "made it acceptable <b>for</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> to sing country & western music, in the process doing almost as much to break down racial barriers as did the civil-rights movement." ...|$|E
