40|$|OBJECTIVE: Skin imaging plays a {{key role}} in many {{clinical}} studies. We have used many skin imaging techniques, including the recently developed capacitive contact skin imaging based on fingerprint sensors. The aim of this study is to develop an effective skin image retrieval technique using <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform,</b> which can be used on different types of skin images, but with a special focus on skin capacitive contact images. METHODS: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a useful technology to retrieve stored images from database by supplying query images. In a typical CBIR, images are retrieved based on colour, shape, and texture, etc. In this paper, texture feature is used for retrieving skin images, and <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform</b> is used for texture feature description and extraction. RESULTS: The results show that the Gabor wavelet texture features can work efficiently on different types of skin images. Although <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform</b> is slower compared with other image retrieval techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform</b> is the best for retrieving skin capacitive contact images and facial images with different orientations. <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform</b> can also work well on facial images with different expressions and skin cancer/disease images. CONCLUSION: We have developed an effective skin image retrieval method based on <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform,</b> that it is useful for retrieving different types of images, namely digital colour face images, digital colour skin cancer and skin disease images, and particularly, grayscale skin capacitive contact images. <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform</b> can also be potentially useful for face recognition (with different orientation and expressions) and skin cancer/disease diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract. An {{efficient}} facial {{representation is}} a crucial step for successful and effective performance of cognitive tasks such as object recognition, fixation, facial recognition system, etc. This paper demonstrates the use of <b>Gabor</b> wavelets <b>transform</b> for efficient facial representation and recognition. Facial recognition is influenced by several factors such as shape, reflectance, pose, occlusion and illumination which make it even more difficult. <b>Gabor</b> wavelet <b>transform</b> is used for facial features vector construction due to its powerful representation {{of the behavior of}} receptive fields in human visual system (HVS). The method is based on selecting peaks (high-energized points) of the Gabor wavelet responses as feature points. This paper work introduces the use of <b>Gabor</b> wavelets <b>transform</b> for efficient facial representation and recognition. Compare to predefined graph nodes of elastic graph matching, the approach used in this paper has better representative capability for <b>Gabor</b> wavelets <b>transform.</b> The feature points are automatically extracted using the local characteristics of each individual face in order to decrease the effect of occluded features. Based on the experiment, the proposed method performs better compared to the graph matching and eigenface based methods. The feature points are automatically extracted using the local characteristics of each individual face in order to decrease the effect of occluded features.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{technique}} by which high-intensity feature vectors extracted from the Gabor wavelet transformation of frontal face images, is combined together with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for enhanced face recognition. Firstly, the high-intensity feature vectors are automatically extracted using the local characteristics of each individual face from the <b>Gabor</b> <b>transformed</b> images. Then ICA is applied on these locally extracted high-intensity feature vectors of the facial images to obtain the independent high intensity feature (IHIF) vectors. These IHIF forms {{the basis of the}} work. Finally, the image classification is done using these IHIF vectors, which are considered as representatives of the images. The importance behind implementing ICA along with the high-intensity features of Gabor wavelet transformation is twofold. On the one hand, selecting peaks of the <b>Gabor</b> <b>transformed</b> face images exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation selectivity. Thus these images produce salient local features that are most suitable for face recognition. On the other hand, as the ICA employs locally salient features from the high informative facial parts, it reduces redundancy and represents independent features explicitly. These independent features are most useful for subsequent facial discrimination and associative recall. The efficiency of IHIF method is demonstrated by the experiment on frontal facial images dataset, selected from the FERET, FRAV 2 D, and the ORL database.

40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{explosion}} of digital images on the Web, content-based retrieval {{has emerged as a}} significant research area.

Radon and <b>Gabor</b> <b>transforms</b> are both powerful techniques that have been widely studied to extract shape-texture-based information. The combined Radon-Gabor features may be more robust against scale/rotation variations, presence of noise, and illumination changes. The objective of this paper is to harness the potentials of both <b>Gabor</b> and Radon <b>transforms</b> in order to introduce expressive binary features, called barcodes, for image annotation/tagging tasks.
