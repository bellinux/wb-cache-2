5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E

25|$|In Finland, {{the title}} of tohtori or doktor denotes holder of a {{research}} doctorate comparable to a PhD. Until recent years it was customary to first become licentiate (after the master's degree), which meant persons becoming doctors already had <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> long academic career. Nowadays doctorate programs are available after the master's degree in many fields and becoming doctor at young age is much more common.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} groups of workers at Cornwall Iron Furnace: Free labor, indentured {{servants}} and slaves. Slavery was legal in Pennsylvania until it was gradually abolished beginning in 1780 when the importation of slaves was prohibited. The management of the furnace <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of trouble with the staff of indentured servants. These unskilled workers were imported from Germany, England and Ireland. Many of them worked at Cornwall {{for a short time}} before eventually running away.|$|E
25|$|Though only an {{auxiliary}} ship, General Taylor {{appears to have}} <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> colorful career. After her Seminole War service, she played a cameo role in the notorious trial and sentencing of abolitionist Jonathan Walker. In the mid-1840s, General Taylors crew included two future Engineers-in-Chief of the Navy. After being burned and rebuilt in 1846, the steamer later {{played a role in}} the foiling of a planned 1849 filibuster invasion of Cuba. General Taylor was sold by the Navy in 1852.|$|E

25|$|Den forgyldte Krone, {{under the}} Dutchman Arent Henriksen, was sent {{in advance to}} test the waters, but {{returned}} after waiting in vain for Dyppel. Dyppel's vessel Færøe had departed on October 20, 1671 and did not arrive until May 23 the following year. This delay {{was caused by a}} leak incurred in November 1671, and subsequent docking in Bergen for 3 months, during which time Dyppel <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> task with controlling the crew which consisted partly of indentured servants and partly of convicted felons conscripted for duty.|$|E
25|$|Although Scrope did {{not have}} a {{particularly}} active political life, his brother Charles Thomson did. With much advising behind the scenes, Charles rose to political prominence and was eventually made Lord Sydenham. As part of his new duties, he was engaged in much economic and political discourse, for which he <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> sound mind. He was responsible for implementing the Union Act in 1840, which united Upper Canada and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada. Eventually Charles became Governor General of Canada until his death in 1841.|$|E
25|$|Collishaw <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few close escapes {{during the}} war. His plane was hit often by bullets, but Collishaw escaped unscathed in the air. His {{aircraft}} {{was shot down}} {{out of control and}} crashed several times. Once, lost in a fog, he landed on a German aerodrome, and was actually taxiing to the tarmac when he saw German insignia on the grounded planes, and German troops rushing out to arrest him. He opened his throttle wide, took off, and escaped. On another occasion, his goggles were shattered by an enemy bullet. He once had his controls disabled by German machine gun fire from the ground and had to ride out the flight until the aircraft crash-landed – luckily near the British front trenches.|$|E

25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> collection and he thought he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrians in Persia armed {{themselves}} {{under the}} command of General Agha Petros, who had been approached by the Allies to help fight the Ottomans. They put up a resistance, and Agha Petros' volunteer army <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few successes over the Ottoman forces and their Kurdish allies, notably at Suldouze where 1,500 Assyrian horsemen overcame the far larger Ottoman force of over 8,000, commanded by Kheiri Bey. Agha Petros also defeated the Ottoman Turks in a major engagement at Sauj Bulak and drove them back to Rowanduz. Assyrian forces in Persia were greatly affected by the withdrawal of Russia from the war and the collapse of Armenian armed resistance in the region. They were left cut off, with no supplies, vastly outnumbered and surrounded.|$|E
25|$|In September 1977, McCluskey and Humphreys put {{together}} the seven-piece (three singers, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboard player) Wirral group The Id, whose line-up included drummer Malcolm Holmes and McCluskey's girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the Merseyside area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> following on the scene, and one of their tracks ("Julia's Song") was included on a compilation record of local bands called Street to Street. Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side-project called VCL XI (named after a misreading of a valve from the diagram on the back cover of Kraftwerk's Radio-Activity album; the name of valve is actually written with Arabic numbers, VCL 11, and not Roman numerals). This side-project allowed them to pursue their more bizarre electronic experiments, often working with tape collages, home-made kit-built synthesisers, and circuit-bent radios.|$|E

25|$|Despite the tribulations {{created by}} the Second World War, Richmond was able to {{maintain}} a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. Dyer was a fearsome presence {{in his role as}} playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action {{a few weeks before the}} match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944, when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.|$|E
25|$|Australia has <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{well-known}} soap operas, {{some of which}} have gained cult followings in the UK, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two-and-a-half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes. Stylistically, these series most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in-studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences. Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.|$|E

To further stimulate sales the dust-jacket also emphasised Waugh's experiences of madness, which brought him a large correspondence from strangers anxious to relate their own parallel experiences—"the voices... of the persecuted, turning to him as confessor".|$|E
