5000|$|The Big Hollow is a wind eroded <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> located to {{the west}} of Laramie, Wyoming in the United States. It is the second largest wind eroded {{depression}} in the world. The Big Hollow is the largest <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> in North America. The Big Hollow is younger than the alluvial valley floors which now form its boundaries and is therefore of Late Pleistocene age (less than 250,000 years). During most of the Pleistocene the Big Hollow was actually a hill composed of soft sedimentary bedrock. The material making up this former hill was much more easily eroded than the alluvial valley floors which bounded it to both the north and south. Eventually, the hill was washed and blown away and then the wind continued to erode a <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> into the soft bedrock. Eventually the former hill became lower than the river channels which once flowed around it. The geologists call this [...] "topographic reversal". The Qattara Depression near Cairo, Egypt is the largest. The Big Hollow is an undrained basin and is 11 mi long, 4 mi wide, and up to 200 ft deep. Oil was discovered in 1917 and the basin has been productive since. [...] The basin is listed on the National Natural Landmark list.|$|E
50|$|In troughs, the structure’s {{topography}} can accelerate {{flows and}} form jets {{that result in}} maximum erosion along the <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> floor and laterally expand {{the slopes of the}} blowout. Additionally, when the wind flows on top of the blowout’s lateral walls, sediment transport is at its maximum in the middle axis of the trough depositional lobe, leading to formation of a parabolic dune. Although some studies like Hesp and Prinlge (2001) noted that wind flow that was oblique to blowouts’ orientation became pulled into the depression due to a zone of low pressure at the <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> and was steered parallel to the orientation of the trough blowout. However, in Smyth, Jackson, and Cooper’ study (2014), little evidence supported that wind flow was being steered along the axis of the blowout, rather the flow remained constant to the direction that it was flowing before or showed other characteristics like turbulent separated flows.|$|E
50|$|The lake lies on {{the eastern}} edge of the gently undulating Bassendean Dune System, which is formed mainly of leached grey-white {{siliceous}} sands. It is a <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> bordered by low sand ridges up to five metres high. On the north-eastern edge of the lake there is a rocky sandstone outcrop. The lake bed sediments are up to two metres thick and include clay, silt, peat, diatomite, marl and freshwater limestone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deflation</b> <b>basins,</b> called blowouts, are hollows {{formed by}} the removal of {{particles}} by wind. Blowouts are generally small, but may be up to several kilometers in diameter.|$|R
40|$|The genesis, erosion, {{transport}} and deposition of aeolian dust particles have major implications in environmental management, soil-landscape processes and landscape evolution. A {{key component of}} this study is an understanding of the generation of these aeolian dust materials in the source areas.

40|$|Late-middle to late Holocene dune {{sediment}} that overlies Pleistocene {{lacustrine sediment}} marks {{the onset of}} xeric conditions in the Estancia Valley, central New Mexico. Incised into the underlying lacustrine sediments, the modern <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> are enclosed by parabolic dunes composed of clay and gypsum derived from the underlying sediment. Located on the in-facing dune slopes of the <b>deflation</b> <b>basins,</b> the most striking geomorphic feature of this dune complex are numerous elongated scars. These relict scars document a geomorphically distinct earthflow event. Arroyos that cut into flow scars expose eolian earthflow sediment overlying lacustrine deposits. In the zone of depletion, erosional-flow evidence reveals flamed-load structures, channels, and rip-up clasts of lacustrine sediments. In the zone of accumulation, depositional flow evidence reveals laminations and lithic-rich horizons derived from the underlying lacustrine section. The large number of geomorphically similar earthflow scars are believed to represent a mesic climatic fluctuation within the late Holocene of the Estancia Valley...|$|R
5000|$|The anabranch flows {{approximately}} 460 to 488 km {{from its}} offtake on the Darling River south of , southward to the Murray River, west of [...] There are approximately twenty ephemeral <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> lakes, called the Anabranch Lakes, {{associated with the}} Darling Anabranch of which several are over 5000 ha in size. The Anabranch Lakes and associated marginal vegetation {{are listed in the}} Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia and collectively cover an area of 269000 ha.|$|E
50|$|Saucer blowouts {{indicate}} a deceleration of wind flow along the <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> as the structure widens over time by reversing flows eroding {{the sides and}} expanding upwind. Due to rapid deceleration, saucers tend to form short, wide, radial depositional slopes. When wind flow enters a saucer shape blowout, the wind speed decreases upon entering the blowout and accelerates at the downwind side of the formation. A zone of separation develops along the lee slope as the wind enters the blowout and decrease in speed, yet it accelerates again as it re-attaches at the basin and flow up to the depositional lobe, where sand becomes evacuated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ephemeral <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> lakes (EDBLs) are {{widespread}} {{throughout the}} arid and semi-arid {{regions of the}} Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. They are diverse and productive habitats whose management has generally lead to significant declines in wetland condition. Managers are currently trying to protect or restore these systems without an adequate theoretical framework {{on which to base}} management decisions. Existing conceptual models provide little insight into the effects of any component of the flow regime except flooding and are therefore inadequate. We review the effects of flooding and drying on lakes and use the information to propose a conceptual model that identifies 5 stages in the cycle of flooding and drying. The conceptual model incorporates elements of the Flood Pulse Concept, Trophic Cascade models and the Geomorphic Trophic model as they apply to these highly variable systems...|$|E
25|$|Aeolian lakes are lakes {{produced}} by wind action. They are found mainly in arid environments although some aeolian lakes are relict landforms indicative of arid paleoclimates. Aeolian lakes consist of lake basins dammed by wind-blown sand; interdunal lakes that lies between well-oriented sand dunes; and <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> formed by wind action under previously arid paleoenvironments. Moses Lake, Washington, {{is an example}} of a lake basins dammed by wind-blown sand.|$|R
50|$|Even though they’re more {{influences}} blowout structures have {{on their}} morphology, both types basically tend to have <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> eroded until they reach their non-erodible base level. A study conducted by Hesp (1982) indicates that depositional length isn’t correlated with the eroded depth but rather the blowout width. In other words, as the depositional lobe increases, the blowout width also increases by a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 in saucer blowouts and 1:4 in trough blowouts.|$|R
50|$|Once an {{exposure}} {{has been}} spawned, the morphology of the blowout {{depends on the}} interaction of wind speed and direction with the stabilized dune’s vegetation and topography. There is {{a wide range of}} blowout types that form depending on these factors; however, the scientific community mostly utilizes two types of blowouts: trough and saucer. Although there is no obvious reason why one type is formed rather another in a particular region, saucer blowouts generally have semicircular and saucer shapes while trough blowouts have more elongated shapes with deep <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> and steeper slopes. Nevertheless, both types of blowouts have structures that can affect wind flow within the basin.|$|R
40|$|Deflation basins, or shallow {{depressions}} {{formed by}} wind erosion, {{are found in}} many semi-arid regions around the world. Because these features are topographic lows they become sites of water accumulation and are often associated with wetlands that represent important refugia for biota in dry environments. Despite being important habitats {{little is known about}} the relationship between water and sediment in these features. This study assesses soil geochemical properties from 50 wet-climate and 39 dry-climate deflation basins in Tasmania. The results reveal clear differences between wet-climate and dry-climate <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> soils. Macronutrients typically have higher concentrations in wet-climate soils (with the exception of potassium and calcium) while metals and other trace elements typically have higher concentrations in dry-climate soils. These findings have important implications for wetland biological-soil associations, with high plant productivity likely in wet-climate deflation basins as a result of both favourable nutrient status and better water availability...|$|E
40|$|The early Pleistocene (Blancan) Rita Blanca lake {{deposits}} in the north-western {{part of the}} Panhandle of Texas occupy a <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> cut through the caprock of the Pliocene Ogallala Group. During its maximum develop-ment, Rita Blanca lake had an elliptical shape with a north-south length of about 6 miles and a breadth of about 3. 5 miles. The lower exposures of the Rita Blanca deposits contain an areally re-stricted clay bed with a maximum observed thickness of 65 inches that con-tains abundant fossils representing the lacustrine and riparian environments, and a plains community of mixed sagebrush and grass. The clay bed also contains two types of cyclic lithology: (1) an alternation of light- and dark-colored clay zones {{on the scale of}} centimeters and decimeters, and (2) couplets of light- and dark-colored laminae with an average thickness of 0. 9 mm. The light-colored laminae are rich in calcium carbonate, quartz silt grains, and ostracodes; the dark-colored laminae are composed principally of illit...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the response of}} nutrient concentrations to the drying and re-flooding of ephemeral <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> lakes (EDBL) in western New South Wales, Australia. As lakes dried total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concen-trations increased. TN concentrations increased more quickly and TP concentrations increased more slowly than {{could be attributed to}} evaporation alone. This suggested that additional nitrogen was being sequestered from the atmosphere or sediments and that some phosphorus loss to the sediments was occurring. Concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP), however, declined as lakes dried, suggesting a tighter coupling of nutrient release and uptake mechanisms. Inorganic nutrient concentrations rose sharply in response to re-flooding in all lakes. Evidence is provided to suggest that post-flood nutrient pulses are the net result of both riverine inputs and sediment releases and that the relative significance of either may be influenced by regulation.

40|$|A {{search of}} active <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> near Jal, Lea County, New Mexico {{resulted}} in the discovery of two meteorites, Lea County 001 and 002. Lea County 001 has mean olivine and low-Ca pyroxene compositions of Fa(19) and Fs(17), respectively. These and all other mineralogical and petrological data collected indicate a classification of H 5 for this stone. Lea County 002 has mean olivine and low-Ca pyroxene compositions of Fa(2) and Fs(4), and is unequilibrated. Although it is mineralogically most similar to Kakangari and chondritic clasts within Cumberland Falls, the high modal amount of forsterite makes Lea County a unique type 3 chondrite. Oxygen isotope data for Lea County 002 fall on an 0 - 16 -mixing line through those of the enstatite meteorites and IAB irons, a feature shared by Kakangari...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} minimum age {{estimates for the}} sand units underlying the two largest meteorite deflation surfaces in Roosevelt County, New Mexico, USA, using thermoluminescence dating techniques. The dates obtained ranged from 53. 5 (+/- 5. 4) to 95. 2 (+/- 9. 5) ka, and must be considered lower limits for the terrestrial ages of the meteorites found within these specific deflation surfaces. These ages greatly exceed previous measurements from adjacent meteorite-producing <b>deflation</b> <b>basins.</b> We find that Roosevelt County meteorites are probably terrestrial contemporaries of the meteorites found at most accumulation zones in Antarctica. The apparent high meteorite accumulation rate reported for Roosevelt County by Zolensky et al. (1990) is incorrect, as it used an age of 16 ka for all Roosevelt County recovery surfaces. We conclude that the extreme variability of terrestrial ages of the Roosevelt County deflation surfaces effectively precludes their use for calculations of the meteorite accumulation rate at the Earth's surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between chemical, physical and biological indices was examined in 1, 640 sandhill lakes {{during the years}} of 1954 to 1963. Sandhill lakes are formed by either (1) wind <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> and closed drainages or (2) exposed ground water table basins. Topography of the 20, 000 square mile sandhill region is primarily stabilized dune sand interspersed with wet meadows and pine - cedar - oak river drainage systems. Two-thirds of the area is dune sandhills and one-third occupied by basins, valleys and lakes. All of the lakes are comparatively shallow, the deepest lake being Blue Lake with 13. 8 feet. The average depth of the 1, 640 lakes is around 3. 2 feet. The lakes have a combined area of 65, 800 surface acres ranging in size from 10 to 2, 300 acres. Permanent natural lakes less than 10 acres {{were not included in the}} survey but number about 850. Average rainfall is less than 18. 0 inches a year...|$|R
40|$|Integrated lithostratigraphic and geochronologic {{studies of}} Umm Akhtar Playa, a newly {{discovered}} dry lake located at ≈ N 22 ° 36 ' E 30 ° 18 ' in s. Egypt, indicate the accumulation and rapid desiccation of a sizeable (> 65 km²) standing water body during the Late Quaternary. An optical date of 15, 120 cal yr on basal aeolian sediments {{indicates that the}} <b>deflation</b> <b>basin</b> was mantled with aeolian sands during the Late Pleistocene. Overlying Holocene fluvio-lacustrine muds and gravels attests to the former availability of ponded runoff waters at this now-hyperarid locality. Playa waters were deep and persistent enough to create beach berms composed of well-rounded pebbles, and to sustain cultural activities of Neolithic pastoralists. Twenty-two radiocarbon dates bracket 'wet' phases and concurrent prehistoric human occupation from ≈ 8915 - 8580 ¹⁴C yr BP (9925 - 9544 cal yr BP) and ≈ 7105 - 5955 BP (7878 - 6799 cal yr BP). Increasing amounts of sand were incorporated into the playa after 7500 ¹⁴C yr BP; two optical dates constrain the timing of enhanced aeolian activity from 6720 - 6250 cal yr. These optical data comprise the only existing absolute ages for the emplacement of aeolian sediments during the rapid transition from wet (playa) to dry (sands) conditions in the Holocene. Playa desiccation after 5955 ¹⁴C yr BP (6799 cal yr BP) was marked by cultural abandonment, evaporite precipitation, dune migration, and deflation. The AMS dates from Umm Akhtar Playa fall in the same range as published radiocarbon data from contemporary sites and playas in Egypt and northern Sudan; the main period of enhanced surface water storage from 8100 - 6000 BP {{is linked to the}} intensified Afro-Asian monsoon forced by cyclical astronomical variations. The record from the Arba'in Desert of Egypt and northern Sudan lags the Northern Hemisphere seasonal insolation maximum (centered at 10, 400 BP) and the greatest frequency of African lake highstands, (9500 - 8500 BP) and may result from biogeophysical feedback mechanisms involved with the 'recycling' of water within the continental interior. Sub-millenial variability apparent in the composite record from Egypt likely reflects the influence of atmospheric-oceanic dynamics throughout the Holocene...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few decades great numbers of meteorites have been {{recovered}} from the ice accumulation zones of Antarctica and from the vast Sahara. Although these two great deserts are the two most productive areas, the Southern High Plains in USA (New Mexico and Texas) and Nullarbor Plain, Western Australia have great potential for meteorite recovery. The number of meteorite finds from Roosevelt County, New Mexico alone exceeds 100 in only approximately 11 km{sup 2 } area. Most meteorites from this area have been found on the floors of active <b>deflation</b> <b>basins</b> (blowouts) that have been excavated from a mantle of sand dunes. This area has no apparent fluvial or permafrost activity within the last 50, 000 years, suggesting that only prevailing winds and natural aridity aid in the concentration and preservation of meteorites. The authors investigated these deflation surfaces in Lea County (the SE corner of New Mexico) and neighboring Winkler County, Texas following a prior search in this area which found two chondrites. They found a tiny H 4 chondrite in this search and here they report its mineralogy and petrology along with preliminary data on its exposure history...|$|R
