5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E
5|$|During its rule, Spain quelled various {{indigenous}} revolts. There {{were also}} several external military challenges from Chinese and Japanese pirates, the Dutch, the English, the Portuguese and the Muslims of Southeast Asia. Those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the Philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from Japan to Indonesia. British forces occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764 in {{an extension of}} the fighting of the Seven Years' War. Spanish rule was restored following the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The Spanish–Moro conflict lasted for several hundred years. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century, Spain conquered portions of Mindanao and the Moro Muslims in the Sulu Sultanate formally recognized Spanish sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked {{being under}} Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes {{in order to}} defeat them and to show his courage. This took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 4th century, {{possibly}} around 380. Boz, {{the king of the}} Antes (rex Antorum), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.|$|E

5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, {{the station}} {{building}} was expanded with a porch and additional waiting room. From 1938 to 2000, train services {{were provided by}} the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Netherlands Railways), when the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (Hollandic Iron Railroad Company). In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, approximately 500 Jews from Winschoten were transported by train to the Westerbork transit camp {{and from there to}} Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland, where 446 of them were killed. As a result of the war, the German border at the railway was closed for passenger transport from 1944 to 1954.

5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped {{the idea of a}} five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{shallower}} pits at Aberdare {{proved a}} bigger attraction for prospective mine owners, but once Aberdare became fully worked by the 1860s the Rhondda saw a {{rapid growth in}} development. During the 1860s-1870s 20 collieries opened in the Rhondda Valleys with the leading coalowner in the Rhondda Fach being David Davis of Aberdare, and David Davies in the Rhondda Fawr. In 1865 the output of coal from the Rhondda Valley was roughly one quarter of that of Aberdare; ten years later the Rhondda was producing over two million tons, more than the Aberdare Valleys. These figures would later be dwarfed by the massive excavation rates seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century up {{to the beginning of}} the First World War. In 1913 it was recorded that the Rhondda Valley's output was 9.6 million tons.|$|E

5|$|Most Hungarian lords and the prelates {{opposed the}} {{restoration}} of paganism. They preferred the devout Christian Andrew to his pagan brother Levente, even if, {{at least according to}} Kristó and Steinhübel, the latter was the eldest among Vazul's three sons. The Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, who died in short time, did not oppose his brother's ascension to the throne. The three bishops who had survived the pagan uprising crowned Andrew in Székesfehérvár <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of 1046 or in the spring of 1047. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Andrew was crowned with a crown that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos had sent to him. Nine enamelled plaques from this golden crown were unearthed in Nyitraivánka (Ivanka pri Nitre, Slovakia) in the 19th century. Andrew soon broke with his pagan supporters, restored Christianity and declared pagan rites illegal. According to Kosztolnyik, Andrew's epithets (the White or the Catholic) are connected to these events.|$|E

5|$|The {{core of the}} I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text {{called the}} Changes of Zhou (周易 Zhōu yì). Various modern {{scholars}} suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form.

A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips (recovered in 1994) shows that the Zhou yi was used throughout all levels of Chinese society in its current form by 300 BC, but still contained small variations as late as the Warring States period. It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time; the Rites of Zhou name two other such systems, the Lianshan and the Guizang.|$|E
