30|$|Kennedy[26] invented PSO {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} members of the class of stochastic search techniques in 2001. They are originally defined to solve NP-complete problems. However, two optimization techniques are compared in this section. One advantage of PSO[27] over the GA is its algorithmic simplicity. A GA comprises parameters of its major operators which are crossover, mutation, and elitism. The parameters are population size, probability of mutation, probability of crossover, and selection. However, PSO has one simple operator, velocity calculation. The benefit of having a small number of operators is the reduction of computation and the elimination of the need to select the best operator for a given optimization. Another difference between the PSO and GA is the ability to control convergence. Mutation and crossover rates can subtly affect the convergence of the GA, but not as effectively as the <b>inertial</b> <b>weight.</b> Fogle[27] indicated that the decrease of <b>inertial</b> <b>weight</b> significantly increases the swarm's convergence. This type of control allows its use to determine the rate of convergence, and the final level of stagnation is ultimately achieved. Stagnation occurs in the GA when eventually all the individuals possess primarily the same genetic code. In that case, the gene pool is so homogeneous that crossover has little or no effect, and each successive generation is the same as the first.|$|R

There is a class of experiments, in which an inner observer can distinguish between the state of free fall in a gravitational field and the state of free space by detecting the effect of a proper mass variation.

40|$|We {{consider}} a rapidly rotating, Boussinesq fluid stirred by buoyant anomalies. In {{such a system}} it is known that, {{in the absence of}} a magnetic field, inertial waves whose wave vectors lie normal to the rotation axis play a key role in establishing quasi-geostrophic motion. In particular, buoyant anomalies radiate low-frequency inertial wave packets which disperse along the rotation axis, leading to axially elongated columnar vortices. Here we focus on the influence of an ambient magnetic field on this process, motivated by the dynamics of planetary cores. We find that, once again, the waves responsible for establishing quasi-geostrophic structures have wave vectors normal to the rotation axis; however, these are not conventional inertial waves, but rather hybrid 'inertial-Alfvén waves'. Their frequency equals that of an Alfvén wave but their axial group velocity is half that of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>inertial</b> wave.
