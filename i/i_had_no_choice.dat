5|$|Many battles were fought from January to July 1499, {{and in all}} but a few minor skirmishes, the {{experienced}} Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance to fight a war that even the Swabian counts considered to be more {{in the interests of the}} powerful Habsburgs than in the interest of the Holy Roman Empire proved fatal handicaps. When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, king Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499 in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the Eidgenossenschaft officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus de facto acknowledged it as a separate political entity.|$|E
500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. So, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to make my own}} beats to get that sound."

Falsafi justified these acts by saying that they increased the Shah’s prestige. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to order him, in my own rash way, to refrain from giving further speeches until order was reestablished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following WWF's annual SummerSlam event, Warrior {{was handed}} a letter dated August 26, 1991, from Vince McMahon, saying Warrior was {{suspended}} effective immediately. Among other things, McMahon said, [...] "You threatened {{to stay at}} home thereby not even appearing at Titan's major summer pay-per-view event SummerSlam. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accede to your exorbitant demands. This was a serious mistake on your part". McMahon later testified that the only reason the company agreed to the contract was to [...] "acquiesce to his demands temporarily" [...] to ensure Warrior would perform at the SummerSlam event.|$|E
2500|$|The Beach Boys' {{rigorous}} performing schedule increasingly burdened Wilson, {{and following}} a panic attack {{on board a}} flight from L.A. to Houston on December 23, 1964, he stopped performing live with the group {{in an effort to}} concentrate solely on songwriting and studio production. Wilson explained in 1971: [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> I was run down mentally and emotionally because I was running around, jumping on jets from one city to another on one-night stands, also producing, writing, arranging, singing, planning, teaching—to the point where I had no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest." [...] Glen Campbell was called in as his temporary stand-in for live performances, before Bruce Johnston replaced him. As thanks, Wilson [...] "rewarded" [...] Campbell by producing him with the single [...] "Guess I'm Dumb".|$|E

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930 Grabar {{left all}} his administrative, {{academic}} and editorial jobs, even {{that of an}} editor of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and concentrated on painting. Grabar himself wrote: [...] "I had to choose between the daily mounting administrative burden and creating ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> A personal pension granted by Sovnarkom hastened my retirement." [...] According to Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, the decision was influenced by his mother's death; Grabar the artist shifted his attention to problems of age, aging and death. According to Colton, the change followed a campaign of demolition inside the Kremlin (Chudov Monastery) and all over Moscow. The preservationist Old Moscow Society, unable to influence the authorities any longer, voted itself out of existence, and Grabar's heritage commission was disbanded a few months later. Grabar's influence over impending demolitions was now reduced to writing pleas to Stalin, as was the case of the Sukharev Tower in 1933–1934.|$|E
