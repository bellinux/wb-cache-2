5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
500|$|When I {{recorded}} 'Deja Vu' ... I {{knew that}} even before <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on my album, I {{wanted to add}} live instruments to all of my songs. It's such a balance [...] It's still young, still new and fresh, but it has the old soul groove. The energy is incredible. It's the summer anthem, I pray. I feel it. Rodney Jerkins is incredible, Jay of course is on it, he blessed the song, I'm happy with it.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé crafted most {{songs on}} B'Day through live {{instrumentation}} and diverse techniques. This is evident on [...] "Déjà Vu", which utilizes bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, horns and the 808 drum; it also features rap vocals by Jay-Z. In {{an interview with}} MTV, Beyoncé said, [...] "When I recorded 'Déjà Vu' [...] I knew that even before <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on my album, I wanted to add live instruments to all of my songs..." [...] The album's second single [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] is noted {{for the use of}} a siren in its melody. It was called a song that [...] "shows a harder edge to Beyoncé'ss sound". [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is a crescendo that uses a two-note riff and galloping beats. The song [...] "advises women who have partners with straying eyes to put on sexy dresses and grind on other guys in the club to regain their affections." [...] Meanwhile, the use of the [...] "uh-huh huh huh" [...] vocals and brassy stabs in the song [...] "Green Light" [...] is a direct echo to [...] "Crazy in Love", according to Peter Robinson of The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|... "A {{month before}} <b>I</b> <b>start</b> shooting, <b>I</b> sit with my director, try to {{understand}} how he has visualised the character {{on the screen and}} take notes. Then <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>working</b> on the most basic thing— the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|R
5000|$|... "Julie and <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>working</b> {{together}} in the late '90s at ABT. I danced some of my first roles and debuts with her. I think my favorite ballet with Julie was Romeo and Juliet. You never forget your first Juliet." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the {{original}} album, Glenn Frey wrote of the song, [...] "My anthem to fitness. Jack and <b>I</b> both <b>started</b> <b>working</b> out, eating right and generally tightening up our acts. Having tried nearly every other way to feel good, we've wound up back in gym class. Who'd of thunk it!" ...|$|R
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> at EJ's {{when it was}} a {{strip club}} in about October 1994. A couple of the key staff and I {{convinced}} the owner we would do better as a rock-'n'-roll bar, and decided to launch the new format on [...] 1, 1995. As a future rock club, we decided we needed to rethink our drink selections to suit that clientele. While comparing the prices of the domestic beers, we found that Pabst was cheapest at $33 per keg. The club gained popularity, and Pabst became the drink of choice. On Tuesdays, Pabst was sold at the full price of $1.75, but there was no cover to see the bands. Things kept getting busier. It was suggested that Thursdays become a 'beer bust,' where a patron could get unlimited Pabst between opening at 6 pm and 8 pm, when the room was cleared for the show. By this time, perhaps mid-1996, EJ's had achieved some recognition from touring bands and had a steady influx of national talent, which again increased sales. During busy months, we were getting three deliveries a week and moving more than 40 kegs a month. Years later, Pabst became known as the 'hipster' beer of Portland. There is no way for me to warrant that EJ's decision to make PBR its house beer caused this impact, but I have done so nonetheless, for years.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2010 Attenborough {{asserted}} that his First Life – dealing with evolutionary history before Life on Earth – {{should also be}} included within the [...] "Life" [...] series. In the documentary Attenborough's Journey he stated, [...] "This series, to a degree which I really didn't fully appreciate until <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on it, really completes the set." ...|$|E

500|$|Koufax tried {{one more}} year of {{baseball}} and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years. Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when <b>I</b> really <b>started</b> <b>working</b> out. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> running more. <b>I</b> decided I was really {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|R
5000|$|A talent rep {{associated}} with {{the production of the}} film reported conflicts on set between Smith and Willis, saying of Smith, [...] "He smokes way too much pot. He sat behind his monitor. He didn't interact with the actors. The actors felt they were on their own." [...] Smith defended his use of marijuana while working, claiming [...] "I dealt with every actor who wanted to be dealt with on that set" [...] and pointed to the number of projects he worked on while making Cop Out to counter claims he was unproductive because of marijuana. Smith admitted in an interview that heavy marijuana-smoking had {{become an integral part of}} his work ethic after claiming that he watched actor Seth Rogen on the set of Zack and Miri Make a Porno use marijuana as a tool to become a more creative and productive worker, saying [...] "The moment <b>I</b> <b>start</b> smoking, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>working....</b> That way, no one could ever take it away from you." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Coming {{from the}} North, I knew I was totally ignorant," [...] Dolci wrote later. [...] "Looking all around me, I saw no streets, just mud and dust... <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> with masons and peasants, who kindly, gently, taught me their trades. That way my {{spectacles}} {{were no longer}} a barrier. Every day, all day, as the handle of hoe or shovel burned the blisters deeper, I learned more than any book could teach me about this people's struggle to exist..." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{honestly}} {{feel it is}} {{the most}} beautiful song I've ever been a part of. My goal when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on Leona's new album was to '' chase or be influenced by any of her previous hits—or any songs 've ever done with anyone else—including 'Bleeding Love'. True artists do not look back to previous successes; they look forward to creating new moments and songs the world can connect with in a different way. And that is what Leona has done with 'Happy'. I hope [...] like it as much as we do, and I hope the lyrics hit [...] as hard as they hit me".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{backing band}} {{featured}} players Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner, {{who went on}} to form the Eagles. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on Linda Ronstadt, her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt's version of Browne's [...] "Rock Me On the Water", was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend John Boylan. She said, [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims." [...] Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with David Geffen about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen's Asylum Records label.|$|E
50|$|Dr Wilhelm Brandes was a Senior Specialist (Oberregierungsrat). Dr Brandes {{headed the}} group {{directed}} by Dr Paschke, which worked to penetrate cyphers of Dutch, Swiss, Belgian or French origin. Having worked with Dr Paschke in World War <b>I,</b> he <b>started</b> <b>working</b> for Pers Z S in 1920. Known {{for being a}} capable linguist, archivist and bookbuilder, he had also certain liaison functions for his own group.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} {{fourteen}} I had to leave school and give all my thoughts to the more serious side of life. Yet, strange to relate, it was after <b>I</b> had <b>started</b> <b>working</b> as a “tiler” and dropped some of my old school pals that I took up football. The place where I learned the game properly was Knighton, Radnorshire, and I can well remember a piece of ground where we youngsters used to practice.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a writer}} Walker {{published}} {{a biography of}} Parsons, God's Own Singer, in 2002. He had started the project in 1996 and told Bill Beaver and Steve Wilcock of Triste magazine that [...] "it completely dominated my life. Everything I did hinged upon the availability of working computers and printers so I could work on it whenever I wanted. <b>I</b> even <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on it during my day job, which was really taking the piss. I almost got fired." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear Spot (credited to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound maybe {{just a little too}} blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|E

50|$|While in college, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> for an anti-censorship paper, The Independent. After I left college <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>working</b> there full time. So, I {{never had}} a normal job where I had to be interviewed and wear a suit and tie. I became their {{managing}} editor and also did freelance stuff for Mad magazine. But Mad was aimed at a teenage audience, {{and there was no}} satirical magazine for adults. So {{it was a kind of}} organic evolution toward The Realist, which was essentially a combination of satire and alternative journalism.|$|E

40|$|D eveloping a {{structural}} phylogenetic {{framework for the}} family Tachinidae has been an interest of mine since <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>working</b> on tachinids as a graduate student.

I was surprised at the time that no one had attempted a broad quantitative phylogenetic analysis of the family, and a publication from my thesis work on the Exoristinae (Stireman 2002) became the first such study that I know of. Ever since that initial work, I have been seeking ways to continue working towards the development of a broad and robust phylogeny of Tachinidae (e. g., Stireman 2005, 2010) ...|$|R
