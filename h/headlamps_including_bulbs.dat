50|$|Perennials {{typically}} grow {{structures that}} allow them to adapt to living from one year to the next through a form of vegetative reproduction rather than seeding. These structures <b>include</b> <b>bulbs,</b> tubers, woody crowns, rhizomes plus others. They might have specialized stems or crowns {{that allow them}} to survive periods of dormancy over cold or dry seasons during the year. Annuals produce seeds to continue the species as a new generation while the growing season is suitable, and the seeds survive over the cold or dry period to begin growth when the conditions are again suitable.|$|R
