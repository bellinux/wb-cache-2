500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set, Elizabeth Mitchell responded I <b>guess</b> <b>so.</b> It was creepy because {{it was supposed to}} be underwater, so it was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will miss is just being one on one with another actor. And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [...] because the three of us, it was almost like being on stage. We were able to really work off of each other and I thought you don't usually get that in a TV show.|$|E
500|$|A minute later, the {{controller}} instructed {{the flight to}} turn to the northeast and asked the flight crew if they had enough fuel to be directed fifteen miles from the airport. First Officer Klotz replied, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> thank you very much." [...] At 21:29:11, Klotz asked {{the controller}} if he [...] "can give us a final now...?" [...] The controller said, [...] "affirmative sir turn left heading zero four zero." [...] At 21:30:12, the controller cleared another aircraft for landing. Klotz briefly thought the clearance was directed at Avianca and began to tell Captain Caviedes to change course before the controller corrected him. The controller then asked Avianca to climb to [...] Klotz replied, [...] "negative sir we just running out of fuel we okay three thousand now okay." [...] The controller continued to direct the flight northward, away from the airport. At 21:31:01, the controller said, [...] "Okay and you're number two for the approach I just have to give you enough room so you make it without ah having to come out again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Didn't notice it. I <b>guess</b> <b>so,</b> if she's {{what you}} say. It's what they pay her for, ain't it? Do {{you work in}} a store, too?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hilda, how wonderfully quick {{you are at}} {{reading these}} things! I see you are right; but I could never have <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> much myself from such small premises." ...|$|R
5000|$|Because our {{plaintext}} guesses have {{an effect}} on the key 4 characters to the left, we get feedback on correct/incorrect <b>guesses,</b> <b>so</b> we can quickly fill in the gaps: ...|$|R
5000|$|Ebert's {{version of}} the problem states that all players who guess must guess at the same {{predetermined}} time, but that not all players are required to guess. Now not all players can <b>guess</b> correctly, <b>so</b> the players win if at least one player guesses {{and all of those}} who <b>guess</b> do <b>so</b> correctly. How can the players maximise their chance of winning? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, {{placing her}} white hands on my {{shoulders}} and smiling straight into my face.|$|E
60|$|His heart ached like {{a living}} wound. She had told so little, and he could <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> much. This unknown man who had triumphed seemed to sneer scornfully {{at him from the}} shadows.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{was this}} <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> very far wrong; for as Rob, sitting disconsolate upon the sand, raised his eyes, he saw {{across the desert}} a dark line that marked the {{approach}} of the invaders.|$|E
60|$|The office-boy {{scratched}} his cheek dourly with a ruler. No {{one would have}} <b>guessed,</b> <b>so</b> austere was his aspect, that a moment before her entrance he {{had been trying to}} balance it on his chin, juggling the while with a pair of paper-weights. For, impervious as he seemed to human weaknesses, it was this lad's ambition one day to go into vaudeville.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{very kind}} and {{rational}} {{you were about}} it,' said Tom, warmly; 'I never thought any woman could have <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> much, without making mischief. But you must not put any misconstruction on my present intention. All I mean to do as yet is to induce Henry to remove them out of that dismal swamp, and bring them home to comfort and civilization. Then {{it may be time}} to--' ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>guess</b> came <b>so</b> {{near the}} truth, I could not prevent a suddenly-rising warmth {{in my face}} from {{revealing}} as much.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, I <b>guess</b> <b>so,</b> lil sunbeam. And {{before you}} could shoot, I'd crowd your tin liz into the bank, and jam right into it! I may get killed, but you won't even be a grease-spot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I don't know," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>so.</b> The {{doctor said}} he could see some, {{and he wants to}} see his friends. That's not strange--he always did. I'll ask. Will you tell me your name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Mr. Toad hopped {{into the}} shade of a big mullein leaf. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>so,</b> if it is {{anything}} important," [...] said he. [...] "Phew! Hot, isn't it? I simply can't stand the sun. Now what is that you've got on your mind, Peter?" ...|$|E
25|$|During the program, another psychic {{was doing}} a sorting of 250 Zener cards, {{guessing}} which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct <b>guesses,</b> <b>so</b> it was agreed in advance that the psychic had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, {{she was able to}} get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he agreed, [...] "I <b>guess</b> that's <b>so.</b> Anyway, {{the game}} can't last much longer; they'll {{have to use}} our guns {{in the next few}} days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A Pebble {{for your}} thoughts, Constance," [...] said Mary, tossing one to her feet. [...] "But I can <b>guess</b> them--for <b>so</b> many sisters {{is there not}} one brother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear child, I'm badly shaken," [...] I said. [...] "Don't {{expect me}} to be natural yet. There are things you can't <b>guess.</b> <b>So</b> much {{depended}} upon--Oh, never mind! I'll go now. I want to be alone, to think things out. Let me go, Sally." ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>guess</b> <b>so,</b> {{and very}} likely on...; {{but there is}} no telling... and [...] Cox are certain. There is nothing {{definite}} said or hinted as yet, [...] as I understand Cox; but starving men are the same as maniacs. It [...] would be well to keep a watch on your pistol, so as to have it and [...] the cartridges safe from theft.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why does {{everybody}} repeat riddles," [...] went on Moon abruptly, [...] "even if they've {{forgotten the}} answers? Riddles {{are easy to}} remember because they are hard to <b>guess.</b> <b>So</b> were those stiff old symbols in black, red, or green easy to remember {{because they had been}} hard to guess. Their colours were plain. Their shapes were plain. Everything was plain except the meaning." ...|$|E
30|$|In each trial, {{observers}} {{needed to}} indicate both items {{involved in the}} event. Thus, accuracy was the numbers of correct items selected divided by two. This meant {{that it was possible}} for an observer to be half right if only one of the two items was correctly marked. Accuracy was considered to be zero if the trial was a miss (i.e. when observers did not respond within 2  s after the event). As in Experiment 1, the 2 -s deadline minimized <b>guessing,</b> <b>so</b> the overall tracking performance P is given by Eq.  1 (P[*]=[*]K/N).|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{yet he was}} held there, {{awaiting}} Gian Maria's signal. The Duke continued to eye him with that same astonished look, what time he turned over in his mind the news he had gathered. Then conviction of the truth sank into his mind. It was the Lord of Aquila who was the idol of the Babbianians. What, then, more natural than that the conspirators should have sought to place him on the throne they proposed to wrest from Gian Maria? He dubbed himself a fool {{that he had not}} <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> much before.|$|R
6000|$|And so the [...] "cunning woman" [...] (as {{she truly}} was), talking half to herself, ran {{over all the}} names which she thought likely, peering at Rose all the while out of {{the corners of her}} foxy bright eyes, while Rose stirred the peat ashes steadfastly with the point of her little shoe, half angry, half ashamed, half frightened, to find that [...] "the cunning woman" [...] had <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> well both her suitors and her {{thoughts}} about them, and tried to look unconcerned at each name as it came out.|$|R
60|$|To {{reach the}} {{courtyard}} where the thoats were kept {{it was necessary}} for Carthoris to pass through one of the buildings which surrounded the square. Which were occupied and which not he could not even <b>guess,</b> <b>so</b> he was compelled to take considerable chances to gain the enclosure in which he could hear the restless beasts squealing and quarrelling among themselves.|$|E
6000|$|The Lady Adeline, Right Honourable, [...] And honoured, ran a risk {{of growing}} less so; [...] For few of the soft sex are very stable [...] In their resolves--alas! that I should say so; [...] They differ as wine differs from its label, [...] When once decanted;--I presume to <b>guess</b> <b>so,</b> [...] But will not swear: yet both upon occasion, [...] Till old, may undergo adulteration.|$|E
60|$|Lyndar. O, could I {{read the}} dark decrees of fate, That I might once know whom to love, or hate! For I myself scarce my own {{thoughts}} can <b>guess,</b> <b>So</b> much I find them varied by success. As in some weather-glass, my love I hold; Which falls or rises {{with the heat}} or cold.-- I will be constant yet, if fortune can; I love the king,--let her but name the man.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next night}} in we came again, and I {{saw that the}} third lieutenant's plan {{was going to be}} adopted; in fact, I <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> before; for the sail makers had been at work with two light ropes making a rope ladder, and the ship's smith had got some empty shells on deck, and had made a shift to screw some iron eyes into them for fixing ropes to. The gun was taken out of the pinnace and a little mortar fixed in her, and half a dozen ropes, each a hundred fathoms long, had knots put in them every two feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>guess</b> that's <b>so,</b> too," [...] {{her father}} assented. [...] "'Ta'n't {{so much of}} a muchness as you might think, in that light." [...] He took refuge from the subject in an undirected whistle.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He {{was in a}} torture of {{suspense}} regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him, {{and there was a}} royal lot of it, too, to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret, but already he knew <b>so</b> much, and <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tommy's making {{tracks for}} the Argentine. I guess he thought you'd turned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George! That's right. It'll take 'em {{at least five}} minutes to get busy after us. They'll use the telephone, I <b>guess,</b> <b>so</b> look out for snares ahead--and don't take the direct route. Who's this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I persuaded him {{to come on the}} trip for his health." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And thou, who canst <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> truly," [...] said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, {{dropping}} the mantle from his face, [...] "art no true daughter of Israel, but in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I {{am not an}} outlaw, then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become them, than to deprive thee of these ornaments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I might <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> much," [...] said Saladin; [...] "but {{his passion}} had existed ere my wishes had been formed--and, I must now add, {{is likely to}} survive them. I cannot, in honour, revenge me for my {{disappointment}} on him who had no hand in it. Or, if this high-born dame loved him better than myself, who can say {{that she did not}} justice to a knight of her own religion, who is full of nobleness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jeff {{burst into}} a laugh. [...] "Well, I <b>guess</b> that's <b>so,</b> mother. And now {{you want me to}} throw away the only chance I've got of {{learning}} how to run Lion's Head in the right way by breaking with Cynthy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hannah, presently, [...] "there's no use {{sitting up}} all night." [...] She rose and kissed Janet again. [...] "I just can't believe it," [...] she declared, [...] "but I <b>guess</b> it's <b>so</b> {{if you say}} it is." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christianity Todays Joel Oliphint said [...] "The Wreckings first album, A New Abolition, was {{all over}} the map stylistically, {{incorporating}} worship songs, hip-hop, and even a cover of Peter Gabriels In Your Eyes. It didnt always work, but at least it kept you <b>guessing.</b> <b>So</b> Much for Love, on the other hand, is 14 tracks of consistently normal, predictable pop rock, with verses that only exist to forecast fist-pumping choruses. The slick sound recently scored the band a spot on Showtime series The Big C, and the formula will likely serve The Wrecking well on the radio. But it makes for a humdrum listen." [...] Christianity Today said the top song was [...] "View from the Top".|$|R
