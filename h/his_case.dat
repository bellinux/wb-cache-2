5|$|Askarov's lawyer {{then said}} he would protest the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in the UN Human Rights Council, however Askarov himself was against this, feared {{of not being able}} to survive until the day of decision.

5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community. Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive even the slightest empathy from it, {{and even a few}} years earlier <b>his</b> <b>case</b> might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.|$|E
5|$|Because Andrew Wilson {{was given}} a death sentence, <b>his</b> <b>case</b> was not {{reviewable}} on the same grounds by the Appellate Court, and it {{went directly to the}} Illinois Supreme Court. In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that his confession had been coerced involuntarily from him while under duress. It ordered a new trial.|$|E
5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles. His religious edicts were reversed and the stone of Elagabal {{was sent back to}} Emesa. Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate. The practice of damnatio memoriae—erasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of note—was systematically applied in <b>his</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>case</b> {{would make}} {{its way to the}} United States Supreme Court, where his {{conviction}} for breaking curfew was affirmed. After internment during most of World War II, he moved to Denver, Colorado in 1944. In Denver, Yasui married and became a local leader in civic affairs, including leadership positions in the Japanese American Citizens League. In 1986, his criminal conviction was overturned by the federal court.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Bamber's lawyers {{highlighted}} {{two police}} logs {{in support of}} Bamber's application to have <b>his</b> <b>case</b> referred back to the Court of Appeal. The question was whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position {{that there were two}} calls to police, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the U.S. conferred the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award on Askarov. The Kyrgyz {{government}} protested {{this decision}} and formally terminated a 1993 agreement on {{cooperation between the}} U.S. and Kyrgyzstan. On 12 July 2016, the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan revoked the life sentence against Askarov and sent <b>his</b> <b>case</b> to the Chui Oblast Court for review. He was resentenced for life on 24 January 2017.|$|E

5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing <b>his</b> <b>case</b> {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about {{the authenticity of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) {{travels to}} a parole hearing for her husband, Hank (Chris Mulkey). She is uneasy about helping <b>his</b> <b>case</b> {{as she is}} seeing Ed Hurley (Everett McGill), but {{promises}} him {{a job at the}} diner she owns. Meanwhile, Johnson's wife Shelley is having an affair with Briggs; she shows him Johnson's bloodstained shirt. He takes it, promising to rid them of Johnson for good.|$|E
5|$|The former Parliamentarian, Colonel John Hutchinson, was infamously {{detained}} by the Crown at Sandown in 1664; his wife, Lucy, who subsequently widely publicised <b>his</b> <b>case,</b> described the castle as ruinous and his imprisonment there as inhumane. After several months Hutchinson {{died in the}} castle, his doctor blaming his physical decline on {{the conditions in which}} he had been kept.|$|E
5000|$|Sir James Burrow {{said that}} Lord Mansfield forbade the citing of Barnardiston's reports in Chancery, {{for fear of}} {{misleading}} students, since none of <b>his</b> <b>cases</b> were correct throughout. Lord Manners, on the other hand, said: [...] "Although Barnardiston is not considered a very correct reporter, yet some of <b>his</b> <b>cases</b> are very accurately reported;" [...] and Lord Eldon said {{that some of the}} reports were [...] "of very great authority".|$|R

5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking <b>his</b> <b>case</b> {{to the people}} that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on <b>his</b> <b>case</b> with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed <b>his</b> <b>case</b> against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E

5000|$|During Seasons 5 and 6 of Walker, Carlos {{appeared}} on 15 episodes and Trent for 12 episodes (one of these episodes included a Hayes Cooper {{story in which}} both actors appeared in a dual role). During these episodes, Trent opens his own martial arts dojo {{as well as a}} protection agency to either help people who are too scared to go to the police or who the police can't help.

5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. <b>His</b> <b>case</b> was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that <b>his</b> <b>case</b> was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in <b>his</b> <b>case</b> against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E
