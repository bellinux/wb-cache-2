5|$|The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police {{headquarters}} {{is situated in}} the Neoclassical-inspired Politigården building built in 1918–24 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms {{does not lead to}} prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public <b>health</b> <b>issue,</b> not a criminal one.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major <b>health</b> <b>issue.</b> A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public <b>health</b> <b>issue</b> in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the {{character}} {{was used to}} highlight another important gynaecological <b>health</b> <b>issue,</b> fibroids. The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when {{the character}} Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary hysterectomy. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision {{that had been made}} by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.|$|E

40|$|In Australia, it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that most homeless people have mental <b>health</b> <b>issues,</b> and that mental illness is a primary cause of homelessness. This paper uses information from a study of 4291 homeless people in Melbourne to investigate these propositions. The research found that neither proposition was plausible. Fifteen per cent of the sample had mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> prior to becoming homeless, and 16 per cent developed mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> after becoming homeless. For those who had mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> prior to becoming homeless, it was the breakdown of family support that usually precipitated homelessness. For those who developed mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> after becoming homeless, it was often their experiences in the homeless population that precipitated mental illness. Regardless of whether mental illness preceded or followed homelessness, most people with mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> experienced long-term homelessness. The paper concludes with two policy recommendations. This paper was presented at the 2009 Australian Social Policy Conference, University of New South Wales, 8 - 10 July, 2009.

Background To ensure the early identification and effective treatment of mental health disorders in the veteran population, general practitioners (GPs) need to be aware that the traditional profile of an Australian veteran has changed, and that more than combat service can give rise to mental <b>health</b> <b>issues.</b> Objective This article uses {{findings that}} have emerged from research undertaken with participants from three veteran cohorts to highlight mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> that should be considered in general practice. Discussion GPs have a key role to play in the diagnosis and treatment of mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> among the veteran population for several reasons. First, mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> may emerge at any point during a veteran’s lifespan and among any veteran cohort. Second, mental <b>health</b> <b>issues</b> may have a significant trans-generational impact on a veteran’s family. Third, GPs are uniquely positioned to break down barriers to help-seeking, such as stigma. Importantly, there is a comprehensive system of support available to assist GPs in providing effective and culturally appropriate care for veterans...|$|R
