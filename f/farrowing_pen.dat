40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important enteropathogen in both humans and animals. The finding of C. difficile in air samples in hospitals suggests a role for aerial dissemination in the transmission of human C. difficile infection.

40|$|Housing {{lactating}} sows with piglets in a multi-suckling pen from around 14 days post-farrowing is {{common practice in}} Swedish organic piglet production. However, nursing-suckling interaction is less frequent in multi-suckling pens than in individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens,</b> thus affecting piglet performance, e. g., piglet growth. Moreover, piglet mortality is higher in systems using multi-suckling pens. Three management routines whereby {{lactating sows}} with piglets were moved from individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> to multi-suckling pens at one, two, or three weeks post-farrowing were compared in terms of nursing-suckling interaction and piglet performance. Correlations between nursing-suckling interaction, piglet performance, and piglet mortality were also examined. In total, 43 Yorkshire sows with piglets {{were included in the}} study. Nursing-suckling interaction and all piglet performance parameters except piglet mortality did not differ between management routines. Piglet mortality in the individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> did not differ between management routines, but piglet mortality in the multi-suckling pen was lower (P< 0. 05) when piglets were group housed at three weeks compared with one week post-farrowing. Overall piglet mortality was positively correlated with mortality in the multi-suckling pen for piglets group housed at one week (r = 0. 61 : P< 0. 05) and at two weeks post-farrowing (r = 0. 62 : P< 0. 05) but not for piglets group housed at three weeks post-farrowing. In conclusion, overall piglet mortality could be reduced if sows and piglets are group housed at three weeks post-farrowing and piglet survival the first week post-farrowing is improved...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{environmental}} enrichment on physiological responses to stressors and behavior in growing pigs, pigs were housed in either a poor environment (standard <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> followed by standard rearing and fattening pens) or in an enriched environment (larger <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> followed by larger rearing and fattening pens, provision of straw). Body temperature, heart rate and salivary cortisol were measured during baseline conditions and in response to relocation, isolation and restraint. Pigs housed in the poor environment performed more manipulative social behavior directed to penmates than pigs housed in the enriched environment. Physiological responses to the stressors were the same for enriched- and poor-housed pigs. Surprisingly, enriched-housed pigs had significantly higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations, especially at 14 and 17 weeks of age. Moreover, enriched housed pigs had a lower baseline body temperature at 17 weeks of age.

40|$|The {{impact of}} hovers (closed nests) in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> on energy {{consumption}} was studied. The hovers were equipped with electric heating tube, sensor, and automatically controlled heat regulation. They reduce energy losses {{and provide a}} warm environment for piglets, {{as well as a}} thermally suitable farrowing unit for sows. Temperature wise, hovers provide a high level of comfort for both. During the two-year experimental period, electricity usage was measured from farrowing to weaning during 60 lactations standardised to 28 days. On average, the electricity consumption was 42. 68 kWh per lactation (51. 51 kWh in winter and 33. 65 kWh during summer season). Major part of the energy was used {{in the first week of}} lactation (41. 45 %). After that, the weekly usage of energy decreased (29. 26 %, 19. 89 %, 9. 40 % from the second to the fourth week, respectively) because of the decreased needs for supplemental heating and increased self produced warmth of older piglets. The calculation of total costs for heating showed that nearly 100. 21 EUR per <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> were saved annually compared to the system without hovers and without heat regulation, a common practice in piglet production...|$|E
40|$|These days, {{especially}} in organic piglet production, {{it is necessary}} to reduce the production costs to be competitive on the market. A large proportion of the production costs are caused by labor and construction costs to ensure a high level of animal welfare. The <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> of Wels, currently existing in prototype form, was designed to fulfill organic farming requirements, improve animal welfare, and minimize the costs for construction and labor. The housing system is characterized by four separate functional areas: the lying area, the excretion and moving area, the feeding area for the sow, and a piglet nest. To identify the working time requirements of routine and special tasks, a time study, based on the work element method and an electronic time recording system (ortim b 3) (a Pocket PC with time recording software), was conducted. The influencing variables and the time measurements were collected by directly observing work processes in the farrowing unit, which had 5 farrowing pens, over a period of 21 days at the “LFZ Raumberg Gumpenstein. ” The data were descriptive and statistically analyzed to obtain planning data on the element basis. The time requirement was modeled according to the related task and in total over the suckling period. The routine tasks consisted in transporting the feed to the pen, feeding the sows, monitoring the sows and piglets, mucking out the dung corridor with a tractor and sprinkling straw in it, as well as filling up the hay rack. The labor input was 3. 99 AKmin per sow and day in total. The special tasks included inoculating the piglets, marking with ear tags, castrating the male piglets, cleaning the whole pen and the dung corridor, and preparing the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> for the next sows. Special work required 25. 9 MPmin per sow over the keeping period of 21 days. The total working time requirements over the period of 21 days were 1. 82 MPh per sow.

50|$|Presumably, A. suum {{infections are}} present in pig farms all over the world. However, few {{countries}} have up-to-date information on its prevalence. In a Swedish study {{it appeared that the}} pens of sows and fatteners are the heaviest infected environments. This was shown by the presence of eggs in old faecal deposits collected from the pens. These findings were supported by studies from China and Denmark where the highest prevalence of A. suum was also found in breeding sows and fatteners. The prevalence in breeding boars is usually lower than in sows or fatteners. Nevertheless, infected boars could also be an important source of transmission of parasite eggs on the farm since they are often located in more traditional pens than the sows (e.g. with solid floor and/or bedding). Moreover, boars are regularly used for contact stimulation of the sows, which allows them to spread the infection by defecating in areas other than their own pen.Strong evidence exists that under indoor conditions, massive infection of piglets with A. suum usually occurs shortly after arrival in the highly infectious fattening units and not in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens.</b> Several studies have shown that A. suum egg excretion was nearly absent in weaners despite the, sometimes substantial, presence of eggs in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> of intensive herds. Here, the increased hygienic standards in combination with the low humidity in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> may significantly reduce the presence of favourable microenvironments for egg survival. On the other hand, in piglets raised under outdoor conditions, significant transmission is thought to occur soon after birth and pigs are infected before fattening.|$|R

40|$|Newborn piglets {{in organic}} <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> {{have a lower}} {{survival}} rate than in conventional <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens.</b> This difference is mainly caused by housing the sow loose compared to crated and by climatic effects of the outdoor temperature. Organic lactating sows {{should have at least}} 7. 5 m² indoor area with straw and a 2. 5 m² outdoor run. The aim of the project was to increase piglet survival in order to improve animal welfare as well as the profitability of organic farms. In the experiment we compared survival and behaviour in 3 pen types: type 1 with outdoor run, type 2 with an indoor run and a higher proportion of solid floor and type 3 without run. Data was analysed with Analysis of Variance using parity and liveborn piglets as covariables. Results of 131 litters in total showed 9. 6 a, 10. 8 b and 9. 4 a (p= 0. 05) weaned piglets per litter for pen type 1, 2 and 3. Fouling scores indicating dunging behaviour in the indoor lying area showed 13 a, 21 b and 19 b (p= 0. 04) for pen types 1, 2 and 3. We found a tendency that litters with high survival rates used the separate piglet nest sooner for lying than the litters with low survival rates. Climatic conditions seemed to be crucial for the vitality and survival of the newborn piglets. The better climatic conditions combined with the higher proportion of solid floor resulted in a higher survival rate of the piglets. These results are currently used in a second experiment focussing on extra heating around farrowing and solid floor proportion in a new farrowing accommodation. ...|$|R

40|$|Public {{interest}} in livestock farming is increasing, as is general criticism regarding {{the welfare of}} farm animals. In this context, husbandry systems for pigs especially are perceived very negatively. Despite rising concern for animal farming, most people lack detailed knowledge of modern agricultural production processes, as well as direct contact with agriculture. With regards to public demand for transparency of production quality and animal welfare standards, farmers and farmer associations in several countries have begun installing webcams in dairy, pig and poultry farming operations. Along with informational texts, pictures from webcams are publicly {{available on the internet}} and are used as a new type of communication tool aimed at increasing the acceptance of livestock farming by providing farming-specific information. However, there are currently no existing studies quantitatively investigating the effect of webcam pictures from stables and accompanying informational texts on the broader public. In a randomized between-subject experimental design, we presented two webcam pictures from conventional pig barns (pig fattening barn and sow <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen)</b> to the broader public, along with two different informational texts (one written directly by farmers and one neutrally written by the authors). Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} examine 1) if the attitude towards pig farming changes after having seen the webcam pictures, 2) if different informational texts alter the evaluation of webcam pictures, 3) if there are differences in the perception of webcam pictures of a pig fattening barn and a sow <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen,</b> and 4) how people evaluate the use of webcams as a public relations tool that can be used to provide transparency. It was determined that the majority of respondents display a more negative attitude after viewing the webcam pictures and informational texts, and this is especially true for participants reading the neutrally written texts. Further, the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> is evaluated substantially more negatively than the pig fattening pen. Regarding the overall evaluation of webcams, people seem to appreciate that farmers show real pictures from their stables, although a rather low {{interest in}} the usage of webcams in agriculture can be observed. Thus, although transparency may be enhanced through the use of webcams, our findings suggest that webcams generally do not show the desired effects on the public and are likely to be unable to improve the image of pig farming by simply providing information via pictures and texts. Finally, the application of webcams as a communication tool cannot be recommended, at least not for the husbandry systems investigated within this study...|$|E

Three to five days before parturition the sows were confined to farrowing crates until 4 – 6 days after parturition.

5000|$|There is {{also some}} {{criticism}} of 'farrowing crates'. A farrowing crate houses the sow in one section and her piglets in another.

40|$|Production {{systems with}} group housing of sows at {{different}} stages of production are increasing in Europe, as an effect of public demand for more animal welfare-friendly pig production. Some niche certified piglet production systems keep lactating sows with piglets in groups in multi-suckling pens. However, three factors have been identified as affecting certified piglet production in systems with multi-suckling pens: The occurrence of lactational oestrus, piglet mortality and within-litter weight variation at weaning. This thesis investigated the possibility to affect these three factors by altering management routines. Three different management routines that differed in terms of time spent in an individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> post-farrowing, before the lactating sows with piglets were group-housed in a multi-suckling pen, were created. Time spent in the individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> was one (W 1), two (W 2) or three weeks (W 3). Piglets in all management routines were weaned at six weeks post-farrowing. Only one of 43 sows ovulated during lactation. This was determined by post-mortem macroscopic examination of the ovaries and progesterone metabolite concentration in faeces. Interestingly, the weaning to standing oestrus interval was significantly shorter (p< 0. 001) for W 2 (2. 6 ± 0. 3 days) and W 3 (2. 7 ± 0. 2 days) than W 1 (4. 0 ± 0. 3 days). Piglet mortality in the multi-suckling pen was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in W 3 and W 2 than W 1. Within-litter weight variation did not differ between the management routines. Stress induced by reallocation and mixing of sows can affect ovarian activity and was therefore assessed during the group-housing period by measuring cortisol concentrations in saliva sampled during the first four days post-mixing. Analysis showed that W 3 sows were less stressed in the multi-suckling pen than W 1 sows. Overall, the results in this thesis on sow reproduction and piglet performance can be used for development of housing and management routines...|$|E

The risk on lameness caused by the pen floor is increasing with group housing becoming more important. Lameness is a major welfare and production problem and often related to claw lesions. A good-quality floor to ensure healthy claws is characterized by a surface with friction (non-slip), abrasion, soft and dry properties and rounded edges. During pregnancy, aggressive interactions should be minimized because the walking and activity characteristics are more important than in individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens.</b> During lactation, claws can recover from lesions in pregnancy and should heal before {{the start of a new}} reproductive cycle.

This observation was corroborated in serological studies of sera obtained at the abattoir, which showed that older breeder swine had consistently higher titres than the younger market swine.

40|$|Abstract Background Lameness in piglets {{is a major}} {{animal welfare}} issue. Floor {{abrasiveness}} is a common cause of superficial injury in piglets in <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens.</b> The abrasion achieved may act as a gate for infections, which in turn may induce development of infectious arthritis. In this study, the influence of improvements of the floor quality and of increased ratios of straw in identical <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> was measured. Methods The study was carried out at a herd with four identical farrowing units with solid concrete floor bedded with 1 kg chopped straw per sow and 1 hg per piglet and day. Nothing was changed {{in the management of}} the four identical farrowing units, but four experimental groups were created: Group I – control, Group II – the amount of bedding was doubled. The surface of the floor was repaired in two units, Group III – Piglet Floor ®, Flowcrete Sweden AB, Perstorp, Sweden and Group IV – Thorocrete SL ®, Växa Halland, Sweden. Three farrowing batches were studies in each unit. In total, 93 litters (1, 073 piglets) were examined for foot and skin lesions until the age of 3 weeks. The occurrence of lameness was registered until weaning at an average age of 4. 5 weeks. Twenty seven lame piglets were culled instead of medicinally treated and subjected to necropsy including histopathological and microbiological examinations. Isolates of streptococci, staphylococci and E. coli were tested with respect to antimicrobial resistance. Results Piglet born on the repaired floors had the lowest prevalences of abrasions at carpus. Also the doubled straw ration decreased the abrasions. Skin lesions at carpus decreased significantly in magnitude in all four systems from day 10. At day 3, the sole bruising scores of the control unit were greater than the other three units (p Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (60 %), Staphylococcus hyicus subsp. hyicus (35 %) and Escherichia coli (5 %). These isolates were sensitive to all antibiotics included in the antimicrobial panels. Conclusion The results suggest that proper maintenance of the floor can prevent the degree of roughness and abrasiveness of the floors, which in turn can contribute significantly to prevention of abrasions, sole bruising and lameness in piglets. Maintaining the surface of concrete floors with two different commercially available solutions both decreased the incidence of abrasions and sole bruisings and thereby also of arthritis significantly. Also doubling the amount of chopped straw turned out to prevent development of skin lesions and sole bruisings to some extent, and subsequently also the incidence of arthritis. </p...|$|R

The sows {{were randomly assigned to}} two different treatment groups and the sows that remained in the batch during the second lactation switched treatment group. In the treatment group (n= 163 farrowings) sows were provided with 15 – 20 kg of chopped straw 2 days before expected farrowing. Sows in the control group (n= 161 farrowings) received 0. 5 – 1 kg of chopped straw on a daily basis plus 2 kg for nest building when the stockperson judged that the sow was about to farrow. After the sows was moved to <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> (0 - 9 days before actual farrowing), body condition was measured with ultrasound equipment and a back-fat thickness of ≤ 12 mm was denoted “low body condition” (n= 41 farrowings) while higher values were denoted “high body condition” (n= 283 farrowings). Shoulder lesions were recorded on a 5 -point scale (score 0 - 4) after the sows was moved to <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> and approximately 5 weeks after farrowing. Data were analysed using z-tests for proportions. The provision of 15 – 20 kg of straw 2 days prior to expected farrowing could not be shown to affect the prevalence of shoulder lesions. On the other hand, the sows’ body condition before farrowing had a strong effect on the development of shoulder lesions. The percentage of shoulder lesions after farrowings with a low and high body condition score was 71 and 39 percent, respectively (z= 4. 20, p< 0. 001). In sows with a low condition score, the difference in the prevalence of shoulder lesions of scores 3 - 4 between treatment and control groups (15 and 33 percent, respectively) indicates that large quantities of straw can reduce the risk of severe shoulder lesions in lean sows. In conclusion, piglet producers should keep their farrowing sows in good body condition to prevent shoulder lesions. Strategic supply of large quantities of straw before farrowing can be effective in reducing the risk of severe lesions, but further research is needed...|$|R

From 5 to 22 days of age, suckling piglets were offered a high-fibre diet (HF; 5 % cellulose; n= 5 litters), or a control low-fibre diet (n= 5 litters). Piglets were housed with the sows in individual <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens,</b> and had access to maternal milk until weaning, at 23 days of age. Behaviours of six focal piglets per pen were scored at 6, 16 and 21 days of age. All piglets were individually weighed at 5, 15 and 20 days of age and feed intake was measured daily at the pen level. Piglets on the HF diet were more active than controls (P= 0. 05), and spent more time suckling or massaging the udder (P= 0. 01) and interacting with pen mates (P= 0. 008). Time spent manipulating pen mates, which may reflect re-directed foraging activity {{in the absence of}} substrate, accounted for most of the time spent interacting with pen mates (⩾ 73 % of total time spent interacting). Dietary fibres had no effect on BW and feed intake. In conclusion, inclusion of cellulose in the supplemental diet of suckling piglets affects behaviour, with no deleterious effects on performance before weaning...|$|R
40|$|In the {{farrowing}} pens {{the amount}} of bedding material {{and the quality of}} the concrete floor has a huge impact on both the sow and the piglets. In this study imbedding of rubber flooring on the solid area in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> was used to see if it had any effects on the sows lying behaviour when compared to concrete. Another important aspect was to evaluate if the rubber floorings had a high enough durability to resist the normal wear in a <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen.</b> Concrete flooring is assumed to have a higher thermally conductive effect then rubber which can affect the sow’s chance to cool down. Therefore the temperature in the farrowing compartment was measured to see if there was a correlation between the sows lying behaviour and the temperature. In total, the study was performed during five farrowing batches, in total about 30 weeks observation period. In each batch, two “rubber” pens and two “concrete” pens were included in the behavioural observations. Three different rubber floorings were included in the study; ProCoat rubber compound, Porca relax, and KKM Porca prototype. Continuous video recordings for the behavioural observations were made twice during the suckling period of five weeks. The video recordings were 24 hours each and took place at about one and three weeks after farrowing. The different behaviours that were noted were standing/walking, lying on the side, lying on the abdomen and sitting. The floor in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> was divided into three different zones: solid flooring, slatted flooring and transition zone between solid and slatted flooring. In the behavioural study there was a significant difference one week after farrowing and a trend three weeks after farrowing, that the sows in the rubber pens lay down less than the sows in the concrete pens. This difference was not due to less lying on the solid floor area in the “rubber” pens, but was due to significantly less lying in the transition zone. In contrary, when only looking at the behaviour lying and recalculating the figures for this there was a weak, but not significant, trend that the sows chose to lie more on the solid rubber area than on the solid concrete area in the pen. The highest mean temperature was 21. 9 °C and the lowest mean temperature was 15. 1 °C. The assumption that sows could be more sensitive to higher temperatures when on the rubber floor, due to less thermal conductivity, could not be confirmed nor disregarded because the temperature during the observation period did not exceed the sows’ thermo neutral zone (15 - 20 °C) by much. The relation between temperature and lying percent on the slatted area showed a large variation between individual sows. The time it took for the sows to lie down showed no significant difference between the treatments, but a great variation between individual sows could be noted. The good durability of the Porca relax and of the KKM Porca prototype rubber mats were convincing during the whole study. In contrast ProCoat rubber flooring did not sustain the tough rooting behaviour of a sow in a <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> and broke down. In conclusion there were large individual variations in sow behaviour in the study and the sows, in the farrowing pens, choose between different surfaces with different thermal and comfort properties. The use of rubber flooring instead of concrete on the solid area in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> did not seem to be a great advantage in this herd. But the study showed that there are now rubber mats on the market, which can sustain the weight and behavioral activity of sows. I grisningsboxar påverkar mängden och kvaliteten strö samt golvets typ och kvalitet både suggan och smågrisarna. I denna studie lades gummimattor alternativt en gummimassa in på grisningsboxens betonggolv för att se om det hade någon inverkan på suggornas liggbeteende jämfört med de suggor som hölls på betong. En annan aspekt som också var viktig att utvärdera var om gummimattorna och gummimassan hade en så pass hög hållbarhet att de kunde motstå påfrestningarna som uppstår i en grisningsbox. Betonggolv har en viss värmeledande effekt som antas vara högre än den hos gummigolv. För att se om det fanns ett samband mellan liggbeteende och temperatur mättes därför också temperaturen i grisningsavdelningen. Studien utfördes under totalt fem grisningsomgångar under sammanlagt ca 30 veckor. I varje omgång av beteendeobservationer ingick två boxar med gummigolv och två med betonggolv. Tre olika sorters gummigolv användes: ProCoat gummimassa, Porca relax och KKM Porca prototyp. Dygnsvisa videoinspelningar gjordes en och tre veckor efter grisning. Dessa inspelningar användes för att observera suggans beteende. De beteende som noterades var står/går, ligger, sidoligger/sidobukligger och sitter. En indelning av golvet i grisningsboxen gjordes också och de olika zonerna var: helt golv, spaltgolv och övergång mellan helt golv och spaltgolv. I beteendestudierna av suggorna var det en signifikant skillnad en vecka efter grisning, och tre veckor efter grisning sågs en trend att suggor i boxar med gummigolv låg mindre än de med betonggolv. Denna skillnad berodde dock inte på att suggorna låg mindre på det hela golvet utan på att de låg signifikant mindre på övergången mellan helt golv och spaltgolv. Då en omräkning av siffrorna gjordes och endast beteendet Ligger studerades fanns en svag, men ej signifikant, trend att suggor valde att ligga mer på det hela gummiområdet än på det hela betongområdet. Den högsta medeltemperaturen var 21. 9 °C och den lägsta temperaturen var 15. 1 ° C. Hypotesen att suggor kan vara mer känsliga för högre temperaturer på gummigolv, på grund av sämre värmeledningsförmåga, kunde varken bekräftas eller förkastas eftersom medeltemperaturen inte mer än marginellt översteg den termiska komfort zonen (15 - 20 °C) under observationsperioden. Förhållandet mellan temperatur och liggtiden i procent på spalten visade en stor variation mellan suggorna. Tiden det tog för suggorna att lägga sig ner visade också på en stor variation mellan suggorna, men ingen signifikant skillnad mellan behandlingarna kunde ses. Porca relax och KKM Porca prototyp visade god hållbarhet under hela studien. Däremot kunde inte ProCoat gummimassa stå emot suggans bökande i grisningsboxen utan gick sönder. Slutsatserna av studien var att det fanns en stor variation mellan suggor och att icke fixerade suggor själva kan bestämma vilken yta i boxen med olika komfort och termiska egenskaper som de vill uppehålla sig på. Gummigolv istället för betong på den fasta ytan i grisningsboxen verkade inte vara någon fördel i den här studien. Undersökningen visade att det finns gummimattor på marknaden som kan motstå suggors vikt och bökande beteende i grisningsboxen...|$|E
40|$|Integrons {{are one of}} {{the genetic}} {{elements}} involved in the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. The aim of the present research is to investigate the presence of integrons in commensal Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, isolated from pigs at different stages of production system and from the environment in an Argentinian farm. Five sows postpartum and five randomly chosen piglets from each litter were sampled by rectal swabs. They were sampled again at day 21 and at day 70. Environmental samples from the farm were also obtained. E. coli containing any integron class or combination of both integrons was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 100 % of sows and in piglets at different stages of production: <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> stage 68. 1 %;, weaning 60 %, and growing/finishing 85. 8 %, showing an increase along the production system. From environmental samples 78. 4 % of E. coli containing any integron class was detected. We conclude that animals and farm environment can act as reservoirs for potential spread of resistant bacteria by means of mobile genetic elements as integrons, which has a major impact on production of food animals and that can reach man through the food chain, constituting a problem for public health...|$|E
40|$|Poor claw {{health of}} preweaning piglets is {{regarded}} as a major welfare issue in today’s pig industry. Rough concrete flooring is a well known risk factor for development of abrasions on claws and limbs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if use of rubber mats on the solid laying area in the <b>farrowing</b> <b>pen</b> for loose housed sows, were able to prevent development of skin and claw abrasions in suckling piglets compared to the original solid concrete floor. The study was carried out on two commercial piglet producing farms during February - December 2012. Two types of solid rubber mats with different softness were installed on the lying area. The harder mat (PORCA relax, Kraiburg Elastik GmbH) was installed in 3 pens in farm A and 2 pens in farm B. The softer mat (KKM Porca prototype, Kraiburg Elastik GmbH) was installed in 4 pens in farm A and in 2 pens on farm B. In total, the limbs and claws of 759 piglets from 67 litters were clinically examined when the piglets were 4 - 12 days old (18 litters from hard rubber pens, 16 litters from soft rubber pens, 33 litters from concrete pens). Skin and claw abrasions were found in 72...|$|E
40|$|Tail biting in pigs is a {{widespread}} problem in intensive pig farming. The tendency to develop this damaging behaviour has been suggested to relate to serotonergic functioning and personality characteristics of pigs. We investigated whether tail biting in pigs {{can be associated with}} blood serotonin and with their behavioural and physiological responses to novelty. Pigs (n = 480) were born in conventional <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> and after weaning at four weeks of age they were either housed barren (B) or in straw-enriched (E) pens. Individual pigs were exposed to a back test and novel environment test before weaning, and after weaning to a novel object (i. e. bucket) test in an unfamiliar arena. A Principal Component Analysis on behaviours during the tests and salivary cortisol (novel object test only) revealed five factors for both housing systems, labeled ‘Early life exploration’, ‘Near bucket’, ‘Cortisol’, ‘Vocalizations & standing alert’, and ‘Back test activity’. Blood samples were taken at 8, 9 and 22 weeks of age to determine blood platelet serotonin. In different phases of life, pigs were classified as tail biter/non-tail biter based on tail biting behaviour, and as victim/non-victim based on tail wounds. A combination of both classifications resulted in four pig types: biters, victims, biter/victims, and neutrals. Generally, only in phases of life during which pigs were classified as tail biters, they seemed to have lower blood platelet serotonin storage and higher blood platelet uptake velocities. Victims also seemed to have lower blood serotonin storage. Additionally, in B housing, tail biters seemed to consistently have lower scores of the factor ‘Near bucket’, possibly indicating a higher fearfulness in tai...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{demonstration}} was to compare two alternative winter farrowing systems that meet niche pork production criteria. The demonstration was conducted at the ISU Armstrong Research Farm, Lewis, IA, and the ISU Allee Demonstration Farm, Newell, IA. A group of 18 second parity gestating sows from the Allee Farm were randomly {{divided into two groups}} of nine sows. One group was farrowed during January 2007 at each farm. Each group farrowing was completed in 5 to 6 days. One farm had swing-side <b>farrowing</b> <b>pens</b> and the other farm had farrowing huts, all in bedded, heated rooms. The two systems had virtually identical performance results. For both systems the average number of pigs born alive was 13 pigs per litter with an average birth weight of 3. 8 lb per pig. Weaning occurred at 44. 9 days of age with 10. 2 pigs per litter weighing an average of 34. 2 lb each. The pre-wean mortality was 21. 8 %. Although this is high, it is approximately 1 / 4 less than the pre-wean mortality recorded during our earlier demonstration of the bedded Swedish free-stall farrowing system. The larger number of pigs born live and the lower pre-wean mortality resulted in 10. 2 pigs weaned per litter in this demonstration compared with 8. 1 pigs per litter in the Swedish cubicle system. This is about a 26 % improvement. Again, the bedded group lactation worked well with few mortalities and good pig growth. Overall about 80 % of the piglet mortalities occurred on day 1. The swing-side pens had fewer losses on day 1, but more losses later...|$|R
