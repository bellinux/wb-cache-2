5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decipher.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{organization}} {{among both}} North and South Korean units made it <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> estimate total casualties for both sides. Several units were completely {{destroyed in the}} fighting, making precise casualty counting difficult. A memo from the South Korean army claimed 3,800 North Korean killed and 181 captured in the P'ohang area from 17 August onward. However, casualty numbers are likely far higher. The NK 12th Division alone likely suffered at least 4,500 casualties {{on top of that}} number, reporting a strength of 6,000 on 5 August and only 1,500 on 17 August.|$|E

5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Unlike card tricks done on {{the streets}} or on stage and card cheating, cardistry is solely about impressing without illusions, deceit, {{misdirection}} and other elements commonly used in card tricks and card cheating. Cardistry, or card flourishes, are always intended to be visually impressive and appear <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> perform. Card flourishing {{is often associated with}} card tricks, but many sleight of hand artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E

30|$|Such {{studies to}} {{characterize}} the dependency of these Tuber–bacteria associations are made <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> owing <b>to</b> (1) the slow growth of Tuber mycelium and (2) the non-cultivability of associated Rhodopseudomonas and thus difficulties in characterizing and eliminating bacteria from mycelial cultures.|$|R
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> note the dimmer companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid. The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 February, Blücher, {{commanding}} a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps, resumed his attack against Marmont. The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined-arms forces, which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia. Blücher {{realized that he was}} facing the Emperor in person and decided to pull back and avoid another battle against Napoleon. In practice, Blücher's attempt to disengage proved <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> execute, as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position, had virtually no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was facing an enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry.|$|E

50|$|Claims of “substantial sexual dimorphism” {{have been}} made by several {{scientists}} but it is an <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> claim <b>to</b> confirm {{as a result of the}} small sample size analyzed and conclusions based on sexual dimorphism should be acknowledged as possibilities, not as concrete fact.|$|R
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> assign one specific, {{overarching}} theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of overarm bowling at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania {{preferred}} underarm bowling {{at a time when}} roundarm bowling was permitted {{in the rest of the}} world. The match was played at the Launceston Racecourse ground, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were dismayed by the state of the pitch, which looked <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
5|$|This corvid {{is known}} to join mixed-species flocks with other species {{including}} unicolored jays and emerald toucanets. It is also known to travel in groups with two to ten other azure-hooded jays. It is a skulking and secretive species, rarely coming out into the open. Because of this habit, the bird is <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> observe in the wild and not much is known about its ecology. Mates are known to preen each other, a process which entails one bird bending over {{in front of the}} other and tugging on its throat feathers. The feathers of the crown are often moving swiftly, and it is believed that the condition of a mate can be determined by this movement.|$|E

5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, {{against the advice of}} many of his peers. This experience was a poor one, as Brady was <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918. His experience there was not much better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are <b>extremely</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By outsourcing calculations to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|E
