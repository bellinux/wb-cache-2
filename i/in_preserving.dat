5|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, {{there was little}} {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>preserving</b> the wall due to the negative memories associated with the Nazi occupation. One of the best preserved parts is the Todt Battery. In 2011, renewed efforts to preserve the wall were spearheaded by organisations in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301.

40|$|Lipid Peroxidation by Paracetamol and Hot Water Extract of Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) in Yeast Candida tropicalis <b>preserved</b> <b>in</b> Low Temperature. The use of C. tropicalis cell {{as a tool}} to {{evaluate}} antioxidant property of green tea to protect oxidative stress caused by paracetamol in cell level was investigated in our laboratory. Immediate availability of cell culture will significantly reduce the time of cell preparation. Low temperature preservation of cell culture is one of methods to produce cell cultures. However, low temperature might affectphysiological state of the cell. In this study, effect of low temperature preservation (4 ºC, 10 days) on the oxidative response of yeast cell treated with paracetamol and hot water extract of green tea had been investigated. Cells incubation with paracetamol 0. 3 % for 2 h caused oxidative stress in both fresh and preserved culture since the content of a marker of oxidativestress, peroxyd lipids increased significantly. Whereas, concentration of peroxidised lipids <b>in</b> <b>preserved</b> cultures was lower than that of fresh culture. Increasing of peroxydized lipids followed with decreasing of cell viability in fresh culture but not <b>in</b> <b>preserved</b> culture. Green tea withconcentration of 0. 1 % decreased peroxyd lipids in fresh cultures treated with paracetamol but not <b>in</b> <b>preserved</b> cultures. Green tea with concentration of 0. 2 % or 0. 4 % in increased peroxyd lipids in fresh cultures treated with paracetamol but not <b>in</b> <b>preserved</b> cultures. The data indicated that green tea did not show anti- or pro-oxidative effect <b>in</b> cultures <b>preserved</b> <b>in</b> low temperature treated with paracetamol. However, induction of super oxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant defense enzyme, was not observed <b>in</b> cell <b>preserved</b> <b>in</b> low temperature. The study revealedthat low temperature might make the cell more resistant against prooxidative properties of paracetamol...|$|R

5|$|Horses were {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful <b>in</b> <b>preserving</b> the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380000 animals as soon as 1945.|$|E

For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E
