40|$|Since {{the concept}} of {{ubiquitous}} computing is firstly proposed by Mark Weiser, its connotation has been extending and expanding by many scholars. In pervasive computing application environment, many kinds of small devices containing smart cart are used to communicate with others. In 2013, <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> proposed an enhanced authentication scheme using smart card for digital rights management. They demonstrated that their scheme is secure enough. However, Mishra <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> pointed out that <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> ’s scheme suffers from the password guessing attack and the denial of service attack. Moreover, they also demonstrated that <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> ’s scheme is not efficient enough when the user inputs an incorrect password. In this paper, we analyze <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> ’s scheme again, and find that their scheme is vulnerable to the session key attack. And, there are some mistakes in their scheme. To surmount the weakness of <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> ’s scheme, we propose a more efficient and provable secure digital rights management authentication scheme using smart card based on elliptic curve cryptography...|$|R

30|$|There {{have been}} several geochemical studies of Yangtze River sediments, {{including}} analysis of the rare earth element (REE) composition (e.g., <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2002; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013; <b>Yang</b> and Wang 2011), major element chemistry (e.g., Chen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2002; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004 a), and the Sr-Nd isotope characteristics (e.g., Meng <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007). However, {{there has been little}} integration of major/trace element chemistry and Sr-Nd isotope composition, especially for sediments finer than 63  μm, which are often considered to be tracers of the average REE composition of the source regions and dominate the volumetric flux to the ocean (e.g., Yang and Wang 2011). These authors argue for a strong link between the REE chemistry of the river sands and that of the dominant sources, which they infer to be in {{the upper reaches of the}} river based on the similarity of the REE composition in the Jinshajiang (upper reaches) and delta sands. <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2002) also showed that REEs are generally enriched in clay and silt fractions, but depleted in the sand fraction, suggesting that grain size may be crucial control on sediment chemistry, something that has been documented in other SE Asian rivers (e.g., Clift <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008).|$|R

This would explain the presence of mass loss in the range between 864 and 1000 °C. The production of CH 4 occurs significantly at temperatures from 500 to 600 °C and, as well as the production of H 2, can be associated to the lignin aromatic rings and to the O-CH 3 functional groups (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007).|$|R

The BEX 1 referred in the publications (Quentmeier <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2005; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2002) is actually BEX 2. BEX 2, represented by the Genbank accession number AF 220189, was called BEX 1 by <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> and others (Quentmeier <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2005; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2002).

30|$|Additionally, LCN 2 {{is a novel}} {{regulator}} of angiogenesis {{in human}} breast cancer (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013). LCN 2 functions to protect matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) against degradation, which further enhances its enzymatic activity and facilitates angiogenesis and tumor growth (Fernandez <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2005). Overexpression of LCN 2 in MCF 7 breast cancer cells increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key angiogenic activator (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013). The LCN 2 -induced VEGF is mediated through HIF 1 α and that LCN 2 regulates HIF 1 α through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013). However, some studies reported that inhibition of LCN 2 results in breast tumorigenesis in two different mouse models (Berger <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2010; Leng <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011).|$|R

30|$|The E-twenty six (ets) {{transcription}} factor GA binding protein (GABP) is a tetrameric {{transcription factor}} complex that contains GABPα and GABPβ proteins. Deletion of GABPα induced cell cycle arrest and profound loss of hematopoietic progenitor cells in bone marrow (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013). Recently, <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> identified the serine-threonine kinase protein kinase D 2 (PRKD 2) {{as a potential}} effector of GABP in HSCs through bioinformatic screen. PRKD 2 can rescue the growth of GABPα-null Bcr-Abl-expressing cells whereas inhibiting PRKD 2 expression decreased cell cycling (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013). These data indicate that GABP {{is essential for the}} cell cycle entry of HSC and CML development and may offer a potential therapeutic target for CML.|$|R
30|$|Saliva harbors {{a complex}} {{microbial}} community (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Zarco <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012).

Moreover, growing evidence from our research groups and others suggested that organismal structure of saliva microbiota is correlated with disease state such as caries (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012), gingivitis (Huang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011) and periodontitis (Griffen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011), thus the organismal structure of saliva microbiota can potentially {{serve as a}} proxy to the oral health of the host (Nasidze <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Kanasi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010).

30|$|In Papatheou <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (2015), the {{potential}} of using SCADA data for the condition monitoring of wind turbines was explored. The power curve of each individual wind turbine in a wind farm is produced by a machine learning method using the SCADA data collected from the wind turbine. The constructed power curve of each wind turbine is then used to predict the power curves of other wind turbines. The residual error between the actual and predicted power produced was then used for the condition monitoring of wind turbines. The condition monitoring, fault diagnosis and reliability of major wind turbine components and sub-systems, such as blades (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015), drive trains (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015), power converters (Zhou <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015), gearboxes (Yoon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Du <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015) and bearings (Ming <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015; Gerber <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2015), were well covered by the selected contributions.

30|$|Protein kinase {{activity}} of PKM 2 has been recently recognized and plays critical roles in tumorigenesis (Gao <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2012; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2012 b; <b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2011). This spectacular ability needs PKM 2 located in nucleus. Upon EGFR activation, PKM 2 was phosphorylated by ERK 2, which recruits Importin α 5 to facilitate its nuclear translocation (<b>Yang</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2012 c). In nucleus, PKM 2 mainly exists as a dimer with high {{activity of}} protein kinase and low activity of pyruvate kinase. Interestingly, {{as shown by}} Wang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> these dimers are formed {{with the loss of}} intermolecular interaction on the C-C′ interface, suggesting that regulation on this interface may be responsible for the switch from pyruvate kinase to protein kinase.
