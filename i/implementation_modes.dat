The paper shows how structuration concepts enable a combined analysis of actors' interactions with a technology and of the interaction among these actors from different institutional contexts. In this example, fragmented multi-actor agency induced an inconsistent implementation mode, leading to unsuccessful telecare appropriation.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to determine how}} and why world class manufacturing (WCM) practices are implemented, and to examine potential links between the introduction {{of these kinds of}} practices and performance measurement systems. There is theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest that WCM practices can be categorised into one or more of: total quality management (TQM), just in time manufacturing (JIT) and employee involvement (El). Four different WCM <b>implementation</b> <b>modes</b> are also identified in the literature. Research in the areas of management control and performance measurement suggest that in order for companies to assess the benefit of implementing WCM practices, there is an increasing necessity for them to use both financial and non-financial measures effectively. This literature thus provides the basis for the theoretical framework used in the study. The complete rubber mouldings segment of the Irish automotive component manufacturing industry is examined using a case-based design, to address both the initial research questions and the research propositions developed following literature reviews. The empirical data includes information from: preliminary interviews in academia, consultancy and government agencies; in-company interviews; plant tours; and a performance measurement questionnaire administered to three management levels in each of the five organisations studied. The findings suggest that firms can utilise both a main and secondary mode to introduce WCM practices, and that the overall implementation mode used is both affected by and affects other variables. This thesis contributes to research in a number of ways. First it provides an indepth study of WCM practices and performance measurement in an Irish context. It also develops and applies a classification of the <b>implementation</b> <b>modes</b> used to introduce WCM practices. Finally, it identifies internal and external factors associated with both the introduction of WCM practices as well as the performance measurement system utilised...|$|E

40|$|Governments deploy {{a mix of}} {{different}} innovation policy instruments to stimulate firm-level innovation additionality. Firms often receive multiple instruments simultaneously, and additionality can depend on interactions within this instrument mix. Depending on how consistent different instruments are {{with one another in}} terms of their underlying rationales, goals, and <b>implementation</b> <b>modes,</b> and how stable this consistency is over time, interaction effects can be complementary, substitutive or neutral. Consistency is thus an important means of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the instrument mix at achieving policy objectives. This has important implications for policymaking. To explore these implications, we build a conceptual framework for the ex-ante and ex-post impact evaluation of innovation policy instrument mixes. Applying this framework, we construct a unique panel dataset capturing the core innovation policy instruments available to firms in Ireland, and employ a novel microeconometric technique to estimate the degree of temporal consistency within the instrument mix. Our results highlight the importance of temporal dynamics when evaluating innovation policy instrument mix consistency...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the stochastic optimization of a function unknown in closed form {{which can only}} be estimated based on measurements or simulations. We consider parallel implementations of a class of stochastic optimization methods that consist of the iterative application of a descent algorithm to a sequence of approximation functions converging in some sense to the function of interest. After discussing classical parallel modes of implementations (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, random, Gauss-Southwell), we devise effort-saving <b>implementation</b> <b>modes</b> where the pace of application of the considered descent algorithm along individual coordinates is coordinated with the evolution of the estimated accuracy of the convergent function sequence.

40|$|Aerodynamic shape {{design and}} {{optimization}} problems based on evolutionary algorithms and surrogate evaluation tools, i. e., the so-called metamodels, have recently found widespread use. Using metamodels, trained either separately from {{or during the}} optimization loop, a considerable reduction in the overall computing cost can be achieved. To support metamodel-based evolutionary algorithms, a class of new metamodels which utilize both known responses and response gradients for their training is proposed. The new gradient-assisted metamodels are extensions of standard multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis function networks. To demonstrate the prediction capabilities of the proposed metamodels and investigate different <b>implementation</b> <b>modes</b> within search algorithms along with the relevant CPU cost, a number of 2 D and 3 D aerodynamic shape (namely airfoils and turbomachinery blades) design problems are analyzed. Single- and two-objective problems, aiming at designing shapes that reproduce known pressure distributions at specific operating points, are considered. The exact evaluation tool is a numerical solver of the compressible fluid flow equations. The necessary gradient of the objective function is obtained by formulating and numerically solving adjoint equations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidics tools {{have been}} {{developing}} rapidly {{over the past}} decade, as they offer unparalleled ability for controlling nucleation and tracking crystallisation events inside very large numbers of individual nanolitre-size droplets. They have demonstrated a significant potential for screening protein crystallization conditions and for the direct determination of inorganic products solubility curves. The accepted basis for analysing microfluidics data is the probabilistic nucleation model originally proposed by Pound and La Mer (1952). Given {{the significance of this}} model for the purpose of analysing microfluidics data, the paper conducts a review of its hypotheses, usage and applicability. A step-by-step derivation of the model equations confirms that the time variation of the proportion of empty droplets which microfluidics experiments can provide with high accuracy is indeed the recommended method for estimation of nucleation kinetic parameters from microfluidics experiments. The paper shows that, depending on its implementation, the model predicts different rates of appearance of crystals inside individual droplets. The paper focuses on two distinct <b>implementation</b> <b>modes,</b> referred to as constant supersaturation and single nucleation event modes. By confronting model prediction with microfluidics measurements for eflucimibe in octanol, the paper finds that both modes yield different model predictions, shedding light on the potential and limits of the probabilistic nucleation model for the analysis of microfluidics data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present the {{implementation}} and performance evaluation of security functionalities at the link layer of IEEE 802. 15. 4 -compliant IoT devices. Specifically, we implement the required encryption and authentication mechanisms entirely in software {{and as well}} exploit the hardware ciphers that are made available by our IoT platform. Moreover, we present quantitative results on the memory footprint, the execution time and the energy consumption of selected <b>implementation</b> <b>modes</b> and discuss some relevant tradeoffs. As expected, we find that hardware-based implementations are not only much faster, leading to latencies shorter than two orders of magnitude compared to software-based security suites, but also provide substantial savings in terms of ROM memory occupation, i. e. up to six times, and energy consumption. Furthermore, the addition of hardware-based security support at the link layer only marginally impacts the network lifetime metric, leading to worst-case reductions of just 2 % compared to the case where no security is employed. This {{is due to the}} fact that energy consumption is dominated by other factors, including the transmission and reception of data packets and the control traffic that is required to maintain the network structures for routing and data collection. On the other hand, entirely software-based implementations are to be avoided as the network lifetime reduction in this case can be as high as 25 %...|$|E
