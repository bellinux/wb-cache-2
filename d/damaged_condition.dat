5|$|In Italian service, Beograd and Ljubljana were repaired, re-armed, and renamed Sebenico and Lubiana respectively. Sebenico was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Italian Navy in August 1941, and Lubiana in October or November 1942. They both served mainly as convoy escorts between Italy and the Aegean and North Africa, with Sebenico completing more than 100 convoy escort missions over a two-year period. Neither ship {{was involved in}} any notable action. On 1 April 1943, Lubiana was either sunk off the Tunisian coast by British aircraft, or ran aground in the Gulf of Tunis and was lost. Sebenico was captured by the Germans in Venice after the Italian Armistice in September 1943 in a <b>damaged</b> <b>condition.</b> She was repaired, re-armed, and renamed TA43 and entered service in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). TA43 served on escort and mine-laying duties in the northern Adriatic Sea, but saw little action. She was either damaged by artillery fire on 30 April 1945 at Trieste then scuttled, or just scuttled on 1 May.|$|E

One had been damaged in a landing accident, two {{were at the}} workshops in Zagreb being repaired, and the fourth unserviceable machine was in a badly <b>damaged</b> <b>condition</b> at Bosanski Aleksandrovac. That day and the next, the 107th Fighter Squadron patrolled over Bosnia but did not make any contact with the enemy. Two machines conducted a combat air patrol over the airfield of the 8th Bomber Regiment at Nova Topola. This pattern continued the following day without incident, but patrol duration and coverage was limited by the short range of the aircraft. On 8 April, a patrol unsuccessfully gave chase to a lone German reconnaissance aircraft, {{and later in the}} day, one of the IK-2s force landed, leaving seven operational aircraft.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} {{relationships between}} traumatic symptoms and environmental <b>damage</b> <b>conditions</b> among children {{who survived the}} 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. METHODS: The subjects were 12, 524 children in kindergartens, elementary schools, and junior high schools in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms for Children 15 items (PTSSC- 15), a self-completion questionnaire on traumatic symptoms, was distributed to the children and a questionnaire regarding environmental <b>damage</b> <b>conditions</b> affecting the children was distributed to their teachers. Of 12, 524 questionnaires distributed, an effective response was obtained from 11, 692 (93. 3 %). RESULTS: The PTSSC- 15 score was significantly higher in females than in males among 4 (th) to 6 (th) grade students in elementary schools and among junior high school students. In terms of traumatic symptoms and environmental <b>damage</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{with the exception of}} kindergartners, children who had their houses damaged or experienced separation from family members had a significantly higher PTSSC- 15 score than children who did not experience environmental damage. Except for kindergartners and 4 (th) - to 6 (th) -grade elementary school students, children who experienced evacuation had a significantly higher PTSSC- 15 score. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated relationships between traumatic symptoms and environmental <b>damage</b> <b>conditions</b> in children who had suffered from the disaster. Factors examined in studying the relationship between environmental <b>damage</b> <b>conditions</b> and traumatic symptoms were gender, age, house damage, evacuation experience, and bereavement experience.

In the second part of this article, the frame building scale model and the performed experimental tests, leading to the dynamic identification of the structure, are described.

The crew was ordered by signals from Kormoran to abandon ship, but the merchant sailors did not comply until after the raider resumed fire, having observed an attempt to man the ship's stern gun.

Annual failure probabilities are determined up to 25 -year ship lifetime, accounting for time-variant corrosion wastage of structural members contributing to hull girder strength. Statistical properties of hull girder capacity are determined by Monte Carlo simulation, applying three correlation models among corrosion wastages of structural members contributing to hull girder strength, namely no correlation, full correlation and full correlation among wastages of structural members belonging to the same category of compartments. A modified incremental-iterative method is applied, to account for instantaneous neutral axis rotation, in case of asymmetrical <b>damage</b> <b>conditions,</b> as for collision and grounding events. Incidence of intact/damage condition, as well as correlation among corrosion wastages, on annual sagging/hogging time-variant failure probability is investigated and discussed.

40|$|Expansive soils have damage light {{structures}} due to {{movement of}} soil {{which was a}} common problem all around the world. Soils exhibiting expansive properties were common throughout Australia. The damage to light structures founded on expansive soils in Victoria occurred mainly in properties built on quaternary basaltic clays and Tertiary to Ordovician clays. A {{review of existing literature}} in the area of expansive soils showed a lack of a thorough scientific diagnostic of the damage to light structures founded on expansive soils. Very few studies had been performed on damage to light structures on expansive soils in Victoria. There were no models so far to predict <b>damage</b> <b>condition</b> to light structures. More over, most of the reports on damage to light structures on expansive soils in Victoria were poorly documented. The aim of this research project was to develop a model to predict the <b>damage</b> <b>condition</b> of light structure on expansive soils in Victoria. A hybrid Neural Network trained with Genetic Algorithm was adopted for the de-velopment of the Predictive <b>Damage</b> <b>Condition</b> model. The Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm toolboxes from MATLAB &# 0174; version 7. 1 were used. The development of a Predictive <b>Damage</b> <b>Condition</b> model was driven by the shortage of defined quanti-tative studies and methods of selecting the factors that influenced the damage to light structure on expansive soils. The data used was based on information extracted from the Building Housing Commission which was recorded by different engineering companies based only on the tenants complain and site investigation of the properties. A series of factors that were believed to be dominant in influencing damage to light structures were chosen including: structural type, foundation, the presence of vegetation, soil type, age, and climate change. The model showed that it was able to resolve the problems facing light structures on expansive soils. First and foremost, the Predictive <b>Damage</b> <b>Condition</b> model was able to predict the <b>damage</b> <b>condition</b> or <b>damage</b> class using different combinations of fac-tors. It was also possible to identify the factors contributing to the damage of the struc-ture and to assess their relative importance in causing damage to light structures on expansive soil. It was found that the construction footing and vegetation were the most important among all the other input parameters. Change in Thornthwaite Moisture In-dex or climate was ranked second. Construction wall and age, were ranked third and fourth respectively while both region and geology were ranked fifth.
