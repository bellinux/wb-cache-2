5|$|The Battle of Machias (August 13–14, 1777) was an {{amphibious assault}} on the Massachusetts town of Machias (in present-day eastern Maine) by British forces during the American Revolutionary War. Local militia aided by Indian allies {{successfully}} prevented British troops from landing. The raid, led by Commodore Sir George Collier, was executed {{in an attempt to}} <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> planned second assault on Fort Cumberland, which had been besieged in November 1776. The British forces landed below Machias, seized a ship, and raided a storehouse.|$|E
5|$|When the dwarves take {{possession}} of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, an heirloom of Thorin's dynasty, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the Iron Hills, reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> war, but Thorin is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, {{after signing}} his first solo career record deal, Osbourne bit the <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> dove {{during a meeting}} with CBS Records {{executives}} in Los Angeles. Apparently {{he had planned to}} release doves into the air as a sign of peace, but due to being intoxicated at the time, he instead grabbed a dove and bit its head off. He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping from his lips. Despite its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.|$|E

Bevin took a conciliatory line at the 11 October 1945 Gen 75 Committee meeting, only to take a harder line at the one a week later, Unusually, the matter was placed before the full Cabinet. Hopes were expressed that Britain {{might be able to}} broker a deal that would <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> schism between the United States and the Soviet Union.

25|$|While Yale is {{somewhat}} overlooked in crime histories, {{he was one}} of New York's leading gangsters in the 1920s. In the initial aftermath of Yale's murder, leadership of his family was taken over by Anthony Carfano. Four months later Joe Masseria orchestrated the murder of mobster Salvatore D'Aquilla. The December 1928 Hotel Statler meeting in Cleveland was most probably called to <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> potential New York gang war. Roughly half of Yale's men and territory were absorbed by the D'Aquila family, which was now led by Al Mineo, while the rest remained under Carfano. Yale's murder {{turned out to be the}} first in a series of events that facilitated Masseria's attempt to consolidate all of New York's Mafia families under his control, which eventually resulted in the Castellammarese War.|$|E
25|$|The {{phrase is}} said to have {{originated}} one day when Coggeshall's town clock chimed 11 times at noon. When the villagers heard that the town clock at Lexden had struck 12 times at 11 o'clock, they rode to the town to collect the missing stroke. Other jobs included winching up a cow onto the church roof to eat the grass growing there, knocking down one of two windmills as there would not be enough wind for both of them, attempting to divert the course of the river with hurdles, hanging sheets over roads to prevent the wind from blowing disease into the town, chopping the <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> lamb to free it from a gate, removing stairs from a house to stop flood water entering and some appropriated from other 'fool centres', for example the classic 'fishing for the moon'.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a North Carolina {{grand jury}} handed down indictments against pig-farm workers on Belcross Farm in Camden County, the first indictments for animal cruelty on a factory {{farm in the}} United States, after a three-month PETA {{investigation}} produced film of the workers beating the animals. In 2004, PETA published {{the results of an}} eight-month undercover investigation in a West Virginia Pilgrim's Pride slaughterhouse that supplies chickens to KFC. The New York Times reported the investigation as showing workers stomping on live chickens, throwing dozens against a wall, tearing the <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> chicken to write graffiti, strangling one with a latex glove, and squeezing birds until they exploded. Yum Brands, owner of KFC, called the video appalling and threatened to stop purchasing from Pilgrim's Pride if no changes were made. Pilgrim's Pride subsequently fired 11 employees and introduced an anti-cruelty pledge for workers to sign.|$|E

He was also hired as the illusionist for the planned 2009 Michael Jackson O2 arena concerts before Jackson's death. In 2013, Angel had a cameo in the feature film The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, and Jim Carrey's character in the movie [...] "Steve Gray" [...] has been said to be modeled after Angel.

500|$|This {{friction}} {{between the two men}} and their respective camps boiled over after the September 19 Battle of Freeman's Farm. [...] In that battle, Arnold was forceful in wanting to move troops out of the strong American fortifications to <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> flanking maneuver. [...] Gates grudgingly allowed this, and Arnold's troops sent out to counter the British advance precipitated the battle. [...] It has been widely recounted in histories of this battle that General Arnold was on the field, directing some of the action. However, John Luzader, a former park historian at the Saratoga National Historical Park, carefully documents the evolution of this story and believes it is without foundation in contemporary materials, and that Arnold remained at Gates' headquarters, receiving news and dispatching orders through messengers. Arnold biographer James Kirby Martin, however, disagrees with Luzader, arguing that Arnold played a more active role at Freeman's Farm by directing patriot troops into position and possibly leading some charges before being ordered back to headquarters by Gates.|$|E

According to Osbourne in the booklet to the 2002 edition of Diary of a Madman, the bat was not only alive but managed to bite him, resulting in Osbourne being treated for rabies. Also that year, Osbourne urinated on the Alamo while on tour in San Antonio and while drunk.|$|E
2500|$|Boxing at {{that time}} was very {{different}} from the boxing of today. [...] There were few rules. [...] There was no boxing organization to oversee the sport or lay down regulations or procedures. [...] There was no formal end to the fights: [...] they would go on until one fighter was unable to continue or would give up. [...] A now obsolete practice was that of the seconds. The seconds would wait in the ring during the fight, and assist the boxer between rounds. [...] There were no restrictions regarding fight tactics. [...] For example, a fighter could hit his opponent's <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> corner post, or wrestle his opponent to the ground, or pull his hair, or wrap his arm around his neck in a choking motion and then hit him in the face with the other hand. [...] The fights were very severe and often brutal, and they would continue until the end.|$|E
2500|$|Cale {{released}} Animal Justice in 1977, an EP notable {{particularly for}} the epic [...] "Hedda Gabler", based very loosely on the Ibsen play. His loud, abrasive and confrontational live performances fitted well with the punk rock scene developing {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic Ocean. Cale took to wearing a hockey goaltender's mask onstage (as evinced by the cover of Guts , a compilation drawn from the Island trilogy after the label withheld Helen of Troy in the United States); this look predated the creation of Friday the 13th's villain, Jason Voorhees, by several years. During one concert in Croydon, Cale chopped the <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> dead chicken with a meat cleaver, leading his band to walk offstage in protest. Cale's drummer – a vegetarian – was so bothered he quit the group. Cale mocks his decision on [...] "Chicken Shit" [...] from the Animal Justice EP. Cale has admitted that some of his paranoia and erratic behaviour at this time was associated with heavy cocaine use.|$|E

2500|$|On October 12, 2007, The Hellacopters {{announced}} {{they would be}} breaking up after releasing their seventh full-length album <b>Head</b> <b>Off,</b> <b>a</b> collection of cover songs. According to the band, {{the reason for the}} breakup was to quit while they were still on top and not because of tension within the band. The album was originally presented as a regular Hellacopters studio album so that the fans would keep an open mind about the music. Håkansson also felt that it was fitting for the fans to get to know eleven new great bands to check out after the band's break up. The album debuted at number four in the Swedish charts and in the top 20 in Finland and Norway. The last Hellacopters shows were played at Debaser Medis in Stockholm October 25 and 26; the concerts were filmed and streamed live on the band's MySpace page. Several friends and collaborators of the band were in the audience, including members of Sahara Hotnights, Entombed, Burst, Stefan Sundström, Texas Terri, Pernilla Andersson and [...] "Demons" [...] (who was the opening band for most of the dates on the tour).

2500|$|In April 1942, Japanese carrier-based {{aircraft}} attacked the ports of Colombo and Trincomalee in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), in {{what came to}} be called the Easter Sunday Raid, and destroyed the heavy cruisers [...] and , the aircraft carrier , and some lighter naval craft in the Indian Ocean waters off that isand. [...] Around the same time, Japanese light warships and aircraft sank approximately 100,000 tons of merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal, and Japanese aircraft dropped a handful of bombs on the port of Vizakapatam, on India's southeastern coast, causing panic there and along that coast. According to the war despatches of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the army in India, both the War Office in London and the commander of the British Eastern Fleet, then employed in Madagascar, acknowledged that the fleet was powerless to mount serious opposition to a Japanese naval attack on Ceylon, southern- or eastern India, or shipping in the Bay of Bengal. [...] The Japanese raids in the Bay of Bengal also worsened an ongoing transportation problem in eastern India. Before 1942, the railway systems in Assam and eastern Bengal, {{as well as in the}} Ganges Delta in Bengal, both single-line metre gauge, had offered poor access to those regions, as the major waterways crisscrossing them, the Brahmaputra and the Ganges Delta channels, flowed entirely unbridged along their lengths. In 1942, the Japanese raids put additional strain on the railways, which later that year also had to face the flooding in the Brahmaputra, a malaria epidemic which was the worst in years, and the Quit India movement which targeted road and rail communication. [...] According to scholar Iftekhar Iqbal, the Japanese attack had a longer term effect as well; for throughout the period of the Bengal famine, the rail transportation of relief and civil supplies was compromised not only by the railways' military obligations, but also by the dismantling of the rail tracks that had been carried out in some areas of eastern Bengal in May 1942 to <b>head</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> potential Japanese invasion.|$|E
