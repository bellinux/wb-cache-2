There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
