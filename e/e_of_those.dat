The principal ingredient of our analysis is the assumption that individuals desire to occupy a (subjectively) better position than their peers. This is quite a primi-tive starting point in that it does not give any reference to what is actually regarded as ‘‘status’ ’ in the society. We call this basic postulate negative interdependence, and study its implications. In particular, combining this assumption with some other basic postulates that are widely used {{in a number of other}} branches of the theory of individual choice, we axiomatize the rela-tive income hypothesis, and obtain an operational representation of inter-dependent preferences. ...|$|E

After using the general relativistic expression for the electromagnetic scalar potential in the magnetar magnetosphere, we find that larger compactness parameters of the star as well as larger inclination angles between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment produce death-lines well above the majority of known magnetars. This is consistent with the observational evidence of no regular radio emission from the magnetars in the frequency range typical for the ordinary pulsars. On the contrary, when oscillations of the magnetar are taken into account, the death-lines shift downward and the conditions necessary for the generation of radio emission in the magnetosphere are met. Present observations showing a close connection between the burst activity of magnetars and the generation of the radio emission in the magnetar magnetosphere are naturally accounted for within our interpretation.

40|$|Breast feeding {{offers a}} number of short- and {{long-term}} advantages to mothers and their children. Many population-based studies have shown that, e. g., breast-fed infants are at lower risk of later overweight and associated disturbances than formula-fed infants. Furthermore, numerous studies point to an independent positive influence of breast feeding on psychomotor and cognitive development. Therefore, breast feeding could, {{as a measure of}} primary prevention, be of particular importance for offspring of diabetic mothers who are at increased risk of developing overweight and associated disturbances and often present with delayed psychomotor and cognitive development, as compared to children of healthy mothers. However, this has rarely been investigated before. Here, we carried out a two-part epidemiological study as well as a complementary experimental study to characterize consequences of ingesting breast milk from diabetic mothers. In the Kaulsdorf Cohort Study (KCS), a prospective cohort study in children of diabetic mothers, we investigated consequences of ingesting diabetic breast milk (DBM) on later overweight risk and on psychomotor and cognitive development. Childhood overweight risk was increased in children who had ingested more DBM during the early neonatal period (first week of life). Univariate analysis revealed that DBM intake during the late neonatal period (second to fourth week of life) was associated with a doubled risk of overweight in childhood. Adjustment for {{a number of}} confounders did not change this effect. However, after adjustment only for the DBM volume ingested during the first neonatal week no independent effect of late neonatal DBM ingestion was observed. Early neonatal DBM ingestion had a dose-dependent positive influence on psychomotor development, but showed a dose-dependent negative impact on an important cognitive parameter, namely on reaching the developmental milestone speaking first words. Cross-fostering normal pups to diabetic rat dams led to hypothalamic malprogramming in terms of an acquired neuro-endocrine disposition to hyperphagia, overweight, and diabetogenic disturbances: Despite unchanged peripheral concentrations of glucose, insulin, and leptin, offspring suckled by diabetic dams presented with an up-regulation of orexigenic neuropeptides, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> stimulating food intake and body weight gain, and with a down-regulation of anorexigenic neuropeptides, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> inhibiting food intake and body weight gain, in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Taken together, early neonatal ingestion of diabetic breast milk might increase later overweight risk and retard cognitive development in offspring of diabetic mothers. In the cross-fostering model, exposure to maternal diabetes during lactation through intake of diabetic breast milk led to profound structural and functional alterations in hypothalamic nuclei which are decisively involved in the lifelong regulation of food intake, body weight, and metabolism. Further studies on possible positive and negative consequences of infant nutrition with diabetic breast milk are urgently needed. In general, breast feeding with its long-lasting consequences might be an important paradigm of perinatal programming of health and disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of work-family balance (WFB) {{is an area}} where increasing attention is being paid nowadays since it relates to the health, satisfaction, personal development of employees, to the care for their children, youths and elder family members. The purpose of the paper is to explore the connection between the voluntary job change and the potential improvement of the work-family balance since it was assumed that changing the job voluntarily might bring to a higher WFB as employees could satisfy their needs more effectively in a new working environment, chosen by their own will. Data were collected using a combination of CAWI (computer assisted web interview) and pen and pencil methods. Employees from various companies and public sector organizations from Slovenia were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of family-work balancers, i. <b>e.</b> <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> who help with balancing employees ‟ work and family domains.

The exceptions are the group of employees with children (in a positive direction) and the group of employees without children and no help in the household (in a negative direction). The employees do not use a job change as a tool for increasing WFB. This is probably als...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently several {{conflicting}} hypotheses {{concerning the}} basal phylogenetic relationships within the Phasmatodea (stick and leaf insects) have emerged. In previous studies, musculature of the abdomen {{proved to be}} quite informative for identifying basal taxa among Phasmatodea and led to conclusions regarding the basal splitting events within the group. However, this character complex was not studied thoroughly for a representative number of species, and usually muscle innervation was omitted. In the present study the musculature and nerve topography of mid-abdominal segments in both sexes of seven phasmid species are described and compared in detail {{for the first time}} including all putative basal taxa, e. g. members of Timema, Agathemera, Phylliinae, Aschiphasmatinae and Heteropteryginae. The ground pattern of the muscle and nerve arrangement of mid-abdominal segments, i. <b>e.</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> not modified due to association with the thorax or genitalia, is reconstructed. In Timema, the inner ventral longitudinal muscles are present, whereas they are lost in all remaining Phasmatodea (Euphasmatodea). The ventral longitudinal muscles in the abdomen of Agathemera, which span the whole length of each segment, do not represent the plesiomorphic condition as previously assumed, but might be a result of secondary elongation of the external ventral longitudinal muscles. Sexual dimorphism, common within the Phasmatodea, also applies to the muscle arrangement in the abdomen of some species. Only in the females of Haaniella dehaanii (Heteropteryginae) and Phyllium celebicum (Phylliinae) the ventral external longitudinal muscles are elongated and span the length of the whole segment, possibly as a result of convergent evolution...|$|E
