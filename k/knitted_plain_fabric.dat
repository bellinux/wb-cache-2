In this project, the <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> wool <b>fabrics</b> produced on commongauge flat-knitting machines were investigated {{in terms of a}} wide range of yarn linear densities, loop lengths, tightness factors, yarn twists and fibre diameters.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{the effects}} of yarn parameters, on the {{bursting}} strength of the <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were examined {{with the help of}} artificial neural networks. In order to obtain yarns having different properties such as tenacity, elongation, unevenness, the yarns were produced from six different types of cotton. In addition to cotton type, yarns were produced in four different counts having three different twist coefficients. Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to analyze the bursting strength of the <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> As independent variables, yarn properties such as tenacity, elongation, unevenness, count, twists per inch together with the fabric property number of wales and courses per cm were chosen. For the determination of the best network architecture, three levels of number of neurons, number of epochs, learning rate and momentum coefficient were tried according to the orthogonal experimental design. After the best neural network for predicting the bursting strength of the <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> was obtained, statistical analysis of the obtained neural network was performed.

Abrasion behaviors of the fabrics are assessed bymeasuring the weight loss and the color values after four different increasing abrasion cycles. The bamboo/cotton fabrics reveal the highest K/S and C * values, but the lowest L * values before abrasion. The lowest weight loss values are obtained for the bamboo/cotton fabrics. Regarding the color properties after abrasion, the bamboo/cotton fabrics show the highest K/S and C * values, but the lowest L * values {{as in the case of}} those obtained before abrasion. The highest color difference values (E *) occurred between the beginning and the end of the abrasion test (20000 cycles) and are observed for the bamboo/cotton fabrics.

40|$|Moisture {{management}} {{is a complicated}} process which {{is known to be}} influenced by a variety of fabric characteristics such as fibre nature (hydrophilic or hydrophobic), porosity and thickness. There are different aspects of the moisture management properties of textile materials since water transport in textile materials can be in the form of liquid and vapour. The ability of textile materials to transfer water vapour allows the human body to keep thermal balance due to evaporation. With stronger physical activity of a person when the body produces a large amount of heat, the skin perspiration increases (in order to regulate the body temperature) and liquid sweat should be taken from the skin, otherwise it will worsen the sense of comfort. The aim of this research was to investigate the factors influencing moisture management properties of <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> at the three scale levels, i. e. microscopic (fibre type), mesoscopic (yarn geometry) and macroscopic (<b>fabric</b> porosity) levels. <b>Plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were produced from the two-assembled hemp, cotton and viscose yarns under controlled conditions so as to be comparable in basic construction characteristics, but varying in yarns geometry. Evaporative resistance test reflecting vapour transport and water distribution test reflecting liquid transport in the knitted fabrics were conducted. To determine the statistical importance of the results, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. As a consequence of the geometry and deformation behaviour of the fibres used and spinning techniques applied, the yarns differed in both packing density and surface geometry, thus determining the pore distribution. Due to loose structure of the cotton yarn, the cotton knitted fabric was characterised by the lowest free open surface (macroporosity) exhibiting the lowest both water vapour and liquid permeability. Although having the highest macroporosity, the water vapour and liquid transport capability of the hemp knitted fabric was lower than that of the viscose knit. The best moisture management properties of the viscose knitted fabric were resulted from viscose affinity for water absorption and increased surface area of the viscose yarn. The results obtained proved that variations in any of the hierarchical structure levels can modify moisture transport ability of textile fabrics. Therefore, the moisture management properties of textile materials can be guided in a desired direction by the appropriate selection of fibres and careful design of yarn structure.

In order to do so a mechanism for <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> structure deformation in plane was proposed, implemented and tested on a range of real samples. The problem of extension of a knitted structure is complicated by the combination of non-linear properties derived from both the characteristics of the knitted structure and the properties of the yam.

The proposed model of mechanical behaviour of knitted fabrics is an analogue of the thin membrane problem in mechanics. The model developed is applicable to a wide range of mechanical problems where it is possible to assume that fabric is a thin membrane with zero bending rigidity. To facilitate the mechanical properties of the proposed model, standard dimensional parameters of fabric and yam combined with the mechanical properties have been used.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the media have {{highlighted}} the damage {{of the ozone layer}} and the resulting increase of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the earth’s surface. Prolonged and repeated, both occupational and recreational, sun exposure of the population causes some detrimental effects. Clothing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important tools for UV protection. It is generally accepted that synthetic fibres provide a high UV protection capability of textiles, while cellulose fibres (cotton, linen, hemp, viscose) have a low UV absorption capacity. However, natural pigments, pectin and waxes in natural cellulose fibers, and lignin in hemp fibers, act as UV absorbers having a favorable effect on UPF of grey-state fabrics. Bearing in mind the trend of reintroduction of hemp fibers as a source of eco-friendly textiles, there is a serious lack of study about the potential of hemp materials in terms of UV protection. Folded yarn is a complex yarn composed of two or more component yarns arranged parallel and twisted together to make a “new quality” yarn. Folding of yarns is an operation undertaken in order to modify single-yarn properties to an appreciable degree. There are very few investigations concerning the relationship between the yarn properties and UV protection effectiveness of the fabric made there from. In addition, there is no any result in the scientific literature about the influence of yarn folding on UV protection properties of textile materials. Having this in mind, for our research the idea was to evaluate the effect of yarn folding in this regard. The <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> composed of single or two-folded hemp yarn were compared in terms of UV protection properties. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as the quantitative measurement of the material effectiveness to protect the human skin against UVR, was determined for the textile materials by in vitro test method according to the European standard EN 13758. The knitted fabrics construction and physical properties were also determined. Bearing in mind that <b>plain</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> are particularly susceptible to relaxation, they were subjected to relaxation and shrinkage by wetting process, and testing procedure was repeated on the water-treated samples. The results obtained indicated that the folding operation influences UV protection properties of knitted fabrics through an influence on a loop configuration, i. e. the fabric openness. Relaxation and shrinkage of the knitted fabrics due to wet relaxation caused the reduction of macro-porosity increasing the UPF of the knitted fabrics. Although the knitted fabric produced from single hemp yarn was characterized by higher UPF, the UVR transmittance of the folded hemp yarn knitted fabric after wet relaxation placed it in the “excellent UV protection category” (according to European Standard EN 13758 - 2). This fact together with the better thermal comfort manifested itself in higher air permeability, confirmed the potential of folding operation in terms of UV protection properties of textile materials...|$|R
