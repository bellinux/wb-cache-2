5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{became the}} driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement <b>for</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> hope as well as faith to attain salvation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song.

5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking <b>for</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

25|$|By 2004, it was {{observed}} that since the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned. She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad movie choices, agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies <b>for</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.|$|E

25|$|Allegations {{of working}} with the Japanese do not seem to have harmed Na's {{reputation}} as one of the founders of Korean cinema either in his own time or in the following decades. Na's funeral procession was led by a band playing Arirang, and was attended by mourning crowds in spite of the rain. The newspaper Chosun Ilbo's November 1938 audience poll for the best silent Korean films put Arirang in the number one spot. Two other films by Na Woon-gyu were also on the top ten list: Sarangul Chajaso (Looking <b>for</b> <b>Love),</b> <b>and</b> Punguna (The Man with Great Ambition) (1926). Na's last film, Omongnyo (1937) was second on the list of best sound films made in Korea.|$|E
25|$|White is {{the most}} common color and can symbolize gratitude, purity, or the {{cleansing}} of negative influences. Red is <b>for</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> passion. It can also signal emotional stability. The color gold signifies economic power, success, money, and prosperity. Green symbolizes justice, legal matters, or unity with loved ones. Amber or dark yellow indicates health. Images with this color can be seen in rehabilitation centers, especially those for drug addiction and alcoholism. Black represents total protection against black magic or sorcery, or conversely negative magic or for force directed against rivals and enemies. Blue candles and images of the saint indicate wisdom, which is favored by students and those in education. It {{can also be used to}} petition for health. Brown is used to invoke spirits from beyond while purple, like yellow, usually symbolizes health.|$|E
25|$|After MacDonald and Eddy left MGM in 1943, they {{appeared}} frequently on radio together while planning several unrealized films {{that would have}} reunited them onscreen. Eddy was upset at how his first film turned out at Universal, so their joint project at that studio fell through. They next sought independent financing for team projects like East Wind and Crescent Carnival, a book optioned by MacDonald. Other thwarted projects were The Rosary, a 1910 best seller (which Nelson Eddy pitched for a team comeback at MGM), The Desert Song, and a remake of The Vagabond King, plus two movie treatments written by Eddy, Timothy Waits <b>for</b> <b>Love</b> <b>and</b> All Stars Don't Spangle. In 1954, Eddy pulled out of yet another proposed team film {{to be made in}} England when he learned MacDonald was investing her own funds. He had invested in 1944's Knickerbocker Holiday, and had lost money.|$|E
