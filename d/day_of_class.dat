500|$|Murray's {{trial on}} charges {{stemming}} from the bus incident and her experience with the Waller case inspired a career in civil rights law. In 1941, she began attending Howard University law school. Murray {{was the only woman}} in her law school class, and she became aware of sexism at the school, which she labeled [...] "Jane Crow"—alluding to Jim Crow, the system of racial discriminatory state laws oppressing African Americans. On Murray's first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> one professor, William Robert Ming, remarked {{that he did not know}} why women went to law school. She was infuriated.|$|E

500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a claymore mine (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>class,</b> he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, {{reviewing}} Robb Forman Dew's book The Family Heart: A Memoir of When Our Son Came Out, Bawer {{praised the}} book but added: “To be gay is to yearn {{for a time}} when it won't be necessary for mothers to write sensitive books about their children's coming out.” Reviewing a book by Urvashi Vaid in 1995, Bawer argued that “while more and more gay people” were seeking a gay-rights movement focused on “integration, education and conciliation,” Vaid wished “to return to the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> struggle and liberation fronts.” The fact that “her rhetoric has come to seem so old so fast,” he concluded, “is a measure of how gay political discourse outside the academy, anyway—has been profoundly altered in a relatively brief time.” Bawer called for same-sex marriage in a March 1996 op-ed. In June 1997, he expressed concern that so-called “morning-after” treatments for possible HIV infection could result in “increased carelessness” by at-risk individuals. In January 2001, he called for the Bush administration “to take substantive action on behalf of gays,” noting that the U.S. government was “now lagging behind the American people on gay issues.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Autherine Lucy was {{admitted}} to the University as a graduate student, but her admission was rescinded when authorities discovered she was not white. [...] After three years of legal wrangling, Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP got a court order preventing the University from banning Lucy and another student based on race. [...] The following year, Lucy enrolled as a graduate student in Library Science on February 3, 1956, becoming the first African American ever admitted to a white public school or university in the state. [...] Her first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> on February 6 was met by riots on the campus, a mob of more than a thousand men pelting the car in which she rode between classes. [...] Death threats were made against her and the University president's home was stoned. [...] The riots were the most violent involving a pro-segregation demonstration since the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. [...] After the riots, the University suspended Lucy from school stating her own safety was a concern, later expelling her on a technicality. [...] She was active in Civil Rights for a short while, but ended her involvement later that year. [...] After her expulsion was annulled by the University in 1988, Lucy reenrolled and completed her M.S. in Library Science in 1992.|$|E
