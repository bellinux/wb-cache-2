5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> of his stories.|$|E
5|$|Though the <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> of all {{antibodies}} is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of {{the protein}} is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E

We call an algebra of a functor corecursive if it {{supports}} <b>general</b> <b>structured</b> corecursion: there is a unique map to it from any coalgebra of the same functor. The concept of antifounded algebra is a statement of the bisimulation principle. We show that it is independent from corecursiveness: Neither condition implies the other. Finally, we call an algebra focusing if its codomain can be reconstructed by iterating structural refinement. This is the strongest condition and implies all the others. ...|$|R

25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an alkoxy group. The <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> {{of human}} {{vertebrae}} is fairly typical of {{that found in}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the vertebral body does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next vertebral body fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, {{and there may be}} variation in form of the vertebrae {{along the length of the}} spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the vertebral bodies of geckos and tuataras, containing a remnant of the notochord.|$|E
25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> of {{vertebrae}} {{in other}} animals is largely {{the same as}} in humans. Individual vertebrae are composed of a centrum (body), arches protruding from {{the top and bottom of}} the centrum, and various processes projecting from the centrum and/or arches. An arch extending from the top of the centrum is called a neural arch, while the haemal arch or chevron is found underneath the centrum in the caudal (tail) vertebrae of fish, most reptiles, some birds, some dinosaurs and some mammals with long tails. The vertebral processes can either give the structure rigidity, help them articulate with ribs, or serve as muscle attachment points. Common types are transverse process, diapophyses, parapophyses, and zygapophyses (both the cranial zygapophyses and the caudal zygapophyses). The centrum of the vertebra can be classified based on the fusion of its elements. In temnospondyls, bones such as the spinous process, the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum are separate ossifications. Fused elements, however, classify a vertebra as having holospondyly.|$|E

25|$|While ellipticals and spirals {{tend to have}} {{somewhat}} well-defined Sérsic profiles, {{the surface}} brightness profiles of lenticular galaxies are often more difficult to quantify. The disk component of lenticular galaxies often has a very flat surface brightness distribution (Sérsic index of n ≈ 1), especially in the outermost regions of the disk. Also, there is typically an observed truncation in the surface brightness of lenticular galaxies at ~ 4 scale radii of the disk. These features {{are consistent with the}} <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> of spiral galaxies. However, the bulge component of lenticulars is more closely related to elliptical galaxies in terms of morphological classification. This spheroidal region, which dominates the overall structure of lenticular galaxies, has a much steeper surface brightness profile (Sérsic index of n ≈ 4, or that of a de Vaucouleurs profile) than the disk component. Since the bulge component tends to dominate the galaxy, lenticular galaxy samples are often indistinguishable from elliptical galaxy populations in terms of their overall surface brightness profiles. However, galaxies are often assigned the S0 morphological class when they require multiple Sérsic indices to describe their surface brightness profiles, one to describe the bulge and one to describe the disk. This implies that lenticular galaxies are a distinct morphological subclass of galaxies.|$|E

Weeks 1 to 7 involved the <b>general</b> <b>structure</b> - welding the shell and the underframe together and attaching the ends.

A mineral fibre insulation was sprayed on internal surfaces between weeks 12-14, and then the final six weeks the internal fibreglass ceiling and wall sheets were fitted, along with carpet, seats, lighting, doors and other components, with a one-week trial at the end. The cost was roughly $500,000 per carriage. The total build time added to 16,500 man-hours per carriage, against 32,000 for the earlier Z type carriages. Additionally, the carriages are between five and eight tonnes heavier than comparable designs overseas, partially due to their being a compromise between regional and commuter type vehicles. On the other hand, they cost a mere $13,000 per seat, against $47,000 per seat for the XPT carriages being built for New South Wales Railways around the same time.|$|E
