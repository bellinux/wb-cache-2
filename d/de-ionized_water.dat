We have demonstrated a 42 MHz poly-SiGe disk resonator with <b>de-ionized</b> (DI) <b>water</b> confined to the electrode gaps. The resonator has a measured quality factor (Q) of 3, 800, motional impedance (RX) of 3. 9 k � and 3 % series frequency tuning range...|$|R

Chemical polishing was adopted to remove impurities {{adhered to the}} surface of Ti foils. The polishing solution consists of hydrofluoric acid (HF, AR), nitric acid (HNO 3, AR), and <b>de-ionized</b> (DI) <b>water,</b> with the volume ratio of 1 : 1 : 2. At last, cleaned Ti foils were dried in nitrogen stream. The TiO 2 -NTAs were synthesized in a two-electrode cell containing a cathode of platinum foil at 60 [*]V with weak magnetic stirring. The electrolyte was composed of 0.3 [*]wt.% of NH 4 F (96 % purity, AR), glycol (> 99 % purity, AR), and 2 [*]vol.% of DI water, similar to previous investigation described by Grimes et al. [1]. After 4 [*]h of anodization, the samples were sonicated in DI water and carbinol (> 99.5 % purity, AR), respectively, and then dried by a drying oven to take off the first TiO 2 -NTAs films from substrate. Followed by cleaning, the reoxidation was carried out at ‘bowl-like’ Ti foil substrate at the same voltage and lasted for the same time. The above process has always been under room temperature. Before the CdSe sensitization, a subsequent heating at 350 °C for 2 [*]h with a temperature ramp rate of 2 °C[*]⋅[*]min- 1 in air was applied to achieve the crystallized TiO 2 -NTAs.|$|R
50|$|Purity depends chiefly on {{the quality}} of the source water, carrier gas and the {{components}} in the water and steam path. The water quality becomes a living history of contact with all piping materials as well as gases used for bubbling. The bubbling process is a single stage distillation step that concentrates contaminants in the remaining water in the vessel. These contaminants can be traced to the supply water and the carrier gas as well as the continuous leaching of contaminants from the vessel itself, which is commonly heated. House <b>de-ionized</b> <b>water</b> and secondary chemical filters and degassers are sometimes employed to reduce contaminants.Bubbler are susceptible to inaccurate flow due to the temperature of the gas, liquid, operating pressure, liquid level, and thermal droop.|$|E
5000|$|The tournament {{was plagued}} with {{problems}} from the start. Ice conditions {{were not the}} best, due {{to a number of}} factors, including the arena being located adjacent to a swimming pool. Also, <b>de-ionized</b> <b>water,</b> a standard at major events was not used for the first draws, due to a refusal by the organising committee to pay for it. These ice issues led to the postponement of the fourth draw. Also, ticket prices were very expensive, leading to poor attendance numbers. Due to a dispute with volunteers who wanted to be paid, time clocks were not used. This meant that the on-ice umpire was allowed to pull rocks out of a game as a penalty for slow play. This arguably cost the Russian team a loss in one game.|$|E
50|$|Deionized water (DI water, DIW or <b>de-ionized</b> <b>water),</b> often {{synonymous with}} demineralized water / DM water, is water {{that has had}} almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as cations like sodium, calcium, iron, and copper, and anions such as {{chloride}} and sulfate. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured ion-exchange resins, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. However, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove Gram-negative bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using electrodeionization.|$|E
