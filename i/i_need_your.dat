[...] Harvey compared [...] "Discipline" [...] to one Nine Inch Nails's first singles, [...] "Head Like a Hole", saying [...] " [...] comes from a long-established and now label-free artist trying to reflexively reassert his position in the pop landscape, on his own terms. [...] 'Discipline' evinces Reznor's desire {{for some sort of}} framework [...] In relative terms, 'I need your discipline/ <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>your</b> help' is sure {{a long way from the}} nearly 20-year-old 'Head Like a Hole' refrain 'I'd rather die/ Than give you control'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Motown's main songwriting and {{production}} team, Holland–Dozier–Holland, created a complete instrumental track without {{any idea of}} what to do with it. They decided to craft the song as a more mainstream pop song for the Four Tops and proceeded to create [...] "Baby <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Loving" [...] from the instrumental track. On its release in mid-1964, [...] "Baby <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Loving" [...] made it to number 11 on the Billboard pop chart. However, the song proved to be much more popular on trend-setting radio stations in key U.S. markets and has since grown in popularity over the years to be one of the group's classic tracks. After the single's success, the Tops were pulled away from their jazz material and began recording more material in the vein of [...] "Baby <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Loving".|$|E

2500|$|After first {{consulting}} with Kosei Maeda, {{an expert on}} aerial torpedo warfare, and being told the harbor's shallow waters rendered such an attack almost impossible, Onishi summoned Commander Minoru Genda. After studying the original proposal put forth by Yamamoto, Genda agreed: [...] "he plan is difficult but not impossible". Yamamoto gave {{the bulk of the}} planning to Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka, who was very worried about the area's air defenses. Yamamoto encouraged Kusaka by telling him, [...] "Pearl Harbor is my idea and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>your</b> support."

2500|$|Spector {{commissioned}} Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil {{to write}} a song for the group, bringing them over from New York to Los Angeles {{to stay at the}} Chateau Marmont Hotel so they could write the song. Taking a cue from [...] "Baby <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Loving" [...] by The Four Tops that was then rising in the charts, Mann and Weil decided {{to write a}} ballad. Mann wrote the melody first, and came up with the opening line [...] "You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips", influenced by a line from the song [...] "I Love How You Love Me" [...] that was co-written by Mann - [...] "I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me". Mann and Weil wrote the first two verses quickly, including the chorus line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'", and Spector added [...] "gone, gone, gone, whoa, whoa, whoa" [...] {{to the end of the}} chorus, which Weil disliked. [...] The line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'" [...] was originally only intended to be a dummy line that would be replaced later, but Spector liked it and decided to keep it. The form of the song is of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus or ABABCB form. [...] Mann and Weil had problems writing the bridge and the ending, and asked Spector for help. Spector experimented on the piano with a [...] "Hang On Sloopy" [...] riff that they would then use to build on for the bridge.|$|E
