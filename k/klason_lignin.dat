50|$|The {{conventional}} {{method for}} lignin quantitation in the pulp industry is the <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> and acid-soluble lignin test, which is standardized according to SCAN or NREL procedure. The cellulose is first decrystallized and partially depolymerized into oligomers {{by keeping the}} sample in 72% sulfuric acid at 30 C for 1 h. Then, the acid is diluted to 4% by adding water, and the depolymerization is completed by either boiling (100 °C) for 4 h or pressure cooking at 2 bar (124 °C) for 1 h. The acid is washed out and the sample dried. The residue that remains is termed <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin.</b> A part of the lignin, acid-soluble lignin (ASL) dissolves in the acid. ASL is quantified by the intensity of its UV absorption peak at 280 nm. The method is suited for wood lignins, but not equally well for varied lignins from different sources. The carbohydrate composition may be also analyzed from the Klason liquors, although there may be sugar breakdown products (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural).|$|E

The weight losses and shrinkages of raw materials during pyrolysis, the FT-IR spectra of raw materials and of end-products, and the specific surface area of end-products and their discolouring ability using aqueous solution of methylene blue, were determined. The combination of such materials can improve the characteristics of end-products (e. g. higher specific surface area and discolouring ability) or the processing characteristics (e. g. lower weight losses and shrinkages of materials during pyrolysis).

After A. polytricha cultivation, the highest decrease ratio (71.6  %) of <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> was obtained in F. moluccana and that of α-cellulose (57.8  %) was found in F. moluccana and Shorea sp. After ozone treatment, the decrease ratio from SM to SMO in <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> was 76.4, 77.8, and 60.3  % for F. moluccana, Shore sp., and T. grandis, respectively. On the other hand, the decrease ratio from SM to SMO in α-cellulose (7.1, − 3.9, and 13.4  %, respectively), showed lower values compared to decrease ratio in <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin.</b> These results indicate that ozone treatment is effective for the degradation of lignin, but not for cellulose. Our results {{are similar to those of}} other studies focused on lignocellulosic materials [6, 23].

40|$|Family 1 glycosyltransferases {{catalyse}} the glycosylation {{of small}} molecules and {{play an important}} role in maintaining cell homeostasis and regulating plant growth and development. In this study, a putative glycosyltransferase gene of family 1, PtGT 1, was cloned from poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.). Sequence analysis showed that this gene encodes a protein of 481 amino acid residues with a conserved PSPG box at its C-terminal, suggesting that it is active in the glycosylation of plant secondary products. The PtGT 1 gene was expressed in poplar stems and leaves, with a particularly high expression level in elongating stems. Transgenic tobacco plants ectopically over-expressing PtGT 1 were obtained and phenotypes were analysed. Wiesner and Mäule staining showed that stem xylem of transgenic tobacco plants stained more strongly than controls. Measurement of the <b>Klason</b> <b>lignins</b> showed much higher lignin content in the transgenic lines than in control plants. Furthermore, the ectopic over-expression of PtGT 1 in tobacco resulted in an early flowering phenotype.

Various mixtures of lignocellulosic materials and novolac resin were cured with hexamethylenetetramine and then pyrolyzed up to 1000 degrees C. The IR-Spectrum of the cured material consisted of 20 % novolac and 80 % cellulose is practically {{similar to that of}} 100 % cellulose. The corresponding material with <b>lignin</b> <b>Klason</b> instead of cellulose has different IR-Spectrum compared to that of 100 % lignin, because of additional reactions taken place between lignin and novolac under curing conditions.

Significant variation for agronomic- and cell wall-related traits was observed for the RIL per se (plants without ears) and topcross (whole plants) experiments after crossing with both old (Ia 153) and modern tester (RFl) lines. Three QTLs for stover (plant without ear) yield were observed in per se experiments, with alleles increasing yield originating from RIo in two genomic locations with the highest effects. However, no QTL for whole plant yield was detected in topcross experiments, despite the fact that two QTLs for starch content were shown with increasing alleles originating from the modern RIo line. Fifteen lignin QTLs were shown, including a QTL for <b>Klason</b> <b>lignins</b> in per se experiments, located in bin 2. 04, which explained 43 % of the observed genetic variation. Thirteen QTLs for p-hydroxycinnamic acid contents and nine QTLs related to the monomeric composition of lignin were shown in per se experiments, with syringaldehyde and diferulate QTLs explaining nearly 25 % of trait variations. Nine and seven QTLs for cell wall digestibility were mapped in per se and topcross experiments, respectively. Five of the per se QTLs explained more than 15 % of the variation, up to nearly 25 %. QTL positions in bins 2. 06, 5. 04, 5. 08 and 8. 02 for ADL/NDF, IVNDFD, lignin structure and/or p-hydroxycinnamic acid contents have not been previously shown and were thus first identified in the RIo x WM 13 progeny. Based on QTL colocalizations, differences in cell wall degradability between RIo and WM 13 were less often related to acid detergent lignin (ADL) content than in previous RIL investigations. QTL colocalizations then highlighted the probable importance of ferulate cross linkages in variation for cell wall digestibility. No colocalizations of QTL for cell wall phenolic-related traits were shown with genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis or polymerization. In contrast, colocalizations were most often shown with MYB and NAC transcription factors, including orthologs of master genes involved in Arabidopsis secondary wall assembly. QTL colocalizations also strengthened the probable involvement of members of the CoA-dependent acyltransferase PF 02458 family in the feruloylation of arabinoxylan chains...|$|R

The good correlation found between the Py-lignin and <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> content gave a common model to both species. In this work different larch species (Larix sp.) as well as varieties of European larch were used to evaluate this common model, revealing only small differences between the measured and the predicted <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> contents. Compression wood was included due to the difference in lignin composition and content compared to normal wood. As the influence of compression wood was small a so-called ‘‘softwood model’’ including all samples was calculated (Py-lignin = 0. 7325 <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> + 3. 9195, R 2 = 0. 94).

The chromic oxide underestimated the heifers consumption of all diets and its estimates differed from either hod consumption or those obtained with markers.

The <b>lignin</b> <b>Klason</b> showed to be more appropriate to estimate the heifers consumption that were fed with diets based on grass silage than those heifers fed with sugarcane. This marker underestimated the consumption of heifers that received sugarcane and urea (3, 57 kg/day of MS) when it was compared to the consumption registered in hod (4, 05 kg/day of MS), however, for those heifers that received sugarcane, urea and supply, <b>lignin</b> <b>Klason</b> underestimated the consumption (3, 90 kg/day of MS), so that, it differed form consumption in hod (4, 90 kg/day of MS). The indigestible fibers (FDAi and FDNi) were suitable to estimate the heifers consumption in all diets. Those results showed that markers present differentiated effect according to the roughage used.

40|$|Because of the {{structural}} complexity of biomass, quantitation of lignin {{in a variety of}} wood and plant cell walls is difficult. Consequently, to measure lignin in different plant species, a number of different methods exist.

The identification of key marker compounds which are the derivatives of the three major lignin subunits (G, H, and S) allowed pyroprobe-GC/MS to be statistically correlated to the <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> content of the biomass using the partial least-square method to produce a calibration model. Data from this multivariate modelling procedure was then applied to identify likely ?key marker? ions representative of the lignin subunits from the mass spectral data. The combined total abundance of the identified key markers for the lignin subunits exhibited a linear relationship with the <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> content. In addition the effect of alkali metal concentration on optimum pyrolysis characteristics was also examined. Washing of the grass samples removed approximately 70 % of the metals and changed the characteristics of the thermal degradation process and products. Overall the data indicate that both the organic and inorganic specification of the biofuel impacts on the pyrolysis process and that pyroprobe?GC/MS is a suitable analytical technique to asses lignin composition.

30|$|A {{moisture}} analyser {{was used}} to evaluate the moisture content. The acid insoluble lignin (<b>Klason</b> <b>lignin)</b> was detected by weighting the dried residue after total removal of the sugars. Monomeric sugars were quantified using a Biorad Aminex HPX- 87 H high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column using 5  mM sulphuric acid as mobile phase.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{extraction}} of native lignin from spruce (soft) wood has been developed using high pressure catalytic hydrogenation in acid and alkaline hydrolytic media. The preferential hydrogenation and inactivation of the reactive centres responsible for polymerization-condensation reactions and amorphous lignin formation have been affected during the hydrolytic extraction without reduction of the aromatic nucleus. Yields of aromatic C 6 -C-C and C 6 -C-C-C products amounting to 12. 6 % of the initial <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> were identified. In addition, completely distillable hydroaromatic products amounting to 60 - 65 % calculated on the original <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> content of the wood were obtained. Aromatic and hydroaromatic dimeric units of the (C 6 -C 3) types were isolated and proof has been obtained that a carbon to carbon linkage between these units exists to a considerable extent in the simple lignin structures isolated...|$|E
30|$|Acid-insoluble lignin (<b>Klason</b> <b>lignin)</b> was {{analyzed}} by hydrolysis, {{according to the}} method described elsewhere [21]. A sample was weighed (0.5  g after oven drying) and treated with the two-step hydrolyzation using sulfuric acid, as described above. The residue was collected on a glass filter (1 GP 16), and its weight was measured as acid-insoluble lignin.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to compare two {{delignification}} methods (formic/acetic acid 1 and soaking in aqueous ammonia) on Miscanthus x giganteus and to assess the suitability to produce cellobiose and other oligosaccharides after enzymatic hydrolysis. Oligosaccharides have recently gotten attention for their health benefits. Two methods were compared in order to quantify lignin: the acid detergent lignin method (procedure of Van Soest most commonly employed by animal scientist and agronomists for analysis of forages) and the <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> procedure. Lignin concentrations in raw material determined by both methods were different; <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin</b> value (23. 5 %) was greater than the acid detergent lignin concentration (12. 9 %). Possible reasons of these results will be discussed. Pretreatment by the formic/acid mixture showed a better deliginification rate compared to the soaking in aqueous ammonia method. Results were based on <b>Klason</b> <b>lignin.</b> Analysis of the structural carbohydrates revealed that untreated miscanthus was mainly composed of glucose and xylose. Extracted pulps by both delignification methods were hydrolysed by commercial cellulases and hemicellulases. A major challenge is the characterisation of complex mixtures of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. In this study, the hydrolysis products were separated and quantified by highperformance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAECPAD). This method was successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of monosaccharides (glucose and xylose) and disaccharides (cellobiose and xylobiose) formed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated miscanthus. The influence of the pretreatments on the oligosaccharides yields will be presented...|$|E
