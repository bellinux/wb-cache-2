5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be further complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> diagnosed, even though the <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI {{that results}} from blunt trauma occurs within the chest. The most common {{tracheal}} <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> a tear near the carina or in the membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> {{more common in the}} right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. Another possibility is that people with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore die before reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{management}} of a suspected spinal cord <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> geared toward basic life support and preventing further injury: maintaining airway, breathing, and circulation and immobilizing the spine.|$|E
50|$|Figures for slight <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} highly unreliable, {{largely due}} to under-reporting where <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> self-treated.|$|R
40|$|Bomb blast cause injury {{on large}} groups of people by {{multiple}} mechanisms. Bomb blast injuries differ from the conventional description of trauma complexity. Primary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by blast wave and over pressure. Secondary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by flyin g debris and cause shrapnel wounds. Tertiary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by blast wind due to forceful impact and quaternary <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by other vectors like heat, radiation etc. Combined injuries, especially blast and burn injury or blast and crush injur y, are common during an explosive event. Knowledge about nature of <b>injuries</b> <b>is</b> essential for medicolegal and postmortem reports...|$|R
40|$|Vascular {{injuries}} following fixation of acetabular <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming increasingly}} recognized. Most case reports describe thrombosis or rupture of the adjacent artery. Repair of these <b>injuries</b> <b>is</b> most often described by open technique with endovascular repair rarely reported. Here, {{we present a}} case of injury to the external iliac artery caused by extrinsic compression from orthopedic hardware following acetabular fracture repair. Diagnosis of this <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> difficult with angiography, but on duplex ultrasonography, the <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> more clearly seen. The <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> treated with endovascular angioplasty and stenting, with restoration of normal arterial flow to the lower extremity...|$|R
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, and breathing dysfunction. If the <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person {{may not be able to}} breathe without the help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to determine the injury rate in Iranian Shotokan karate championships in children and adolescent age groups. All of the <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> recorded in national competition in 2004. Details of ages, weight, year of karate experience and kind and location of <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> obtained. Thirty <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> recorded in this competition. The overall rate of <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> 0. 25 per bout and 0. 29 per competitor. Fourteen (43. 7 %) <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> to the limbs, 31. 3 % to {{the head and neck}} and 25 % to the trunk. Only four competitors were unable to continue fighting {{as a result of their}} injuries, one of them due to fracture...|$|R
40|$|Spinal cord <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} devastating of all trauma-related injuries. Penetrating {{cervical}} spinal cord <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> seen rarely. Due to the damage to neural structures, these <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> associated with significant morbidity. The majority of penetrating <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> caused by gunshot wounds. Stabbing injuries caused by knives, screwdrivers, glass fragments and nails are much less common. The primary concern in managing penetrating neck <b>injuries</b> <b>is</b> control of bleeding and airway management. In this case report we described an unusual case of accidental nail injury occuring in a man who sustained a penetrating neck injury with a nail lodged between the os occipitale and the first cervical vertebra which caused incomplete spinal injury...|$|R

5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the tracheobronchial tree {{within the}} chest may occur due to {{penetrating}} forces such as gunshot wounds, but {{are more often}} the result of blunt trauma. TBI due blunt forces usually results from high-energy impacts such as falls from height and motor vehicle accidents; the <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> rare in low-impact mechanisms. Injuries of the trachea cause about 1% of traffic-related deaths. Other potential causes are falls from high places and injuries in which the chest is crushed. Explosions are another cause.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> occurring.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, no median or ulnar nerve <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> {{found in any}} patient. Radial nerve <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> found in six {{patients}} (8.6 %) preoperatively, and in all patients the radial nerve injury recovers within 2  months after injury. In contrast to Cramer et al. [29] and Dormans et al. [30], no iatrogenic nerve <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> encountered {{in any of the}} patients.|$|R
40|$|Cut throat <b>injuries</b> in {{children}} <b>are</b> rare, but they constitute a significant management challenge. Such <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> rarely {{reported in the}} literature. Evaluation and treatment of such <b>injuries</b> <b>is</b> a tough task. Cervical tracheal <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> relatively uncommon and are frequently associated with esophageal, vascular or spinal injuries. We hereby report a case of cut throat injury with incom-plete transection of trachea and its management in a four years old male child...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> one gunshot wound, six motor vehicle accidents and nine falls from height. Five fractures <b>were</b> Essex-Lopresti tongue-type <b>injuries,</b> while the remaining 11 <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> joint-depression type.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps {{the first}} {{reported}} case of personality change after brain <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> that of Phineas Gage, who survived an accident {{in which a}} large iron rod was driven through his head, destroying {{one or both of}} his frontal lobes; numerous cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> {{at high risk for}} other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.|$|E
50|$|Hip and elbow <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> {{more common}} on highracers than on lowracers {{due to the}} greater height from which the rider can fall. However, the <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> very rare and seldom serious.|$|R

5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic brain <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as}} {{damage to the}} brain {{resulting}} from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile.

40|$|During 1982, 312 {{patients}} with 408 vascular injuries and 48 cardiac <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> seen. Two or more vascular or cardiac <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> present in 34 % of patients. Over 87 % of <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> secondary to gunshot wounds, stab wounds, or shotgun wounds. Vascular <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> most commonly {{seen in the}} extremities (39. 9 %) or abdomen (31. 9 %). The most common arterial injuries occurred in the brachial artery (39 patients), while the most common venous injuries occurred in the internal jugular vein (26 patients).

5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
