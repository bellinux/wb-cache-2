One type of MEMS-based <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sensor</b> is coated with a film consisting of nanostructured indium oxide (In2O3) and tin oxide (SnO2). A typical configuration for mechanical Pd-based hydrogen sensors is the usage of a free-standing cantilever that is coated with Pd. In the presence of H2, the Pd layer expands and thereby induces a stress that causes the cantilever to bend. Pd-coated nanomechanical resonators have also been reported in literature, relying on the stress-induced mechanical resonance frequency shift caused by the presence of H2 gas. In this case, the response speed was enhanced {{through the use of a}} very thin layer of Pd (20 nm).

In this thesis, we demonstrate a multi-point, one-feed through, in-fiber <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sensor</b> capable of hydrogen detection below 0. 5 % concentration with a response time of less than 10 seconds. Our solution entails use of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) coated {{with a layer of}} hydrogen-absorbing palladium which, in turn, induces strain in the FBG in the presence of hydrogen. The hydrogen-induced stress was detected by the shift of FBG wavelength. The responsivity of fiber optic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sensor</b> was calibrated for hydrogen concentration from 0. 1 % to 10 % and temperature range from - 120 oC to 120 oC.
