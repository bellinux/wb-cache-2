[...] Days before the season opener, Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest. Carr noted, [...] "It's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest. But Mount Everest has been climbed.

On the whole <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>our</b> team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E

500|$|In The Speaker, A.B.Walkley {{admired the}} play {{and was one of}} few to see it as the {{culmination}} of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied the term [...] "farce" [...] was derogatory, or even lacking in seriousness, and said [...] "It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>our</b> stage has not seen." [...] H.G.Wells, in an unsigned review for the Pall Mall Gazette, called Earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying [...] "More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions {{it would be difficult to}} imagine." [...] He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, [...] "...how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously." [...] The play was so light-hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. W. H. Auden later called it [...] "a pure verbal opera", and The Times commented, [...] "The story is almost too preposterous to go without music." [...] Mary McCarthy, in Sights and Spectacles (1959), however, and despite thinking the play extremely funny, would call it [...] "a ferocious idyll"; [...] "depravity is the hero and the only character." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>our</b> awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

[...] Christian also discussed the difficulties in writing this record. [...] "When you try to write 29 songs lyrically you find yourself topically working in circles; I only go through so much in one year, but needlessly I have dedicated myself to begin searching books, art, and friends for new directions." [...] During the recording process, the band set up a live webcam in the studio so fans could watch them record the album via the band's MySpace profile.

I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, {{that would be a good}} start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{death of}} Kurdi and reports {{that his family}} {{had been trying to}} {{ultimately}} reach Canada had an immediate impact on domestic Canadian politics.

2500|$|This {{game was}} Michigan's worst defeat since 1968 when they lost 50 to 14 at Ohio State. Dennis Dixon {{accounted}} for 368 {{yards and a}} career-high 4 touchdowns.

[...] The Ducks led by 25 at halftime, and faced little opposition in the second half. [...] According to Oregon coach Mike Bellotti the game was a [...] "good win because I think there were some questions about how Michigan was going to bounce back, and whether we would be competitive. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>our</b> players took that to heart." [...] With this game Michigan opened the season with two home losses, {{the first time that}} had happened since 1959.

2500|$|In March 2015, Loeb {{spoke on}} the ability for the series to {{crossover}} with the MCU films and the ABC television series, saying, [...] "As it is now, {{in the same way}} that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to The Avengers, it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into [...] and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of Iron Man 3. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going." [...] In April, Cox stated that crossing over with the films is [...] "possible. I think there's a way that the worlds can merge. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>our</b> show feels tonally and thematically a bit different from the Avengers movies, but it's all one universe and I feel like there's a way for Daredevil—and other characters, Luke Cage and street level crime characters—to fit into that universe.

[...] Pincus stated that [...] "the court of appeals said, that this Court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental.

I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching." [...] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since [...] "everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back."
