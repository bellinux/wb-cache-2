Pearlman {{was pleased with the}} later broadcast date, believing that [...] "it creates a second wave of anticipation for an audience, too. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the business and I couldn't even tell you the names of a third of the new shows this season because we were bombarded with all the messaging." ...|$|E
500|$|Lucan left Brandt's {{in about}} 1960, {{shortly after he}} had won £26,000 playing chemin de fer. A {{colleague}} had been promoted before him, and he protested and then gave up his job, saying [...] "why should <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a bank, when I can earn a year's money in one single night at the tables?" [...] He travelled to the United States, where he played golf, raced powerboats, and drove his Aston Martin around the West Coast. He also visited his elder sister Jane, and his former guardian, Marcia Tucker. On his return to England he moved out of his parents' home in StJohn's Wood and into a flat in Park Crescent.|$|E
2500|$|Burton told Entertainment Weekly {{that there}} was a {{possibility}} that she would return for guest appearances if asked, and clarified what happened behind the scenes regarding her contract, stating, [...] "hen I hear that there's turmoil or negotiations based on money, it kind of hurts my feelings, because it's not what's been going on at all." [...] She said, [...] "I think my fan base in particular knows that money isn't necessarily a big motivator for me, that's why <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the world of independent film." [...] Burton had known for some time that she was leaving, adding, [...] "For me, it was definitely an emotional decision. And a professional decision as well. I got really, really lucky. One Tree Hill was my very first television audition; it was a fairytale. I feel really lucky to have that level of success right out of the gate." [...] Referring to a video she had sent to her fans, she said: ...|$|E

2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

6000|$|All {{unaware of}} the trend of events, {{unaware of the}} laws that were closing in upon all the Brethren, unaware indeed that there lived a Brother {{for him on the}} earth, young Caddles chose this time to come out of his chalk pit and see the world. His {{brooding}} came at last to that. There was no answer to all his questions in Cheasing Eyebright; the new Vicar was less luminous even than the old, and the riddle of his pointless labour grew at last to the dimensions of exasperation.

He who is strong for evil can be as mighty for good, witness Saul when he journeyed up to Damascus to bring Christian captives to Jerusalem.

6000|$|Thus was the Maid taken, by art and {{device of}} the devil and Brother Thomas, and in no otherwise. They who tell that Flavy sold her, closing the gates in her face, do him wrong; he was an ill man, but loyal to France, as was seen by the very defence he made at Compiegne, for there was none like it in this war. But of what avail was that to us who loved the Maid? Rather, many times, would I have died in that hour than have seen what I saw. For our enemies made no more tarrying, nor any onslaught on the boulevard, but rode swiftly back with the prize they had taken, with her whom they feared more than any knight or captain of France. This page whereon <b>I</b> <b>work,</b> <b>in</b> a hand feeble and old, and weary with much writing, is blotted with tears {{that will not be}} held in.
