25|$|Potassium is an electrolyte, 98% {{of which}} is intracellular. The 2% {{remaining}} outside the cell has great implications for cells that generate action potentials. Doctors prescribe potassium for patients when potassium levels are insufficient, called hypokalemia, in the blood. The potassium can be given orally, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> route; {{or it can be}} given intravenously, in which case strict rules and hospital protocols govern the rate at which it is given.|$|E
25|$|Gamma ray {{treatment}} is also uncommon, because although it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> and cheapest irradiation method, successful treatment can take several months. The color produced is a blue to blue-green which penetrates the whole stone. Such diamonds are not annealed. The blue color can sometimes approach that of natural Type IIb diamonds, {{but the two}} are distinguished by the latter's semiconductive properties. As with most irradiated diamonds, most gamma ray-treated diamonds were originally tinted yellow; the blue is usually modified by this tint, resulting in a perceptible greenish cast.|$|E
25|$|To be on {{the safe}} side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} device is preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E

25|$|Vacuum {{aspiration}} in {{the first}} trimester <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a primary care office, abortion clinic, or hospital. Complications are rare and can include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate. Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States. The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion {{in the first}} trimester is similar {{regardless of whether the}} procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office. Preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before elective abortion, as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection. The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid-level practitioner. Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen. Second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{of nuclear}} power argue that in {{comparison}} to {{any other form of}} power, nuclear power <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> form of energy, accounting for all the risks from mining to production to storage, including the risks of spectacular nuclear accidents. Accidents in the nuclear industry have been less damaging than accidents in the hydro industry, and less damaging than the constant, incessant damage from air pollutants from fossil fuels. For instance, by running a 1000-MWe nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal, the radiation dose is 136 person-rem/year, the dose is 490 person-rem/year for an equivalent coal-fired power plant. The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths from accidents in course of different forms of energy production. In their comparison, deaths per TW-yr of electricity produced from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower, 342 for coal, 85 for natural gas, and 8 for nuclear. Nuclear power plant accidents rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.|$|E

[...] One notable instance of mass media spreading a tornado myth was after the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, where TIME magazine ran a caption on a picture suggesting that highway overpasses were safer tornado shelters than houses. [...] The spread of some myths can be attributed to popular tornado-themed movies such as The Wizard of Oz and Twister.|$|E

500|$|Some {{people still}} {{incorrectly}} believe that opening windows {{ahead of a}} tornado will reduce the damage from the storm, {{but this is not}} true. Some people also believe that escaping in a vehicle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> method of avoiding a tornado, but this could increase the danger in some situations. Other myths are that tornadoes can skip houses, always travel in a predictable direction, always extend visibly from the ground to the cloud, and increase in intensity with increasing width. Finally, some people believe that tornadoes only occur in North America, do not occur in winter, are attracted to trailer park homes, or that some areas are protected from tornadoes by rivers, mountains, valleys, tall buildings or other geographical or man-made features; the truth is that tornadoes can occur almost anywhere at any time if the conditions are right. [...] Some geographic areas are simply more prone to these conditions than others.|$|E

2500|$|Although black lights produce {{light in}} the UV range, their {{spectrum}} is mostly confined to the longwave UVA region, that is, UV radiation nearest in wavelength to visible light, with low frequency and therefore relatively low energy.

[...] UVA <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> of the three spectra of UV light, although high exposure to UVA has been linked to the development of skin cancer in humans. The relatively low energy of UVA light does not cause sunburn. UVA is capable of causing damage to collagen fibers, however, so it does have the potential to accelerate skin aging and cause wrinkles. UVA can also destroy vitamin A in the skin.|$|E

Crime in San Jose had been lower than in other large American cities until 2013, when crime rates in San Jose climbed above California and U.S. averages.

2500|$|It is safest (for both multimeter, circuit under test, and the operator) to {{disconnect}} a component from its circuit, and almost always, to remove {{power from the}} device being investigated. [...] Removing all power connections from a piece of mains powered equipment before testing (and ensuring that all large capacitance devices are discharged safely) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> choice. [...] Leaving equipment attached to the mains supply while making measurements should be only a very carefully considered alternative choice. [...] Amongst other issues, there are interactions between the ground arrangements for wall powered test equipment, and the device under test, which are unsafe, and can damage test equipment and the device under test. This is especially so {{when there is a}} fault, suspected or not, in any of the interconnected devices. Battery powered test equipment may be the safest choice in such situations.|$|E

Eventually, Martin convinces her that he is not a demon and that a hospital <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> place for her and Arthur. However, she is then sectioned after refusing to voluntarily admit herself, because she will be separated from Arthur. Stacey tells the doctor she has been hearing God's voice since Arthur's birth at Christmas, so the doctor suspects she is suffering from postpartum psychosis. Martin apologises to her and promises to make things right, determined {{to find a way to}} bring her back together with Arthur. Shabnam soon realises that Stacey wants to see Arthur, so goes to Martin with the idea of getting Stacey and Arthur taken to a mother and baby care unit. When Shabnam decides to leave Walford, Stacey finally admits that Kush is Arthur's father, showing that she is starting to recover. Martin finds a mother and baby unit for Stacey in Essex, and takes her and Arthur there. Stacey writes Martin a letter revealing that Arthur is Kush's son, but decides not to send it, however a nurse finds it and gives it to Martin; Martin is heartbroken. Stacey begs for his forgiveness, but he goes to America, returning a few weeks later and they reunite. Stacey is allowed a home visit, where she meets Kyle again. He explains that he is transgender and he used to be her sister but is now her brother. Stacey accepts and supports him and allows him to stay at her and Martin's flat. Stacey says she no longer wants to be Martin's [...] "not-wife" [...] and proposes to him, which he accepts, and tells Kush he can be part of Arthur's life, but Kush later decides he does not want to be Arthur's role model. Stacey is discharged from the mother and baby unit.|$|E
