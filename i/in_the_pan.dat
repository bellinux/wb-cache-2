40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The Darling and Yzerfontein hypersaline pans {{are located}} on the western coastal plain of South Africa. The area has an arid, Mediterranean type climate. The {{carbonate}} minerals calcite and dolomite have precipitated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> through <b>the</b> evaporation and concentration of ions derived from weathering of bedrock, marine aerosols and coastal rainfall. Five <b>pans</b> were studied, <b>the</b> brine-type <b>pans</b> Rooipan South, Zwartwater North and Zwartwater South, <b>the</b> brackish saline <b>pan</b> Rooipan North, and <b>the</b> coastal Yzerfontein <b>pan.</b> Directly below <b>the</b> surficial halite crust of <b>the</b> three brine-type <b>pans</b> is a black organic-matter rich layer in which bacterial sulphate reduction is occurring (hydrogen-sulphide smell). All of <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> contain disseminated calcite, with only the Zwartwater North and Zwartwater South pans containing a mixture of dolomite and calcite. Yzerfontein and Zwartwater North pans contain small aragonitic gastropod shells (Tomichia ventricosa) which are no longer active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> due to <b>the</b> high present-day salinities of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> waters. Low-magnesian calcite is likely the first evaporite mineral to precipitate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> because of its low solubility...|$|R

5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E

25|$|The matchlock musket or pistol (an early gun {{ignition}} system), {{as well as}} the flintlock {{would often}} be unusable in wet weather, due to powder <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> being exposed and dampened.|$|E
25|$|The fast {{rotation}} of the wheel against the pyrites produces white-hot sparks that ignite the powder <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> which is transferred to the main charge in the breech of the barrel via the vent, and the gun discharges.|$|E
25|$|The wheellock {{was used}} {{along with the}} matchlock until both were {{replaced}} by the simpler and less-costly flintlock, by the late 17th century. The wheellock mechanism however gave faster ignition than the flintlock, because the sparks were produced directly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> {{rather than having to}} fall a certain distance from the frizzen.|$|E
