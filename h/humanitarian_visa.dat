40|$|Third-country {{nationals}} seeking protection have no EU-wide legal channels {{at present}} for entering EU territory and triggering protection mechanisms under the Common European Asylum System. As a result, many embark on hazardous journeys, with concomitant risks {{and loss of}} human life. The absence of ‘protection-sensitive’ mechanisms for accessing EU territory, along with EU external and extraterritorial border and migration management and control, undermine Member States' refugee and human rights obligations. Humanitarian visas may offer a remedy in this regard by enabling third-country nationals to apply in situ for entry to EU territory on humanitarian grounds or because of international obligations. This study asks whether the existing Visa Code actually obliges Member States to issue humanitarian visas. It also examines past implementation of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>visa</b> schemes by Member States and considers whether more {{could be done to}} encourage them to make use of existing provisions in EU law. Finally, with a Commission proposal for Visa Code reform on the table, it asks whether there is now an opportunity to lay down clear rules for <b>humanitarian</b> <b>visa</b> schemes...|$|E

But it’s important to note that people who are not registered with the UNHCR can still come through the Special Humanitarian Programme. Bernardi is right to say that many persecuted minorities don’t go to camps. But that may be for a variety of reasons, not just safety fears as described by church groups. In fact, increasing numbers of refugees live in urban areas, not camps. The final determination about which 12, 000 refugees come to Australia rests with the Australian government...|$|R
