5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E

5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium {{and the young}} roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> the role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies {{only a small percentage of}} ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E

Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E

Other studies <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics.

5|$|Various studies <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> {{the use of}} anticoagulation to {{suppress}} blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E
