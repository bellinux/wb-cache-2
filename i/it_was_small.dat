5|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} a tropical storm, {{the movement of}} Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October28. The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped cloud band and maximum winds far {{from the center of}} the storm at the time. Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81°F (27°C). That afternoon, it gained full tropical characteristics, as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast. The eye became clearly defined, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995season, as it turned northward in response to the nearby low.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E
30|$|The roadway {{deformation}} rate versus load can reflect {{the ability of}} the surrounding rock to resist deformation due to external load. The variation of the roadway {{deformation rate}} versus load exhibits the following trends: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>small</b> in the load-bearing stage before the peak stress <b>is</b> reached, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for higher-density bolt supports, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for longer bolt lengths, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for larger-diameter bolts.|$|R

25|$|Another {{claim was}} {{put forth by}} a young boy who stated {{that he had been}} hit by a small (~3-gram) stone of the Mbale {{meteorite}} fall from Uganda, and who stood to gain nothing from this assertion. The stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking the boy on the head, causing little to no pain, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> enough to have been slowed by both friction with the atmosphere as well as that with banana leaves, before striking the boy.|$|E
25|$|Boxley Abbey had {{a famous}} {{portrait}} of the saint. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and of a weight so small a child could lift it but at times became so heavy even strong people could not lift it. According to tradition, the attempt to lift the portrait was a test of a woman's chastity. In practice, those who paid the priest well could lift the portrait with ease, while others could not. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England, {{it was discovered that}} the portrait was held by a wooden pin by an unseen person behind the portrait.|$|E

25|$|This {{change is}} due to the influx into Tallahassee of many {{students}} and workers {{from other parts of the}} state, and from outside the state and outside the South. Primarily this has been driven by the birth and great expansion of Florida State University, founded in 1947, to some extent to serve World War II veterans studying under the G.I. Bill. Its predecessor, Florida State College for Women, was politically liberal and pro-integration, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and its faculty and graduates had little political power. Secondarily, Tallahassee's change has been due to Florida A University, and to the changing demographics of the state itself. Florida's population growth has been due to in-migration from other, usually more liberal parts of the country. As the state became more liberal, so did the legislators and their staffs.|$|E
25|$|The early Roman army (c. 500 BC) was, {{like those}} of other {{contemporary}} city-states influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen militia which practiced hoplite tactics. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> (the population of free males of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the comitia centuriata, the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive. By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation {{in favor of a}} more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or in some cases 60) men called maniples could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a legion, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 men. The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (hastati, principes and triarii), a force of light infantry (velites), and the cavalry (equites). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.|$|E
500|$|An English {{military}} presence was briefly established at Gibraltar {{for the first}} time in 1620. The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, James I successfully resisted Parliamentary pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England. After Charles I ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to [...] "take or spoil a town" [...] on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked Cádiz in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but the raid turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.|$|E

500|$|New Ironsides had a {{complete}} waterline belt of wrought iron that was [...] thick. Below the waterline it {{was reduced to}} [...] It reached [...] above the waterline and [...] below. Above the belt the [...] battery was protected by 4.5-inch armor, but the bow and stern were left unprotected. Although not initially part of the design, transverse bulkheads were added during construction to protect {{the ends of the}} battery. They consisted of [...] of wrought iron backed by [...] of white oak. The deck was three inches of yellow pine beneath [...] of wrought iron. Mirroring French practice, the armor plates were secured to the ship's hull and deck by countersunk screws. The armor plates were cut with a groove on each side and an iron bar was inserted between each plate to better distribute the shock of impact. The side armor was backed by [...] of wood. A conning tower with three-inch sides was also added during construction. It was placed behind the funnel and the mainmast, and had no visibility directly forward. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and could only fit three people.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{even as the}} old Gaelic harp {{tradition}} was dying out, a new harp was invented in Ireland. It had gut strings and semitone mechanisms like an orchestral pedal harp, and was invented by Dublin pedal harp maker John Egan. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and curved like the historical cláirseach or Irish harp, but its strings were of gut and the soundbox was much lighter. In the 1890s a similar new harp was also developed in Scotland {{as part of a}} Gaelic cultural revival.|$|E

Wendover is located on the north-facing escarpment of the Chiltern Hills, with a [...] chalk aquifer feeding natural springs which could supply water all year round, and so the Wendover branch was conceived as a non-navigable feeder, to carry water from the springs and streams in the area to the Tringford reservoirs which fed the Tring summit. However, the cost of widening <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> and so it was always a navigable channel from the time of its completion in 1799.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expedition}} {{had succeeded}} in climbing 26 peaks of over – as many as had been achieved by all previous mountaineering expeditions put together. Of these, 24 were first ascents. In 1994 Warren remembered, [...] "This surely must {{have been one of}} the most enjoyable of all the expeditions to Mount Everest. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and achieved the objectives set for it at little cost." [...] Judged in these ways, and by the surveying results achieved, the expedition was a success but one that never caught the imagination of the press or public– it was the only pre-war British expedition that did not publish a book afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was nothing}} about the Fordson's design or farming {{capabilities}} that was a [...] "first ever" [...] among tractors (the unit frame was novel for tractors, but that didn't give it special farming advantages). But {{it was the first}} tractor that combined all of the following factors: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> lightweight, mass-produced, and affordable; it had a large distribution network (dealers nearby in many locales); and it had a widely trusted brand (via Ford). Such factors made it possible for the average farmer to own a tractor for the first time. Thus Henry Ford and colleagues had done again, for the tractor, what they had recently done for the automobile with the Ford Model T. Ford incorporated his private company, Henry Ford and Son Inc, to mass-produce the tractor on July 27, 1917. The Fordson tractor went into mass production in 1917 and debuted for sale on October 8, 1917, for US$750.|$|E
2500|$|The CPU {{has eight}} 32-bit {{general-purpose}} data registers (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register is the stack pointer, and assemblers accept the label SP as equivalent to A7. This {{was a good}} number of registers at the time in many ways. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> enough to allow the 68000 to respond quickly to interrupts (even in the worst case where all 8 data registers D0–D7 and 7 address registers A0–A6 needed to be saved, 15 registers in total), and yet large enough to make most calculations fast, because they could be done entirely within the processor without keeping any partial results in memory. (Note that an exception routine in supervisor mode can also save the user stack pointer A7, which would total 8 address registers. However, the dual stack pointer (A7 and supervisor-mode A7') design of the 68000 makes this normally unnecessary, except when a task switch is performed in a multitasking system.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Tom Elmhirst, who remixed {{the single}} [...] "You Know I'm No Good", was enlisted {{to help with}} the mixing of the album. He first {{received}} Ronson's original mix, which he described as being [...] "radical in terms of panning, kind of Beatlesque. The drums, for instance, were all panned to one side." [...] He attempted to mix [...] "Love Is a Losing Game" [...] in the same manner he did with [...] "Rehab", but he felt it was not right. The majority of the songs produced by Ronson were done at the studio of the band the Dap-Kings, in Brooklyn, New York. The drums, piano, guitar and bass were all done together in one room, with the drums being recorded with one microphone, with lots of spill between the instruments. Elmhirst mixed [...] "Rehab"; when he first received the multitrack of the song <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> but Ronson then went to London to record strings, brass and percussion in one of Metropolis Studios's tracking rooms. After this was added, there were quite a few tracks. The song had a retro, 1960s soul, R feel, which is what the Dap-Kings specialise in, {{when it came to the}} mixing Elmhirst added a contemporary feel to it as well, while Ronson wanted to keep the mix sparse and not overproduced.|$|E
2500|$|The Lander Road departs {{the main}} trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming.
