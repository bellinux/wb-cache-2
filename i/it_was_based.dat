5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known only from the type locality, differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on an invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus alenquerensis {{was named}} in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on post cranial {{material}} from Portugal. In 1990 this material was reassigned to Camarasaurus, but in 1998 {{it was given}} its own genus, Lourinhasaurus. This was further supported by the findings of Tschopp etal. in 2015, where Lourinhasaurus {{was found to be}} sister to Camarasaurus and other camarasaurids.|$|E

5|$|Chōdō-in was a {{rectangular}} walled enclosure situated {{directly to the}} north of the Suzakumon gate in the centre of the southern wall of the Greater Palace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the 7th century onwards.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on the work of the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, {{there was no evidence that}} he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E

5|$|In February 1916, Wilson enlisted as {{a private}} in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H, 5th Maryland Infantry. This unit was called to active duty at Laurel, Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> at Eagle Pass, Texas, and, like most National Guard units, {{supported}} but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, although it did occasionally cross the border into Mexico. Wilson was soon promoted to corporal, and later sergeant. The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917.|$|E
5|$|In January 1915 Maunsell {{received}} {{authority to}} build six examples, but, {{as with the}} Nclass, production was delayed due {{to the use of}} the Ashford works for wartime armaments manufacture. Assembly began in 1917 and the first, No.790, emerged in July of that year. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> at Bricklayers Arms depot, preceding the earlier Nclass design into service by one month. Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had caught up with the maintenance backlog caused by the war.|$|E
5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, Kneale {{made his}} only attempt at writing a stage play. Called Crow, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> upon the memoirs of real-life Manx slaver Captain Hugh Crow.

5|$|Kanti (1108), {{known for}} her wit and humour, {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} female poets of the Kannada language and a contemporary of Nagachandra, with whom she indulged in debates and repartees. Rajaditya, a native of either Puvinabage or Raibhag (the modern Belgaum district), was in the Hoysala court during the days of King Veera BallalaI and King Vishnuvardhana. He wrote in easy verse on arithmetic and other mathematical topics and is credited with three of the earliest writings on mathematics in the Kannada language: Vyavaharaganita, Kshetraganita and Lilavati. Udayaditya, a Chola prince, authored a piece on rhetoric called Udayadityalankara (1150). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>based</b> on Dandin's Sanskrit Kavyadarsa.|$|E
