During this, the Australian Defence Force pilots were given permission to destroy any hostile aircraft. This <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> {{at any time during}} Australian peace time, but was deemed necessary because of the 11 September 2001 attacks six months earlier.|$|E
5|$|While Wizards & Warriors III {{hinted at}} a sequel {{at the end}} of the game, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened.</b> The {{publishing}} rights for the series remained with Acclaim, who went bankrupt in 2004, with their intellectual property rights going to Throwback Entertainment. As of late 2010, the Toronto-based company has no plans for any future games in the series.|$|E
5|$|There were fears {{among some}} traders in India that Indian goods {{would find a}} limited outlet in Tibet, while China would {{have access to a}} ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal. The reopening of the pass was {{expected}} to stimulate the economy of the region and bolster Indo-Chinese trade, but this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened.</b> Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006, only US$186,250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La.|$|E

While that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> yet, the possibility of Brazil enriching uranium at a level higher than the 20-percent threshold and employing it at a military facility has prompted continued concerns over its nuclear intentions.|$|E

25|$|Yet, as {{sovereignty}} still originates {{from the}} national level, it may be withdrawn by a member state who wishes to leave. Hence, if a law is agreed {{that is not to}} the liking of a state, it may withdraw from the EU to avoid it. This however <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> as the benefits of membership are often seen to outweigh the potentially negative impact of a specific law.|$|E
25|$|Harpur {{has noted}} that Kuhn had {{expected}} his ideas to have a Darwin-like impact on religious studies, but that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> and Kuhn's concepts are generally ignored or rejected. Porter criticizes Kuhn's work based on various errors such as confusing the dates of {{the composition of the}} Mishnah and the Babylonian Talmud when drawing conclusions. Porter also criticizes Harpur's views (which are often based on Kuhn) for their lack of rigor and consistency.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{elections}} traditionally occur after September in {{the third}} year following the last election, and snap elections occur rarely; the only three elections out of sync in the period of 1948 to 2008 took place in 1951, 1984 and 2002—and the last two came only a few months early. Convention in New Zealand expects Parliaments to run for a full three years unless the government loses the confidence of the House, although this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> since 1911.|$|E

25|$|Media {{support for}} ice hockey has {{improved}} {{on a national}} level, {{although the majority of}} news is still found on the internet.

Premier Sports picked up the mantle for a number of seasons, but there has been no Main Stream Media coverage of the EIHL since 2015.|$|E
25|$|Mortlockese uses tense markers such as mii and {{to denote}} {{the present tense}} state of a subject, aa to denote a present tense state that an object has changed to from a different, past state, kɞ to {{describe}} something {{that has already been}} completed, pɞ and lɛ to denote future tense, pʷapʷ to denote a possible action or state in future tense, and sæn/mwo for something that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> yet. Each of these markers is used in conjunction with the subject proclitics except for the markers aa and mii. Additionally, the marker mii can be used with any type of intransitive verb.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no natural}} {{candidate}} {{for what might}} cause {{what has been called}} dark energy but the current best guess is that it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum. One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In general relativity, mass and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This obviously <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> and this issue, called the cosmological constant problem, {{is one of the greatest}} unsolved mysteries in physics.|$|E
25|$|Any {{event that}} changes the number of {{observers}} in the universe may have experimental consequences. Quantum tunnelling to a new vacuum state would {{reduce the number of}} observers to zero (i.e., kill all life). Some cosmologists argue that the universe is in a false vacuum state and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state. This <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This {{can be thought of as}} a variation on quantum suicide.|$|E
25|$|The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 recognizes all the {{languages}} spoken as mother tongues in Nepal {{as the national}} languages of Nepal. It says that Nepali in Devanagari script shall be the language of official business, however, the use of mother tongues in local bodies or offices shall {{not be considered a}} barrier. The use of national languages in local government bodies <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>happened</b> in practice, and discouragement in their use and discrimination in allocation of resources persist. Some analysts have stated that one of the chief causes of the Maoist insurgency, or the Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006), was the denial of language rights and marginalization of ethnic groups.|$|E
