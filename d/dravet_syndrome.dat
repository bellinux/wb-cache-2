Effective treatment should control seizures and improve EEG abnormalities. Current treatment options are presented. i 2007; 12 (Supplement 1) : 4 – 6 Catastrophic epilepsies of infancy include several syndromes {{with not only}} disabling frequent seizures but also major effects on normal development. Many of these are specific epileptic encephalopathies like West and <b>Dravet’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> with age-dependant expression, predictable responses to antiepileptic drugs and expected outcomes.

40|$|SummaryStudies of the {{efficacy}} of topiramate (TPM) in infants and young children are few. Here we report an open, prospective, and pragmatic study of effectiveness of TPM in terms of epilepsy syndromes, in children aged less than 2 years. The median follow-up period was 11 months. We enrolled 59 children in the study: 22 affected by localization-related epilepsy (LRE), 23 by generalized epilepsy, six by <b>Dravet's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and eight with unclassifiable epilepsy. TPM was effective (responders showed a decrease of more than 50 % in seizure frequency) in 47 % of patients, including 13 % who were seizure-free at the last visit. TPM was more effective in localization-related epilepsy (48 % of responders) than in generalized epilepsy (32 % of responders). In the latter group, 19 patients suffered from infantile spasms. Four of six patients with cryptogenic infantile spasms became seizure-free. Of the 13 patients with symptomatic infantile spasms, only one was seizure-free. Results were poor for patients with <b>Dravet's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In general, TPM was well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse effects were drowsiness, irritability, hyperthermia, and anorexia. The present study concludes that TPM is effective for {{a broad range of}} seizures in infants and young children and represents a valid therapeutic option in this population...|$|R

In view of their critical role in neuronal firing and their strong sequence conservation during evolution, {{it is not surprising}} that mutations in the sodium channel genes are responsible for a growing spectrum of channelopathies. Nearly 700 mutations of the SCN 1 A gene have been identified in patients with <b>Dravet's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), making this the most commonly mutated gene in human epilepsy. A small number of mutations have been found in SCN 2 A, SCN 3 A and SCN 9 A, and studies in the mouse suggest that SCN 8 A may also contribute to seizure disorders. Interactions between genetic variants of SCN 2 A and KCNQ 2 in the mouse and variants of SCN 1 A and SCN 9 A in patients provide models of potential genetic modifier effects in the more common human polygenic epilepsies. New methods for generating induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons from patients will facilitate functional analysis of amino acid substitutions in channel proteins.

40|$|Background: Studies on the {{efficacy}} and tolerability of rufinamide in infants {{and young children}} are scarce. Here we report on an open, retrospective, and pragmatic study about safety and efficacy of rufinamide in children aged less than four years, in terms of seizures types and epilepsy syndromes. Methods: Forty children (mean age 39. 5 months; range 22 - 48) {{were enrolled in the}} study. The mean follow-up period was 12. 2 months (range 5 - 21). Rufinamide was initiated at a mean age of 26. 7 months (range 12 - 42). Final rufinamide mean dosage was 31. 5  mg/kg/day if associated with valproic acid and 44. 2  mg/kg/day if not. Results: The highest seizure reduction rate was observed in the epileptic spasms (46 %) and drop attacks (42 %) groups. Seizure reduction was also observed in tonic seizures (35 %) and in the focal seizure (30 %) groups. In terms of epilepsy syndrome, rufinamide was effective in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Results were very poor for those affected by <b>Dravet's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Globally, responder rate was 27. 5 %, including two (5 %) patients seizure-free. Adverse reactions occurred in 37. 5 % of children and were mainly represented by vomiting, drowsiness, irritability, and anorexia. Discontinuation rate due to treatment-emergent adverse events was 15 %. Conclusion: The present study concludes that rufinamide may be a safe and effective drug for a broad range of seizures and epilepsy syndromes in infants and young children and represents a valid therapeutic option in this population. © 2014 European Paediatric Neurology Society...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} initiate action potentials {{in brain}} neurons, and sodium channel blockers {{are used in}} therapy of epilepsy. Mutations in sodium channels are responsible for genetic epilepsy syndromes {{with a wide range}} of severity, and the NaV 1. 1 channel encoded by the SCN 1 A gene is the most frequent target of mutations. Complete loss-of-function mutations in NaV 1. 1 cause severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI or <b>Dravet's</b> <b>Syndrome),</b> which includes severe, intractable epilepsy and comorbidities of ataxia and cognitive impairment. Mice with loss-of-function mutations in NaV 1. 1 channels have severely impaired sodium currents and action potential firing in hippocampal GABAergic inhibitory neurons without detectable effect on the excitatory pyramidal neurons, which would cause hyperexcitability and contribute to seizures in SMEI. Similarly, the sodium currents and action potential firing are also impaired in the GABAergic Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, which is likely to contribute to ataxia. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission in these mice can be partially corrected by compensatory loss-of-function mutations of NaV 1. 6 channels, and thermally induced seizures in these mice can be prevented by drug combinations that enhance GABAergic neurotransmission. Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is caused by missense mutations in NaV 1. 1 channels, which have variable biophysical effects on sodium channels expressed in non-neuronal cells, but may primarily cause loss of function when expressed in mice. Familial febrile seizures is caused by mild loss-of-function mutations in NaV 1. 1 channels; mutations in these channels are implicated in febrile seizures associated with vaccination; and impaired alternative splicing of the mRNA encoding these channels may also predispose some children to febrile seizures. We propose a unified loss-of-function hypothesis for the spectrum of epilepsy syndromes caused by genetic changes in NaV 1. 1 channels, in which mild impairment predisposes to febrile seizures, intermediate impairment leads to GEFS+ epilepsy, and severe or complete loss of function leads to the intractable seizures and comorbidities of SMEI...|$|R

40|$|The term {{idiopathic}} focal epilepsies {{of childhood}} (IFE) is not formally recognised by the ILAE in its 2010 revision (Berg et al., 2010), nor are {{its members and}} boundaries precisely delineated. The IFEs are amongst the most commonly encountered epilepsy syndromes affecting children. They are fascinating disorders that hold many "treats" for both clinicians and researchers. For example, the IFEs pose {{many of the most}} interesting questions central to epileptology: how are functional brain networks involved in the manifestation of epilepsy? What are the shared mechanisms of comorbidity between epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders? How do focal EEG discharges impact cognitive functioning? What explains the age-related expression of these syndromes? Why are EEG discharges and seizures so tightly locked to slow-wave sleep? In the last few decades, the clinical symptomatology and the respective courses of many IFEs have been described, although they are still not widely appreciated beyond the specialist community. Most neurologists would recognise the core syndromes of IFE to comprise: benign epilepsy of childhood with centro-temporal spikes or Rolandic epilepsy (BECTS/RE); Panayiotopoulos syndrome; and the idiopathic occipital epilepsies (Gastaut and photosensitive types). The Landau-Kleffner syndrome and the related (idiopathic) epilepsy with continuous spikes and waves in sleep (CSWS or ESES) are also often included, both {{as a consequence of the}} shared morphology of the interictal discharges and their potential evolution from core syndromes, for example, CSWS from BECTS. Atypical benign focal epilepsy of childhood also has shared electro-clinical features warranting inclusion. In addition, a number of less well-defined syndromes of IFE have been proposed, including benign childhood seizures with affective symptoms, benign childhood epilepsy with parietal spikes, benign childhood seizures with frontal or midline spikes, and benign focal seizures of adolescence. The term "benign" is often used in connection with the IFEs and is increasingly being challenged. Certainly most of these disorders are not associated with the devastating cognitive and behavioural problems seen with early childhood epileptic encephalopathies, such as West or <b>Dravet</b> <b>syndromes.</b> However, it is clear that specific, and sometimes persistent, neuropsychological deficits in attention, language and literacy accompany many of the IFEs that, when multiplied by the large numbers affected, make up a significant public health problem. Understanding the nature, distribution, evolution, risk and management of these is an important area of current research. A corollary to such questions regarding comorbidities is the role of focal interictal spikes and their enduring impact on cognitive functioning. What explains the paradox that epilepsies characterised by abundant interictal epileptiform abnormalities are often associated with very few clinical seizures? This is an exciting area in both clinical and experimental arenas and will eventually have important implications for clinical management of the whole child, taking into account not just seizures, but also adaptive functioning and quality of life. For several decades, we have accepted an evidence-free approach to using or not using antiepileptic drugs in IFEs. There is huge international variation and only a handful of studies examining neurocognitive outcomes. Clearly, this is a situation ready for an overhaul in practice. Fundamental to understanding treatment is knowledge of aetiology. In recent years, there have been several significant discoveries in IFEs from studies of copy number variation, exome sequencing, and linkage that prompt reconsideration of the "unknown cause" classification and strongly suggest a genetic aetiology. The IFE are strongly age-related, both with regards to age of seizure onset and remission. Does this time window solely relate to a similar age-related gene expression, or are there epigenetic factors involved that might also explain low observed twin concordance? The genetic (and epigenetic) models for different IFEs, their comorbidities, and their similarities to other neurodevelopmental disorders deserve investigation in the coming years. In so doing, we will probably learn much about normal brain functioning. This is because these disorders, perhaps more than any other human brain disease, are disorders of functional brain systems (even though these functional networks may not yet be fully defined). In June 2012, an international group of clinical and basic science researchers met in London under the auspices of the Waterloo Foundation to discuss and debate these issues in relation to IFEs. This Waterloo Foundation Symposium on the Idiopathic Focal Epilepsies: Phenotype to Genotype witnessed presentations that explored the clinical phenomenology, phenotypes and endophenotypes, and genetic approaches to investigation of these disorders. In parallel, the impact of these epilepsies on children and their families was reviewed. The papers in this supplement are based upon these presentations. They represent an updated state-of-the-art thinking on the topics explored. The symposium led to the formation of international working groups under the umbrella of "Luke's Idiopathic Focal Epilepsy Project" to investigate various aspects of the idiopathic focal epilepsies including: semiology and classification, genetics, cognition, sleep, high-frequency oscillations, and parental resources (see www. childhood-epilepsy. org).
