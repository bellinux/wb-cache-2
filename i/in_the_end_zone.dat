After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E
