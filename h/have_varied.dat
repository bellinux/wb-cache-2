5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency.

However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans <b>have</b> <b>varied</b> widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term.

His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E
