40|$|Computer {{models of}} life and {{reliability}} are presented for planetary gear trains with a <b>fixed</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> input applied to the sun gear, and output taken from the planet arm. For this transmission the {{input and output shafts}} are co-axial and the input and output torques are assumed to be coaxial with these shafts. Thrust and side loading are neglected. The reliability model is based on the Weibull distributions of the individual reliabilities of the in transmission components. The system model is also a Weibull distribution. The load versus life model for the system is a power relationship as the models for the individual components. The load-life exponent and basic dynamic capacity are developed as functions of the components capacities. The models are used to compare three and four planet, 150 kW (200 hp), 5 : 1 reduction transmissions with 1500 rpm input speed to illustrate their use...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input sun gear, a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' gear above the sun gear, a split ring gear that has a fixed lower ring gear coaxial with the sun gear and a rotating upper ring gear also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring gears together. Within the split ring gear is an even number of planet gears between the split ring gear and the sun gear. Each planet gear consists of an upper planet gear, and lower planet gear with {{the upper and lower}} planet gears splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet gears. The lower planet gear meshes with the input sun gear and the <b>fixed</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> while the upper planet gear is driven by the lower planet gear and meshes with the rotating ring gear...|$|E
50|$|Epicyclic gearing is also {{available}} which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with the sun gear, while the second planet meshes with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> For this case, when the carrier is <b>fixed,</b> the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> rotates {{in the same direction}} as the sun gear, thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.|$|R
50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train can be assembled so the planet gear rolls {{on the inside}} of the pitch circle of a <b>fixed,</b> outer <b>gear</b> <b>ring,</b> or <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> sometimes called an annular gear. In this case, the curve traced by a point on the pitch circle of the planet is a hypocycloid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce volume of robot actuator, a novel gear meshing motor with three phase poles was presented. The rotors and {{external}} gears are connected as one part by which the external gears are driven meshing with <b>fixed</b> internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to output big torque. The torque is convenient to be controlled for its separated magnetic poles without magnetic coupling. The operation principle and magnetic field characteristics were analyzed and the control method was introduced. The finite element software Ansof. Maxwell is used to simulate and calculate the flux linkage where rotor was at different positions, and the static torque obtained directly through magnetic coenergy method. The simulation results verify that output torque of designed motor can reach 1. 9 Nm under 4 A current...|$|R

5000|$|This {{rotation}} of the planet gears can in turn drive the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> (not depicted in diagram), in a corresponding ratio. If the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has N teeth, then the ring will rotate by N/N turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Extending this case from the one above: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of a <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
30|$|The typical {{vibration}} modes also {{arise if}} the elastic components {{such as the}} thin <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are considered [11, 12]. Wu and Parker [11] examined the PGT with elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and identified the rigid-elastic vibration modes, and later Parker and Wu [12] proved the vibration modes of the PGT with unequally-spaced planets and elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Tanna and Lim [15, 16] examined the <b>ring</b> <b>gear’s</b> free vibration and proved the elastic vibration modes, including in-plane extensional, radial inextensional, out-of-plane bending, and torsional deformations. It seems that similar modes to those in Refs. [11, 12] can be found for the helical planetary <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> even when considering various deformations owing to the symmetries. However, {{it could be a}} challenge to develop an analytical model incorporating many deformations. Even so, the theoretical analysis is another difficulty to be overcome.|$|R

5000|$|The {{combination}} of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a sun <b>gear</b> and a <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> {{is called a}} planetary gear train. [...] In this case, the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is usually <b>fixed</b> and the sun gear is driven.|$|R
40|$|The {{strain of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> can reflect the dynamic {{characteristics}} of planetary gearboxes directly, which makes it an ideal signal to monitor the health condition of the gearbox. To overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods, a new approach for the dynamic measurement of <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the installation of FBGs is determined according to the analysis for the strain distribution of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Secondly, {{the parameters of the}} FBG are determined in consideration of the accuracy and sensitivity of the measurement as well as the size of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The strain measured by the FBG is then simulated under non-uniform strain field conditions. Thirdly, a dynamic measurement system is built and tested. Finally, the strains of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are measured in a planetary gearbox under normal and faulty conditions. The experimental results showed good agreement with the theoretical results in values, trends, and the fault features {{can be seen from the}} time domain of the measured strain signal, which proves that the proposed method is feasible for the measurement of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains of planetary gearboxes...|$|R
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R
40|$|A new rotary {{actuator}} is reported {{that consists of}} a motor functionally integrated with the transmission of a <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in a single element which {{is driven by the}} rotating magnetic vector in the stator. Because the number of teeth on the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is different from that on the <b>fixed</b> ground <b>gear,</b> the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> rotates at a fraction of a revolution and simultaneously rotates the output gear in one eccentric cycle in the opposite direction. The advantages of the design are that only two bearings are required on a low speed output shaft...|$|R
40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an annular <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical gear teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical gear teeth that are offset from the vertical gear teeth and which contact helical gear teeth on the speeder gear and helical gear teeth on the outer <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> One half of the twist planet gears are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun <b>gear,</b> the outer <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> the speeder gear, and the inner <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash gear system...|$|R

40|$|Phase-oriented gear {{systems are}} {{differential}} planetary transmissions {{in which each}} planet gear has two sets of unequal numbers of teeth indexed at prescribed relative angles (phases). The figure illustrates an application of the phase-oriented gearing concept to a relatively simple speed-reducing differential planetary transmission that includes a sun gear, an idler gear, three identical planet gears, a ground internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Typically, the ground internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and output internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> have different numbers of teeth, giving rise to a progressive and periodic phase shift between the corresponding pairs of teeth engaged by each successive planet gear. To accommodate this phase shift, {{it is necessary to}} introduce a compensating phase shift between the ground-gear-engaging and output-gearengaging sections of each planet gear. This is done by individually orienting each planet gea...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, {{a special}} {{variation}} of epicyclic gearing {{was developed for}} portable radar gear, where a very high reduction ratio in a small package was needed.

One of these two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> was held <b>fixed</b> and had one tooth fewer than did the other.

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R

50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the sun gear which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink <b>gear</b> is the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> or annulus.|$|R
5000|$|Some designs use [...] "stepped-planet" [...] {{which have}} two differently-sized gears on {{either end of}} a common casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end engages the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> This may be {{necessary}} to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have [...] "timing marks" [...] (or [...] "relative gear mesh phase" [...] in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> would give the same effect as a 100T <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> but with half the actual diameter.|$|R

50|$|All modern {{starters}} {{rely on the}} solenoid {{to engage}} the starter drive with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of the flywheel. When the solenoid is energized, it operates a plunger or lever which forces the pinion into mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The pinion incorporates a one way clutch {{so that when the}} engine starts and runs it will not attempt to drive the starter motor at excessive RPM.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{drawback}} to the Bendix drive {{is that it}} relies on {{a certain amount of}} [...] "clash" [...] between the teeth of the pinion and the <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> before they slip into place and mate completely; the teeth of the pinion are already spinning when they come into contact with the static <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and unless they happen to align perfectly at the moment they engage, the pinion teeth will strike the teeth of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> side-to-side rather than face-to-face, and continue to rotate until both align. This increases wear on both sets of teeth. For this reason the Bendix drive has been largely superseded in starter motor design by the pre-engagement system using a solenoid.|$|R
