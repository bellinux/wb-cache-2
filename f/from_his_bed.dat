5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b> Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E

25|$|The war {{was brought}} {{close to home}} for the Athlones also because many of those {{belonging}} to displaced European royal families sought refuge in Canada and resided {{at or near the}} royal and viceroyal residence, Rideau Hall. Among the royal guests were Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway; Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Luxembourg; King Peter of Yugoslavia; King George of Greece; Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Austria) and her daughters; as well as Queen Wilhelmina and her daughter, Princess Juliana. Further, in December 1941, British prime minister Winston Churchill arrived at Rideau Hall, where he presided over British Cabinet meetings via telephone <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 10 July, Sir William Waller took post on Roundway Down, {{overlooking}} Devizes, {{and captured}} a Royalist ammunition column from Oxford. On 11 July {{he came down}} and invested Hopton's foot in Devizes itself. The Royalist cavalry, Hertford and Maurice with them, rode away towards Salisbury. But although the siege of Devizes was pressed with such vigour that an assault was fixed for the evening of 13 July, the Cornishmen, Hopton directing the defence <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed,</b> held out stubbornly. On the afternoon of 13 July, Prince Maurice's horsemen appeared on Roundway Down, having ridden to Oxford, picked up reinforcements there, and returned at full speed to save their comrades.|$|E
25|$|Beethoven's first {{music teacher}} was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court organist Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who {{provided}} keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and viola). From the outset his tuition regime, {{which began in}} his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with {{the involvement of the}} insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> to the keyboard. Beethoven's musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of Leopold Mozart's successes in this area (with his son Wolfgang and daughter Nannerl), attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy, claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for Beethoven's first public performance in March 1778.|$|E

25|$|Protagoras {{does not}} deny being a Sophist, and claims {{that it is an}} ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used the arts as a screen, a front, to protect {{themselves}} from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus would not want to miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> (317c–e). According to Francis Bacon, Prodicus is led to produce a speech in the dialogue (337a), which seems to Bacon as humiliating for him.|$|E
25|$|Seahorse {{captured}} Sartine on 25 August 1778. Sartine {{had been}} patrolling off Pondichéry with Pourvoyeuse when they sighted two East Indiamen, which were sailing blithely along, {{unaware of the}} outbreak of war. The French vessels gave chase lazily. Sartines captain, Count du Chaillar (or Blanquet du Chayla), first had to be roused <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> ashore. The British merchant vessels escaped, but Sartine came too close to Vernon's squadron. Vernon sent Coventry and Seahorse to engage Sartine. Brisson sailed to support Sartine, but Valentine intercepted Brisson, which retreated. Sartine then surrendered after a short action. A French account remarks acidly that she surrendered to a frigate of her own size without a fight. All four Royal Navy vessels in Vernon's squadron shared in the prize money. (Vernon had already sent Valentine off with dispatches.) Tronjoly Chief and his deputy, Saint-Orens, captain of Pourvoyeuse {{have been criticized for}} not engaging Vernon and Rippon, despite orders from Guillaume-Léonard de Bellecombe, governor of Pondicherry, to do so.|$|E
25|$|Andrianjafy became bolder {{and decided}} to send a group of assassins to Ramboasalama's {{residence}} in Ambohimanga; confident of his plan, he showed the funeral goods he had prepared for Ramboasalama to his brother, and then departed his stronghold at Ambohimanga for a circumcision ceremony {{to be held at}} Ilafy. Andriantsimitovizainitrimo promptly sent a messenger to his nephew instructing him to flee. Rather than leave Ambohimanga, Ramboasalama followed the advice of an elder who instructed him to sacrifice a ram to invoke ancestral protection. The elder then gathered the twelve most respected men of Ambohimanga and thirty soldiers, and rallied them to enforce the decree of Andriambelomasina by overthrowing Andrianjafy and swearing allegiance to Ramboasalama, who took the throne name Andrianampoinimerina. The support of the Tsimahafotsy, inhabitants of Ambohimanga, ensured the defense of the city against efforts by Andrianjafy to reclaim his capital and his authority. Enraged, Andrianjafy took revenge against his brother Andriantsimitovizainitrimo, whom he murdered by pulling him <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed,</b> which was raised in the traditional style over fifteen feet above the ground.|$|E

25|$|During the war, {{the palace}} became {{the home in}} exile {{of a number of}} royals {{displaced}} by the invasions of their respective countries back in Europe. Among the royal guests were Crown Prince Olav (later King Olav V) and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway, Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Luxembourg, King Peter II of Yugoslavia, King George II of Greece, Empress Zita of Austria and her daughters, as well as Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, her daughter, Princess Juliana (later Queen Juliana), and granddaughters, Princesses Beatrix (later Queen Beatrix) and Margriet. Though the resident governor general's wife, Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, could do little to add her personal touch to Rideau Hall, due to rationing and scarce supplies, she put many of the other royal ladies to work making clothing for those who had lost their homes in the Blitz. It was then in 1940 that the governor general's office in the East Block of Parliament Hill was closed and moved to Rideau Hall and, in December of the following year, Winston Churchill arrived at the hall, where he presided over British Cabinet meetings via telephone <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed</b> and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

500|$|Randall's {{positions}} {{on tariffs and}} pensions had made him, according to The New York Times, [...] "a practical Republican" [...] by 1888.

When the new congress began in 1889, he received special permission to be sworn into office <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>bed,</b> where he was confined.
