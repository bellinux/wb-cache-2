5|$|Larger {{animals are}} not as common, but are still present. A grizzly bear was photographed near Cascade pass in October2010, {{and as many as}} twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades, south of the Canada–US border. Wolves, pine martens lynx, wolverines, cougars, weasels, and black bears are also present, and are usually {{detected}} by camera traps. During the summer, bears consume up to 30,000 calories a day in preparation for hibernation, in a dietary phase known as <b>hyperphagia.</b> There have also been attempts to re-introduce fishers to the region. Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary, and are so secretive that they are seldom seen. Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s, but began re-establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990.|$|E
25|$|Prader-Willi {{syndrome}} with an incidence between 1 in 12,000 and 1 in 15,000 {{live births}} {{is characterized by}} <b>hyperphagia</b> and food preoccupations which leads to rapid weight gain in those affected.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic {{criteria}} for KLS {{was established by}} Schmidt in 1990, and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders further refined them. KLS is classified as a sleep disorder, specifically one of recurrent hypersomnia. Before 2005, <b>hyperphagia</b> and hypersexuality were thought to occur in all cases. That was changed with the guidelines published that year, which noted {{that they did not}} always occur.|$|E
25|$|In rats, sleep {{deprivation}} causes {{weight loss and}} reduced body temperature. Rats kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, <b>hyperphagia,</b> loss of body mass, hypothermia, and, eventually, fatal sepsis. Sleep deprivation also hinders the healing of burns on rats. When compared with a control group, sleep-deprived rats' blood tests indicated a 20% decrease in white blood cell count, {{a significant change in}} the immune system.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} growth {{abnormalities}} associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome. One common problem is delayed growth or difficulty in gaining weight. Even {{though some of}} the children may eat well, they still may not grow normally. In contrast, some children may develop <b>hyperphagia,</b> which is overeating, and may become obese. These children clinically resemble children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Developmental delay has also been severe in the patients with the Prader-Willi like characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The extreme lateral {{part of the}} ventromedial {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} {{is responsible for the}} control of food intake. Stimulation of this area causes increased food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area causes complete cessation of food intake. Medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part. Bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes <b>hyperphagia</b> and obesity of the animal. Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation of food intake.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{appetite}} (<b>hyperphagia)</b> {{and unusual}} cravings {{are present in}} half to two thirds of cases. About half of patients, mainly male patients, experience dramatically increased sexual urges (hypersexuality). Several other symptoms usually accompany the syndrome, including marked changes in mood and cognitive ability. Derealization and severe apathy are present in at least 80 percent of cases. About one third of patients experience hallucinations or delusions. Depression and anxiety occur less commonly; one study found them in about 25 percent of patients. Individuals usually cannot remember what happened during episodes. Repetitive behaviors and headaches are commonly reported. Some patients act very childlike during episodes, and communication skills and coordination sometimes suffer.|$|E
25|$|Kleine–Levin {{syndrome}} (KLS), {{also known}} as Sleeping Beauty syndrome, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by persistent episodic hypersomnia and cognitive or mood changes. Many patients also experience <b>hyperphagia,</b> hypersexuality and other symptoms. Patients generally experience recurrent episodes of the condition {{for more than a}} decade and may return at a later age. Individual episodes generally last more than a week. Some times lasting for months. The condition greatly affects the personal, professional, and social lives of sufferers. The severity of symptoms and the course of the syndrome vary between sufferers. Patients commonly have about 20 episodes over about a decade. Several months generally elapse between episodes. The onset of the condition usually follows a viral infection; several different viruses have been observed to trigger KLS. It is generally only diagnosed after similar conditions have been excluded; MRI, CT scans, lumbar puncture, and toxicology tests are used to rule out other possibilities. The syndrome's mechanism is not known, but the thalamus is thought to possibly play a role. Tomography has shown hypoperfusion in the brains of patients during episodes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with <b>hyperphagia.</b> Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial Leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E
25|$|A {{limitation}} of food sources {{in early spring}} and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months may be contributing factors to black bears regularly feeding from commercial human-based food sources. Crops are frequently eaten by these bears, especially during autumn <b>hyperphagia</b> when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops may include apples, oats and corns. Black bears can do extensive damage {{in some areas of}} the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. Though black bears have the capacity to (and occasionally do) hunt adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer smaller, more easily overwhelmed prey such as sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, back, and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; {{whether or not this is}} intentional is not known. Occasionally, pets, especially dogs, which are most prone to harass a bear, are killed by black bears. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs as a deterrent from bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs sometimes cause a bear to run, if pressed, angry bears frequently turn the tables and end up chasing the dog in return. A bear in pursuit of a pet dog has the potential to threaten both canid and human lives.|$|E
25|$|Generally, American {{black bears}} are largely crepuscular in {{foraging}} activity, though may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% {{of the black}} bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn <b>hyperphagia,</b> feeding becomes virtually the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts {{become the most important}} part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.|$|E
500|$|Hedonic hunger or hedonic <b>hyperphagia</b> is [...] "the {{drive to}} eat to obtain {{pleasure}} {{in the absence of}} an energy deficit." [...] Particular foods may have a high [...] "hedonic rating" [...] or individuals may have increased susceptibility to environmental food cues. Weight loss programs may aim to control or to compensate for hedonic hunger.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for winter, bears can gain approximately , {{during a period}} of <b>hyperphagia,</b> before going into hibernation. The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above [...] on north-facing slopes. There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can [...] "partially" [...] recycle their body wastes during this period. Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Haploinsufficiency of SIM1 {{has been}} shown to cause severe early-onset obesity in a human girl with a de novo {{balanced}} translocation between chromosomes 1p22.1 and 6q16.2 [...] and has been suggested to cause a Prader-Willi-like phenotype in other cases. Additionally, studies in mice have shown that haploinsufficieny of Sim1 causes obesity that is due to <b>hyperphagia</b> and do not respond properly to increased dietary fat. Overexpression of SIM1 protects against diet induced obesity and rescues the <b>hyperphagia</b> of agouti yellow mice, who have disrupted melanocortin signaling. The obesity and <b>hyperphagia</b> may be mediated by impaired melanocortin activation of PVN neurons [...] and oxytocin deficiency in these mice. It has been demonstrated that modulating Sim1 levels postnatally also leads to <b>hyperphagia</b> and obesity, suggesting a physiological role for Sim1 separate from its role in development.|$|E

50|$|The ACADS gene {{has also}} been implicated in delaying the onset of Prader-Willi Syndrome, which is {{characterized}} by hypotonia, growth failure, and neurodevelopmental delays {{in the first years}} of life, and <b>hyperphagia</b> and obesity much later.|$|E

50|$|People with Prader-Willi {{syndrome}} {{have high}} ghrelin levels, which {{are thought to}} directly contribute to the increased appetite, <b>hyperphagia,</b> and obesity seen in this syndrome. Cassidy states {{the need for a}} clear delineation of behavioral expectations, the reinforcement of behavioural limits and the establishment of regular routines.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{differences}} in the physiological stress response may {{also contribute to the}} development of emotional eating habits. Those whose adrenal glands naturally secrete larger quantities of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor are more inclined toward <b>hyperphagia,</b> which can act as a physiological catalyst for emotional eating. Additionally, those whose bodies require more time to clear the bloodstream of excess glucocorticoids are similarly predisposed. These biological factors can interact with environmental elements to further trigger <b>hyperphagia,</b> namely the type of stressor the individual is subjected to. Frequent intermittent stressors trigger repeated, sporadic releases of glucocorticoids broken up by intervals too short to allow for a complete return to baseline levels, leading to increased appetite. Those whose lifestyles or careers entail frequent intermittent stressors thus have greater biological incentive to develop patterns of emotional eating.|$|E
50|$|In psychology, {{disinhibition}} {{is a lack}} {{of restraint}} manifested in disregard for social conventions, impulsivity, and poor risk assessment. Disinhibition affects motor, instinctual, emotional, cognitive, and perceptual aspects with signs and symptoms similar to the diagnostic criteria for mania. Hypersexuality, <b>hyperphagia,</b> and aggressive outbursts are indicative of disinhibited instinctual drives.|$|E
5000|$|The ventromedial nucleus (VMN) is most {{commonly}} associated with satiety. Early studies showed that VMN lesions caused over-eating and obesity in rats. However, the interpretation of these experiments was summarily discredited when Gold's research demonstrated that precision lesioning of the VMN {{did not result in}} <b>hyperphagia.</b> Nevertheless, numerous {{studies have shown that the}} immediacy of <b>hyperphagia</b> and obesity syndrome are a consequence of VMN lesions or procaine injections, and point to the VMN's role in satiety. A major review of the subject in 2006 concluded that, [...] "anatomical studies done both before and after Gold's study did not replicate his results with lesions, and in nearly every published direct comparison of VMH lesions vs. PVN or VNAB lesions, the group with VMH lesions ate substantially more food and gained twice as much weight." [...] This strongly substantiates the classification of VMN as the primary satiety center in the hypothalamus.|$|E

50|$|Many of the parabiotic pairs died {{throughout}} the experiment before its conclusion. In each pair, one rat became obese and exhibited <b>hyperphagia.</b> The {{weight of the}} rat with the surgical lesion rose rapidly for a few months, then reached a plateau {{as a direct result}} of the surgical procedure. After the procedure, the rat with the impaired hypothalamus voraciously ate and the paired rat decreased their appetite. The paired rat became obviously thin {{throughout the}} experiment, even rejecting food when it was offered. Some of the paired rats starved to death. Lesions subsequently made in the hypothalamus of two paired rats resulted in <b>hyperphagia</b> and obesity. That result verifies that the paired rat decreased its eating in a direct response to the signals in the blood from the rat with the lesion. If its brain was similarly altered, it also ate voraciously and became obese. The control rats who were given surgical lesions in the hypothalamus became similarly obese to the parabiotic counterparts.|$|E
