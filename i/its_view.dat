5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale, and he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by <b>its</b> <b>view</b> of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} Ethiopian biographical {{tradition}} became far more complex, intertextual, and broader in <b>its</b> <b>view</b> {{of the world}} given Ethiopia's direct involvement in the conflicts between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires in the Red Sea region. The annals of Dawit II (r. 1508–1540) describe the defensive war he waged against the Adal sultan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (r. 1527–1543), in an episodic format {{quite different from the}} earlier chronicling tradition. The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church abbot Enbaqom (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous Ethiopian work of history. It explains the Ethiopian emperor's military alliance with Cristóvão da Gama (1516–1542), son of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the Ottoman governor of Yemen, Özdemir Pasha (d. 1560).|$|E

5|$|In British Guiana, {{the leftist}} People's Progressive Party (PPP) {{candidate}} Cheddi Jagan won {{the position of}} chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution. Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961; despite Britain's shift to a reconsideration of <b>its</b> <b>view</b> of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time, the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in <b>its</b> <b>view</b> go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Singapore {{claimed that}} the old Johor Sultanate, which {{controlled}} a maritime Malay empire from a capital on the Johor River, {{was not the same}} as the new Johor Sultanate occupying only the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula that came into existence after the signing of the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In <b>its</b> <b>view,</b> the Anglo–Dutch Treaty did not divide up the Singapore Strait, in which Pedra Branca is situated, between the new Johor Sultanate under the British sphere of influence and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate under Dutch influence. Instead, both Britain and the Netherlands could access the Strait freely. Therefore, there was a legal vacuum with regard to sovereignty over the island, enabling the British to lawfully take possession of it between 1847 and 1851.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The model-view-controller {{pattern is}} used to keep a data model and <b>its</b> <b>views</b> consistent. Usually there is a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between the data in the model and its representation in the views, which is sometimes too inflexible. We propose to add so-called data mappings between the model and <b>its</b> <b>views.</b> Data mappings are components that can be plugged together hierarchically. They can perform any transformations on the data as well on notifications, thus allowing a more flexible collaboration between a model and <b>its</b> <b>views.</b> GUI builders can be extended so that a user can add data mappings to a graphical user interface interactively, i. e. without programming. ...|$|R
5|$|The museum's National Mall {{building}} construction began in mid-1983. The project, which also included the Sackler Gallery for the Smithsonian's Asian art, created 368,000 {{square feet of}} exhibition space {{at a cost of}} $73.2 million, half of which from the federal government. Almost all of this room was created underground so as not to affect the quadrangle's landmark Smithsonian Institution Building (the Castle), its greenery, or <b>its</b> <b>view.</b> The Smithsonian Castle hides the museum and South Quadrangle from the National Mall, which has contributed to the museum's lower attendance compared with other Mall attractions. The quadrangle project's design architect was Jean-Paul Carlhian of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, based on a concept by Junzō Yoshimura. The two new museums had little involvement in the architectural designs, which were drawn in the 1970s prior to their arrival.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1961, {{differences}} in monetary policy led to open conflict with Bank of Canada Governor Coyne, who adhered to a tight money policy. Appointed by St. Laurent to a term expiring in December 1961, Coyne {{could only be}} dismissed before then by the passing of an Act of Parliament. Coyne defended his position by giving public speeches, {{to the dismay of}} the government. The Cabinet was also angered when it learned that Coyne and his board had passed amendments to the bank's pension scheme which greatly increased Coyne's pension, without publishing the amendments in the Canada Gazette as required by law. Negotiations between Minister of Finance Fleming and Coyne for the latter's resignation broke down, with the governor making the dispute public, and Diefenbaker sought to dismiss Coyne by legislation. Diefenbaker was able to get legislation to dismiss Coyne through the House, but the Liberal-controlled Senate invited Coyne to testify before one of its committees. After giving the governor a platform against the government, the committee then chose to take no further action, adding <b>its</b> <b>view</b> that Coyne had done nothing wrong. Once he had the opportunity to testify (denied him in the Commons), Coyne resigned, keeping his increased pension, and the government was extensively criticized in the press.|$|E
