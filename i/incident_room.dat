25|$|The Metropolitan Police Service {{announced}} that it was to open up a special <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> to field calls from the public, following the BBC documentary The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence. The Independent Police Complaints Commission later stated that the claims made in the programme were unfounded.|$|E
25|$|When Glossop {{was granted}} Municipal Borough Status in 1867, the Watch Committee elected to {{implement}} its own police force. Glossop Police remained independent until 1947 when they amalgamated with the Derbyshire Constabulary. The police station on Ellison Street is staffed by statutory police officers from B Division of Derbyshire Constabulary. It has a custody suite, five cells and an <b>incident</b> <b>room.</b> There {{are also a}} team of volunteer special constables and six police community support officers.|$|E
25|$|West Yorkshire Police were criticised {{for being}} inadequately {{prepared}} {{for an investigation}} on this scale. It {{was one of the}} largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.|$|E
50|$|When North Yorkshire Police {{received}} {{details of}} the Girton murder and of the Torksey robbery they concluded that the same man was responsible and the <b>incident</b> <b>rooms</b> at Nottinghamshire Police and Lincolnshire Police were connected to the North Yorkshire computer to allow the three forces to share and compare information relating to the investigations.|$|R
5000|$|He {{considers}} the book {{a cautionary tale}} against diagnosing someone without really knowing them, and {{about the need to}} avoid confirmation bias. He thinks that is [...] "part of the reason why there are so many miscarriages of justice in the psychopath-spotting field." [...] He does believe that Hare's construct of psychopathy applies to some people, and that their victims deserve sympathy, but is concerned about the [...] "alarming world of globe-trotting experts, forensic psychologists, criminal profilers, traveling the planet armed with nothing much more than a Certificate of Attendance, just like the one I had. These people might have influence inside parole hearings, death penalty hearings, serial-killer <b>incident</b> <b>rooms,</b> and on and on." ...|$|R
50|$|The police {{may also}} use buses {{converted}} by a bus manufacturer or other specialist company (from a new or retired school bus-style body), to serve more specific purposes. This {{can be as}} an <b>incident</b> control <b>room</b> or mobile command post, or even as small mobile police stations for public events. The Toronto Police Service, for instance, has used retired transit buses for their fleet.|$|R
25|$|The police {{set up a}} {{makeshift}} <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> in a former police station on Gordon Street and began talking to local people about the fire and the family. They were surprised and shocked by a rather casual response from the neighbourhood regarding the brothers, despite {{the severity of the}} fire which led to their deaths. The indifference of the neighbourhood came to a climax at the joint funeral for the boys in January 1980 when a grief-stricken Edith Hastie issued an outburst to the gathering crowd over their lack of sympathy for the loss of her sons. The two boys were buried together in one grave at the Northern Cemetery in Hull.|$|E
25|$|Then Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan (who {{retired in}} March 2014) {{attended}} a case conference at Dundalk Garda Station {{on the weekend}} after Donohoe's death, where an <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> was established {{for the duration of}} the investigation. Commissioner Callinan announced the allocation of 150 senior detectives to the case. The investigation team would be led by Assistant Commissioner Kieran Kenny of the Northern Region, Chief Superintendent Pat McGee of the County Louth Division, Superintendent Gerry Curley and Detective Superintendent John O'Reilly of Dundalk Garda Station. National specialist units were assigned to the investigation, including the Special Detective Unit (SDU), National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI) and Organised Crime Unit (OCU). The force's armed intervention teams - Emergency Response Unit (ERU) and Regional Support Unit (RSU) - were placed on alert in the aftermath.|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|The Marine Corps {{sent him}} to Manila, Philippines. On {{garrison}} duty with little to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified <b>incident</b> in his <b>room.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Purse had a quiet 2003-04 campaign, making {{only nine}} Premier League appearances. He did, however, hit the {{headlines}} after elbowing Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu; the Romanian reportedly launched a [...] "volley of expletives" [...] at Purse in a post-match dressing <b>room</b> <b>incident.</b>|$|R
50|$|NIE Networks has {{developed}} a set of procedures for dealing with major incidents, such as storms and snow, driven by the Boxing Day Storm of 1998, during which 162,000 customers were off-supply. At the company's office in Craigavon, a small <b>incident</b> management <b>room</b> sits {{in a constant state}} of readiness. Each week, the Duty Incident Manager meets with the other designated incident team members, in charge of resources, customer contact and network status, to perform a risk assessment of the week ahead.|$|R
2500|$|This {{letter was}} marked [...] "Priority No 1". An index card was created {{on the basis}} of the letter and a policewoman found Sutcliffe already had three {{existing}} index cards in the records. But [...] "for some inexplicable reason", said the Byford Report, the papers remained in a filing tray in the <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> until the murderer's arrest on 2 January the following year.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 August 2016 {{the police}} {{investigation}} {{was the subject}} of BBC Radio 4's The Reunion. Sue MacGregor discussed the investigation with John Domaille, who later became Assistant Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police; Andy Laptew, who was a junior detective who interviewed Sutcliffe; Elaine Benson, who worked in the <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> and interviewed suspects; David Zackrisson who investigated the [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] tape and letters in Sunderland and Christa Ackroyd, a local journalist in Halifax.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emergency}} services established a temporary triage facility and rescue centre outside Yew Tree Cottage and later an <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> at Horley police station. Survivors {{were taken into}} Fernhill House before being transferred to Redhill General Hospital or, {{in the case of}} five badly burned people, the McIndoe Burns Unit at East Grinstead Hospital. Two passengers died en route to Redhill General. The baby who survived in the wreckage of the house was also taken there suffering from [...] "severe bruising and slight cuts".|$|E
50|$|A coconut shy-type game where, {{following}} a dressing <b>room</b> <b>incident</b> between Alex Ferguson and David Beckham where Ferguson reportedly kicked a football boot which hit Beckham in the head, all the panellists took turns to kick a football boot at cardboard cut-outs of Beckham's face.|$|R
50|$|Hannah {{admitted}} to Justin {{that she did}} have a relapse, but it was after the whole Ash hiding the food in her <b>room</b> <b>incident.</b> Justin then went on to be honest with Hannah and confessed his darkest secret to her, that he helped Warren bury Sean Kennedy's body.|$|R
50|$|Tang Fu-zhen's sister Tang Fu-jing (唐福英) {{said that}} after the immolation <b>incident,</b> her {{hospital}} <b>room</b> was protected by 4 people. She {{was not able to}} see her sister at all. On November 29, 11pm Tang Fu-zhen was officially pronounced dead by the hospital. The building was also destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{investigation}} was headed by Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss of the Warwickshire Police Force. An <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> {{was set up}} at Bedworth Police Station.|$|E
5000|$|The {{store was}} {{mentioned}} in {{an episode of}} BBC One's drama series Ashes to Ashes in April 2009. On seeing DS Ray Carling using a mirror, DCI Gene Hunt commented, [...] "Sorry, is this an <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> or the make up counter at Kendals?" ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the video}} game Lost: Via Domus, the <b>Incident</b> <b>Room</b> is the {{abandoned}} laboratory revealed {{to be on the}} other side of the concrete wall in the Swan. The room was accessed by a tunnel and a large locked door. The room contains a large reactor and other severely damaged equipment. The reactor is tilted to one side and discharging electricity as well as coolant fluid. It has the appearance of two large electromagnetic coils suspended over a drilled shaft into the Island surrounded by severely damaged concrete. The <b>Incident</b> <b>Room</b> has its own computer much like the Swan's. This section of the Swan appeared on the blast door map as a blocked off section of the station ("Lockdown"), but was never seen in the show itself.|$|E
5000|$|His £15,500 {{transfer}} from Morton to Derby County in 1947 was a then British transfer record.

2500|$|When {{the dessert}} failed to impress, {{the public was}} annoyed that Fanny Cradock had {{seemingly}} ruined Mrs Troake's special day. Fanny wrote a letter of apology to Mrs Troake, but the BBC terminated her contract {{two weeks after the}} broadcast of programme. She would never again present a cookery programme for the BBC. (Mrs Troake, by contrast, published A Country Cookbook the following year.) Speaking about the <b>incident</b> on <b>Room</b> 101 in 1999, The Big Time presenter Esther Rantzen described Cradock as [...] "hell on wheels", and that she had [...] "reduced this poor little lady [...] to nothing".|$|R
50|$|After a {{training}} <b>room</b> <b>incident</b> {{in which he}} punched Roger Staubach during the 1976 preseason, the team suspended and eventually traded him to the San Diego Chargers for first and second draft choices; the Cowboys used those two picks and two other picks to eventually land the No. 2 overall pick in the 1977 draft, selecting Tony Dorsett.|$|R
50|$|Up to 50 {{officers}} {{were assigned to}} the case to take witness statements and carry out door to door enquiries. During the course of the investigation, Bayliss made several appeals directly to the public through news media allowing news cameras access to the <b>incident</b> <b>room</b> and to follow teams of detectives during the investigation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Incident</b> <b>Room</b> {{has been}} {{mentioned}} several times in Lost. When Sayid first visited the Swan he {{tried to find a}} way past the concrete wall, but it was just too thick to get through. Sayid told Jack that [...] "The last time I heard of concrete being poured over everything in this way was Chernobyl", ("Everybody Hates Hugo").|$|E

25|$|During his spell at Barcelona, Ibrahimović had a falling-out {{with coach}} Pep Guardiola, {{culminating}} in a dressing <b>room</b> <b>incident</b> in which Ibrahimović threw a training-kit box {{across the room and}} screamed insults at Guardiola. Guardiola eventually refused to speak to Ibrahimović and loaned him out to Milan. Barcelona vice president Carles Vilarrubi further revealed that Ibrahimović had threatened to publicly beat up Guardiola if he was not released to Milan.|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} interaction system, {{which is}} aware of the user’s current cognitive load (CL), can change its response, presentation and flow of interaction material accordingly, to improve user’s experience and performance. We present a speech content analysis approach to CL measurement, which employs users’ linguistic features of speech to determine their experienced CL level. We show analyses of several linguistic features, extracted from speech of personnel working in computerized <b>incident</b> control <b>rooms</b> and involved in highly complex bushfire management tasks in Australia. We present the results of linguistic features showing significant differences between the speech from the cognitively low load and high load tasks. We also discuss how the method may be used for user interface evaluation and interaction design improvement...|$|R
500|$|Conroy {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Worcester City and spoke with Tranmere Rovers manager John King, but instead joined Hong Kong club Bulova on a free transfer in 1979. His two-year contract was cancelled by mutual consent after he pushed the head coach in a dressing <b>room</b> <b>incident.</b> In his autobiography, You Don't Remember Me Do You?, Conroy stated that [...] "the five months we [...] were there seemed like five years".|$|R
50|$|The {{series is}} filmed on the French island of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles, {{mainly in the}} commune of Deshaies (which doubles for the town of Honoré on the fictional island of Saint Marie), {{with the help of}} the Bureau d’accueil des tournages de la Région Guadeloupe. The site of the Honoré police station is a church hall in Deshaies with the priest's office {{appearing}} as their <b>incident</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{failure to}} take {{advantage}} of Birdsall's anonymous letter and his visit to the police station was yet again a stark illustration of the progressive decline in the overall efficiency of the major <b>incident</b> <b>room.</b> It resulted in Sutcliffe being at liberty {{for more than a month}} when he might conceivably have been in custody. Thankfully, there is no reason to think he committed any further murderous assaults within that period.|$|E

50|$|Boykins {{signed with}} the Washington Wizards in November 2009, making {{his return to the}} National Basketball Association. Boykins was a much needed {{addition}} to the Wizards, after guards Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton were suspended {{for the remainder of the}} current season after a misdemeanor gun possession charge stemming from a locker <b>room</b> <b>incident.</b> In the December 2, 2009, game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Boykins sank two free throws to clinch the Wizards' victory.|$|R
50|$|After a {{dressing}} <b>room</b> <b>incident</b> on 6 September 2007, in which Shoaib Akhtar was {{alleged to have}} hit Mohammad Asif with a bat, Akhtar was handed an indefinite ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board and sent home from the tournament before it even began. Sohail Tanvir, an uncapped allrounder, replaced him. Misbah-ul-haq was a controversial selection ahead of Mohammed Yousuf. Yet Misbah ended up the 2nd highest run scorer in the competition.|$|R
50|$|Practice for {{the fall}} began on August 8. Several {{injuries}} occurred during practices; defensive end Adewale Ojomo suffered a broken jaw during a locker <b>room</b> <b>incident</b> that could have {{kept him out of}} the whole season. Defensive end Eric Moncur visited a specialist in Philadelphia on August 19 to have a groin injury examined and was held out of some practices, while defensive end Gavin Hardin was held out of camp with an unknown injury.|$|R
