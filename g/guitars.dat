5|$|On Nothing, Meshuggah {{abandons}} {{the fast}} tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album {{was intended to}} be recorded using custom-made Nevborn eight-string <b>guitars,</b> but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used detuned Ibanez seven-string <b>guitars</b> instead. This technique, which involved keeping the instruments untuned during the sessions, created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string <b>guitars</b> with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on <b>guitars.</b>|$|E
