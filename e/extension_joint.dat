40|$|Due to {{the brittle}} {{behaviour}} of rocks during deformation in surficial conditions, numerous fractures develop, both <b>extension</b> <b>joints</b> and faults. The ratio {{between the number}} of <b>extension</b> <b>joints</b> and the number of faults, j/f, which form in a rock mass has been investigated. In order to simulate the stress evolution and the consequent generation of fractures during time, a mechanical model is proposed, while a specific computer program has been prepared. The model takes into account i) the stochastic distribution of the tensile strength of rocks, ii) the temporal and local stress variations caused by continuous fracturing events and iii) the sealing effect occurring along fractures with time. Several geological parameters, such as the tectonic stress rates and their ratio, the depth (i. e. the confining pressure) {{and the role of the}} pore-fluid pressure have been also considered. In the companion paper, numerical calculations and comparison with field examples are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{existence}} and uniqueness {{of a state}} of a joint system with given restrictions to subsystems is studied for a Fermion system, where a novel feature is non-commutativity between algebras of subsystems. For an arbitrary (finite or infinite) number of given subsystems, a product state extension is shown to exist if and only if all states of subsystems except at most one are even (with respect to the Fermion number). If the states of all subsystems are pure, then the same condition is shown to be necessary and sufficient for the existence of any <b>joint</b> <b>extension.</b> If the condition holds, the unique product state extension is the only <b>joint</b> <b>extension.</b> For a pair of subsystems, with one of the given subsystem states pure, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a <b>joint</b> <b>extension</b> and the form of all <b>joint</b> <b>extensions</b> (unique for almost all cases) are given. For a pair of subsystems with non-pure subsystem states, some classes of examples of <b>joint</b> <b>extensions</b> are given where non-uniqueness of <b>joint</b> <b>extensions</b> prevails. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare hip and knee <b>joint</b> <b>extension</b> torque and the {{activity}} of eight muscles around the hip and knee joints during three squat exercises with different movements. Ten male athletes performed three different squats (Normal squat : NS, Knee push squat : KPS, Hip drive squat : HDS). KPS is the type of squat which emphasizes knee joint movement without moving the hip joint position back and forth. On the other hand, HDS is the type of squat which emphasizes hip joint movement, while keeping the knee joint position fixed. Kinematic and kinetic variables such as angle, angular velocity, net torque and power of the joints of the lower extremity were calculated during the descending and ascending phase of each squat. At the same time, surface electrodes were placed on eight muscles of the lower extremity, and %iEMG was also calculated during the same phases. During the descending phase, Elector spinae muscle activity and hip <b>joint</b> <b>extension</b> torque was significantly greater for HDS than KPS. Rectus femoris and Vastus lateralis muscle activity was significantly greater for KPS than HDS. In addition, KPS showed significantly greater knee <b>joint</b> <b>extension</b> torque than HDS and NS. At the ascending phase, Elector spinae, Glueus maximus and Biceps femoris muscle activity, and hip <b>joint</b> <b>extension</b> torque was significantly greater for HDS than KPS and NS. Rectus femoris muscle activity and knee <b>joint</b> <b>extension</b> torque was significantly greater for KPS than HDS and NS.
