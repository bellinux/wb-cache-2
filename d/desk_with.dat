5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> his fist.|$|E

5|$|The main centre for {{administration}} {{was at the}} entrance to the prison, which included the warden's office. The office contained a <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> radio and telegraph equipment, typewriter, and a telephone.

All visits to Alcatraz required prior written approval from the warden.|$|E

25|$|The central {{building}} block of Jilk's design is the student workstation (<b>desk</b> <b>with</b> bulletin board and storage area). This feature simultaneously meets two objectives: that students {{take on the}} role of workers (the workstation resembles an office cubicle) and that the learning environment promote a sense of identity (students can decorate workstations to reflect personal tastes).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to all of this, BBC2 used in-vision continuity {{for at least the}} first few months of its existence, broadcasting the announcer in studio Pres B, Television Centre. The studio featured a <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> BBC2 branding with the day appearing on the wall behind, as well as highlights of the upcoming programmes. This practice was abandoned by BBCs 1 and 2 at about the same time, and the studio vacated.|$|E
25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of {{political}} correctness. He tends to either {{make a fool of}} himself in front of the office crew or make it intensely uncomfortable. The one who seems to enjoy him the most is Sam Bisaillon, former army cadet who worships David. He shares his <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> Louis Tremblay, who is secretly in love with the shy receptionist Anne Viens. The problem is that Anne is engaged to Luc, a macho warehouse employee.|$|E

25|$|A {{keypunch}} is {{a device}} for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small <b>desk,</b> <b>with</b> a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{comes home}} briefly. He tells {{his wife that}} he has been {{entrusted}} with holding a secret pre-conference meeting at his home with a foreign diplomat who is arriving that night and he leaves to meet them. The room is empty for a moment and Costello re-enters through the French windows. Like Jeremy before, he starts to go through the contents of the <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> the secret drawer. Behind him, the door of the hidden recess opens and an unseen hand clubs him down. He falls to the ground behind a sofa. After Clarissa shows her husband off, she re-enters the room and soon finds the body of Costello. Almost instantly Pippa comes through the hidden recess and starts babbling hysterically that she is responsible. Clarissa tries to calm her down while wondering what she will do...|$|E
25|$|Sala das Tapeçarias Espanholas (Spanish Tapestry Hall), as {{its name}} implies is the {{location}} of eight Spanish tapestries of various sizes, representing Dança (Dance), Passeio na Andaluzia(Walking in Andaluzia), Jogo de Cartas (Card Game), Fonte (Fountain), Merenda (Lunch), Partida para a caça (Departure for the Hunt), Regresso da Caça (Return from the Hunt) and Caçadores(Huntsmen). It was {{also referred to as}} the Sala do Dossel (Canopy Room) or Sala de Audiência(Audience Hall), since it was used by King Luís and Queen Maria Pia to as a waiting room for formal guests. On the semi-vaulted ceiling there is an allegorical mural representing King John IV's departure for Brazil. In addition to various paintings and architectural elements, there are wooden cornices and a parquet floor, while over four doors there allegorical paintings interspersed by the eight large tapestries.

50|$|Architects {{designing}} a physical community space, {{have to consider}} how the architecture will shape social interactions. A long hallway of offices creates an utterly different dynamic than <b>desks</b> <b>with</b> arranged in an open space.

5000|$|The term [...] "Bible box" [...] is {{sometimes}} wrongly {{used in the}} United States to qualify antique objects which are in fact simple portable <b>desks</b> <b>with</b> no biblical connection. A more modern, cheaper and more portable version of the bible box is the bible case.|$|R
500|$|The roof {{dates from}} the 19th century and the {{supporting}} woodwork structure {{can be seen from}} inside the church. [...] The church, which is lit by gas lamps, contains box pews in the nave, and a panelled reading <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> a matching pulpit, one on each side in the sanctuary. [...] Cream paint has been used for the pews, pulpit and reading desk. There are some 18th-century memorial tablets on the south wall of the nave. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted an oak collecting shovel dated 1733, a silver cup dated 1773 and a font of uncertain date.|$|E
500|$|Masereel uses an emotional, Expressionistic {{style to}} create a {{narrative}} replete with allegory, satire, and social criticism—a visual style he continued with throughout his career. [...] He expresses a broad variety of emotions through understated, unexaggerated gestures. [...] Most characters are given simple, passive expressions, which provides emphatic contrast with characters expressing more explicit emotion—love, despair, ecstasy. [...] He considered Passionate Journey partly autobiographical, which he emphasized {{with a pair of}} self-portraits that open the book—in the first, Masereel sits at his <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> his woodcutting tools, and in the second appears the protagonist, dressed in identical fashion with the first. [...] Literature scholar MartinS. Cohen wrote that it expressed themes that were to become universal in the wordless novel genre.|$|E
500|$|The {{church has}} {{national}} recognition and statutory protection from alteration {{as it has}} been designated as a Grade II* listed building– the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating [...] "particularly important buildings of more than special interest". It was given this status on 5 April 1971 because it was regarded as [...] "a good example of a late medieval church, its character maintained in the late 19th-century restoration and rebuilding work, and retaining some of the medieval fabric and windows". Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes [...] "some finely detailed fittings including the chancel screen, reredos, pulpit and reading <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> 17th-century carved panels, and also a late 18th-century gallery at the west end." ...|$|E
60|$|A little {{bell rang}} as she looked, and away scampered the {{children}} into the red-and-green school-house with the roof that lifted up, so one could see how nicely they sat at their <b>desks</b> <b>with</b> mites of books, or drew on the inch-square blackboards with crumbs of chalk.|$|R

5|$|The stalls and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, {{are similar}} to the pews in the nave (being of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading <b>desks</b> <b>with</b> triple pointed arches to the fronts and {{scrolled}} tops to the uprights.|$|R
500|$|In late 2010 as the Jets were {{preparing}} for the playoffs, a foot fetish video of woman appearing to be Ryan's wife Michelle surfaced on various internet outlets. The video features a clothed Michelle having her bare feet handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named [...] "ihaveprettyfeet" [...] on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months. In September 2015, a photo of Ryan surfaced of him sitting at his <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> a framed photo of a person's feet behind him.|$|E
500|$|The fly's {{memory is}} {{triggered}} when it encounters Sudeep and Bindu. Sudeep asks the heartbroken Bindu {{to accompany him}} to New Delhi to meet the education minister; if she can impress the minister with a presentation about the NGO, he might help it gain national recognition. The fly causes Sudeep to have an accident {{on his way to}} the airport and writes [...] "I will kill you" [...] on the windshield; this makes Sudeep paranoid. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> her tears. It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep. The latter's obsession with the fly affects his professional and personal life. In a chain of events, his money is burnt to ashes, leaving him almost penniless.|$|E
500|$|The {{monologue}} {{segment is}} often {{followed by a}} segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent—typically introduced as the show's [...] "senior" [...] specialist in the subject at hand—either at the anchor <b>desk</b> <b>with</b> the host or reporting from a false location {{in front of a}} greenscreen showing stock footage. Their stated areas of expertise vary depending on the news story that is being discussed, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme stereotypes of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as [...] "Senior Latino Correspondent", [...] "Senior Youth Correspondent" [...] or [...] "Senior Black Correspondent". They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host's straight man.|$|E
60|$|The Senator spoke. The San Saba {{contingent}} sat, breathing hard, in the gallery, its disordered hair {{hanging down}} to its eyes, its sixteen-ounce hats shifted restlessly from knee to knee.
