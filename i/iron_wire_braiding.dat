It is attached to one of the window mullions of an <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> factory on the one bank, and to a great tree on the other. The two curves which carry the bridge are made up of three <b>iron</b> <b>wires</b> which, taken together, have a diameter of 3/8". From time to time, vertical <b>iron</b> <b>wires</b> are hung from these curves. These in turn support the <b>iron</b> <b>wires</b> which carry the deck 16 feet above the water. The planks of the footpath are 2' long, 3" [...] wide and 1" [...] thick. 8 <b>iron</b> <b>wires</b> attached on either side, serve as guide rails.A bridge of this type can be erected in 15 days in summer, the total cost being less than 300 dollars." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>wire</b> {{had many}} uses, perhaps none more {{important}} than the making of wool cards which were essential to Britain’s important wool industry. However, at this time, the methods for producing <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> in England were traditional ones, inferior to methods that had been long been in use on the European Continent. The main technical barrier was a lack of knowledge about how to produce ‘Osmond iron,’ a high-quality iron essential to producing fine, relatively thin and malleable <b>iron</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R

25|$|Stranded wire has a {{group of}} copper <b>wires</b> <b>braided</b> or twisted together. Stranded wire is more {{flexible}} and easier to install than a large single-strand wire of the same cross section. Stranding improves wire life in applications with vibration. A particular cross-section of a stranded conductor gives it essentially the same resistance characteristics as a single-strand conductor, but with added flexibility.|$|R

Initial goals {{included}} the production of brass {{in addition to the}} <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> which was necessary for producing the cards required by the British wool industry, which had previously been imported. Due in part to difficulties with local materials however, the production of brass at the wireworks went poorly, and the more profitable production of <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> became paramount.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>braiding</b> {{functions}} on {{the lazy}} tongs principle. When axial tension {{is applied to}} the hose, the braid reaches its extension limit. This means that the wires lie tightly spaced with the smallest crossing angle, creating a hose braiding of the smallest possible diameter and the largest possible length. When the hose is axially compressed, the crossing angle and diameter increase to maximum values.|$|R

Like Wong Fei Hung's father Wong Kei-Ying, Tit Sin Saam {{was one of the}} Ten Tigers of Canton. As a teenager, Wong Fei Hung learned <b>Iron</b> <b>Wire</b> from Lam Fuk-Sing (Chinese: 林福成; pinyin: Línfúchéng)a student of Tit Sin Saam. The <b>Iron</b> <b>Wire</b> form is essentially a combination of Hei Gung (Chinese: 气功; pinyin: qigong) or meditative breathing with isometric exercise, particularly dynamic tension, although weights were also used in traditional practice in the form of iron rings worn on the wrists. If properly practiced, it can increase strength considerably and promote a stable root. However, as with both most forms of qigong and most forms of isometric exercise, it must be practiced regularly or the benefits are quickly lost.|$|R
