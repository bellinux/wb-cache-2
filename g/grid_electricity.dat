5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of <b>grid</b> <b>electricity.</b> Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E

5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard <b>grid</b> <b>electricity</b> can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the <b>grid,</b> <b>electricity</b> is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

25|$|Water {{is used in}} {{renewable}} power generation. Hydroelectric power derives {{energy from}} the force of water flowing downhill, driving a turbine connected to a generator. This hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. Significantly, hydroelectric power {{can also be used}} for load following unlike most renewable energy sources which are intermittent. Ultimately, the energy in a hydroelectric powerplant is supplied by the sun. Heat from the sun evaporates water, which condenses as rain in higher altitudes and flows downhill. Pumped-storage hydroelectric plants also exist, which use <b>grid</b> <b>electricity</b> to pump water uphill when demand is low, and use the stored water to produce electricity when demand is high.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> on the landscape in Sweden. The study analyses the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> in the landscape and its cultural heritage aspects. The data for this study were obtained through literature studies and case studies. Three sites served as subjects in the case studies to investigate the different effects on the landscape by the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> in diverse surroundings. The results of the study show that the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> has differing effects on different landscapes. In some landscapes the effects add cultural value whereas in other landscapes it has negative effects on the cultural value. The results also show that the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> is an important part of history, but because it is also an active infrastructure it is difficult to appreciate it in the same way as other parts of the cultural heritage. Electricity is paramount to modern culture, and without the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> that culture would be very different. The structure of the grid is vast, spreading across the country and thus making an impact on the landscape. Because of its vastness it is difficult to comprehend the entirety of it. Despite its impact on the landscape it is not something people often reflect upon. The results suggest that, even though there has not been a cultural heritage perspective on the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid,</b> there should be, as the <b>electricity</b> <b>grid</b> has enabled the modern society to evolve to the state it is in today.

2500|$|Around that time, Philips {{was seeking}} to expand sales of its radios into {{parts of the world}} where <b>grid</b> <b>electricity</b> and {{batteries}} were not consistently available. Philips' management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would facilitate such sales and asked a group of engineers at the company's research lab in Eindhoven to evaluate alternative ways of achieving this aim. After a systematic comparison of various prime movers, the team decided to go forward with the Stirling engine, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil– [...] "cheap and available everywhere"– was favored). They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.|$|E
2500|$|Blended mode {{is a kind}} of charge-depleting mode. It is {{normally}} employed by vehicles which do not have enough electric power to sustain high speeds without the help of the internal combustion portion of the powertrain. A blended control strategy typically increases the distance from stored <b>grid</b> <b>electricity</b> compared to a charge-depleting strategy. The Renault Kangoo and some Toyota Prius conversions are examples of vehicles that use this mode of operation. The Electri'cité and Elect'road versions of the Kangoo were charge-depleting battery electric vehicles: the Elect'road had a modest internal combustion engine which extended its range somewhat. Conversions of 2004 and later model Toyota Prius can only run without using the ICE at speeds of less than about [...] due to the limits dictated by the vehicle's powertrain control software. However, at faster speeds electric power can still be used to displace gasoline, thus improving the fuel economy in blended mode and generally doubling the fuel efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{industrialisation}} and coalmining along the Neath valley, it no longer suited {{its role as a}} fashionable and picturesque residence. In the 20th century Rheola was the home of Col J. Edwards Vaughan at least until 1926. In 1939 the estate was bought by the British Aluminium Company, [...] who used the house as offices, and built an aluminium smelting plant on a large plot between the house and road. Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally produced electricity, generated with local coal supplies. However World War II broke out before the generators were imported from Switzerland, so the smelting plant attempted to run using national <b>grid</b> <b>electricity,</b> and this was discontinued by 1943. The factory was then in use as a strip mill. The industrial activity had involved an area of hardstanding covering almost , which then was used for screening coal from the nearby coalmines. By 1981 it had ceased to be needed for coal screening, and the estate was sold to local construction and demolition company RM Rees. The industrial buildings were used for architectural salvage and a weekly market. The house was in serious decline, as were the grade II listed stables and coach house.|$|E
