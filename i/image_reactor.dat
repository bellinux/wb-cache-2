40|$|The {{passage of}} cosmic-ray muons through matter is {{dominated}} by the Coulomb interaction with electrons and atomic nuclei. The muon’s interaction with electrons leads to continuous energy loss and stopping through the process of ionization. The muon’s interaction with nuclei leads to angular diffusion. If a muon stops in matter, other processes unfold, as discussed in more detail below. These interactions provide the basis for advanced applications of cosmic-ray muon radiography discussed here, specifically: 1) imaging a nuclear reactor with near horizontal muons, and 2) identifying materials through the analysis of radiation lengths weighted by density and secondary signals that are induced by cosmic-ray muon trajectories. We have <b>imaged</b> a nuclear <b>reactor,</b> type AGN- 201 m, at the University of New Mexico, using data measured with a particle tracker built from a set of sealed drift tubes, the Mini Muon Tracker (MMT). Geant 4 simulations were compared to the data for verification and validation. In both the data and simulation, we can identify regions of interest in the reactor including the core, moderator, and shield. This study reinforces our claims for using muon tomography to <b>image</b> <b>reactors</b> following an accident. Warhead and special nuclear materials (SNM) imaging is an important thrust for treaty verification and national security purposes. The differentiation of SNM from other materials, such as iron and aluminum, is useful for these applications. Several techniques were developed for material identification using cosmic-ray muons. These techniques include: 1) identifying the radiation length weighted by density of an object and 2) measuring the signals that can indicate the presence of fission and chain reactions. By combining the radiographic images created by tracking muons through a target plane with the additional fission neutron and gamma signature, we are able to locate regions that are fissionable from a single side. The following materials were imaged with this technique: aluminum, concrete, steel, lead, and uranium. Provided that there is sufficient mass, U- 235 could be differentiated from U- 238 through muon induced fission.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Anaerobic digesters (ADs) are an {{important}} engineered system used to effectively treat wastewater sludge. The ecology of these digesters {{is dominated by the}} acetoclastic methanogens, Methanosaeta spp. and Methanosarcina spp. Though CRISPR sequences have been identified in the genomes of these methanogens, no phages infecting these archaea have been identified. Analysis of the virus size fraction of digester samples by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of numerous virus-like particles (VLPs), consistent with phages within the family Siphoviridae, which contains phages that infect both archaea and bacteria. To further investigate these VLPs, acetate-fed anaerobic reactors were established and samples removed for characterization of the viral size fraction (VSF) by DNA sequencing. Samples from functional ADs were also processed to assess the similarity to the reactor communities. Samples were 0. 2 um filtered, concentrated, placed in CsCl density gradient, and DNase treated before DNA extraction. To assess sample purity and diversity, one sample was initially amplified and sequenced. Samples were then sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM. Sequences were quality trimmed and assembled, and then analyzed using MG-RAST. Taxonomic profiling yielded ~ 10 % of reactor sequences having significant matches, compared to 25 - 32 % of digester sequences, and indicated dominance by the order Caudovirales, consistent with TEM <b>images.</b> <b>Reactor</b> sequence matches to CRISPR spacers of Methanosaeta concilii suggest the presence of viruses of acetoclastic methanogens in these systems. Functional profiling indicated an abundance of DNA methylase genes, consistent with a prior study. Taxonomic and functional comparison indicated moderate differences between the hourly fed reactor and other samples. Functional comparison to viral metagenomes from other environments indicated significantly lower metabolic gene frequency in our samples. DNA analysis of the VSFs is consistent with microscopy results that phages are a robust component of the digester communities...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a {{miniaturized}} device that performs uniform droplet generation and fast temperature cycling, for digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR). The device was fabricated using deep silicon etch for sculpting the microfluidic structures that were then sealed by anodic bonding with a Pyrex wafer. Droplets of an aqueous solution containing PCR reagents and templates were generated in oil using a simple T-junction. Droplet volume and generation rate were respectively 60 pL and 6400 droplets per second. Volume reproducibility in different experiments was about 5 %. A standard two-step Taqman protocol was used for DNA amplification. After each PCR cycle a fluorescent <b>image</b> of the <b>reactor</b> was recorded using a conventional inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera. The analysis of these images allowed to count dark and fluorescent droplets and to reconstruct the real time fluorescence intensity curve for each droplet. To demonstrate the functionality of the device, human genomic DNA with seven nominal starting concentrations ranging from 20 to 13000 copies per μl was amplified. The determined template concentration was {{in agreement with the}} nominal one in the full dynamic range of the system (almost three orders of magnitude). In the current design the dynamic range is limited by the reactor volume (3 mm x 3 mm x 30 m) that can be extended by a factor of hundred by increasing both depth and footprint. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A precise {{estimation}} of bubble size distributions and shapes {{is required to}} characterize the bubble column fluid dynamics at the “bubble-scale”, and to evaluate the heat and mass transfer rate in bubble column <b>reactors.</b> <b>Image</b> analysis methods {{can be used to}} measure the bubble size distributions and shapes; unfortunately, these experimental techniques are limited to resolve bubble clusters and large void fractions, and can not be applied under relevant operating conditions (e. g., high temperature and pressure). On the other hand, needle probes (i. e, optical and conductive probes) can be used to measure bubble sizes in dense bubbly flows and under relevant operating conditions; however, needle probes measure chord length distributions, which should be converted into bubble size distributions by using statistical algorithms. These algorithms rely on correlations—generally obtained for single droplets/bubbles—that predicts the bubble shapes, by relating the bubble equivalent diameter to the bubble aspect ratio. In this paper, we contribute to the existing discussion through an experimental study regarding the bubble sizes and aspect ratio in a large air-water bubble column. The experimental investigation has consisted in gas holdup, image analysis and optical probe measurements. First, the gas holdup measurements have been used to identify the flow regime transition between the homogeneous flow regime and the transition flow regime. Secondly, the homogeneous flow regime has been described at the “bubble-scale”: chord length distributions and bubble size distributions have been obtained by using an optical probe and image analysis, respectively. Based on the experimental data from the image analysis, a correlation between the bubble equivalent diameter and the bubble aspect ratio has been proposed and has been compared with existing correlations. Finally, the chord length distributions have been converted into bubble size distributions using a statistical method, supported by the aspect ratio obtained through image analysis. The proposed approach has been able to estimate correctly the bubble size distributions {{at the center of the}} column then near the wall. We have also demonstrated that the correlations used to predicts the bubble shapes are the main point of improvement in the method. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
