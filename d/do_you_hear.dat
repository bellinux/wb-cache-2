It positions itself {{as an antidote to}} rockism and developed following Carl Wilson's book about Céline Dion's album Let's Talk About Love and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in The New York Times. In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to [...] "stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if anything could, and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, as if that were necessarily a bad thing.

500|$|Tyndall was antisemitic. From earlier fascists like Chesterton, he had {{inherited}} {{a belief that}} there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, opining that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism, using both to their own ends, and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. Tyndall also believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of a Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. He had expressed the view that [...] "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> me? THE JEWS?" [...] Another of his comments, made in 1963, was that [...] "Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples".|$|E

The writer also criticised Furtado's discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of feminism in a Blender magazine interview, writing: [...] "Girls, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> that churning? Those are the ideas of Gloria Steinem turning in their grave." [...] A writer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that cynics could attribute Furtado's commercial success with Loose to her [...] "amped-up sex appeal." [...] The writer added that, the failure of Janet Jackson's album Damita Jo (2004) indicated such a move was not infallible. Furtado was [...] "still demure compared to many of her competitors"—she avoided sporting lingerie or performing [...] "Christina Aguilera-style gyrations or calisthenics" [...] in the [...] "Promiscuous" [...] and [...] "Maneater" [...] videos. [...] "Despite its dramatic arrival ... Furtado's new image doesn’t feel calculated", he said. [...] " [...] seems to be thinking less and feeling more, {{to the benefit of}} her music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP was openly anti-Semitic. From A. K. Chesterton, Tyndall had {{inherited}} {{a belief that}} there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, viewing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race.

It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> me? THE JEWS?" [...] Tyndall added Holocaust denial to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the Holocaust was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination. Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, Who are the Mind Benders?. Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in The Rune, a magazine produced by the Croydon BNP. In 1998, these articles resulted in Griffin being convicted of inciting racial hatred.|$|E
