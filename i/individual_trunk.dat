50|$|Multi-trunk {{trees are}} the most common form after single trunk trees. Often these {{represent}} separate trunks growing from a single root mass. This occurs frequently in some species when the initial trunk has been damaged or broken and in its place two or more new shoots grow from the original root mass. These are genetically the same, but as their growth form is different they should be considered as a different measurement category than single trunk trees. These multiple trunks commonly will grow together to form a large combined mass at the base and split into <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> at greater heights. If they are individual trunks at breast height then the individual trunks can be measured separately and treated as individual single trunk trees. If they have grown together at breast height then a measurement of their combined girth should be made at that height the number of trunks incorporated into the girth measurement listed. If the tree splays outward dramatically at breast height, then the girth should be measured at the narrowest point between breast height and the ground and that height noted.Other girth measurements guidelines outlined for single trunk trees, such as low branches and burls, apply to multi-trunk girths as well. The height of the tallest trunk in the multi-trunk specimen would then be the height of the multi-trunk specimen and the combined crown spread of all the individual trunks the multi-trunk specimen collectively would be the multi-trunk crown spread. If one of the individual trunks is significantly larger than all the others, it can be treated {{as if it were a}} single trunk tree. Its girth is measured where it emerges from the combined mass, and the height and crown spread of that particular trunk is measured individually.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{trees have}} a single trunk, and other single trunk trees pose {{additional}} measurement problems because of their size or configuration. The odd forms include those forms that grew because of unusual circumstances that affected the tree, or those trees that simply have an unusual growth form not seen in most other tree species. Frank proposed a classification system for various tree forms: 1) Single Trunk Trees; 2) Multi-trunk Trees; 3) Clonal Coppices; 4) Clonal Colonies; 5) Conjoined and Hugging Trees; 6) Fallen Trees; 7) Tree complexes, and 8) Banyan-like trees; 9) Trees with Large Aerial Root Systems; and 10) Epiphytic Trees. This initial framework has continued to evolve in discussions within the NTS, but provides an initial beginning and {{suggestions on how to}} approach measuring these various tree growth forms.Since most of these trees are unique or unusual in their form and not amenable to easy measurement, the recommended approach is to write a detailed narrative description of the tree with what measurements that can be taken to amplify and better illuminate the descriptions. These trees should be documented even if the results are {{in the form of a}} written narrative rather than a collection of numerical measurements.There are some parameters that should be consistently measured whenever possible, height is one example. The cross-sectional areas occupied by the trunks and the crown are also parameters that are generally measurable. Other measurements could be taken where they seem to add to the narrative description of that particular tree. GPS locations should be taken whenever possible. Absent a GPS instrument, the locations should be pulled from Google Maps, or topographic maps. Beyond these basics, values like number of trunks larger than a prescribed value, the maximum girth of the largest trunk, and whatever seems appropriate for that particular tree grouping should be recorded. Photographs of these unusual trees are important as they can immensely improve the understanding of what is being described, and help others to visualize the tree. A process or system is needed whereby the photos of a particular tree can be associated with the description of the tree in the researcher’s notes. The goal of the narrative and measurements is to document the tree or tree grouping.An approach needs to be developed that is appropriate for each of these unusual forms. For example, clonal colonies, such as the Pando aspen, may occupy many acres. The area occupied by the colony should be measured as well as the size of the largest <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> present. Banyan-like trees similarly consist of multiple trunks spread across a large area. In many of these specimens the interior trunks are not easily accessible, if accessible at all. An approach to their measurement would be to measure the area occupied by the many trunks, the area occupied by the crown of the tree, the height of the tree, and any other measurements the investigator deems appropriate. These measurements would then be supplemented by a narrative description and photographs. The goal in all of these cases of trees with unusual forms is to document their characteristics.Girth can also be thought of as essentially a snapshot of the cross-section of a tree at one particular elevation. In some cases the base of the tree may be so complex that simply wrapping a tape around the base would misrepresent the true wood girth or character of the tree. An example of this would be Big Tree of Tule in Santa María del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico described above. The Tule tree has a diameter of 38 ft as measured by tape wrap, but because of its irregularity a cross-sectional wood area expressed as a circle gave an effective diameter of only 30 ft. The base of the tree was mapped in three dimensions using a frame mapping technique. A rectangular frame was strung around the perimeter of the tree. A series of measurements from the reference lines to the edge of the trunk mapping the irregularities of the tree surface and converted to Cartesian x-y coordinates. The process was repeated at different heights to create a three-dimensional model of the tree.This mapping process can be automated. Taylor has been developing a cloud mapping process using optical parallax scanning technology whereby thousands of measurements are made around the trunk of a tree. These can be used to recreate a three-dimensional model of the trunk and girth and diameter data are among the values that can be calculated.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} trunk {{muscle strength}} and EMG activation during isokinetic axial rotation at different angular velocities. Method. Twenty-four healthy young men performed isokinetic axial rotation in {{right and left}} directions at 30, 60, and 120 degrees per second angular velocity. Simultaneously, surface EMG was recorded on external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and latissimus dorsi (LD) bilaterally. Results. In each direction, {{with the increase of}} angular velocity, peak torque decreased, whereas peak power increased. During isokinetic axial rotation, contralateral EO as well as ipsilateral IO and LD acted as primary agonists, whereas, ipsilateral EO as well as contralateral IO and LD acted as primary antagonistic muscles. For each primary agonist, the root mean square values decreased with the increase of angular velocity. Antagonist coactiviation was observed at each velocity; however, it appears to be higher with the increase of angular velocity. Conclusion. Our results suggest that velocity of rotation has great impact on the axial rotation torque and EMG activity. An inverse relationship of angular velocity was suggested with the axial rotation torque as well as root mean square value of <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> muscle. In addition, higher velocity is associated with higher coactivation of antagonist, leading to a decrease in torque with the increase of velocity...|$|E
40|$|Background. During pregnancy, {{apposition}} of body segments {{and changes}} in trunk mobility and motion control due to increased mass and dimensions may reduce the functional range of motion of the trunk segments. Although static postures have been investigated, dynamic trunk motion during pregnancy in sitting and standing has had very limited investigation. Methods. Included {{in the study was}} a volunteer sample of convenience of nine primiparous and multiparous women. Twelve nulliparous females formed a control group. The subjects were filmed while performing maximum seated and standing trunk forward flexion, side-to-side flexion and seated axial rotation. A repeated measures anova was used to investigate systematic changes in the motion of the pelvic and thoracic segments and the thoracolumbar spines during pregnancy. Results. As pregnancy progressed, there was no significant decrease in the range of side-to-side flexion. For forward flexion and axial rotation, motion of the thoracic segment and the thoracolumbar spine was significantly reduced. Movement of the pelvis was less affected. Base of support width was increased for forward flexion and side-to-side flexion. Conclusions. In late pregnancy, strategies such as increasing the width of the base of support and reducing obstruction from other body parts were used to minimize the effects of increased trunk mass and girths. Not all trunk segment motion was affected equally. The differing effect on <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> segment motion may lead to altered movement patterns during functional tasks...|$|E
40|$|Fossorial {{salamanders}} {{typically have}} elongate and attenuated heads and bodies, diminutive limbs, hands and feet, and extremely elongate tails. Batrachoseps from California, Lineatriton from eastern México, and Oedipina from southern México to Ecuador, {{all members of}} the family Plethodontidae, tribe Bolitoglossini, resemble one another in external morphology, which has evolved independently. Whereas Oedipina and Batrachoseps are elongate because there are more trunk vertebrae, a widespread homoplasy (parallelism) in salamanders, the genus Lineatriton is unique in having evolved convergently by an alternate “giraffe-neck” developmental program. Lineatriton has the same number of trunk vertebrae as related, nonelongated taxa, but <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> vertebrae are elongated. A robust phylogenetic hypothesis, based on sequences of three mtDNA genes, finds Lineatriton to be deeply nested within a clade characterized by generalized ecology and morphology. Lineatriton lineolus, the only currently recognized taxon in the genus, shows unanticipated genetic diversity. Surprisingly, geographically separated populations of L. lineolus are not monophyletic, but are sister taxa of different species of the morphologically generalized genus Pseudoeurycea. Lineatriton, long thought to be a unique monospecific lineage, is polyphyletic. Accordingly, the specialized morphology of Lineatriton displays homoplasy at two hierarchical levels: (i) with respect to other elongate lineages in the family (convergence), and (ii) within what is currently recognized as a single taxon (parallelism). These evolutionary events are of adaptive significance because to invade the lowland tropics salamanders must be either arboreal or fossorial; the repeated evolution of elongation and attenuation has led to multiple lowland invasions...|$|E

Many large public safety and state agencies use SmartZone systems for wide-area communications. Each <b>individual</b> <b>trunked</b> system is considered a site, or a sub-system of a Simulcast system, and {{is controlled by the}} Zone Controller, which is the master controller for all activity and is where all network links terminate. The primary types of sites are 6809 (named after the type of microprocessor used, and can be single or simulcast configurations), MTC 3600 (introduced {{to take the place of}} the 6809, and named for the speed of the control channel data stream in baud), and IntelliRepeaters (single-site only, a type of controllerless site). SmartZone allows efficient use of channels at each site by feature called [...] "Dynamic Site Assignment", or DSA. DSA's simple purpose is to determine whether a site actually needs to broadcast a call or not. In order to make this feature work subscriber radios are required to affiliate, or send in their radio identification and selected talkgroup information whenever they power-up, change channels, or change sites. A programmable [...] "timeout" [...] can be set to automatically query any given radio to determine its affiliation status on the network. These affiliations are compiled into a table which the Zone Controller maintains. When a call is requested at a site, the Zone Controller determines which site that talkgroup is registered at and routes that audio via a switch, referred to as the Ambassador Electronics Bank (AEB), to the appropriate channel at the site. SmartZone allows seamless roaming between sites that is transparent to the user. To the user, the system, when properly configured, appears as just one large system, when in fact the user is actually roaming between several different sites at different locations.|$|R
40|$|Neural crest cells migrate {{extensively}} {{and give}} rise to diverse cell types, including cells of the sensory and autonomic nervous systems. A major unanswered question concerning the neural crest is when and how the neural crest cells become determined to adopt a particular fate. We have explored the developmental potential of trunk neural crest cells in avian embryos by microinjecting a vital dye, lysinated rhodamine dextran (LRD), into individual cells within the dorsal neural tube. We find that premigratory and emigrating neural crest cells {{give rise to}} descendants with distinct phenotypes in multiple neural crest derivatives. These {{results are consistent with}} the idea that neural crest cells are multipotent prior to their emigration from the neural tube and become restricted in phenotype after emigration from the neural tube either during their migration or at their sites of localization. To determine whether neural crest cells become restricted during their migration, we have microinjected <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> neural crest cells with dye shortly after they leave the neural tube or as they migrate through the somite. We find {{that a majority of the}} clones derived from migrating neural crest cells appear to be multipotent; individual migrating neural crest cells gave rise to both sensory and sympathetic neurons, as well as cells with the morphological characteristics of Schwann cells, and other nonneuronal cells. Even those clones contributing to only one neural crest derivative often contained both neurofilament-positive and neurofilament-negative cells. These data demonstrate that migrating trunk neural crest cells, like their premigratory progenitors, can be multipotent. They give rise to cells in multiple neural crest derivatives and contribute to both neuronal and non-neuronal elements within a given derivative. Thus, restriction of neural crest cell fate must occur relatively late in migration or at the final destinations...|$|E
40|$|Trunk {{control is}} {{intriguing}} because trunk muscles must meet multiple requirements during {{the performance of}} everyday tasks (e. g., balancing, locomotion, musical instrument playing, reaching, trunk bending, vocalizing). A unique feature of trunk muscles is that they often participate in simultaneous trunk movement and breathing-related behaviors. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that two voluntary task-specific muscle activity patterns could combine linearly when both tasks activate the same muscles. Surface electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from four trunk sites (upper and lower lateral abdominal, medial and lateral back) during the performance of a trunk task, pulsed expiration task, and combined task (hunk + pulsed expiration task). The trunk task varied across four experiments, and included a static holding task or a uni-directional movement task in both flexion and extension directions. The expiration task was constant. Selected task variables (lung volume, movement amplitude and duration, expiratory target pressure) were consistent across all tasks. For each EMG site, a linear prediction (predicted EMG trace) was calculated from the mathematical addition of the task-specific EMG recorded during the <b>individual</b> <b>trunk</b> and expiration tasks. This linear prediction was compared to the actual muscle activity recorded during the combined task (measured EMG trace) and a point-to-point correlation was performed on the two traces to determine how closely they matched. Findings showed that in just over half the comparisons, the combined muscle activity pattern (measured EMG trace) was the same as a linear addition of each individual muscle activity pattern (predicted EMG trace). Such linear addition implies that two sets of descending command signals reach motoneuron pools essentially unmodified, and that motoneurons supplying trunk muscles may be specially organized to receive dual and simultaneous voluntary neural drive. In the remaining comparisons, the EMG activity for the two individual tasks, were superimposed, but not linearly. This finding suggests that although individual muscles are activated as a unit, selected muscles may be modified by sensory feedback. This flexibility allows the nervous system {{to take advantage of a}} muscles mechanical effectiveness and to adapt to environmental constraints without having to reconfigure or construct a new set of instructions...|$|E

The general aim {{of the study was to}} characterize and compare the aboveground relationships between cumulative A (l), A (s), and k (s) for two Pacific Northwest coniferous species with contrasting sapwood areas to give insight into size-related design of trees for water transport through changes in LSC and K (l). The 230 -year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees had slightly smaller basal diameters than the 102 -year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudostuga menziesii) trees, but contained 85 % sapwood at the base compared to 30 % in Douglas-fir. At the tree base, there was no evidence that A (l) /A (s) decreased with tree age or with tree size. In both species, A (l) /A (s) of branches was significantly higher than A (l) /A (s) at the tree base, but it was not different from A (l) /A (s) measured in the trunks at the top of the tree. Douglas-fir had higher A (l) /A (s) at the base than did ponderosa pine (0. 42 vs. 0. 24 m(2) cm(- 2)), similar patterns of change in A (l) /A (s) with height, and similar values of k (s), such that LSC in Douglas-fir was 77 % the value of LSC in ponderosa pine. Compensating changes to increase LSC between short and tall trees occurred through an increased in k (s) in tall trees but not through a reduction in A (l). LSC increased logarithmically with branch path length or trunk path length whereas K (l) decreased significantly from top to base of old trees, but not between sections from old and young trees of similar cambial age. Even though ponderosa pine had three times more sapwood than Douglas-fir, this study revealed a common relationship of declining K (l) with increasing tree height and diameter between the two species, within age classes and among trees. There was no compensating decrease in A (l) /A (s) as trees got taller, which showed that a homeostasis in K (l) was not maintained during growth.

Two studies assessed wheelchair set up, chair inclination [33] {{and the use of}} a rigid versus an elastic footrest [42] in relation to forward reach. No difference in reach was found for any of these adaptations to chair set up for either persons who were able bodied or those with SCI. One study examined the effect of thigh and chest belts on multidirectional reach [31]. In persons with SCI, reach increased in all directions by using a chest belt {{and to a lesser extent}} by using a thigh belt. Reach decreased by using a belt in persons who were able bodied. One study examined the use of functional electro stimulation (FES) and reported an increase in reach with FES application with both lifting a light and lifting a heavier object [40].|$|R
50|$|The surface clutter return {{depends upon}} {{the nature of the}} surface, its roughness, the grazing angle (angle the beam makes with the surface), the {{frequency}} and the polarisation. The reflected signal is the phasor sum {{of a large number of}} individual returns from a variety of sources, some of them capable of movement (leaves, rain drops, ripples) and some of them stationary (pylons, buildings, tree <b>trunks).</b> <b>Individual</b> samples of clutter vary from one resolution cell to another (spatial variation) and vary with time for a given cell (temporal variation).|$|R
5000|$|Gakhwangjeon Hall is {{two stories}} high, its wooden {{structure}} typical of late Joseon Buddhist architecture. The {{walls of the}} first floor are supported by twenty-four columns 4.2 m high, and measure 26.7 m {{along the length of}} the hall and 18.2 m along the sides. The second floor walls are 24.2 m by 15.9 m and made up of a further sixteen columns 10.4 m high that form a concentric rectangle surrounding the altar. [...] The interior columns and the four central columns, which are 13.5 m high and positioned behind the altar, together support the roof of the second floor. Each of the columns were made from <b>individual</b> tree <b>trunks,</b> initially just stripped of their bark with the natural curvature largely left in. The outer columns and the upper part of the interior columns, though, were refashioned into more standard tapered columns during the colonial-era, and a few were replaced with new timber altogether.|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} and system design concepts {{for a commercial}} satellite communications system planned for the 1990 's has been developed. The system provides data communications between the <b>individual</b> users via <b>trunking</b> and customer premise service terminals utilizing a central switching satellite operating in a time-division multiple-access mode. Baseband processing is employed to route and control traffic on an individual message basis while providing significant advantages in improved link margins and system flexibility. Key technology developments required to prove the flight readiness of the baseband processor design are being verified in the baseband processor proof-of-concept model described herein...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{a limited}} {{understanding}} about how gait speed influences the control of upper body motion during walking. Therefore, {{the primary purpose of}} this study was to examine how gait speed influences healthy <b>individual's</b> lower <b>trunk</b> motion during overground walking. The secondary purpose was to assess if Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to gain further insight into postural responses that occur at different walking speeds. Methods: Thirteen healthy subjects (23 ± 3 years) performed 5 straight-line walking trials at self selected slow, preferred, and fast walking speeds. Accelerations of the lower trunk were measured in the anterior-posterior (AP), vertical (VT), and mediolateral (ML) directions using a triaxial accelerometer. Stride-to-stride acceleration amplitude, regularity and repeatability were examined with RMS acceleration, Approximate Entropy and Coefficient of Multiple determination respectively. Coupling between acceleration directions were calculated using Cross Approximate Entropy. PCA was used to reveal the dimensionality of trunk accelerations during walking at slow and preferred speeds, and preferred and fast speeds. Results: RMS acceleration amplitude increased with gait speed in all directions. ML and VT trun...|$|R
