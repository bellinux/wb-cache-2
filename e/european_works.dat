In England, various herbals in either Latin or English were mainly compilations and translations of continental <b>European</b> <b>works,</b> of limited relevance to the British Isles. This included the rather unreliable work of Gerard (1597). The first systematic attempt to collect information on British plants was that of Thomas Johnson (1629), who was later to issue his own revision of Gerard's work (1633–1636).|$|E
5|$|Djajakusuma became {{employed}} at the Cultural Centre {{as a translator}} and actor under Armijn Pane. Among the works he translated were several pieces by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg and Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, {{as well as a}} history of Japan and several kabuki stage plays. While with the Centre, Djajakusuma wrote several of his own stage plays. In his free time, Djajakusuma helped establish the amateur theatre company Maya, together with artists such as HB Jassin, Rosihan Anwar, and Usmar Ismail. The troupe, formed in response to a desire for greater artistic freedom, performed translations of <b>European</b> <b>works</b> and original works by Ismail and El Hakim. To promote a sense of Indonesian nationalism while still conforming with the Japanese censorship bureau's rules, several of Maya's plays did not explicitly promote Japan, but rather the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Themes supporting the Indonesian nationalist movement, meanwhile, remained implicit in the works. With Maya, Djajakusuma travelled from village to village, putting on performances.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{collection has}} more than 7,500works from the 13thcentury to 1848 and is managed by 12curators who oversee the collection's display. Nearly two-thirds are by French artists, and more than 1,200are Northern European. The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of FrancisI and LouisXIV's collections, others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era, and some were bought. The collection began with Francis, who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court. After the French Revolution, the Royal Collection formed {{the nucleus of the}} Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Musée d'Orsay in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum. French and Northern <b>European</b> <b>works</b> are in the Richelieu wing and Cour Carrée; Spanish and Italian paintings are {{on the first floor of}} the Denon wing.|$|E

The Museum of Contemporary Art, founded in 1941, is located {{just above the}} waterfront in what was originally the 1915 residence of philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps. The museum has a permanent collection with more than 3,500 post-1950 American and <b>European</b> <b>works,</b> including paintings, works on paper, sculptures, photographic art, design objects and video works.

25|$|Under the Pomeroys {{the castle}} {{consisted}} of a dry moat (now mostly infilled), gatehouse and ramparts surmounted by the curtain wall with buildings disposed around the wall on the inside.

In 1978, a wall painting was discovered in the upper storey of the gatehouse, hidden behind {{a thick layer of}} vegetation.

25|$|Though other {{departments}} contain {{significant numbers of}} drawings and prints, the Drawings and Prints department specifically concentrates on North American pieces and western <b>European</b> <b>works</b> produced after the Middle Ages. The first Old Master drawings, comprising 670 sheets, were presented as a single group in 1880 by Cornelius Vanderbilt II and in effect launched the department, {{though it was not}} formally constituted as a department until later. Other early donors to the department include Junius Spencer Morgan II who presented a broad range of material, but mainly dated from the sixteenth century, including 2 woodblocks and many prints by Albrecht Dürer in 1919. Currently, the Drawings and Prints collection contains more than 17,000 drawings, 1.5 million prints, and twelve thousand illustrated books. The great masters of European painting, who produced many more sketches and drawings than actual paintings, are extensively represented in the Drawing and Prints collection. The department's holdings contain major drawings by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Rembrandt, as well as prints and etchings by Van Dyck, Dürer, and Degas among many others. The curator is Nadine Orenstein.|$|E
25|$|The Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) {{is located}} in the former monastery of San Agustin. The {{building}} {{is considered one of the}} major Baroque works of art in Mexico, built in the 18th century and is attributed to Ignacio Mariano de la Casa It has a facade of cantera stone in which an image of a crucified Christ is surrounded by grapevines. The niches around the main portal contain images of Saint Joseph, Our Lady of Sorrows, Saint Monica and others. Its cupola contains life-sized images of angels, but its bell tower was never finished. The monastery was occupied by Augustine friars starting in 1743 and is considered to be one of the finest Baroque monasteries in the Americas. Its fame as such comes from the decoration of the arches and columns that surround the inner courtyard. On the ground floor, there are faces with fierce expressions, while those on the upper floor have more serene expressions. Surrounding both sets of faces are chains linking the images. The museum contains one of the most important collections of colonial-era art and is organized by painting style. Some <b>European</b> <b>works</b> are here but the focus is on the painters of New Spain, including some of the most famous. The museum also sponsors temporary exhibits, theatrical works, as well as literary, photography and musical events.|$|E

500|$|Although {{available}} only on limited release {{in many parts}} of the Western world, Lucian Pintilie's production has attracted significant interest abroad, and was granted a special reception at the Telluride Film Festival. John Simon describes the film as [...] "witty, harrowing, wonderful", and, in one of his comparative essays on cinema traditions, lists it among the most notable <b>European</b> <b>works</b> of 1994 (alongside Yves Angelo's Colonel Chabert and Nanni Moretti's Caro diario). His colleague Hoberman added the film to a [...] "10 Best" [...] list for 1994. Berardinelli draws a parallel between An Unforgettable Summer and Before the Rain, by Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski, noting that, for all the difference in setting and approach, they deal with similar subjects. He writes: [...] "If nothing else, these two pictures taken together underline the unhappy truth that, in the Balkans, little has changed over the past seventy years." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} years after independence, Brazilian {{literature}} was still heavily influenced by Portuguese literature and its predominant Neoclassical style. In 1837, Gonçalves de Magalhães published the first work of Romanticism in Brazil, beginning {{a new era in}} the nation. The next year, 1838, saw the first play performed by Brazilians with a national theme, which marked the birth of Brazilian theater. Until then themes were often based on <b>European</b> <b>works</b> even if not performed by foreign actors. Romanticism at that time was regarded as the literary style that best fitted Brazilian literature, which could reveal its uniqueness when compared to foreign literature. During the 1830s and 1840s, [...] "a network of newspapers, journals, book publishers and printing houses emerged which together with the opening of theaters in the major towns brought into being what could be termed, but for the narrowness of its scope, a national culture".|$|E
500|$|However, Toby E. Huff {{writes that}} Shen Kuo's [...] "scattered set" [...] of {{writings}} lacks clear-cut organization and [...] "theoretical acuteness," [...] that is, scientific theory. Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands [...] "cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities" [...] that provide little insight. Donald Holzman writes that Shen [...] "has nowhere organized his observations into {{anything like a}} general theory." [...] Huff writes {{that this was a}} systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in <b>European</b> <b>works</b> such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century). In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo [...] "do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant." ...|$|E
