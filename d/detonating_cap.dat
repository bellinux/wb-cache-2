6000|$|... "A human being," [...] I continued, [...] "sometimes {{illustrates}} this principle figuratively--I mean the violent explosion {{of a large}} cartridge {{by means of a}} small detonator. Take, for example, a schoolmaster, and suppose him to be a dynamite cartridge. His heart is a <b>detonating</b> <b>cap.</b> The schoolroom and boys form a galvanic battery. His brain may be likened to a conducting-wire. He enters the schoolroom; the chemical elements are seething in riot, books are being torn and thrown, ink spilt, etcetera. Before opening the door, the good man is a quiet piece of plastic dynamite, but the instant his eye is touched, the electric circuit is, as it were, completed; the mysterious current flashes through the brain, and fires his detonating heart. Instantly the gleaming flame shoots with lightning-speed to temples and toes. The entire man becomes a detonator, and he explodes in a violent hurricane of kicks, cuffs, and invective! Now, without a detonator--a heart--the man might have burned with moderate wrath, but he could not have exploded." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>detonating</b> <b>cap,</b> thus invented and adopted, {{brought about}} the {{invention}} of the modern cartridge case, and rendered possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols.|$|E
50|$|When the {{condition}} of the munitions was originally assessed there was concern that copper azide, an extremely sensitive explosive, would be produced through reaction between lead azide and copper from fuse components (lead azide would react with water vapour, rather than liquid water, to form hydrazoic acid, which could react with copper in the <b>detonating</b> <b>cap</b> to form copper azide).|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; {{but much}} more quickly than {{gunpowder}} does. It were better to say that a powder detonates when it all explodes at the same instant. Gunpowder appears to do so, but in reality it does not. One of the best detonators is fulminate of mercury. <b>Detonating</b> <b>caps</b> are therefore made of this, and one such cap put into the middle of that cartridge of dynamite and set fire to, by any means, would convert the cartridge itself into a detonator, and explode it with a shattering effect.|$|R
40|$|The machine - EKA 350 is {{designed}} for the activation of the serial or mixed connected electric <b>detonating</b> <b>caps</b> EK - 40 - 69 in explosive fillings at mining and demolition. For the analyzes of reliability {{it is important that}} the machine works in the three regimes of function: LOAD, FIRE and EMPTY. Modeling of reliability was executed for each of the mentioned regimes of the EKA 350 machine. In the machine are incorporated the components dedicated to the professional usage and satisfaction of the MIL standards. The machine is treated as it works in a single - stage mission which lasts 20 seconds...|$|R
5000|$|The {{attempted}} main bombing {{took place}} at Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square {{at the corner of}} Southwest Yamhill Street and Sixth Avenue, as {{tens of thousands of people}} gathered for the city's annual Christmas tree lighting. The fake bomb was in a white van that carried six 55-gallon drums with what appeared to be real detonation cords and plastic caps. Mohamud tried to detonate the bomb by dialing a cell phone that was attached to it. When the device failed to explode, the undercover agent suggested he get out of the car to obtain better reception. When he did so he was arrested.Because the FBI ensured that the device had no explosive components—even the <b>detonating</b> <b>caps</b> were inert—the public was never in any danger. According to an affidavit, Mohamud told the agents, [...] "I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{alteration}} {{of the military}} flint-lock to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan by a perforated nipple, and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint with a smaller hammer that had a hollow to fit on the nipple when released by the trigger. The shooter placed a percussion cap (now made of three parts of potassium chlorate, two of fulminate of mercury and powdered glass) on the nipple. The <b>detonating</b> <b>cap</b> thus invented and adopted, brought about {{the invention of the}} modern cartridge case, and rendered possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and full-automatic firearms.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Shock tube {{initiators}} are small-diameter hollow plastic tubing used in blasting {{systems to}} remotely convey an initiation signal {{in the form}} of shock wave to a <b>detonating</b> <b>cap.</b> Over the past years, few researchers have reported the development of various shock tube designs consisting of single, double, and triple polymeric layers. Despite the disclosure of the development of different shock tube designs, none of the researchers presented experimental data enabling one to predict how shock tubes' properties and performance could be affected by the number of polymeric layers and the nature of polymeric materials present in the shock tube. The aim of this investigation was, therefore, to experimentally determine to which extent changing the number of polymeric layers and the type of polymeric materials could vary the properties and performance of a multi-layered shock tube. The methodology used during the investigation involved the extrusion and testing of a standard three-layered shock tube similar to the commercially available high performance shock tube and samples of different recipes of two-layered shock tubes. The three-layered shock tube was made of high density polyethylene in the outer layer, ethylene based ionomer in the inner layer and ethylene acrylic acid copolymer in the intermediate layer. Samples of two-layered shock tubes were made of ethylene based ionomer in the inner layer and various blends of polyethylene/Adhesion promoter in the outer layer...|$|E
5000|$|Another use is in {{so-called}} [...] "cap bombs"; devices roughly {{in the shape}} of an aerial bomb that contain a firing mechanism in the nose capable of holding a single cap, either plastic or paper (cut from a strip), though types are not interchangeable due to the mutually exclusive design. With the newer designs they have both the paper cap or plastic cap. When dropped on a hard surface, the impact <b>detonates</b> the <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{mixtures}} {{are based on}} Ammonium nitrate as an oxidizer plus a volatile fuel, but unlike ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosive) these binaries can be <b>detonated</b> by blasting <b>caps.</b> ANFO requires high explosive boosters to detonate it.|$|R
60|$|They lighted a {{fire and}} sat beside it, thawing two sticks of dynamite, a {{proceeding}} attended by some risk, which Carnally seriously increased when he crimped the powerful <b>detonating</b> <b>caps</b> on the fuses with numbed and clumsy fingers. Both men were moody and dejected, {{but they did not}} express their feelings, for they were capable of meeting reverses with silent fortitude. Carnally stood to lose more money than he had ever had a prospect of earning until his companion took him north; Andrew knew at what a disadvantage his failure would place him in the struggle with Leonard. He was sincere in his purpose to see justice done, but he had no romantic ideas about it. His task was based on common honesty: Allinson's had guaranteed the undertaking and Allinson's must make good. Andrew was, however, troubled by two conflicting claims. He had a duty to the shareholders which could best be discharged by remaining near the lode until he proved its value; and a duty to Graham, whom he had promised to bring home safe and sound. Graham, most unfortunately, was crippled, and the scarcity of provisions made it doubtful whether he could be taken back to the Landing, unless they started without delay. The shareholders must wait.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the hit at the airport, Ferritto {{tried to}} plant a bomb on Petro's car. While {{assembling}} the explosive, Ferritto accidentally <b>detonated</b> the blasting <b>cap,</b> causing a minor injury to his leg. He opted for the [...] "one-way ride" [...] method of execution next. Petro's killing went unsolved for years, until a dramatic turn of events began to unfold.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{satisfactory}} {{magnetic induction}} blasting machine {{was constructed in}} 1878 by Henry Julius Smith of Mountain View, New Jersey. [...] Its mechanism consisted of a T-handle that was pushed down; {{the lower end of}} the handle was a rack that drove a pinion, which in turn drove a high-voltage magneto, which generated the high voltage that is required to <b>detonate</b> the blasting <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might <b>detonate</b> normal blasting <b>caps,</b> and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide {{are very sensitive to}} static electricity, radio frequency, shock etc.|$|R
50|$|The Dreyse needle-gun (Nadelgewehr) was a {{military}} breechloading rifle, famous as {{the arm of the}} Prussians, who adopted it for service in 1848 as the Prussian Model 1848. Its name comes from its needle-like firing pin, which passed through the cartridge case to <b>detonate</b> a percussion <b>cap</b> {{at the base of the}} bullet. The Dreyse rifle was also the first breech-loading rifle to use a bolt-action to open and close the chamber.|$|R
50|$|History-The EWA is {{currently}} {{pushing for a}} Superfund status for Pompton Lakes, a community located in northern New Jersey. DuPont began manufacturing explosives in the town when it acquired Laflin & Rand Powder Company in 1902. During World War 1, employment and production at the factories surged, where the company size increased from 300 {{to a high of}} 7,500. Production mainly focused on munitions, including rifle and hand grenades, blasting <b>caps,</b> <b>detonating</b> fuses, boosters, and primer. During World War II production and employment once again increased, and employees were bussed in from surrounding cities to meet this demand. Once again production centered around munitions.|$|R
50|$|On April 21, Nichols {{learned he}} was wanted for questioning, turned himself in, and consented to {{a search of}} his home. The search turned up {{blasting}} <b>caps,</b> <b>detonating</b> cords, ground ammonium nitrate, barrels made of plastic similar to fragments found at the bombing site, 33 firearms, anti-government warfare literature, a receipt for ammonium nitrate fertilizer with McVeigh's fingerprints on it, a telephone credit card that McVeigh had used when he was shopping for bomb making equipment, and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City. Nichols was held as a material witness to the bombing until he was charged on May 10. Nichols's family said {{the federal government was}} framing him and said this was proved by other explosives found inside the building.|$|R
50|$|During {{her time}} refitting, Halibut {{was used for}} torpedo testing, firing torpedoes from her stern tubes into the cliffs at Kahoolawe — stern firing was a {{precaution}} against erratic or circular running torpedoes. Earlier tests had shown that one in three Mark 14 topedoes failed to explode on impact (see USS Muskallunge); the crushing deformed the contact exploder before it could <b>detonate</b> the firing <b>caps.</b> The modified versions, made from Japanese aircraft propellers, that were tested by Halibut were almost three times better in testing (6 out of 7 detonations) and even more efficient in action. A short time later, while performing underwater training, Halibut was accidentally struck by a destroyer; the glancing blow damaged both periscopes (an incident which in peacetime would warrant a board of inquiry). The damage was repaired in hours, {{and there were no}} other repercussions.|$|R
