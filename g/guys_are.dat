500|$|The {{designers}} included role-playing {{elements in}} the game. Similar to Ultima Underworld, another Looking Glass Studios project, the environment in System Shock 2 is persistent and constantly changes without the player's presence. Paper-and-pencil role-playing games were influential; the character customization system was based on Travellers methodology and was implemented in the fictional military branches which, by allowing multiple character paths, the player could receive a more open-ended gameplay experience. Horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was deemed primary, {{which resulted in the}} player having little physical contact with other sentient beings. Secondly, a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character. Last were the inclusion of moody sound effects and [...] "the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows". The game's lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of System Shock villain SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with her, as he believed that game characters were too trusting, stating [...] "good <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> good, bad <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> bad. What you see and perceive is real". Levine sought to challenge this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: [...] "Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the player never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that they, and not [...] the character, were led on and deceived". This design choice was controversial with the development team.|$|E

But we're going to go with the best guy, not because <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> out of options."

500|$|Slayer's {{previous}} album, Show No Mercy, became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release, selling 40,000 copies worldwide; {{the success}} led producer Brian Slagel {{to want to}} record another album with them.

On seeing Slayer in the studio, Fair stated, [...] "Wow, these <b>guys</b> <b>are</b> really angry," [...] as he was inexperienced working with heavy metal musicians.
