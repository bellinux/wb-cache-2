2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. Snubber capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E

This space tether experiment, Oedipus-A, showed a sheath-wave passband up to about 2 MHz and a phase velocity somewhat slower than the velocity of light in a vacuum, and also demonstrated both ease of wave excitation and low attenuation. The evidence suggests that, on any large structure in low Earth orbit, transient or continuous wave electromagnetic interference, once generated, could propagate over the structure via sheath waves, producing unwanted signal levels much {{higher than in the}} absence of the ambient plasma medium.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{previous}} chapter described measurements {{using an}} open-area test site. Although OATS is the internationally accepted facility and standard test approach for measurement of radiated emissions and radiation susceptibility, {{it is not}} always convenient or possible to use OATS. Consequently, a number of measurement facilities and procedures have been developed over the years to enable such measurements to be carried out in a laboratory. This chapter is devoted to a description, and procedures for use, of several of these laboratory techniques. In particular, we will study Microwave anechoic chamber Transverse electromagnetic cell Reverberating chamber G-TEM cell The advantages, as well as the limitations, of each of these will also be briefly discussed. 6. 2 ANECHOIC CHAMBER 6. 2. 1 Anechoic Chamber A most common laboratory approach for <b>electromagnetic</b> interference/electromagnetic <b>compatibility</b> (EMI/EMC) measurements is the use of microwave anecho...|$|R

The performance characteristics that will be looked at are first of all the ability for the anechoic chamber to keep environmental noise from entering the chamber walls, creating false measurements, preventing harmful signals escaping and interfering with other commercial bandwidths. Then the pyramidal absorbers themselves will be analysed and their capability of attenuating a wide range of frequencies over a set number of angles of incidences will be recorded. This {{is the first step in}} a bigger task of being able to explain the patterns of variation in the electromagnetic field in a two dimensional plane. The way in which the performance of the pyramidal absorbers varies with angle helps explain this, as it gives the magnitude of absorption when a wave is reflected off the wall and interferes with the direct path, This process of following the different paths around the enclosed area is called ray tracing which is touched on in this project, but due to time constraints only the theory of the technique is recalled. From the results that were obtained, the anechoic chamber can now be utilised as to get a more accurate measurement by being able to configure the testing specifications to suit the chambers performance strengths and weaknesses. Even though some characterisation has been logged, there is still the potential for further work to be done to optimise the anechoic chambers useability and hopefully someday match the standards set for a commercial anechoic chamber...|$|R

All these workplaces generate electromagnetic signals to their surroundings, and thus they represent sources of strong disturbance to the neighboring ones.

The proposed method uses a previously developed hybrid time domain integral equation based field-cable-circuit to carry out deterministic EMI/EMC simulations permitting the statistical characterization of pertinent observables. The number of simulations required by the proposed method is far fewer than those needed by Monte-Carlo methods. The proposed method is used to characterize cable-induced coupling onto PC cards located in shielding enclosures. Both the hybrid simulator and the stochastic collocation code execute with near-full efficiency on distributed memory clusters.

A fast time domain integral equation-based field-cable-circuit simulator is used to perform deterministic EMI/EMC simulations for excitations and/or system geometries and configurations specified by Stroud integration rules. Outputs of these simulations then are processed to compute averages {{and standard deviations of}} pertinent observables. The proposed Stroud-based collocation method requires far fewer deterministic simulations than Monte-Carlo or tensor-product integrators.

40|$|Photonic {{microwave}} and millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency conversion is a promising technique for future electronic systems {{due to its}} large bandwidth, <b>electromagnetic</b> immunity, and <b>compatibility</b> with other optical systems. However, the conversion gain of a photonic mixer is often low and may be further reduced by the fiber dispersion. In this paper, a photonic {{microwave and}} mm-wave mixer using an integrated polarization division multiplexing Mach-Zehnder modulator (PDM-MZM) is proposed, which exhibits the merits of high conversion gain, high purity, and compensation of the power fading in multichannel fiber transmission. By suppressing the optical carrier and optimizing the modulation index, the conversion gain and isolation are respectively improved by 27. 6 and 55. 3 dB in the experiment. After power compensation, high and relatively flat microwave and mm-wave signals from 12 to 45 GHz are obtained after transmission over 25 -km fiber. In addition, an up-converted 38 -GHz mm-wave signal carrying 100 -MSym/s 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM) vector signal is simultaneously transmitted over four channels with different fiber length (back to back, 4, 25, and 50 km).

40|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> interference/electromagnetic <b>compatibility</b> (EMI/EMC) {{testing is}} a {{compulsory}} part of todayâ€™s electronics compliance and reliability. The importance of EMI/EMC arose {{with the advent}} of wireless devices to provide interference free envi-ronment. Spurious emissions emitted by electronic devices cannot be predicted without EMC measurements. If these emissions emanating from a specific device are above a certain limit, they can be harmful for devices operating in its close vicinity. Interference is an unwanted signal that causes disturbance in the normal operation of an electronic device. As a result there occurs degradation in the functionality of the victim device that is unacceptable. To avoid this undesired behavior of the devices, international regulatory authorities have introduced different standards and regulations. All devices consisting of electrical circuits are tested to comply these international standards and rules. The main objective of EMI/EMC testing {{is to make sure that}} a device i. 	Does not create interference to other devices. ii. 	Is not susceptible to emissions produced by other devices. iii. 	Does not cause interference with itself. The prime objectives of this thesis work include the development of testing programs in Agilent VEE intended to conduct radiated emission (RE) and radiated immunity (RI) tests automatically and to study the suitability of an anechoic chamber for radiated im-munity test. The thesis is divided into two major parts. First part contains the introduc-tion and theoretical background and covers first three chapters. It describes the need and importance of RE and RI testing. Second part presents the development of testing programs, test equipment, procedures and results in detail. Testing programs developed during current thesis include most of the necessary features requisite by IEC and CISPR standards and available in commercial testing software for example in Total Integrated Laboratory Environment (TILE), EMC 32 and Schaffner. The study of anechoic cham-ber, testing programs and results illustrate that the expected goals of the thesis have been successfully achieved. For future studies and improvements practical analysis and tests are recommended to be performed on the chamber. It could not be done during current thesis work due to unavailability of power amplifiers for radiated immunity test...|$|R
