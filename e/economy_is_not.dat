He then convinces his friends that if they want the economy to be strong, they must have faith in it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of , says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.|$|E

25|$|Switching a {{gasoline}} engine over to butanol would in theory {{result in a}} fuel consumption penalty of about10% but butanol's effect on mileage {{is yet to be}} determined by a scientific study. While the energy density for any mixture of gasoline and butanol can be calculated, tests with other alcohol fuels have demonstrated that the effect on fuel <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> proportional to the change in energy density.|$|E
25|$|It was the Manx Government's {{position}} that, if the United Kingdom {{had decided}} {{to participate in the}} euro, then it would be likely that the Island would also choose to participate. Primarily this was because most of the Island's trade is with the United Kingdom and other countries of Europe, and the break-up of the existing currency union with the UK would cause economic harm to the Island. There was also concern that the island's <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> large enough to withstand attack by currency speculators if the Manx pound became a stand-alone free-floating currency.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the merger}} of the three old municipalities, Shaghur's <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{improving}} as expected and the city still remains quite poor and unmanaged due to political boycotts. According to the CBS, in 2004, there were 6,674 salaried workers. The mean monthly salary was 3,663 NIS The city's {{average income per capita}} decreased by −1.04 NIS to 1,093 NIS ranking it Israel's 19th poorest municipality. The amount of employed persons in the city that received above twice the average wage was 1.45% in 2003. Its population density is also increasing because of the city's inability to expand residentially and commercially beyond its jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{generally}} such as {{to provide}} riches. Neither is it one {{which used to}} require large towns as other than external markets in which to sell. The population is therefore dispersed. The exception to this is the town of Oyonnax, in the Ange valley which is parallel with the Ain. According to the legend, St Léger gave the monopoly of comb making to Oyonnax in 630. The traditional small products of the region, wood-turning, horn combs and trinkets {{led to the development}} of a specialism in the injection moulding, vacuum forming and so on of plastics, beginning with celluloid in 1880. The town's population in 1999 was 24,636 but it is the exception for the river basin (ext links).|$|E
500|$|During the five-years {{from the}} end of 2004 through 2009, {{worldwide}} renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall. In 2011, UN under-secretary general Achim Steiner said: [...] "The continuing growth in this core segment of the green <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> happening by chance. The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." [...] He added: [...] "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".|$|E

500|$|Deng did {{not believe}} that the {{fundamental}} difference between the capitalist mode of production and the socialist mode of production was central planning versus free markets. He said, [...] "A planned <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too. Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity". Jiang Zemin supported Deng's thinking, and stated in a party gathering that it did not matter if a certain mechanism was capitalist or socialist, because the only thing that mattered was whether it worked. It was at this gathering that Jiang Zemin introduced the term socialist market economy, which replaced Chen Yun's [...] "planned socialist market economy". [...] In his report to the 14th National Congress Jiang Zemin told the delegates that the socialist state would [...] "let market forces play a basic role in resource allocation." [...] At the 15th National Congress, the party line was changed to [...] "make market forces further play their role in resource allocation"; this line continued until the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee, when it was amended to [...] "let market forces play a decisive role in resource allocation." [...] Despite this, the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee upheld the creed [...] "Maintain the dominance of the public sector and strengthen the economic vitality of the State-owned economy." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the November 2007 deadline, {{some analysts}} feared the restart {{of the border}} war but the date passed without any conflict. There were many reasons why war did not resume. Former U.S. Ambassador David Shinn said both Ethiopia and Eritrea were in a bad position. Many fear the weak Eritrean <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{improving}} like those of other African nations while others say Ethiopia is bogged down in Mogadishu. David Shinn said Ethiopia has [...] "a very powerful and so far disciplined national army that made pretty short work of the Eritreans in 2000 and the Eritreans have not forgotten that." [...] But he stated Ethiopia {{is not interested in}} war because America would condemn Ethiopia if it initiated the war saying [...] "I don't think even the US could sit by and condone an Ethiopian initiated attack on Eritrea." ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other areas}} of the United States, the western <b>economies</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> based upon {{manufacturing}} and the great deindustrialization of the 1970s and 1980s did little to hurt the region—creating an imbalance between rapid growth in the west and stagnation or decline in the east.|$|R
50|$|Data on forestry's {{contribution}} to the <b>economy</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> readily available, largely because most GDP tables aggregate data on forestry, fishing, and hunting. In 1980/81 forestry accounted for 2.5% of GDP at constant 1960/61 factor cost and 5.4% of the share attributable to the agricultural sector.|$|R
50|$|Around 6,000 watermills {{of varying}} power and {{efficiency}} {{had been built}} in order to grind flour, freeing up peasant labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.

2500|$|The {{last step}} is that {{effectively}} capitalist market society develops {{human beings in}} an inverted way. The capitalist <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> primarily organized for the people, but people are organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there {{is more and more}} external pressure forcing people to act in all kinds of different roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and semiotic flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the [...] "economic formation of society" [...] at the same time, even if in this society people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. It is just that the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst the {{financial}} sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> limited to that sector. The legal profession {{has a strong}} presence, especially {{in the west and}} north (i.e., towards the Inns of Court). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the West End of London, though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at Cheapside near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the Barbican Centre and adjacent Museum of London, though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the [...] "night-time" [...] economy does feature in the Bishopsgate area, towards Shoreditch. The meat market at Smithfield, wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest meat market. In the east is Leadenhall Market, a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.|$|E
