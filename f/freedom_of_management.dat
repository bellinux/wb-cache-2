In the initial {{study of the}} RAI incorporating AKI biomarkers, a positive biomarker result (using matrix metalloproteinase-8, neutrophil elastase-2, or NGAL) in the population with an RAI > or = 8 significantly increased the predictive discrimination of renal angina for subsequent severe AKI. [...] Improvement of AKI prediction by {{incorporation of}} biomarkers into the renal angina index occurred via correct classification of disease, improving the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), demonstrating net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). The results demonstrate that a clinician can identify the absence or fulfillment of renal angina in any patient on admission and then appropriately allocate {{the use of an}} AKI biomarker test to those in whom the test may yield the greatest predictive benefit. The excellent negative predictive value (NPV > 90%) of the RAI allows a clinician to reliably ‘rule out’ AKI outside the window of ‘functional AKI’ and may afford more <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> for the acutely ill patient (i.e., higher volume resuscitation) with less concerns about developing the severe fluid overload consistently associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients.|$|E

Their main areas of criticism were frequent changes of social worker, lack of an effective voice at reviews, lack of confidentiality and, linked to this, lack of a confidante. The findings are discussed in relation to recent policy changes. Specifically, the Looked After Children documentation and the Quality Protects Initiative by setting out uniform objectives and performance criteria seem to restrict the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> local authority <b>management</b> and <b>of</b> social workers to respond to individual children’s preferences or to give weight to what the children themselves consider to be in their best interest...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the tax reform of 2014, which took place through Law No. 2 / 2014 of 16 / 01 the Transfer Pricing regime, whose main purpose is to {{regulate}} transactions between related companies, respecting the arm's length principle, has undergone considerable changes. In this work, based on the relevant and legal literature, we conducted a qualitative investigation to investigate the impact of the changes occurred in the level of deductibility of Corporate Income Tax (IRC) expenses, enshrined in no. 23 of the Corporate Income Tax Code (CIRC), specifically the disappearance of the requirement of indispensability. From this investigation, we conclude that the now "omission" requirement of indispensability still lingers {{in the spirit of the}} law. Next, it was crucial to understand the extent to which the aforementioned reform affected the Transfer Pricing regime, understood as a specific anti-abuse clause, taking into account that the same institute can be used as a tax planning instrument. This culminated, with the repeal of no. 5 of article 23 of the CIRC, which in our view is a sensible measure. We conclude with the question whether the arm's length principle conflicts with the principle <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> business <b>management</b> decisions. To that extent, in the light of the existing literature and case-law, and given the practical difficulty in applying the arm's length principle, coupled with the excessive interference of the Tributary and customs authority, it will be possible to some extent to do so...|$|R

However, when it comes to compulsory collective management/administration of copyright and related rights, questions have been raised about the implications on the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and the right to property. The purpose of this project was to look into the human rights repercussions <b>of</b> compulsory collective <b>management</b> <b>of</b> copyright and related rights in general and the constitutionality of Section 30 A in particular. The human rights in focus were the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and the right to property. The project preceded from the normative framework <b>of</b> collective <b>management</b> organizations (CMOs) in general, the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and the right to property, looking into both local and international instruments. On establishing how compulsory collective <b>management</b> <b>of</b> rights, the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association and the right to property interact, the limits and incentives of the allowable limitations on these rights for the sake <b>of</b> compulsory collective <b>management</b> <b>of</b> rights were discussed. Section 30 A of the Copyright Act was then examined in this context in a bid to determine its permissibility in the face of the legal, political and cultural realities in Kenya. Two judgments that have been made so far on the constitutionality of Section 30 A were used as tools of analysis. The study was mainly done through desk research. It established that due to the public participation aspect that was lacking in Section 30 A, it is unconstitutional as it violates Article 118 of the constitution of Kenya, but would have otherwise been an allowable limitation on the right to property and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association, considering the realities of Kenya’s creative sector and level of development.
