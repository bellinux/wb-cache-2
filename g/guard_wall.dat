The ashes of so many burnt bodies have been carried by the river to the blue ocean illimitable. The man who expected so much return from his plantain trees on the southern side of that green, and at the bend of the river put bamboo traps to catch fish, is lying today on the bank of the Ichhamati - only his white bones remain, bleached by sunrays. So many young girls came to the river for water, and as they grow old their footprints are lost… during ceremonies of marriage, of making the child taste rice for the first time and of investing with the holy thread, the festivals of Durgpuja, Luxmipuja… those ladies of so many families pass away unnoticed… who knows when death may embrace us? Like a deceptive guide Death accompanies us at every bend of life and then suddenly, mysteriously he reveals his real character to a child, to an old man, perhaps… one listens to the music of eternity when one spots the old flowers or smells the pungent fragrance of herbal plants in Autumn. Some can visualise and dream the unlimitable unknown eternity in the image of the Ichhamati river during the turbulent rainy season. Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay ...|$|E
5000|$|Wall is a {{point guard}} and {{is known for his}} blazing speed and {{explosive}} athleticism. Wall's results at the draft combine of 10.84 seconds in the lane agility drill and time of 3.14 seconds in the 3/4 court sprint further demonstrate Wall's elite horizontal and vertical quickness. Along with having elite athleticism, Wall possesses good size for an NBA point guard, being 6'4" [...] and having a 6'9.25" [...] wingspan. Due to his athleticism, a large focus of his game is attacking the basket and emphasis on pushing the tempo in transition. Using his explosiveness and a myriad of finishing moves, Wall was able to achieve an impressive field goal percentage of 61.9% within three feet of the basket in 2014-15. Wall's use of floaters and runners also account for his impressive field goal percentage of 40% within 3-10 feet of the basket (2014-15 season). Along with his ability to get to the rim using his speed and ball handling, Wall also has a tremendous ability to pass the ball, averaging 8.7 assists for his career (as {{of the end of the}} 2014-15 season). Being a point <b>guard,</b> <b>Wall</b> constantly uses the pick-and-roll to initiate the offense, which contributes to his high assist total. In the earlier stages of his career, he was criticized for the amount of turnovers he committed, as he was dubbed [...] "very turnover prone". While increasing his assist to turnover ratio throughout his professional career, Wall still averages 3.7 turnovers per game (as of the end of the 2014-15 season). While Wall's strengths do not include shooting, he has seen his shooting improve throughout his NBA career. Wall has consistently improved his midrange jump shot over the course of his career, forcing defenders to not go under screens as often. After only making 49 three-pointers on 24% shooting in his first three years in the NBA, Wall was able to elevate both three-point makes and three-point percentage to 108 three-pointers while shooting his best percentage of [...]351 from long range during the 2013-14 season. Wall has also demonstrated his ability to defend the basketball at an elite level, resulting in him being placed on the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in the 2014-15 season.|$|E

40|$|<b>Guard</b> cell <b>walls</b> combine {{exceptional}} {{strength and}} flexibility {{in order to}} accommodate the turgor pressure-driven changes in size and shape that underlie the opening and closing of stomatal pores. To investigate the molecular basis of these exceptional qualities, we have used a combination of compositional and functional analyses in three different plant species. We show that comparisons of FTIR spectra from stomatal guard cells and those of other epidermal cells indicate a number of clear differences in cell-wall composition. The most obvious characteristics are that stomatal guard cells are enriched in phenolic esters of pectins. This enrichment is apparent in guard cells from Vicia faba (possessing a type I cell wall) and Commelina communis and Zea mays (having a type II wall). We further show that these common defining elements of <b>guard</b> cell <b>walls</b> have conserved functional roles. As previously reported in C. communis, we show that enzymatic modification of the pectin network in <b>guard</b> cell <b>walls</b> in both V. faba and Z. mays has profound effects on stomatal function. In all three species, incubation of epidermal strips with a combination of pectin methyl esterase and endopolygalacturonase (EPG) caused an increase in stomatal aperture on opening. This effect was not seen when strips were incubated with EPG alone indicating that the methyl-esterified fraction of homogalacturonan is key to this effect. In contrast, arabinanase treatment, and incubation with feruloyl esterase both impeded stomatal opening. It therefore appears that pectins and phenolic esters have a conserved functional role in <b>guard</b> cell <b>walls</b> even in grass species with type II walls, which characteristically are composed of low levels of pectins...|$|R
40|$|Stomatal guard cells play a {{key role}} in the ability of plants to survive on dry land, because their {{movements}} regulate the exchange of gases and water vapor between the external environment and the interior of the plant. The walls of these cells are exceptionally strong and must undergo large and reversible deformation during stomatal opening and closing. The molecular basis of the unique strength and flexibility of <b>guard</b> cell <b>walls</b> is unknown. We show that degradation of cell wall arabinan prevents either stomatal opening or closing. This locking of <b>guard</b> cell <b>wall</b> movements can be reversed if homogalacturonan is subsequently removed from the wall. We suggest that arabinans maintain flexibility in the cell wall by preventing homogalacturonan polymers from forming tight associations...|$|R
