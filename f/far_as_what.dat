5|$|Viking metal {{features}} the Vikings as its {{subject matter and}} for evocative imagery. The Vikings were Northern European seafarers and adventurers who, during the Middle Ages, relied on sailing vessels such as longships, knerrir, and karvi to explore, raid, pirate, trade, and settle along the North Atlantic, Baltic, Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Caspian coasts and Eastern European river systems. The Viking Age is generally cited as beginning in 793, when a Viking raid struck Lindisfarne, and concluding in 1066, {{with the death of}} Harald Hardrada and the Norman conquest of England. During this two-hundred-year period, the Vikings ventured west as far as Ireland and Iceland in the North Atlantic and Greenland and what is now Newfoundland in North America, south as far as the Kingdom of Nekor (Morocco), Italy, Sicily, and Constantinople in the Mediterranean, and southeast as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> are now Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Georgia in the Caucasus, and Baghdad in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of conquest, polities in the north {{included}} Mani, Cehpech and Chakan. Chakan was largely landlocked with a small stretch of coast on {{the north of the}} peninsula. Cehpech was a coastal province to its east; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. The modern city of Valladolid is situated upon the site of the former capital of Cupul. Cupul and Chinkinchel are known to have been mutually hostile, and to have engaged in wars to control the salt beds of the north coast. Tases was a small landlocked province south of Chikinchel. Ecab was a large province in the east. Uaymil was in the southeast, and Chetumal was to the south of it; all three bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah was also in the eastern half of the peninsula; it was southwest of Ecab and northwest of Uaymil. Its borders are poorly understood and it may have been landlocked, or have extended to occupy a portion of the Caribbean coast between the latter two kuchkabaloob. The capital of Cochuah was Tihosuco. Hocaba and Sotuta were landlocked provinces north of Mani and southwest of Ah Kin Chel and Cupul. Ah Canul was the northernmost province on the Gulf coast of the peninsula. Canpech (modern Campeche) was to the south of it, followed by Chanputun (modern Champotón). South of Chanputun, and extending west along the Gulf coast was Acalan. This Chontal Maya-speaking province extended east of the Usumacinta River in Tabasco, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> is now the southern portion of Campeche state, where their capital was located. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory {{to the north of the}} Itza and east of Acalan, between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche, and to the west of Chetumal. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Bindusara, just 22yearsold, {{inherited}} a large empire {{that consisted of}} what is now, Northern, Central and Eastern parts of India along with parts of Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Bindusara extended this empire to {{the southern part of}} India, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> is now known as Karnataka. He brought sixteen states under the Mauryan Empire and thus conquered almost all of the Indian peninsula (he is said to have conquered the 'land between the two seas' – the peninsular region between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea). Bindusara didn't conquer the friendly Tamil kingdoms of the Cholas, ruled by King Ilamcetcenni, the Pandyas, and Cheras. Apart from these southern states, Kalinga (modern Odisha) was the only kingdom in India that didn't form the part of Bindusara's empire. It was later conquered by his son Ashoka, who served as the viceroy of Ujjaini during his father's reign.|$|E

25|$|The Tláhuac was {{established}} {{on a small}} island in the waters between Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco in 1222 by the Chichimecas. By the 14th century, {{it had become a}} dominion expanding as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> is now Santiago Zapotitlán and Santa Catarina Yecahuizotl, but distinct from the dominion of Mixquic, which was on a nearby island. Tláhuac was connected to the mainland by two causeways leading to Santiago Zapotitlán and Tulyehualco. The first regional leader of the area was Cohuatomatzin in 1262. The dominion remained independent until the 14th century, when it was conquered by the Tepanecs. Soon after, it was dominated by the Aztecs. During the pre-Hispanic period, the economy of the area was based on chinampa farming and fishing. After conquest, the area paid tribute to Azcapotzalco and then to Tenochtitlan. The town of Tláhuac was laid out along the various dikes and canals which centered on a ceremonial center, where the San Pedro parish church is today.|$|E

West of Green River a [...] "northern route" [...] would extend the railroad towards Ogden, Utah, there connecting with the established Overland Route. This proposal was eventually completed as the Utah Division, loosely following the route of modern U.S. Route 6 across eastern Utah. This line soon became the main line of the D and {{remains one of the}} main transcontinental rail arteries of the U.S, now operated by the Union Pacific Railroad as the Central Corridor.|$|E

When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still."

500|$|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film's soundtrack album. It was {{released}} by Varèse Sarabande on October 12, 2010. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino. Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult [...] "balancing act" [...] for some scenes. He mentioned, [...] "I {{was always trying to}} say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [...] was like, 'no, put it in!'" [...] In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, [...] "…it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary? Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> everyone's intentions are in the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Circus" [...] {{was written}} by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Claude Kelly, while {{produced}} by Luke and Blanco. Luke and Kelly were initially commissioned {{to work on a}} new track for Spears, and entered the studio with no concept prepared, as Kelly explained, [...] "just knowing her style and knowing what she does." [...] After Luke came up with the music, they based the song on the public's perception of her life at the time. Spears explained that after listening to [...] "Circus" [...] for the first time, she felt inspired and imagined a story behind it. She also stated, [...] " [...] put the whole album together as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> I wanted my show to be like. You can play with a circus in so many different ways". [...] "Circus" [...] was recorded at Conway Recording Studios and Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Glenwood Place Studio in Burbank, California. Background vocals were provided by Cathy Dennis, Kelly and Myah Marie. Main instrumentation was done by Luke and Blanco. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia. [...] "Circus" [...] was announced on October 31, 2008, as the second single from the album, and was officially serviced to American radio stations on December 2, 2008.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with reviewers generally calling [...] "Papa's Cabin" [...] a solid finale to the Dean O'Dell mystery {{but one that}} was less entertaining than previous mystery-ending episodes. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode an 8.2 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that it was [...] "an interesting episode that went against the grain as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> the show has done with similar reveals in the past." [...] While stating that Tim being the actual murderer was not very surprising, the reviewer felt satisfied with the scene in which Veronica pieces the clues together to implicate Tim. He also commented on how [...] "Papa's Cabin" [...] differed from previous mystery-ending episodes by having lower stakes, a characteristic he felt was appropriate. He thought it was similar to a traditional detective story model, meaning that it [...] "fell {{in line with the}} feel of the show." [...] However, he did not enjoy the fact that Fabian's character was being written out of the show. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, lauded the episode. He referred to the conclusion of the Dean O'Dell story arc as the closure to a conventional mystery in the sense that Veronica and Keith slowly built up evidence instead of stumbling on one incriminating object by chance. The reviewer also thought that the episode provided an intellectually satisfying conclusion to the mystery and that it [...] "maintains that level of involvement." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{reported}} by The Korea Times, {{the thought of}} Gothel being a villain who is both a [...] "greedy, selfish woman and a mother figure to Rapunzel" [...] was initially [...] "perplexing" [...] for animator Jin Kim, and it wasn't until after Kim heard Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{for the first time}} that he [...] "came up with the 1940s Hollywood screen siren motif" [...] for the character. The directors also strived to make it obvious that Mother Gothel and Rapunzel are not related. Greno told Animation World Network, [...] "When they're standing together, it is very clear that this is not a mother and daughter, just by the frames of their bodies, their hair, the pigments of their skin," [...] as opposed to when Rapunzel is in close proximity with her true parents, the King and Queen. Howard added that, in comparison to Rapunzel, [...] "Gothel is very tall and curvy, she’s very voluptuous, she’s got this very exotic look to her. Even down to that curly hair, we’re trying to say visually that this is not this girl’s mother." [...] The animators studied footage of Murphy in order to get [...] "ideas about facial expressions" [...] and [...] "gestures." [...] After much speculation, the directors finally admitted that, in addition to Murphy, Gothel's physical appearance was in fact influenced by American singer Cher. Howard explained that this was [...] "because Cher is very exotic and Gothic looking," [...] continuing that the singer [...] "definitely was one of the people we looked at visually, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> gives you a striking character." ...|$|E

That was the goal and the mission, and it {{set the tone for}} the entire project." [...] In an article for Grantland, Steven Hyden noted the album's stylistic similarities to Rush, writing, [...] "There are songs on Dream Theater that are just straight-up Rush imitations, most notably 'The Looking Glass,' which crossbreeds 'Limelight' with 'Freewill' while leaving out Neil Peart’s misanthropic individualism." ...|$|E
