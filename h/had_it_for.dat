25|$|While {{retaining}} his WBC and WBA super flyweight belts, Darchinyan vacated his IBF belt {{in order}} to move up to bantamweight to fight IBF champion Joseph Agbeko in Sunrise, Florida on 11 July 2009. He lost a unanimous decision in a fight he looked almost too overly aggressive in and couldn't seem to cope with the Ghanan's style and repeatedly walked into straight right hands. Agbeko spoiled Darchinyan's goal of winning his third world title in a different division. Two judges scored the bout 114-113 for Agbeko, while the third <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the Ghanaian Agbeko, 116-111. Despite the defeat at bantamweight, Darchinyan was still recognized as super flyweight champion by both the WBC and WBA.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a long while and the others copied it. I suppose {{the most important thing}} I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E

Kirk was replaced as Prime Minister by Bill Rowling shortly afterwards. In the 1975 election, National ran {{on a platform of}} [...] "New Zealand – The Way You Want It", a slogan Muldoon came up with himself, promising a generous national superannuation scheme to replace Kirk and Rowling's employer-contribution superannuation scheme (which the famous [...] "Dancing Cossack" [...] television advertisement implied would turn New Zealand into a communist state), and undertaking to fix New Zealand's [...] "shattered economy". Labour responded with a campaign called Citizens for Rowling, described by Muldoon as [...] "not even a thinly disguised" [...] attack on himself. Muldoon overwhelmed Rowling, reversing the 32–55 Labour majority into a 55–32 National majority.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the success}} of Smash, The Offspring left Epitaph and signed with Columbia Records. Epitaph {{retained}} its rights to release the next album in Europe, while Columbia <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> all other territories. The band's attorney, Peter Paterno, had issued a letter to Epitaph stating that the band had [...] "substantial and fundamental reasons" [...] for wanting to leave the label and that Epitaph had [...] "breached its contract." [...] The band began writing and recording their fourth album, titled Ixnay on the Hombre, in 1996. The album was released on February 4, 1997, which was also Noodles' 34th birthday. This album was not as successful as Smash, although it did sell four million units and spawned five singles. The album saw the band {{move away from the}} political-punk themes common to many Epitaph bands, and more into mainstream rock with songs like: [...] "All I Want", [...] "Gone Away" [...] and [...] "I Choose". The video for the last track was directed by Holland himself. Dexter commented that Ixnay was probably not as well-received as Smash because it was such a departure, and that many fans probably were expecting Smash Part Two.|$|E
