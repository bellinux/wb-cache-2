25|$|To not be jostled out of {{the saddle}} and to not harm the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully <b>extended</b> <b>trot</b> without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.|$|E

5000|$|The Canarian hound is {{a slender}} and lightly built but sturdy dog, of medium size, with height at the withers {{approximately}} 55 to 64 cm (21.7 to 25.2 ins) for males, females are slightly smaller. Sizes {{vary with the}} terrain on which the dog hunts. The short, dense coat should be some shade of red, white, {{or a combination of}} red and white, depending on the island and, in some cases, the specific area on some of the islands. There should be no other colour on the coat, or indeed anywhere on the body, as even the dog's nose, nails and skin should be a shade of red, and they are even known to [...] "blush" [...] when excited. The neck is long, the head is longer than it is wide, and the large ears are carried fully up. The long tail is usually seen low set but can be raised. The tail is not carried too high when moving. The dog should move in an <b>extended</b> and agile <b>trot.</b> Faults, which indicate that a particular dog should not be bred, include aspects of appearance as well as structural faults that would prevent the dog's ability to move and hunt, such as cow hocks, and crossing of the fore and hind legs at a trot.|$|R

2500|$|Sitting: The rider's seat {{remains in}} the saddle the whole time while {{following}} {{the motion of the}} horse and without bouncing. This is required for show ring western riding and preferred in dressage, especially at the upper levels. Sitting the trot gives the rider optimum control, because he or she can use the seat and weight to ask the horse to make upward or downward transitions, turns, and/or to decrease or increase impulsion. It is also a test of equitation by proving that the rider can quietly move with the horse. The jog, which is the preferred gait of western horses, is generally smoother and less-bouncy than the working and <b>extended</b> <b>trot</b> of the English-style horse. [...] Sitting can be very tiring for the rider, especially if performed by riders who have not built up their stomach and back muscles, or if riders are on an extremely powerful mount with a big trot. To sit the trot, there is a slight forward and back movement of the lower back and stomach as the rider's hips follow both the up and down and side-to-side motion of the horse. To absorb the impact of the trot, the rider relaxes through the hips and the stomach and lower back, as well as the legs. The rider's upper body remains upright and quiet. The rider's hands remain steady. [...] The lower legs remain relaxed and only come into play when the rider gives a leg aid. If a rider cannot sit the trot and is bounced around, the rising trot is preferable, because not only is the rider uncomfortable, the constant slamming of the rider onto the horse is uncomfortable for the horse. As a result, it will hollow its back and stiffen its movement.|$|E

5000|$|English riding is an equestrian {{discipline}} with many different styles, however, {{at the most}} basic level, most versions require riders to use {{both hands on the}} reins, rather than just one hand, as is seen in western riding.

The [...] "posting trot" [...] is used most often in a working or <b>extended</b> <b>trot,</b> although there are also times when English riders may sit the trot; the [...] "sitting trot" [...] is most often used to ride collected forms of the trot seen in dressage, show hack and hunt seat equitation competition.|$|E

50|$|The {{passage is}} a {{movement}} seen in upper-level dressage, in which the horse performs a highly elevated and extremely powerful trot. The horse is very collected and moves with great impulsion. The passage differs from the working, medium, collected, and <b>extended</b> <b>trot</b> in that the horse raises a diagonal pair high {{off the ground and}} suspends the leg for a longer period than seen in the other trot types. The hindquarters are very engaged, and the knees and hocks are flexed more than the other trot types. The horse appears to trot in slow motion, making it look as if it is dancing. The passage is first introduced in the dressage intermediaire test II. A horse must be well-confirmed in its training to perform the passage, and must be proficient in collecting while remaining energetic, calm, and supple. The horse must also have built up the correct muscles to do the strenuous movement.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesised}} that trotters {{during an}} <b>extended</b> <b>trot</b> have lower energetic costs of locomotion (C T) than horses not bred for this behaviour. VO 2 was measured {{as a function}} of speed in 7 Arabian horses (3 trained to extend their trotting speeds) and in 2 horses, of similar mass, bred to trot (Hackney). Both oxygen consumption and C T increased with speed and there was, contrary to our hypothesis, no difference between breeds. In Arabians at 6. 5 m/s, C T had increased 25 % above the C T at 5. 0 m/s (normal transition speed). For Hackneys at 6. 8 m/s, the C T was almost 35 % higher. Stride frequencies increased linearly in all horses up to 5. 0 m/s. At the canter at 5. 0 m/s, the frequency increased 9 % to 111 strides/min, but then increased minimally with speed. In the Hackneys and the Arabians that extended the trot, stride frequencies were approximately 102 and did not increase with speed. Stride length (SL) increased linearly with speed in both trotting and cantering horses, and cantering SL were lower than trotting (at 5. 0 m/s, SL for trotting = 3. 04 m and for cantering SL = 2. 68 m). There were no differences between breeds in stride frequency or stride length. Extending the trot can have profound energetic requirements that could limit athletic performance and may lead to increased concussive impact on the limbs...|$|E
40|$|Kinematic studies {{quantifying}} {{the various}} influences on equine locomotion are widespread, however {{research on the}} effects of stretching on equine movement is limited and lacks in comparison to human medicine. Equine trainers should be aiming to facilitate movement that is natural, aesthetic and rewarding for the horse and rider. Injury prevention is also critical for equine welfare and career longevity. The use of stretching regimes as part of manual therapy is becoming a widespread procedure within the performance horse industry. This is most likely due to extrapolation of the positive findings from human research. The aim of the investigation was to quantify the effects of two eight-week stretching regimes on stride length (SL) and range of motion (ROM) in the equine trot. Eighteen horses were divided into three matched groups according to age, conformation and breed. The groups were assigned to a 6 -day stretching regime (6 DSR), 3 -day stretching regime (3 DSR) and a control, no stretching regime (NSR). Baseline measurements of SL and ROM in trot (in hand) were obtained prior to treatment using two-dimensional video analysis. The two stretching regimes were applied for eight weeks. SL and ROM data were collected at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 for the trot in hand. Subjects were analysed in ridden <b>extended</b> <b>trot</b> at week 8 and 16. The results were analysed by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). There were no significant effects of stretching on the in hand or ridden SL (P> 0. 05). Some significant differences were found in joint ROM between the 6 DSR, 305 R and NSR, the 6 DSR generally produced lower ROM than the other two treatments. In conclusion SL was not altered by the two eight-week stretch regimes, however the 3 DSR was more beneficial than the 6 DSR on increasing joint R. OM. Further research is required to investigate whether the ROM differences are due to stretch hold times and frequencies...|$|E
