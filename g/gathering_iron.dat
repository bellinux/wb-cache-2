60|$|But this fool of a {{creature}} goes around collecting {{the most ridiculous}} things you can imagine and storing them up. He never selects a thing that could ever prove of the slightest help to him; but he goes about <b>gathering</b> <b>iron</b> forks, and spoons, and tin cans, and broken mouse-traps--all sorts of rubbish that is {{difficult for him to}} carry and yet be any use when he gets it. Why, that bird will go by a gold watch to bring back one of those patent cake-pans.|$|E
40|$|Iron is {{required}} by most living systems. A great variety of means of acquisition, avenues of uptake, and methods of storage are used by pathogenic fungi to ensure a supply of the essential metal. Solubilization of insoluble iron polymers {{is the first step}} in iron assimilation. The two methods most commonly used by microorganisms for solubilization of iron are reduction and chelation. Reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron by enzymatic or nonenzymatic means is a common mechanism among pathogenic yeasts. Under conditions of iron starvation, many fungi synthesize iron chelators known as siderophores. Two classes of compounds that function in <b>iron</b> <b>gathering</b> are commonly observed: hydroxamates and polycarboxylates. Two major responses to iron stress in fungi are a high-affinity ferric iron reductase and siderophore synthesis. Regulation of these two mechanisms at the molecular level has received attention. Uptake of siderophores is a diverse process, which varies among the different classes of compounds. Since free iron is toxic, it must be stored for further metabolic use. Polyphosphates, ferritins, and siderophores themselves have been described as storage molecules. The iron-gathering mechanisms used by a pathogen in an infected host are largely unknown and can only be posited on the basis of in vitro studies at present...|$|R
40|$|The role of pyoverdin, {{the main}} {{siderophore}} in iron-gathering capacity produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in bacterial growth in vivo is controversial, although iron {{is important for}} virulence. To determine the ability of pyoverdin to compete for iron with the human iron-binding protein transferrin, wild-type P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 (PAO 1 strain) and PAO pyoverdin-deficient mutants were grown at 37 degrees C in bicarbonate-containing succinate medium to which apotransferrin had been added. Growth of the pyoverdin-deficient mutants was fully inhibited {{compared with that of}} the wild type but was restored when pyoverdin was added to the medium. Moreover, when growth took place at a temperature at which no pyoverdin production occurred (43 degrees C), the wild-type PAO 1 strain behaved the same as the pyoverdin-deficient mutants, with growth inhibited by apotransferrin in the presence of bicarbonate and restored by pyoverdin supplementation. Growth inhibition was never observed in bicarbonate-free succinate medium, whatever the strain and the temperature for growth. In vivo, in contrast to results obtained with the wild-type strain, pyoverdin-deficient mutants demonstrated no virulence when injected at 10 (2) CFU into burned mice. However, virulence was restored when purified pyoverdin originating from the wild-type strain was supplemented during the infection. These results strongly suggest that pyoverdin competes directly with transferrin for iron and that it is an essential element for in vivo <b>iron</b> <b>gathering</b> and virulence expression in P. aeruginosa. Rapid removal of iron from [59 Fe]ferritransferrin by pyoverdin in vitro supports this view...|$|R
