25|$|A {{fractional}} rigged sloop has its <b>forestay</b> attached {{at a point}} {{below the}} top of the mast, allowing the mainsail to be flattened to improve performance by raking {{the upper part of the}} mast aft by tensioning the backstay. A smaller headsail is easier for a short-handed crew to manage.|$|E
500|$|The toroidal-shaped stadium roof is held {{together}} by a tensioned system, which {{has been described as}} [...] "ground-breaking" [...] by New Steel Construction magazine. The stadium's architectural focal point is the sweeping roof and support masts which are separate from the concrete bowl. A catenary cable is situated around the inner perimeter of the roof structure which is tied to the masts via <b>forestay</b> cables. Backstay cables and corner ties from the masts are connected to the ground to support the structure. With the expansion of the South Stand in 2015 to accommodate a third tier of seating, the original south end roof was dismantled; but with the southern masts and corner ties remaining, so as to continue to tie the catenary cable which now runs below the new roof. [...] The new higher South Stand roof is a separate structure, with its own set of braced masts and cables; and it is expected that a counterpart arrangement will be adopted for the proposed North Stand expansion.|$|E

50|$|The {{bowsprit}} of a {{sailing vessel}} is a spar extending {{forward from the}} vessel's prow. It provides an anchor point for the <b>forestay(s),</b> allowing the fore-mast to be stepped farther forward on the hull.|$|R
50|$|To a stay - Sails {{attached}} to stays, include jibs, which are {{attached to}} <b>forestays</b> and staysails, which are mounted on other stays (typically wire cable) that support other masts from the bow aft.|$|R

2500|$|This {{photograph}} shows {{well the}} auxiliary sail rig of the Anderson. [...] There {{appear to be}} furled sails on the <b>forestay</b> and foremast. [...] The image also shows the later version of Anderson when her passenger deck had been extended {{all the way to}} her bow.|$|E
2500|$|The cutter {{is similar}} to a sloop with a single mast and mainsail, but {{generally}} carries the mast further aft to allow for [...] a jib and staysail to be attached to the head stay and inner <b>forestay,</b> respectively. Once a common racing configuration, today it gives versatility to cruising boats, especially in allowing a small staysail to be flown from the inner stay in high winds.|$|E
50|$|A headsail of a {{sailing vessel}} is any sail set {{forward of the}} {{foremost}} mast. The most common headsails are staysails, a term that includes jibs and the larger genoa. Other headsails are set independently of any <b>forestays,</b> such as the spinnaker.|$|R
50|$|The {{bowsprit}} on a tall ship may be {{of considerable}} length and carry several <b>forestays</b> supporting the foremast. Headsails are stowed by tying onto the bowsprit when not in use. To minimise the risk of bowsprit and crew handling sail on it being buried in large waves, it is normally angled upwards from the horizontal.|$|R
6000|$|... "The iron <b>forestay's</b> {{holding the}} mast, and there's {{a couple of}} blocks slung round the top," [...] he said. [...] "If it wasn't blowing quite so hard, I'd go up for them." [...] Then he caught a thin rope that ran down from the blocks. [...] "Good signal-halyard; I'd like to take it back, but I didn't bring my knife." ...|$|R
2500|$|On July 28, {{under heavy}} {{covering}} {{fire from the}} Tyrannicide, Hunter, and Sky Rocket, Brigadier General Peleg Wadsworth led an assault force of 400 (200 marines and 200 militia) ashore before dawn at Dyce's Head on the western tip of the peninsula with orders to capture Fort George. They landed on the narrow beach and advanced up the steep bluff leading to the fort. The British pickets, who included Lieutenant John Moore, put up a determined resistance but received no reinforcement from the fort and were forced to retire, leaving the Americans in possession of the heights. Eight British troops were captured. At this point, Lovell ordered the attackers to halt and entrench where they were. Instead of assaulting the fort, Lovell had decided to build a battery within [...] "a hundred rods" [...] of the British lines and bombard them into surrender. The American casualties in the assault had been severe: [...] "one hundred out of four hundred men on the shore and bank", with the Continental Marines suffering more heavily than the militia. Commodore Saltonstall was so appalled by the losses incurred by his marines that he refused to land any more and even threatened to recall those already on shore. In addition his flagship, the Continental frigate Warren, suffered considerable damage during the engagement with hits to its mainmast, <b>forestay</b> and gammoning.|$|E

60|$|As Horton spoke, {{the object}} of his solicitude, with {{incredible}} speed, slid down the <b>forestay</b> and disappeared through the scuttle of the forecastle.|$|E
50|$|Stays are ropes, wires, or rods on sailing {{vessels that}} run fore-and-aft along the {{centerline}} from the masts to the hull, deck, bowsprit, or to other masts which serve {{to stabilize the}} masts. On a ship with a single mast, stays that run aft are called backstays and stays that run forward are called <b>forestays.</b> Along with shrouds, they form the primary stabilization for the standing rigging.|$|R
50|$|In square rigged ships the staysails {{can help}} in tacking, {{overcoming}} the lumbering square sails' tendency to prevent bearing up to windward, especially in light winds. Where a ship attempts to tack but fails and has to bear away again on the original tack, {{she is said to}} have missed her stays. In cutter rigged yachts the genoa will often need to be furled before changing tack due to the difficulty in passing the big sail between the two <b>forestays.</b> Here the staysail can help bring the bow through the wind more effectively.|$|R
5000|$|Alcaeus {{rarely used}} metaphor or simile {{and yet he}} had a fondness for the allegory of the storm-tossed ship of state. The {{following}} fragment of a hymn to Castor and Polydeuces (the Dioscuri) is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyage.Hither now to me from your isle of Pelops,You powerful children of Zeus and Leda,Showing youselves kindly by nature, CastorAnd Polydeuces!Travelling abroad on swift-footed horses,Over the wide earth, over all the ocean,How easily you bring deliverance fromDeath's gelid rigor,Landing on tall ships with a sudden, great bound,A far-away light up the <b>forestays</b> running,Bringing radiance to a ship in trouble,Sailed in the darkness! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads, {{take your}} {{places at the}} sheets, ready to haul or let go as I give the word." [...] So saying, Tom Virtue took {{his place in the}} bow, holding on by the <b>forestay.</b>|$|E
60|$|Four sailors speedily lashed a three-inch rope {{four feet}} above the deck, from the <b>forestay</b> round the shrouds and aft to the mizzen, hove as tight as they could get it and then fastened. While this was being done one of the mates cut {{up a piece of}} two-inch rope into several foot lengths, and gave one to each of the men and officers, {{including}} Frank and George Lechmere.|$|E
60|$|The vessel, already {{staggering}} under {{much too}} great a press of canvas, now rushed through the water with terrific speed; burying her bows in foam at one moment, and hurling off clouds of spray at the next as she held on her wild course. Job stood on the bowsprit, drenched with spray, holding with one hand to the <b>forestay,</b> and waving the other high above his head, cheering and yelling furiously {{as if he were}} daring the angry sea to come on, and do its worst.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} the wharf he found Kitty, with Celia Hartley, {{whom he had}} not met hitherto, awaiting him with Carroll and Drayton. A boat lay at the steps, and he and Carroll rowed the others off to the sloop. The moon was just rising from behind the black firs at the inner end of the inlet, and a little cold wind that blew down across them, faintly scented with resinous fragrance, stirred the water into tiny ripples that flashed into silvery radiance here and there. Lights gleamed on the <b>forestays</b> of vessels whose tall spars were etched in high, black tracery against the dusky blue of the sky, athwart which there streamed the long smoke trail of a steamer passing out through the Narrows.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results obtained from the application of different output-only modal identification techniques to ambient response data collected in two dynamic tests of a cable-stayed bridge and the subsequent finite element model correlation analysis. The first test, performed by using a traditional data acquisition system with servo-accelerometers, was aimed at investigating the vertical dynamic characteristics of the bridge. In the second test, an innovative radar vibrometer was used for non-contact measurement of deflection time series of the <b>forestays</b> and the identification of local natural frequencies of the stay cables. In the theoretical study, vibration modes were determined using a 3 D Finite Element model of the bridge and the information obtained from the field tests, combined with a classic system identification technique, provided a linear elastic model, accurately fitting the modal parameters of the bridge in its present condition...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not quite}} {{half an hour later}} when the Estremedura moved on again, and Macallister {{informed}} Austin that he could not allow two journals to become overheated in the same voyage. It would, he said, be too much of a coincidence, and some of his subordinates did know a little about machinery. They had accordingly some few minutes yet in hand when they swung round the high Isleta cinder heap into sight of Las Palmas. It gleamed above the surf fringe, a cluster of twinkling lights at the black hills' feet, and there were other lights, higher up, on ships' <b>forestays,</b> behind the dusky line of mole. In between, the long Atlantic heave flashed beneath the moon, and there was scarcely two miles of it left. Austin, standing forward with a pair of night-glasses, and Jacinta beside him, watched the lights close on one another dejectedly.|$|R
6000|$|She was a brig, {{with nothing}} {{particularly}} striking in her rig or appointments--a mere trading vessel. But on her bulwarks at {{the bow and}} on the heel of the bowsprit was gathered a group that well deserves notice, for there, foremost of all, and towering above the others, stood Antonio Zeppa, holding on to a <b>forestay,</b> and gazing with intensity and fixedness at the speck of land which had just been sighted. Beside him, and not less absorbed, stood his valiant and amiable son; while around, in various attitudes, sat or stood the chiefs Tomeo and Buttchee, Rosco and Ebony, Ongoloo and Wapoota, and little Lippy with her mother! ...|$|E
60|$|His figure, shapeless in the {{streaming}} oilskins, cut darkly {{against the}} livid foam as the Sorata swung her bows {{high above the}} sea, and then was almost lost in a filmy cloud as she plunged and buried them in the breast of a big comber. Suddenly, however, he dropped on hands and knees, and, crouching with one arm around the <b>forestay,</b> hauled the strip of canvas out along the bowsprit until once more a sea smote the Sorata and he sank into a rush of foam. The girl caught her breath as she waited until the boat swung her head out again, for it was very evident that the man alone stood between her and destruction.|$|E
60|$|The mulatto {{looked at}} the disordered pile and made for the ladder. Marston did not stop him, {{although}} he was angry, and kneeling down began {{to pick up the}} articles. The bottles were strong and had not broken, and in a minute or two he replaced them and the other things in the box. Then he went up the ladder and looked out on deck. A lamp hung on the <b>forestay</b> as a beacon for the boats and one could see the sweep of planks and line of the rail. There was nobody about and nothing broke the silence. Beyond the feeble glimmer of the lamp it was very dark, but the night was calm and Marston knew the splash of a paddle would carry far.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of our {{stations}} and duties {{it is not}} necessary to speak. I hope that, when the proper time shall come, both may be found ready to be at the first, and equal to discharge the last. But Captain Ludlow, backed by the broadside of the Coquette and the cross-fire of his marines, is not Captain Ludlow alone, on a sea bluff, with a crutch no better than his own arm, and a stout heart. As the first, he is like a spar supported by backstays and <b>forestays,</b> braces and standing rigging; while, as the latter, he is the stick, which keeps its head aloft by the soundness and quality of its timber. You have the appearance of one who can go alone, even though it blew heavier than at present, if one may judge of the force of the breeze, by the manner it presses on the sails of yonder boat in the bay." ...|$|R
6000|$|Shrouds {{and stays}} are the thick ropes {{that keep the}} masts firmly in position. They form {{part of what is}} termed the [...] "standing gear" [...] of a ship--in other words, the ropes that are fixtures--to {{distinguish}} them from the [...] "running gear"--those movable ropes, by means of which the sails, boats, flags, etcetera, are hoisted. Nearly all the ropes of a ship are named after the mast, or yard, or sail with which they are connected. Thus we have the main shrouds, the main-top-mast shrouds, and the main-topgallant shrouds; the main back-stay, the main-topgallant back-stay, and so on--those of the other masts being similarly named, {{with the exception of the}} first word, which, of course, indicates the particular mast referred to. The shrouds rise from the chains, which are a series of blocks called [...] "dead eyes," [...] fixed to the sides of the ship. To these the shrouds are fixed, and also to the masts near the tops; they serve the purpose of preventing the masts from falling sideways. Backstays prevent them from falling forward, and <b>forestays</b> prevent them from falling backward, or [...] "aft." [...] Besides this, shrouds have little cross ropes called ratlines attached to them, by means of which rope-ladders the sailors ascend and descend the rigging to furl, that is, tie up, or unfurl, that is, to untie or shake out, the sails.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on, I've {{a bottle}} o' matches in my bunk," [...] cried the skipper, {{returning}} to the flooded cabin. Fortunately the matches were dry; a light was struck, and a candle and lamp lighted. The scene revealed was not re-assuring. The water in the cabin was knee-deep. A flare, made of a woollen scarf soaked in paraffin, was lighted on deck, and showed that the mainsail had been split, the boat hopelessly damaged, {{and part of the}} lee bulwarks broken. The mast also was leaning aft, the <b>forestay</b> having been carried away. A few minutes later Lively Dick went tumbling down into the cabin all of a heap, to avoid the mast as it went crashing over the side {{in such a way as}} to prevent the use of the pumps, and carrying the mizzenmast along with it.|$|E
60|$|Jack {{held his}} breath every time the boat pitched, but she kept on without {{touching}} until within some eighty yards of the wreck; then as she pitched forward down a wave there was a shock that nearly threw Jack off his feet, prepared for it though he was. In a moment he steadied himself, and crept forward and cut the lashing of the hawser just as Tom severed that of the chain. The latter rattled out for a moment. There was another shock, but less violent than the first, and then the renewed rattle of the chain showed that she was drifting astern. Ben now left the tiller and sprang forward. The jib was run in by the traveller and got down, the foresail had been cast off and had run down the <b>forestay</b> the moment she struck, and the three now set to work to lower the mainsail.|$|E
60|$|A {{phosphorescent}} flicker played {{about the}} vague {{blackness of the}} gunboat's bows; {{the light from the}} lamp on her <b>forestay</b> showed part of the deck, and then receded as she rolled. Grahame could make out an anchor hanging ready to let go and a man standing by her rail, until the light reeled and the figure was lost in gloom. It seemed to him that the Enchantress must be seen, and he wondered whether the other vessel had her boats in the water. He suspected that she belonged to the government which Don Martin meant to overthrow, and {{it would be difficult to}} get away from her if she had steam up. She was now abreast of him, but there was no sign of activity on board. The Enchantress crept on. The gunboat dropped back to her quarter. Then there was a sudden harsh rattle, and Grahame gasped. But a splash relieved the tension, because he knew it was only the ash-hoist bringing up furnace cinders.|$|E
60|$|Andrew went {{below and}} trimmed the anchor-light; then {{fastened}} it firmly to the <b>forestay,</b> {{and set off}} across the sands. Half an hour later, Dick and Whitney carried the small, folding dinghy to the channel and pushed her off. The current was now slack and they made progress until Dick shipped his oars and, kneeling down, took up the small hand paddles; but he let her drift {{for a few moments}} while they looked about. It was dark and the shore-line had faded, but some distance up the channel a small black sail was visible across the bank, and a steady bright beam marked the Southerness lighthouse. Half-seen birds were wading about the water's edge, but Dick said these were oyster-catchers and not worth powder and shot. A curlew's wild whistle fell from overhead and the cry of a black-backed gull came out of the obscurity like a hoarse laugh. It was rather dreary; and their clothes and the dinghy were getting damp; so, dipping the paddles, Dick drove the boat ahead.|$|E
50|$|Often a sail is {{attached}} to the <b>forestay.</b> This sail may be a jib or a genoa. In a cutter rig, the jib or jibs are flown from stays in front of the <b>forestay,</b> perhaps going from the masthead to a bowsprit. The sail on the <b>forestay</b> is then referred to as the staysail or stays'l.|$|E
