25|$|An {{elemental}} diet {{taken for}} two weeks is an alternative to antibiotics for eliminating SIBO.

25|$|In the past, LGS {{patients}} were considered de facto as non eligible for epilepsy curative surgery, as scientists were thinking the LGS was a fully generalized epilepsy in all cases. Since around 2010 this assumption has been reviewed and all surgery options, including curative surgery, must be evaluated. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom (Engel class I) for 80% {{of these patients}} below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Nevertheless, like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur {{in the years following}} surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure <b>free</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

Alternatively, fixed-wing aircraft landings can be made on a runway at Sheslay. Charter helicopter service in the small community of Dease Lake provides {{direct access to the}} Level Mountain Range.

2500|$|One of {{the longest}} injury/suspension <b>free</b> <b>period</b> of any player {{in the modern era}} came to end in Round 6, 2006. A back injury, first {{sustained}} in Roosters' Round 3 clash on 26 March 2006 against the Canberra Raiders, that eventually required surgery ruled Minichiello out for the remainder of season. His back injury allowed several younger fullbacks to stake claims for the Australian jersey, particularly Brisbane Broncos fullback Karmichael Hunt. Minichiello's downfall from injury also coincided with the Roosters' decline in form, with the team finishing second from last {{at the end of the}} 2006 season. As part of the Roosters' 100th season celebration, a [...] "Team 100 – The Centurions" [...] was announced at the 2007 season launch. Minichiello was named as fullback. He kicked his first field goal in his career when the Roosters defeated the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in golden point, in Round 11, 2007. Minichiello was recalled as NSW fullback for Game 1 of the 2007 State of Origin series. He played an impressive first game (won 25–18 by Queensland), but unfortunately was ruled out of the second game and the third game too as his back injury was troubling him. He was replaced as the Blues custodian by Manly Sea Eagles flyer Brett Stewart. Unfortunately Mini's back injury put him on the sideline for the remainder of the 2007 season.|$|E
60|$|LITERARY CHARACTERISTICS. When one is {{interested}} enough {{to trace the}} genealogy of Victoria he finds, to his surprise, that in her veins flowed the blood both of William the Conqueror and of Cerdic, the first Saxon king of England; and {{this seems to be}} symbolic of the literature of her age, which embraces the whole realm of Saxon and Norman life,--the strength and ideals of the one, and the culture and refinement of the other. The romantic revival had done its work, and England entered upon a new <b>free</b> <b>period,</b> in which every form of literature, from pure romance to gross realism, struggled for expression. At this day it is obviously impossible to judge the age as a whole; but we are getting far enough away from the early half of it to notice certain definite characteristics. First, though the age produced many poets, and two who deserve to rank among the greatest, nevertheless this is emphatically an age of prose. And since the number of readers has increased a thousandfold with the spread of popular education, it is the age of the newspaper, the magazine, and the modern novel,--the first two being the story of the world's daily life, and the last our pleasantest form of literary entertainment, as well as our most successful method of presenting modern problems and modern ideals. The novel in this age fills a place which the drama held in the days of Elizabeth; and never before, in any age or language, has the novel appeared in such numbers and in such perfection.|$|E
