5|$|Clock Tower 3 (2002) is {{the fourth}} entry in the series. Unlike {{previous}} the previous entries by Human Entertainment, the title was co-developed by Capcom and Sunsoft and released on the PlayStation 2. The story follows 14-year-old Alyssa Hamilton who {{is part of a}} family lineage of female warriors who travel through time to defeat <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b> The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
50|$|After {{reading the}} letter, Rehan feels {{sympathetic}} and brings a psychic (Prachi Shah) to help, but the lady leaves after realising how strong the <b>evil</b> <b>spirit</b> is and asks Rehan {{to do the}} same. Rehan ignores her warning and stays there, challenging the <b>evil</b> <b>spirit</b> by repeating its name as {{it is believed that}} saying an <b>evil</b> <b>spirit's</b> name makes it more powerful.|$|R

5|$|A meter {{in length}} canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, {{are used to}} make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black patina over the {{engraved}} parts; the engraving designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs to ward off <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1987 a clock {{tower and}} a {{fountain}} were erected at Council Negri Monument. A centenary stone that was erected in 1967 {{to commemorate the}} event is kept under the clock tower. The Bintulu Tua Pek Kong temple (near Tamu Bintulu) {{is believed to have}} been built in the 1890s to purge the town from <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b> The temple survived World War II, and was rebuilt after the discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{the sword}} dance Choliya or Saraon of the Kumaon {{region of the}} hills of the Indian state of Uttarakhand started partly due to their long martial {{tradition}} and also to give protection to marriage processions. It was also held auspicious and, according to Hindu tradition, warded off <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b> It has a very beautiful and graceful form and has techniques which give it {{the status of a}} martial art.|$|E

5|$|Most {{accepted}} Lord Shiva as {{the primary}} deity and the lingam, the universal symbol of Shiva, was consecrated in shrines dedicated to him. The other Hindu gods of the pantheon such as Murugan, Pillaiyar, Kali were also worshipped. At the village level, village deities were popular along with the worship of Kannaki whose veneration was common amongst the Sinhalese in the south as well. Belief in charm and <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> existed, {{just as in the}} rest of South Asia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the adventurers' ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a brief but {{informative}} tour of the civilized area. They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces. The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. At midnight {{the devil}} Chernabog awakes and summons <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain. The spirits dance and {{fly through the}} air until driven back {{by the sound of}} an Angelus bell as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing Ave Maria as a line of robed monks is {{depicted}} walking with lighted torches through a forest and into the ruins of a cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The oldest known {{detailed}} {{record of}} the disease itself is in the Sakikku, a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 10671046 BC. This text gives signs and symptoms, details treatment and likely outcomes, and describes many features of the different seizure types. As the Babylonians had no biomedical {{understanding of the nature}} of disease, they attributed the seizures to possession by <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> and called for treating the condition through spiritual means. Around 900 BC, Punarvasu Atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness; this definition was carried forward into the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita (about 400 BC).|$|E
5|$|In the Atharvaveda—where {{he first}} appears—and the Shatapatha Brahmana, Kubera {{is the chief}} of <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> or spirits of darkness, and son of Vaishravana. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls him the Lord of thieves and criminals.da: XIII, 4, 3. Third Brâhmana (13.4.3.10)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sacred-texts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-23}} In the Manusmriti, he becomes a respectable Loka-pala ("world protector") and the patron of merchants. In the epic Mahabharata, Kubera is {{described}} {{as the son of}} Prajapati Pulastya and his wife Idavida and the brother of sage Vishrava. Kubera is described as born from a cow. However, from the Puranas, he is described as the grandson of Pulastya and the son of Vishrava and his wife Ilavida (or Ilivila or Devavarnini), daughter of the sage Bharadvaja or Trinabindu.|$|E
5|$|Many myths {{surrounding}} vampires originated {{during the}} medieval period. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse draugr is another medieval {{example of an}} undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event {{to the lack of}} a shmirah (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|E

5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by <b>evil</b> <b>spirits,</b> witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E
5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living {{beyond the}} bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease <b>evil</b> <b>spirits.</b> The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight <b>evil</b> <b>spirits,</b> while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{instances}} of curing demoniacs in the Old Testament. One example is, whenever an <b>evil</b> <b>spirit</b> from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the <b>evil</b> <b>spirit</b> would depart from him. In the book of Tobit, Sarah had been married to seven husbands, all of whom the <b>evil</b> <b>spirit</b> Asmodeus had killed before they had lain with her; indicating that the demon caused her to strangle them. Tobias had previously caught a fish in the story and was instructed by Brother Aarias on how to cast out the demon: [...] "if a devil or an <b>evil</b> <b>spirit</b> trouble any, {{we must make a}} smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed." ...|$|R
5|$|The main Monpa festivals held in {{the monastery}} are the Choksar, Losar, Ajilamu, and Torgya. Choksar is the festival when the Lamas recite {{religious}} scriptures in the monasteries. Following the religious recitations, the villagers carry the scriptures on their back and circumambulate their agricultural land seeking blessings for good yield of crops without any infestations by pests and to protect against attack by wild animals. In the Losar festival, which {{marks the beginning of}} the Tibetan New Year, people visit the monastery and offer prayers. Torgya, also known as Tawang-Torgya, is an annual festival that is exclusively {{held in the}} monastery. It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of Dawachukchipa, which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, and is a Monpa celebration. The objective of the festival is to ward off <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> and ushering all round prosperity and happiness {{to the people in the}} ensuing year. During the three-day festival, dances performed by artists in colorful costumes and masks are held in the courtyard, including the Pha Chan and the Losjker Chungiye, the latter of which is performed by the monks of the monastery. Each dance represents a myth and costumes and masks represent animal forms such as cows, tigers, sheep, monkeys and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Akilattirattu {{speaks of}} his {{incineration}} of <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> {{as an important}} event in Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the kalimayai - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> (peyattam). The possessed ones danced {{in front of the}} crowd as if the <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these <b>evil</b> <b>spirits</b> to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. When he had finished his orders, the dancers fell flat on the ground and burned.|$|E
25|$|Most cases do {{not involve}} actual surgery {{although}} some practitioners make real incisions.
