5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b> The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth. Temperatures of the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder because it has been mixed with seawater.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{residential}} and commercial development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed of Bowman Creek is clustered along Pennsylvania Route 29, Pennsylvania Route 292, and Pennsylvania Route 309.

5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the middle and upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen in Leggetts Creek ranges from 28.95% to 236.75%, {{with an average}} of 119.27%.

5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b> High numbers of American eels were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{brook trout}} {{naturally}} reproduce in Little Catawissa Creek. However, introducing rainbow trout into the creek is forbidden, {{although they were}} historically stocked there by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.

5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a sharp bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E
50|$|A soil {{known as}} the Wellsboro {{extremely}} stony loam occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of Van Brunt <b>Creek.</b> <b>The</b> surficial geology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek's</b> vicinity mainly consists of a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till.

5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek {{was found by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to have good {{temperatures}} for trout habitation, {{but there was no}} aquatic life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek {{is considered to be a}} cold-water fishery between its headwaters and its confluence with Rattling Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
50|$|The {{entire length}} of Bow Creek is <b>in</b> private land. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> and its unnamed {{tributary}} sometimes flood, but since their floodplains are in relatively undeveloped areas, such floods typically cause little damage.
