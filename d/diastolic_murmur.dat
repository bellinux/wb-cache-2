40|$|A 50 year old, recent cardiac {{transplant}} recipient developed systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmurs</b> {{but remained}} asymptomatic. The {{cause of the}} murmurs was not evident at transthoracic echocardiography. During routine left heart catheterisation a left anterior descending artery to right ventricular fistula was evident arising from the distal vessel and presumably acquired during routine endomyocardial biopsy. One year later, the patient remained asymptomatic but the calibre of the left anterior descending artery had increased and {{there appeared to be}} poor flow in to the proximal branches. The fistula was successfully treated by percutaneous deployment of two detachable embolisation coils in to the distal left anterior descending artery...|$|R

40|$|A {{case of a}} dilated and tortuous right {{coronary}} artery to left ventricle fistula was surgically repaired. Preoperative intracoronary pressure measurements showed a sudden depression of diastolic pressure in the terminal part of the right {{coronary artery}}. Intraoperative mean right coronary flow was recorded as 315 ml/min. After repair of the fistula, blood flow measurements showed only 35 ml/min, which suggested that {{a large amount of}} blood was stolen by the fistula. Although systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmurs</b> only were heard in our patient, continuous murmurs have been noticed by some observers. From a study of the preoperative physical findings, intraoperative coronary flow measurements, and other operative findings, the genesis of heart murmurs relating to this type of anomaly is discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Hope {{went into}} medical {{practice}} in December 1828 in Lower Seymour Street, Portman Square, London, and entered {{himself as a}} pupil at St. George's Hospital, where {{he was one of}} the early champions of auscultation. [...] "He described a soft early <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmur</b> due to mitral stenosis and was the first to distinguiish it from the <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmur</b> of aortic reflux. It was once called Hope's murmur." [...] In 1829 he established a private dispensary linked to the Portman Square and Harley Street district visiting societies. In 1831 he was elected physician to the Marylebone Infirmary, where he had charge of ninety beds. In the autumn of 1832 he delivered at his own home a course of lectures, intended for practitioners only, on diseases of the chest. He afterwards lectured at St. George's Hospital, where he was elected assistant physician in 1834, and at the Aldersgate Street School of Medicine.|$|E
50|$|Acute AI usually {{presents}} as florid {{congestive heart}} failure, {{and will not}} {{have any of the}} signs associated with chronic AI since the left ventricle had not yet developed the eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation that allow an increased stroke volume, which in turn cause bounding peripheral pulses.

30|$|In another work, Zhao et al. [84] employ {{two methods}} for {{instantaneous}} frequency calculation. One based on Hilbert transform, {{and the other}} based on TFD (EMD). The Hilbert-based approach fails for wide band signals while EMD reports satisfactory results. Authors claim {{to make use of}} EMD in its basic form to detect coronary artery disease based on the instantaneous frequency calculated from <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmurs</b> using EMD and SVM. In another study [85] by the same authors, signal was denoised using db 5 and, ensemble EMD (E-EMD) was then applied. EEMD removes the mode mixing problem in traditional EMD. Marginal spectrum was calculated on the Hilbert-Huang spectrum of EEMD output followed by DCT quantization and normalization of the marginal spectrum. Vector quantizer (VQ) was trained using Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm, and classification was carried out using Euclidean distance.|$|R
40|$|The {{case reports}} of 186 {{intravenous}} drug abusers admitted over a three year period were studied. Nineteen had proven staphylococcal septicaemia. Echocardiography showed tricuspid vegetations in seven and aortic vegetations in two. Eighteen out of 19 had systolic murmurs, {{but only the}} two patients with aortic vegetations had <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmurs.</b> The chest x ray showed opacities in 10 patients (all those with tricuspid vegetations plus three with normal echocardiograms). Four patients died during follow up, including both those with aortic vegetations; both mitral and tricuspid vegetations were found at necropsy in the other two. All remaining patients were alive at one year. The presence of tricuspid vegetations in intravenous drug abusers is associated with opacities on chest x ray, but carries a good short term prognosis. But these results suggest a poor outcome when left sided endocarditis is present in intravenous drug abusers...|$|R
50|$|The Carey Coombs murmur or Coombs murmur is a {{clinical}} sign which occurs {{in patients with}} mitral valvulitis due to acute rheumatic fever. It {{is described as a}} short, mid-diastolic rumble best heard at the apex, which disappears as the valvulitis improves. It is often associated with an S3 gallop rhythm, and can be distinguished from the <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmur</b> of mitral stenosis by the absence of an opening snap before the murmur. The murmur is caused by increased blood flow across a thickened mitral valve.|$|E
5000|$|Heart murmurs (or cardiac murmurs) are audible noises {{through a}} stethoscope, {{generated}} by a turbulent flow of blood. Heart murmurs need to be distinguished from heart sounds which are primarily generated by the beating heart and the heart valves snapping open and shut. Generally, heart murmurs are classified as innocent (also called physiological or functional) or pathological (abnormal). Innocent murmurs are usually harmless, often caused by physiological conditions outside the heart, {{and the result of}} certain benign structural defects. Pathological murmurs are most often associated with heart valve problems but may also be caused by a wide array of structural heart defects.Various characteristics constitute a qualitative description of heart murmurs, including timing (systolic murmur and <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmur),</b> shape, location, radiation, intensity, pitch and quality.CAA systems typically categorize heart sounds and murmurs as Class I and Class III according to the American Heart Association: ...|$|E
40|$|An early <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmur</b> {{thought to}} {{indicate}} functional aortic regurgitation was heard in 7 of 74 consecutive patients with end-stage renal failure assessed for chronic intermittent haemodialysis and transplantation. In all 7 cases the murmur was transient {{and related to}} episodes of hypertension and fluid overload and disappeared on correction of these factors. In a further 2 patients aortic regurgitation resulted from a structural abnormality of the aortic valve. Thus, an early <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmur</b> is not uncommon in this situation and does not necessarily indicate organic aortic valve disease which might preclude selection for haemodialysis and transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Discrete wavelet {{analysis}} can efficiently be implemented by filter banks. This paper studies heart sound signals using a wavelet filter banks structure. The heart sound signals are viewed into different wavelet subspaces by expanding them uniquely into sub-band signals of varying time-frequency resolutions. This provides {{the ability to}} isolate and distinguish different vital time-frequency information from the original heart sound signal and to explore the physical characteristics of heart sounds and murmurs such {{as the presence of}} opening snap, third and fourth heart sounds, auscultatory gap, high and low frequency systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmurs.</b> Very specific important features can be extracted from this information and used as a base for an informative diagnostic tool to classify heart diseases. Preliminary results show the significance of this technique in emphasizing the diagnostic information obtainable from auscultation and in helping to bring cardiac auscultation into prominence again along with more modern technologies such as scans, echo and Doppler scans. These results are believed to be satisfactory and promising...|$|R
40|$|Eighty-five {{survivors}} who left hospital after pulmonary autograft replacement for severe aortic regurgitation have been followed critically. Five patients {{died in the}} first five years and 80 were followed for six to 11 years. Important aortic regurgitation occurred only early and was always related to technical malpositioning of one autograft cusp. Seven patients with fascial pulmonary valves had problems, requiring removal in four. There was a small (2 %) morbidity from the right sided homograft and six were removed five to seven years later for progressive calcification; three of these had been irradiated. Despite a high incidence of trivial <b>diastolic</b> <b>murmurs</b> this valve replacement is still preferred for young patients without dilated aortic roots since the survivors remain well, with excellent, maintained relief of outflow obstruction, without problems from haemolysis and thromboembolism, and without deteriorating autograft function or need for anticoagulants. Histology of five autografts examined up to seven years after operation has shown normal living architecture...|$|R
5000|$|Because pulmonic {{regurgitation}} is {{the result}} of other factors in the body, any noticeable symptoms are ultimately caused by an underlying medical condition rather than the regurgitation itself. However, more severe regurgitation may contribute to right ventricular enlargement by dilation, and in later stages, right heart failure. A <b>diastolic</b> decrescendo <b>murmur</b> can sometimes be identified,( [...] heard best) over the left lower sternal border.|$|R
