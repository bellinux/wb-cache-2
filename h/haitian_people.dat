In 1991, there was another wave of <b>Haitian</b> boat <b>people.</b> But the administration of President Bill Clinton tried to discourage <b>Haitian</b> immigration. <b>People</b> were either detained and/or sent back to Haiti.

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working. Dessalines effectively sent the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.|$|E
25|$|Under {{president}} Aristide's leadership, {{his party}} implemented many major reforms. These included greatly increasing {{access to health}} care and education for the general population, increasing adult literacy and protections for those accused of crimes, improving training for judges, prohibiting human trafficking, disbanding the Haitian military (which primarily had been used against the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people),</b> establishing improved human rights and political freedom; doubling the minimum wage, instituting land reform and assistance to small farmers, providing boat construction training to fishermen, establishing a food distribution network to provide low cost food to the poor at below market prices, building low-cost housing, and attempting to reduce the level of government corruption.|$|E
25|$|Racist {{attitudes towards}} the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> by the American {{occupation}} forces were blatant and widespread. Initially, there was intermingling of {{officers and the}} elites at social gatherings and clubs but when families of American forces began arriving, such gatherings were minimized. Relations degraded rapidly, however, upon departure of officers for World War I in Europe; this {{changed the nature of}} the relationship between the races the most. The Haitian elite found the American junior and non-commissioned officers to be ignorant and uneducated. There were numerous reports of remaining Marines drinking to excess, fighting and sexually assaulting women. The situation was so bad that the Marine General John A. Lejeune based in Washington, D.C., banned the sale of alcohol to any military personnel.|$|E
50|$|Born in Port-au-Prince, Colimon {{began her}} writing {{career as a}} playwright and {{published}} five plays between 1949 and 1960. In 1974 she published her first and most well-known novel, Fils de Misère. She also wrote essays, short stories, and children's literature. Colimon's keen observations of the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people's</b> struggle against poverty gave a particularly poignancy to her work, as demonstrated by Fils de Misère. In Les Chants des sirenes, her collection of short stories, she explored the painful impact of the Haitian diaspora on both the individuals in exile and the Haitian community.

In 1992, McMillan was offered her first professional cartooning opportunity as an editorial assistant at XS- magazine/City Link, an alt-newsweekly. By 1999, McMillan began self-syndicating her cartoons, {{as well as providing}} exclusive comic features and illustrations for hundreds of publications worldwide. Her work has appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Daily Beast, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Yes! Magazine, Comic Relief, Amarillo Globe-News, Funny Times, Yahoo.com, and the San Francisco Bay Guardian.

In 2012, McMillan won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for Editorial Cartoonists for her work as a political cartoonist.|$|R
25|$|The Revolution in Haiti did {{not wait}} on the Revolution in France. The {{individuals}} in Haiti relied on no other resolution but their own. The call for modification of society {{was influenced by the}} revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people,</b> there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.|$|E

40|$|The United States marines {{occupied}} Haiti from 1915 - 1934. During the occupation, US marines helped introduce and popularize jazz {{music to}} Haitian youth. By the 1930 s, several Haitian jazz groups took root, often intermixing the imported American form with folkloric garb, songs deriving from the vodou cultures, and {{gestures to the}} anti-occupation indigénisme movement. In Caribbean countries (not unlike the United States), music often assumes what Gérard Béhauge has called “counterhegemonic strategies toward the elimination {{of political and economic}} subordination. ” Despite the music’s arrival from United States armed forces, young Haitians identified the music as their own, and simultaneously as an expression of an African diasporic consciousness. Some even contrasted jazz to things foreign: One popular group, Jazz de Jeunes, asserted that “Jazz des Jeunes is the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people’s</b> treasured child. Their pride, their dignity, is to eat their own food. Living from their Garden, they love being ancient. By extolling the foreign, you betray only yourself. ” This paper illuminates how these meanings of jazz took root for young Haitians in the interwar period, and the political valences of negritude and indigénisme that it became associated with. In doing so, it illustrates larger intra-national trends regarding the communicative and organizing powers of Black Atlantic music...|$|R

The media, government policies, and everyday constructions of Bahamian identity have played a significant role in socially constructing the image and status of Haitians residing in The Bahamas.

From this research, I detail the decision making processes in food aid distribution, and gain insight into the US government’s own evaluations into the work it has done to alleviate global food insecurity. The discussion of Haiti 2 ̆ 7 s future also talks about common global issues, possible solutions to the problems of addressing food insecurity, and how the lessons learned from Haiti can be applied worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Haiti is {{a unique}} environment, {{not just as a}} third world nation but also in culture and heritage. Economic and {{political}} instability has left this country without some of the basic needs and opportunities that we in the western world take for granted. Solutions to Haiti’s problems will only be realized through the understanding of Haiti’s problems. My research’s first goal was to understand the problem of education in Haiti, and then attempt to understand how media and technology can play a role in reform. This study uses qualitative methods to examine a two fold thesis; 1. The cultural differences of Haiti is a context that needs understanding, and 2. How can media and technology benefit the education and cultural society of Haiti? Through my research I seek to demonstrate alternate methods of education through media technologies. Education is an answer to the <b>Haitian</b> <b>people’s</b> problem, it is not, however, a solution for the county’s problems. These two contrasting theories are what I will examine and explore. This study will examine the impact of media on the society and culture of Haiti. Through qualitative research methods used while conducting field research in Haiti, I will address a series of research questions pertaining to the potential effectiveness of media technology education techniques. Using qualitative methods, open-ended questions and participant observation I was able to gather important insights and data on these topics in Haiti with Haitians. While there are many proposed solutions to Haiti’s problems I would rather present an option to better the situation for a small population of Haitian youth. Give a child food and water for life and they will eventually die. Give a child education and that child has the potential to better their economical situation and rise out of poverty.

5000|$|The {{number of}} Haitian {{refugees}} fleeing {{the country by}} boat escalated to new levels after Aristide was overthrown. The George H. W.

If the refugees made it to US soil, they would be protected from repatriation by international law. The administration began redirecting the refugees to Guantanamo Bay after the Haitian Refugee Center won a court case that established a temporary restraining order against forced repatriation. By November 1991, the Administration had to raise the previous cap of 2,500 refugees at Guantanamo. The camp continued to grow substantially until May 1992 when around 11,300 refugees were being held at the military base. The refugees were held on six subcamps in McCalla Airfield and Camp Bulkeley. There weren’t enough supplies. Many refugees slept on cardboard or bare ground and others on cots. Each camp was surrounded in barb wire fencing. Refugees rotated through each camp as they passed or failed each exam on the way to asylum. However, refugees were not told the significance of the movement between subcamps.|$|R

2500|$|Haiti has {{a unique}} history of racial ideology. During its colonial period, class {{structure}} shifted from one based on wealth, to divisions distinguished by race. [...] Once accepted as elite, families of African descent were rejected because of racist stereotypes. [...] This regression shaped {{the evolution of the}} <b>Haitian</b> Revolution as <b>peoples</b> of African descent rose up against the white colonial planters. Haitians are primarily of African descent but a lot of Haitians are also of the indigenous Taino descent (Arawak native Indians) which inhabited the island prior to Christopher Columbus's arrival. The Taino were nearly wiped out due to diseases the Europeans brought with them and because of cruel practices including slavery. The Tainos fled to the mountains just before the Africans arrived on the island. Mixing between the remaining Tainos and some of the Africans occurred and it is believed a lot of Haitians in present-day have some ancestral links to the indigenous Tainos.|$|R
