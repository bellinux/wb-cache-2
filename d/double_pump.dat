50|$|In computing, a {{computer}} bus operating with double data rate (DDR) transfers data {{on both the}} rising and falling edges of the clock signal. This {{is also known as}} <b>double</b> <b>pumped,</b> dual-pumped, and <b>double</b> transition. The term toggle mode is used in the context of NAND flash memory.|$|R
2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses <b>double</b> <b>pumping</b> (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this <b>double</b> <b>pumping.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many minor {{factors of}} the pump's design {{including}} its <b>double</b> <b>pump</b> system and control options give it additional efficiency without sacrificing {{any of its}} performance. By using a <b>double</b> <b>pump</b> system together with variable and automatic control, the pump is able to decrease its energy consumption while increasing efficiency and reliability. [...] Using the pump's variable controls allows the pump to base its amount of energy consumption on how much it is actually performing, cutting down on usage during non-peak hours and extending the pump's life span. The automatic controls allow the pump to follow a set schedule of how much energy to consume during specific hours, which allows building owners to cut down even further on electricity costs. By dividing the output into a <b>double</b> <b>pump</b> in parallel design, the system is able to greatly adapt to partial load conditions. This accounts for {{a significant increase in}} reliability and the 50% to 70% efficiency increase that these high efficiency pumps achieve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} mesh {{generation}} {{is very important}} for the computational simulation of the <b>double</b> channel <b>pump.</b> According to the special characteristics of the <b>double</b> channel <b>pump,</b> there exist a great amount of poor-quality elements, most of which are so called Sliver elements, generated by the tetrahedral mesh generation algorithms of Advancing Front Technique (AFT) and Delaunay Triangulation. By studying the type, distribution and reason of the badly shaped elements, a method to eliminate these Sliver elements was proposed. Then this method was combined with advanced optimization-based smoothing, Laplacian smoothing and swapping optimization to optimize the tetrahedral mesh. The computer language C++ is applied to develop the algorithms. Computational experiments of a <b>double</b> channel <b>pump</b> shown that the worst elements can be removed and the whole quality can be improved noticeably. After comparing the result of numerical simulation with that of the experiment, it is believed that the tetrahedral mesh optimization algorithm can satisfy the computational simulation of the <b>double</b> channel <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Milk {{ejection}} {{is essential}} for a successful lactation, however techniques to measure milk ejection in women are often complex and invasive. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} at milk ejection, milk duct diameter increased in the breast (measured by ultrasound) {{at the same time as}} milk flow rate increased (measured using a weigh balance). This study aimed to evaluate a purpose-built continuous weigh balance (Showmilk, Medela AG) to measure changes in milk flow rate from the breast to identify milk ejections during milk expression. In addition, the Showmilk was used to determine if milk ejection occurred simultaneously in both breasts during <b>double</b> <b>pumping.</b> Methods Increased milk flow rates during single pumping were compared to simultaneous ultrasound measurements of increased milk duct diameters in 14 mothers. In addition, increases in milk flow rate were compared between the left and right breasts of 28 mothers during <b>double</b> <b>pumping</b> for 15 minutes with two separate electric breast pumps attached to two Showmilks to record milk flow rate. Results Increased milk flow rates were associated with increased milk duct diameters during single pumping. The mean number of milk ejections was not different between the Showmilk (4. 2 ± 2. 0) and ultrasound (4. 5 ± 1. 5) techniques. Overall, 67 milk ejections were measured and of these, 48 (72 %) were identified by both techniques. The left and right breasts responded synchronously with 95. 5 % of the flow rate increases corresponding between the breasts. The mean number of milk ejections identified by an increase in milk flow rate during <b>double</b> <b>pumping</b> was 5. 1 ± 1. 7 and 5. 0 ± 1. 7 for the left and right breasts, respectively. In addition, mothers chose the same expression vacuum for the left (- 198 ± 31 mmHg) and right (193 ± 33 mmHg) breasts. Conclusion The Showmilk can simply and non-invasively record milk ejections by measuring increases in milk flow rate that correspond with increases in milk duct diameter. For the first time measurement of milk flow rate has been used to confirm that milk ejections occur simultaneously in the left and right breasts during <b>double</b> <b>pumping.</b> The use of the Showmilk will facilitate further research into the relationship of milk ejection and milk removal. </p...|$|R

50|$|Buses can be {{parallel}} buses, which carry data {{words in}} parallel on multiple wires, or serial buses, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra {{power and control}} connections, differential drivers, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in 1-Wire and UNI/O. As data rates increase, the problems of timing skew, power consumption, electromagnetic interference and crosstalk across parallel buses {{become more and more}} difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to <b>double</b> <b>pump</b> the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. USB, FireWire, and Serial ATA are examples of this. Multidrop connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use daisy-chain or hub designs.|$|E

50|$|It is {{primarily}} composed of an electronically commutated synchronous motor (ECM) {{with a permanent}} magnet rotor. The ECM is a motor that converts a direct current (DC) from an electrical source into an alternating current (AC) which {{is sent to the}} motor itself, allowing for increased efficiency over standard AC motors. The permanent magnet rotor consists of an iron core, surrounded by multiple magnetic rare earth metals, and finally a metal sleeve that evenly spaces the magnets around the core, which helps to drive the motor. By utilizing multiple small improvements in pump-design technology such as a <b>double</b> <b>pump</b> in parallel system and variable controls, these pumps are able to run at about a 50% to 70% increased efficiency with up to an 80% decrease in electricity consumption over the previous standard design. This pump has recently become the new standard in both commercial and residential buildings across the European Union due to a recent ordinance by the European ErP (Eco-Design) Directive. The ErP directive began enforcing this new standard of regulation of these pumps January 1st, 2013 and will become even stricter on efficiency standards on August 1st, 2015 {{in order to meet the}} EU's goal of a 50% total reduction in the pump's energy usage by 2020.|$|E
