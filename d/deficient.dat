5|$|Bluetooth {{connectivity}} {{and range}} sometimes poor, <b>deficient,</b> and/or defective. The sound quality {{on the other}} end is muffled and/or undiscernible, with reports indicating the iPhone is likely the problem as opposed to the Bluetooth headsets.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{and other}} cruciferous {{vegetables}} contain {{small amounts of}} thiocyanate, a compound associated with goiter formation when iodine intake is <b>deficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{sequencing}} of the honey bee genome provided {{a possible explanation}} for the sensitivity of bees to pesticides. Its genome is <b>deficient</b> in the number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione-S-transferases, and carboxylesterases.|$|E
5|$|Old {{scientific}} {{data do not}} distinguish between the two species, making it useless for determining structural differences between them. The IUCN lists both species as data <b>deficient</b> on their Red List of endangered species because of this issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} is <b>deficient,</b> {{but it is}} likely that these poorly defined {{subspecies}} diverged as global temperature rose over the last 10,000 years or so. Only one record of the species possibly dates back to the late Eocene.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is <b>deficient.</b> The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are <b>deficient.</b> The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|There are 254 {{state-owned}} bridges in Juniata County, {{of which}} 77 are considered structurally <b>deficient</b> by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} of three galleys under Antonio Diedo arrived {{to reinforce the}} city on 17 March, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only one {{in two or three}} crenelles, and they were <b>deficient</b> in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach at the head of an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN, 97 {{freshwater}} fish species from the Western Ghats were considered threatened in 2011, including 12 critically endangered, 54 endangered and 31 vulnerable. All but one (Tor khudree) {{of these are}} endemic to the Western Ghats. An additional 26 species from the region are considered data <b>deficient</b> (their status is unclear at present). The primary threats are from habitat loss, but also from overexploitation and introduced species.|$|E
5|$|Before {{researchers}} took active {{interest in}} it, {{the field of}} 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period. That attitude was carried through {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, where in the first edition of the Oxford History of Music, Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was <b>deficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2009 the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) {{replaced}} the viaduct {{that carries the}} route over St. Paul's Avenue and Conrail line. The St. Paul's Viaduct was built in 1928 and determined structurally <b>deficient.</b> The $271.9 million replacement was completed in September 2011. In addition to replacing the St. Paul's Avenue viaduct, the approaches to US1-9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geographical}} {{condition of the}} province, crops and livestock production is generally <b>deficient</b> {{as compared to the}} food requirements of Romblon population. To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, poultry meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.|$|E
5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so <b>deficient</b> that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the blotchy swellshark adapts {{readily to}} captivity and has {{reproduced}} in public aquariums. This species is caught incidentally by Japanese and Taiwanese bottom trawlers {{and brought to}} market. Intensive commercial fishing within its range do not yet appear to have impacted its numbers, but until more data are available the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data <b>Deficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) {{changed its}} {{assessment}} of the killer whale's conservation status from conservation dependent to data <b>deficient,</b> recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.|$|E
5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women <b>deficient</b> of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron <b>deficient</b> and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is {{increased}} in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine <b>deficient,</b> and develop evidence of hypothyroidism {{before or after}} giving birth.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the status}} of the Ethiopian hare has beendata <b>deficient</b> on theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because even though it is {{widespread}} species, very little is known about its status and ecology. The current state of its population trend is unclear. There are no known threats to the species. It occurs in the Abijatta-Shalla National Park and the Gambela National Park. It has also been found in the Baroye Controlled Hunting Area.|$|E
5|$|The quagga {{catshark}} is harmless {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data <b>Deficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} of carbon disulfide (CS2) with electron <b>deficient</b> acetylene derivatives is proposed to give transient 1,3-dithiolium carbenes (i.e. where X1 = X2 = S), which then dimerise to give derivatives of tetrathiafulvene. Thus {{it is possible}} that the reverse of this process might be occurring in similar carbenes.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data <b>Deficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who rejects the prosecution's plea offer must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's <b>deficient</b> performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by the prosecution, and accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.|$|E
5|$|Transgenic mice with {{homozygous}} {{depletion of}} NEDD9 are vital and fertile, but have immunological abnormalities {{that result in}} pre-malignant conditions later in life, defects are initially subtle, but increase in later life; B cell homing to the spleen and lymphocyte trafficking are <b>deficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{tissue is}} <b>deficient</b> or {{mutilated}} {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments. The down-side of a two-stage technique is the need for additional surgery and compromise of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries. The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E
5|$|While Tucker {{began writing}} for publication, as an {{attorney}} he was initially <b>deficient,</b> being disabled by his fear of speaking in the courtroom; he later gained the requisite self-confidence. Tucker became {{a founding member of}} the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society in Richmond, an effort led by John Marshall and John Floyd; Tucker was named to the Society's Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data <b>Deficient</b> to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific right whale, the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data <b>deficient</b> (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and pygmy right whale). Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data <b>Deficient,</b> citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data <b>Deficient</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation is {{intensive}}. The valley {{areas have}} fertile and rich soil. There is intensive cultivation on terraced hill slopes, but irrigation facilities are <b>deficient.</b> The Siwalik Range which forms the southern {{foothills of the}} Himalayas, slopes down into a boulder bed called 'bhadhar'. The transitional belt running along {{the entire length of}} the state is called the terai and bhabhar area. It has rich forests, cutting across it are innumerable streams which swell into raging torrents during the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants <b>deficient</b> in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but <b>deficient</b> in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian {{waxwings}} have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone <b>deficient</b> in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally <b>deficient.</b> Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not be expanded any further.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ismael {{produced}} 30foot (9m) waves {{over the}} Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico. The hurricane, which was forecast {{to move more}} slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared due to <b>deficient</b> communications between the boats and harbor authorities. As a result, 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore, with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded. About 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands, sandbars, or disabled fishing boats. Navy rescue teams and other fishermen searched for days off the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm.|$|E
