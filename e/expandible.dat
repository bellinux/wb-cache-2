40|$|An {{apparatus}} for latching an object, {{such as a}} payload for a space vehicle, {{includes an}} <b>expandible</b> latch which is shifted between a relaxed open condition and a flexed closed condition by actuation {{of a pair of}} temperature-responsive members, such as shaped memory alloy (SMA) coil springs. One of the two temperature-responsive members biases an actuator into a first position that allows the <b>expandible</b> latch to open. The other SMA member biases the actuator in the opposite position to close the <b>expandible</b> latch. Heating the appropriate SMA member causes the actuator to move from one position to the other position. In the preferred embodiment, no power is required to maintain the actuator in either position once the position has been established. For example, the actuator may have a rest position that allows the <b>expandible</b> latch to remain open when the two SMA members are cooled and allowed to reach an equilibrium condition with respect to applied force to the actuator. A detent-and-ball arrangement may be used to maintain the position of the actuator after the <b>expandible</b> latch has been closed...|$|E

40|$|A B S T R A C T: The kaolin {{minerals}} in lateritic weathering profiles on dolerite and granite in Western Australia {{have been}} characterized byintercalation tests for haUoysites, {{and also by}} their particle morphologies. Towards {{the surface of the}} profiles there is a decrease in both total kaolin mineral content, and in the expandibility of those minerals to intercalation. Tubular kaolinite that is non-expandible by any of the intercalation tests for halloysite was identified in the upper few metres of both profiles. Hydrated halloysite is most common at the base of both profiles. Formamide xpands some anhydrous kaolin minerals while the sequence of hydrazine/water/glycerol (HWG) expands more of these minerals. Non-tubular (subhedral to sub-hexagonal platy) kaolinite is also present. Hydrated tubular halloysite apparently alters to tubular kaolinite via dehydrated halloysite that is <b>expandible</b> by formamide and a tubular 'kaolin ' that is <b>expandible</b> by HWG but not by formamide. An examination of the relationship between halloysites and kaolinites should include consideration of the possible existence of intermediates between the two separate minera...|$|E

40|$|Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS) is {{characterized}} by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow. When obstruction {{is limited to the}} suprahepatic veins, portocaval shunting provides an immediate relief of symptoms.
