40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine, in a general population, the {{resemblance}} in <b>eating</b> behaviour between adolescents and their parents. This study was based on the first examination of a community-based epidemiological study in Northern France. Subjects were offspring aged 14 - 22 years (135 boys and 125 girls) and their parents (174 fathers and 205 mothers). The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 18 -item version (TFEQ-R 18) identified three aspects of <b>eating</b> behaviour: cognitive restraint of <b>eating,</b> uncontrolled <b>eating</b> and emotional <b>eating.</b> Familial resemblance in <b>eating</b> behaviour was measured by partial Spearman's correlations, adjusted for age and body mass index. Sons' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> was positively related to fathers' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 36), but not to fathers' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 07), nor to mothers' <b>eating</b> behaviour. Sons' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> was related to no parental <b>eating</b> behaviour scores. In daughters, cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> was positively related to mothers' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 26), but not to mothers' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 13). Daughters' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> and emotional <b>eating</b> were positively associated with the same scores in mothers. Finally, daughters' <b>eating</b> behaviour was not related to fathers' <b>eating</b> behaviour. In conclusion, correlations in <b>eating</b> behaviour were higher with the parent of the same gender, and <b>eating</b> behaviours in adolescents seem to reflect opposition to parents' behaviour more than familial resemblance...|$|R

The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they <b>eat</b> what is readily visible.

40|$|Master's thesisDisordered <b>eating</b> {{behaviors}} are non-pathological forms of abnormal <b>eating</b> that may develop into {{physical and mental}} health disorders. More specifically, disordered <b>eating</b> has been shown to precede <b>eating</b> pathology. Disordered <b>eating</b> is frequently associated with negative affect, such as fear and anxiety. One form of negative affect that has received special attention is disgust, a multifaceted emotion that seems to maintain and intensify disorder <b>eating.</b> While the majority of studies that have examined the interaction between disgust and abnormal <b>eating</b> patterns have focused on clinical samples (i. e., individuals with <b>eating</b> disorders), the interaction between disgust and disordered <b>eating</b> is less understood. We assessed the unique contributions of disgust sensitivity, self-disgust, and negative affect on disordered <b>eating.</b> One hundred and sixteen undergraduate women and men completed self-report measures of negative affect, disgustsensitivity, self-disgust, and disordered <b>eating.</b> Results demonstrated that disgust sensitivity’s animal-reminder subscale {{was a significant predictor of}} external and emotional <b>eating.</b> No significant associations were found between disordered <b>eating</b> and both core and contamination disgust. In addition, physical and behavioral self-disgust predicted restrained <b>eating.</b> Our results suggest that self-disgust and disgust sensitivity are associated with disordered <b>eating...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: While much {{research}} has investigated disordered <b>eating,</b> obesity, {{and weight loss}} treatments, less work has focused on creating a positive definition of psychologically healthy <b>eating.</b> Such a definition could inform obesity and <b>eating</b> disorder treatments. While intuitive <b>eating</b> appears to approximate a definition of psychologically healthy <b>eating,</b> {{it was believed that}} adding concepts of moderation, flexibility, and food enjoyment would improve its construct validity, as previous research has supported these constructs as important for psychologically healthy <b>eating.</b> The current paper presents a two-factor model of healthy <b>eating,</b> one that incorporates both psychologically healthy and nutritionally healthy <b>eating.</b> Method: A total of 479 undergraduate students completed online measures of nutritionally healthy <b>eating,</b> intuitive <b>eating,</b> moderation, flexibility, food enjoyment, emotional <b>eating,</b> hedonic hunger, dieting, body dissatisfaction, disordered <b>eating,</b> psychological health, ethnic identity, and demographics. Results: Factor analyses indicated that the items assessing moderation, flexibility, and food enjoyment were psychometrically problematic, and so analyses proceeded with the measure of intuitive <b>eating</b> alone. Nutritionally healthy <b>eating</b> and psychologically healthy <b>eating</b> were orthogonal. A latent profile analysis was conducted using measures of nutritionally healthy and psychologically healthy <b>eating</b> as indicators; this resulted in a five-class solution including Healthy, Dieting, Non-dieting, Intuitive Eating, and Unhealthy classes. These classes were theoretically meaningful and showed distinct patterns when compared on other study measures. Discussion: Intuitive Eating appears to provide a valid operationalization of psychologically healthy <b>eating.</b> Results generally supported the two-factor theory of healthy <b>eating.</b> Future research should investigate the effectiveness of intuitive <b>eating</b> interventions to improve public health as well as weight loss and <b>eating</b> disorder treatments.

5|$|Although wolves {{primarily}} feed {{on medium}} to large sized ungulates, {{they are not}} fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores. They frequently <b>eat</b> waterfowl and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available. In times of scarcity, wolves readily <b>eat</b> carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses. Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves: during harsh winters, packs often attack weak or injured wolves, and may <b>eat</b> the bodies of dead pack members. Wolf packs in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon. Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon. Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

30|$|In {{line with}} these results, mindful <b>eating</b> {{was also found}} to be {{improved}} after the intervention. For mindful <b>eating,</b> the intervention model explained 11 % of the variance. The mindful <b>eating</b> domain assesses an individual’s adaptive abilities to stop <b>eating</b> when full, refrain from <b>eating</b> in response to emotional states, be aware of environmental cues that evoke <b>eating</b> behavior, notice mindless <b>eating,</b> and {{be aware of the}} effects of food on the senses (Framson et al. 2009). Therefore, the pattern defined by better mindful <b>eating</b> scores, combined with lower measures of emotional <b>eating,</b> that occurred after the intervention is theoretically consistent with the rationale underlying the proposal of DBT as an intervention to tackle problematic <b>eating.</b> It is expected that individuals could learn other skills with which to control their emotions rather than use <b>eating</b> to cope. Also, the results support the hypothesis that mindfulness skills help to develop a better awareness of the context surrounding <b>eating</b> behaviors, including the act and taste of <b>eating</b> (Safer et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>eating</b> behaviors and overweight among population-based adolescents in Japan. Methods. Study subjects comprised adolescents in the seventh grade (age range, 12 – 13 years) from Ina, a town in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, between 1999 and 2008. The height and weight of the subjects were measured, and information concerning <b>eating</b> behaviors (<b>eating</b> speed and <b>eating</b> until full) was obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Results. Among boys (n= 1586), fast <b>eating</b> speed significantly increased the odds ratio (OR) for overweight when compared with medium <b>eating</b> speed, regardless of <b>eating</b> until full or not; moreover, a more marked increase in the OR was observed among boys <b>eating</b> until full (OR: 2. 78, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 76 – 4. 38) than among those not <b>eating</b> until full (2. 43, 1. 41 – 4. 20).

40|$|Objective: Loss {{of control}} (LOC) <b>eating</b> is a salient {{indicator}} of <b>eating</b> disorder psychopathology in adolescents and {{is associated with}} marked distress. While {{research has focused on}} the relevance of episode size, clinical significance of LOC <b>eating</b> frequency has rarely been explored. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying LOC <b>eating</b> prevalence with respect to its recurrence and associated variables in a community-based sample. Method: Participants were 1643 adolescents, aged 12 - 20 years (62. 4 % female). Based on EDE-Q self-report, participants were categorized as those reporting recurrent (N = 156; 9. 5 %), non-recurrent (N = 226; 13. 8 %) and no LOC <b>eating</b> (N = 1261; 76. 7 %). Results: Adolescents with recurrent LOC <b>eating</b> reported clinically relevant and significantly greater <b>eating</b> disorder psychopathology, functional impairment and distress because of LOC <b>eating,</b> and a significantly higher body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2) than adolescents with non-recurrent and those without LOC <b>eating.</b> Discussion: These results underline that LOC <b>eating</b> is a common <b>eating</b> behavior among adolescents in the community associated with clinical characteristics of <b>eating</b> disorders, and could therefore be a risk factor for developing full- or partial-syndrome <b>eating</b> disorders.
