40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze economic factors affecting the demand for imported corn to Saudi Arabia. The analysis aimed also at observing the impact of alternative livestock support policy on the demand for corn. 	Import demand model for corn is specified and statistically estimated using time series data for the period 1976 - 1990. Some literature for related studies in the U. S., Egypt, and Saudi Arabia is reviewed in this research. 	Results showed that about 94 % of the variation in <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn is due to the variations in real import price of corn, real per capita GDP, real price of local chicken meat, and the per animal unit government support to the livestock sector. 	The estimated demand model was tested for its projection ability using the (U-theil). <b>Imported</b> <b>quantity</b> demanded of corn is then forecasted up to the year 2000 with a 95 % confidence interval. The paper also analyzed the impact of a 10 % increase or decrease in the per animal unit government support on the <b>imported</b> <b>quantity</b> of corn to Saudi Arabia. 	It is expected that <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn will be around 504 thousand tons by the year 2000, a 10 % increase (decrease) in the per animal unit government support will result in an increase (decrease) of the forecasted <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn by 9 %, and 33 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the long-term power demand behaviour {{under the influence}} of air-conditioning (A/C) systems in Kuwait. An artificial neural network- (ANN-) based simulation model has been developed to forecast the long-term power demand considering different A/C-system <b>quantity</b> <b>import</b> scenarios. Beside the A/C factor, four socio-economic factors are utilized as inputs for the simulation model, including gross national product, population, number of buildings, and historic peak power demand. The baseline scenario shows that the peak power demand will reach 27 440 MW by the year 2025, with an average annual power growth rate of 5. 9 per cent. The A/C <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> scenario shows that an average A/C <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> change of 1 per cent is proportionate to an 1. 1 per cent change in power demand...|$|R

A use approach is presented as a more suitable tool. The difference between the two approaches is determined by a better grasp of international trade, which can lead to environmental leakage when a country specialises in the production of environmentally friendly products and has the environmentally unfriendly products which it consumes produced abroad. We show that in the period 1995 - 2002 Belgium was on average a provider of air emission intensive products {{for the rest of the}} world. Environmental leakage was mostly negative. However, the evolution of the Belgian environmental terms of trade shows that by 2002 its imports had become considerably more air emission intensive with respect to its exports than in 1995. There are indications that this evolution is due to a considerable increase of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>imports</b> of air emission intensive products. This in turn could point to environmentally inspired offshoring. However, the currently available data do not allow us to test this hypothesis.

40|$|Policy Summary: The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain the natural gas demand {{dynamics}} of Germany and to determine the factors affecting the import of natural gas from Russia. In the existing literature, there are several studies which investigate the demand structure of single sectors (like industry or households), but there is a lack of analysis that tries to explain <b>import</b> <b>quantities</b> as a whole. On the basis of a theoretical discussion, the components of natural gas <b>import</b> <b>quantities</b> have been tested through different time series analysis. We found that the European natural gas and oil prices are co integrated with a time lag of 7 months. We interpret this result as revealing that natural gas is a viable substitute for oil. The time series estimation results support our hypothesis and demonstrate a positive relationship between oil price and natural gas demand. Furthermore, we found that the German industry production level is also an important determinant for natural gas import. In the next step, we used a technologica...|$|R
40|$|Rapeseed oil is {{expected}} to be increasingly used in Spain as raw material to produce biodiesel to the detriment of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>imports</b> of biodiesel mainly based on soybean oil from Argentina. Therefore, the environmental impacts produced throughout the life cycle of energy crops used to produce biodiesel which is consumed in Spain could be radically affected. In this context, the environmental impacts of rapeseed cultivation in Spain and soybean cultivation in Argentina, were compared under certain growing conditions using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Two methods of calculation for Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) and two functional units (FUs) were used to test potential biases. The results showed that the cultivation of soybean in Argentina had, in general, fewer environmental impacts than rapeseed cultivation in Spain when the FU was the area of cultivation, but these findings are inverted when the analysis is conducted according to the energy content of the biodiesel obtained from these crops. Soybean in fact has very low oil content, meaning that larger areas of land are required to obtain the same amount of biodiesel and that consequently it has a higher environmental impact by energy content. Fertilization was, in general, the process that generated the greatest environmental burdens, and is an area in which improvement is necessary in order to increase sustainability, particularly with regard to Spanish rapeseed...|$|R

National demand cannot be covered by local production, due to imported one. This research indicated that soybean harvested area was influenced by local soybean real price, maize real price and last year harvested area. Soybean productivity was influenced by rainfall, maize real price and last year productivity. Local soybean price was influenced by soybean real price at producer level, imported soybean real price, <b>quantity</b> of <b>imported</b> soybean, productivity and last year soybean real price. Soybean real price at producer level was influenced by soybean production, <b>imported</b> soybean <b>quantity,</b> soybean consumption, BULOG monopoly and last year real price at producer level. Soybean <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> was influenced by production and consumption. Imported soybean price was influenced by international price, exchange rates, import tariff, and last year import price. Combination policy of increase the soybean price and import tariff 20 % would stimulate the producer to increase harvested area and production. Strategy to increase competitiveness and national soybean production are through productivity improvement and extended planting area programs. The priority to increase the production is to improve productivity and apply suitable technology. Extension of planting area to better region is conducted to increase cropping index. To anticipate trading liberalization negative effect to farmers’ welfare, protection policy by the government is still needed to control international price fluctuation and to strengthen local soybean competitiveness.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1995 Austria's foreign trade {{can be divided into}} two separate areas: trade with the 14 other EU member states and trade with all other countries in the world. In 1994, intra-EU trade accounted for 65 percent of Austria's exports and 68 percent of imports. These shares exceed those of other EU member states. Thus, Austria's economy was closely linked to that of the EU through foreign trade even before accession to this group of countries. Intra-EU trade is favored vis-a-vis trade with third countries in a variety of ways: the abolishment of border controls, the elimination of variable import levies and tariffs on agricultural products and food, liberalization of public procurement, the abolishment of rules of origin and the simplification of technical provisions. Moreover, there is a tendency within the EU to impose anti-dumping tariffs on goods imported from successful competitors abroad. Suppliers from third countries are disadvantaged vis-a-vis sellers from within the EU at various levels. This {{was one of the reasons}} for Austria's decision to join the EU. In the recent past, Austria's trade with countries outside of the EU (extra-EU trade) has developed somewhat more dynamically than trade with EU countries (intra-EU trade) : in 1993 extra-EU exports rose by 3. 6 percent, while intra-EU exports declined by 7. 8 percent; in 1994 the figures were 11. 8 and 8. 4 percent. The difference can be attributed mainly to cyclical factors. After accession to the EU, Austria's intra-EU trade ought to grow faster than extra-EU trade thanks to more favorable conditions within the EU. This is likely to be the case in agricultural trade. As far as trade with manufacturing products is concerned, the impact of the improvement in trade relations might only be felt after some delay. Extra-EU trade (35 percent of total exports, 32 percent of total imports) might for analytical purposes be broken down into two parts: trade with countries "associated" with the EU (the remainder of the EFTA countries, the six countries of East-Central Europe with Europe agreements, as well the ACP countries), and trade with third countries. The countries of East-Central Europe associated with the EU accounted for 26 percent of Austria's extra-EU exports and 18 percent of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>imports.</b> The EFTA countries contributed 20 percent and 14 percent, respectively, to Austria's extra-EU trade. From Austria's perspective, the grouping of the overseas departments (DOM/TOM, e. g., the Canary Islands, Madeira), as well as the ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean region, the Pacific region) is new. The latter group consists mainly of the former colonies of the founding members of the European Common Market. These countries enjoy special access to the markets of EU countries. At present, foreign trade with these countries is negligible, but might gain in importance in the future. Among the not associated third countries are the developing countries overseas (with a share of 22 percent in extra-EU trade) and the not associated countries of Eastern Europe (8 percent). Industrialized countries overseas account for 19 percent of extra-EU exports and 33 percent of <b>extra-EU</b> <b>imports.</b> Austria's accession to the EU means that the compilation of statistics on trade with EU countries can no longer be based on data as recorded at the border but must be compiled at the firm level based on value added tax returns (Intrastat). Statistics on trade with third countries (Extrastat) will be gathered as before at the border. The changeover to the new system is creating substantial difficulties. For some time no data on foreign trade will be available; this comes at an inopportune time when the current account is turning negative. At the moment it is still unclear how the system of national accounts might be used to substitute for the foreign trade statistics.
