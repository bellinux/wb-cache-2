5000|$|The German World War II Panther tank (and some Tigers) had double torsion bars. [...] Needing bars {{longer than}} {{the width of the}} tank to get the {{required}} spring rate and maximum elastic bend angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively <b>folded</b> the <b>bars</b> in half. For each wheel, one rod was attached to the suspension arm, while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame. On {{the opposite side of the}} tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot. Deflection of the suspension arm caused both halves of the double torsion bar to twist. A disadvantage of the torsion bar suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the torsion bar arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The costal and apical {{portions of the}} forewings are orange, the extreme costal margin dotted irregularly throughout with leaden grey. There is a large reniform leaden grey spot before the apex, not reaching the costa, but attenuated downwards to the apical margin above the anal angle, {{as well as a}} large leaden grey patch extending from the base nearly to the anal angle, occupying three-fourths of the width of the wing, and approaching the costa at its upper and outer angle at two-thirds from the base, its upper and outer edges irregularly sinuous and clearly defined, the outer edge somewhat transverse and oblique. This leaden patch contains three transverse bright vermilion bars, not reaching to its upper edge, and a spot of the same colour. The first bar near the base touching the dorsal margin is angulated outwards on the <b>fold,</b> the second <b>bar</b> tends a little obliquely inwards {{from the middle of the}} dorsal margin and is attenuated at a point a little above the <b>fold.</b> The third <b>bar</b> starts erect from the dorsal margin and is dilated and bent a little inwards at half its length. Between the first and second bar, and almost touching the orange costal border, lies a nearly circular spot containing a few black scales before its upper edge, which is narrowly margined with orange. The hindwings are brownish fuscous.|$|R
25|$|T. H. Foley {{made the}} first medals from 1912 until they went out of {{business}} in 1915. The eagle pendant and scroll were of die struck bronze washed with silver. Early versions were made with a short double knot and later ones with a long double knot. Only 338 of these medals were issued, making them the rarest version. Some Foleys were issued with a drop ribbon– the ribbon was extended, <b>folded</b> through the <b>bar</b> mount on the scroll, then dropped behind the eagle pendant and cut in a swallowtail. The first drop ribbon style medal was issued to the fourth Eagle Scout– Sidney Clapp, a 31-year-old Scoutmaster from West Shokan, NY.|$|R
50|$|The Strida {{is made by}} Ming Cycle in Taiwan. There was a key patent which {{covered the}} early Strida 1 onwards. The U.S. version of this patent was filed in 1986 and expired in 2006, which means only the {{mechanism}} used in Strida 1 and 2 of the product {{is now in the}} public domain. Several other aspects of the latest Strida 3 to 5.x versions are currently covered by patents in various countries, including the <b>folding</b> handle <b>bar</b> system US7243573, hub and locking system US7367632, front joint system US7681900, with other patents pending. The Patents, Trademark, Copyright and other IP are owned by Ming Cycle, Taiwan. Some components of the Series 3 to Series 5 machines are interchangeable but other significant components and sub-assemblies are not. Series 5 and Series 4 (Mini) machines have a freewheel mounted in the conventional position on the rear wheel (In Series 3 the freewheel, a commonly available Shimano 18t model, is part of the metal and plastic bottom bracket/crankset assembly) and a metal bottom bracket shell which incorporates an eccentric housing to adjust belt tension. Alternative folding handlebars which give more knee clearance for the taller rider are available for the Series 5; these may be retro-fitted in place of the standard folding handlebars on Series 3 and Series 4 (Mini).|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{foldable}} rings are designed using polynomial continuation. The first type of ring, when deployed, forms regular polygons {{with an even}} number of sides and is de-signed by specifying a sequence of orientations which each bar must attain at various stages throughout deployment. A design criterion is that these foldable rings must <b>fold</b> with all <b>bars</b> parallel in the stowed position. At first, all three Eu-ler angles are used to specify bar orientations, but elimina-tion {{is also used to}} reduce the number of specified Euler an-gles to two, allowing greater freedom in the design process. The second type of ring, when deployed, forms doubly plane-symmetric (irregular) polygons. The doubly-symmetric rings are designed using polynomial continuation, but in this ex-ample a series of bar end locations (in the stowed position) is used as the design criterion with focus restricted to those rings possessing eight bars. ...|$|R
50|$|The secrete {{was usually}} a small {{skull-cap}} of iron or steel pierced around its rim. The piercing {{allowed it to}} be sewn into {{the inside of a}} hat. The secrete was then undetectable to any observer, but offered considerably more protection from edged weapons than could a felt hat alone. Many different designs were used, some had solid domes, others were ring-shaped with a scalloped lower edge, presumably to save weight. A few exceptional examples had a <b>folding</b> cage of <b>bars,</b> which could be drawn down to afford protection to the face when in action. A further type of head protection which could be considered to fall under the same category, as it was intended to deceive the observer and mimic civilian headgear, was an entire broad-brimmed hat made of iron or steel. Such hat-helmets were either covered in cloth, or blackened and given a dulled finish so as to resemble felt. King Charles I of England is recorded as possessing such a helmet.|$|R

When the United States Navy {{expressed an interest in}} a new multi-role fighter jet under their VFAX project, the United States Congress instead cancelled VFAX and demanded that the U.S. Navy use one of the LWF aircraft under a new program called the [...] "Navy Air Combat Fighter Project" [...] (NACF). Accordingly, the U.S. Navy asked for proposals for versions of the two aircraft with various carrier-based features, including arrestor hooks, catapult <b>bars,</b> <b>folding</b> wings and dramatically strengthened landing gear and fuselage. Another requirement was that the entries would have to be built by companies with recent naval aircraft experience, however, neither General Dynamics nor Northrop had built a carrier aircraft for some time. Both partnered with other companies for the modified design; General Dynamics with Ling-Temco-Vought for what would be termed the F-16N, and Northrop with McDonnell Douglas for what would become the F/A-18.|$|R

5000|$|William Jr. and Harvey Mann started {{production}} of axes in 1825 in Bellefonte. [...] They were only 23 and 21 years of age. Prior to this venture, {{they were living}} near Johnstown, New York, where William Sr., their father, made edge tools. Three years later in 1828, they moved to Boiling Spring (now Axemann) and built a modern forge on land purchased from Judge Thomas Burnside. Two dams and mill ponds were constructed to provide water power for trip hammers. Axe production {{at the time was}} largely a calling of blacksmiths, and the factory {{was among the first to}} employ machinery. Axe production in 1800s was a laborious process, even with aid of machines. Early axes were made from two pieces of metal. The poll or head of an axe was formed by <b>folding</b> a <b>bar</b> of heated wrought iron, which also creates an eye. High carbon steel was used for the bit or cutting edge. Two methods existed for attaching a bit to the iron scarf. An early “inlay” method inserted a bit into a V-shaped cleft or “lip” in the scarf, welded in a forge, and then drawn using a trip hammer. The overlay method - patented by Harvey Mann in 1862 (no. 35,480) - welded steel on the outside of the scarf, which exposed more steel on the cutting edge. Around 1900, all-steel heads came into use. An on-line video from 1964 captures the effort required to make axes, including steeling the head and hanging (“hafting”) a handle or haft. Initially, output was limited to felling (“chopping”) axes and soon grew to over 300 axe heads per day. [...] The main building was 350 feet long and 70 feet wide. [...] Production in 1855 was carried out by a work force of fifty men. Wages were only $2.50 to $3 per day, but this was greater than the $1 wage received by local iron furnace workers. [...] An axe-finishing shop at Thomas Mill in Bellefonte was established in 1832 through partnership with Franklin Smith, but this venture failed after only a year. Its failure caused a split between the brothers, with Harvey assuming the debts. [...] Later, a finishing plant was added near Paradise (now Fisherman’s Paradise; lower left on map above).|$|R
