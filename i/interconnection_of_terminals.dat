40|$|Abstract. The choice {{processes}} <b>of</b> maritime <b>terminals</b> {{included in}} the networks have become, in recent times, a significant importance due to the general improvement of accessibility that has characterized most of the infrastructure. The high degree <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>terminals,</b> achieved thanks to the logistics innovation processes, revealed other attributes <b>of</b> the <b>terminal</b> activity, other than the localisation of facilities, which may be decisive for the users. In this context, considerable importance have strategies adopted by operators <b>of</b> shipping <b>terminals</b> whose level <b>of</b> competitiveness and efficiency is the key element {{in the process of}} selection of ports. Therefore the organizational and functional complexity of most of the ports may prove extremely useful to the analysis <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> for its right collocation in the network...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{a number}} <b>of</b> geometric <b>interconnection,</b> partitioning, and placement problems arising {{in the field}} of VLSI physical design automation. In particular, many of the results concern the geometric Steiner tree problem: given a set <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> in the plane, find a minimum-length <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> those <b>terminals</b> according to some geometric distance metric. Two new algorithms are introduced that compute optimal rectilinear Steiner trees. Both are provably faster than any previous algorithm for instances small enough to solve in practice, and both are also fast in practice. The first algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm based on decomposing a rectilinear Steiner tree into full trees. A full tree is a Steiner tree in which every terminal is a leaf. Its time complexity is O(n 3 ^n), where n is the number <b>of</b> <b>terminals.</b> The second algorithm modifies the first by the use of full-set screening, which is a process by which some candidate full trees are eliminated f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} geometric Steiner tree problem: given a set <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> in the plane, find a minimum-length <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> those <b>terminals</b> {{according to some}} geometric distance metric. In the process, however, it addresses a much more general and widely applicable problem, that of finding a minimum-weight spanning tree in a hypergraph. The geometric Steiner tree problem {{is known to be}} NP-complete for the rectilinear metric, and NP-hard for the Euclidean metric. The fastest exact algorithms (in practice) for these problems use two phases: First a small but sufficient set of full Steiner trees (FSTs) is generated and then a Steiner minimal tree is constructed from this set. These phases are called FST generation and FST concatenation, respectively, and an overview of each phase is presented. FST concatenation is almost always the most expensive phase, and has traditionally been accomplished via simple backtrack search or dynamic programming...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{automation}} of ther placement of integrated modules on a board and <b>of</b> the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> the module <b>terminals.</b> The procedures proposed for solving such problems require very limited resources for implementation and are relatively fast, {{as compared to the}} apporaches discussed in the litterature. The reduced complexity originates from the assumption of a structure scheme and the decomposition of the placement problem and <b>of</b> the <b>interconnection</b> problem is simpler cascaded subproblems...|$|R
40|$|A new MAC {{protocol}} {{which supports}} peer-to-peer direct communication is introduced for a packet switched wireless network. Terminals that are located {{within range of}} each other and are sufficiently isolated from the base station can communicate with their peers directly without the use of the base station as a relay. Slotted Aloha is used as the access protocol. Throughput and delay of the protocol are evaluated. Numerical results are presented which show that significant improvements in throughput/delay performance can be obtained over a system using slotted Aloha without peer-to-peer communication. Index Terms [...] - Wireless LAN, MAC protocol, peer-to-peer communication, slotted Aloha, throughput and delay. 2 1 Introduction <b>Interconnection</b> <b>of</b> data <b>terminals</b> to LAN's by means of wireless links allows for flexible location <b>of</b> these <b>terminals,</b> thus eliminating the need for wiring when terminals are added, removed or relocated. Furthermore, the mobility offered by such systems is highly [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{motivated}} by the phenomenon <b>of</b> the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> lossless electrical networks, a class of behaviours known as J-lossless behaviours is introduced, where J is a symmetric two-variable polynomial matrix. It is shown that for certain values <b>of</b> J, <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> J-lossless behaviours leads to an oscillatory behaviour. Physically this translates {{to the fact that}} <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> two multi-port lossless electrical networks results in an autonomous lossless electrical network. Finally, the problem of decomposition of an oscillatory behaviour with a given characteristic polynomial as an <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> two single-input–single-output behaviours, such that one has a lossless positive real transfer function and the other has a lossless negative real transfer function is also considered. This problem can be viewed as an inverse problem to the one <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> J-lossless behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} called application concentrator, which enables <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks at an application level. Because of rapid development and deployment of advanced networking technologies, various social activities have been shifting onto a network, thus necessitating a technology for providing closed networks for real/virtual groups. In particular, <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks {{is the key}} for realizing those social activities on a network. In this paper, we therefore propose an application-level gateway called application concentrator, which enables <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks for various types of application protocols. In the application concentrator, <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> multiple closed networks is realized by multiplexing/demultiplexing the content of communications. For demonstrating effectiveness of the application concentrator, we design example implementations of the application concentrator for three typical applications such as Web, e-mail, and remote desktop...|$|R

40|$|In December 1998, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) {{began writing}} a {{standard}} for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> distributed resources with electric power systems. This standard will prescribe technical requirements for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> distributed resources that are connected to primary or secondary voltages in electric distribution systems. It is expected to {{play a significant role}} in facilitating a new, emerging market for small, distributed, primarily gas-fired electric generators, including new technologies such as fuel cells and micro-turbines. Once published, this new standard will be enforced for the <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> distributed wind power applications, as well. The co-authors of this paper have been active with this standard from the beginning, focusing on issues most likely to affect <b>interconnection</b> <b>of</b> wind power. This paper describes the standard-writing process and highlights technical issues critical to wind power, with the intent of soliciting feedback from an encouraging broader participation by the wind industry...|$|R
