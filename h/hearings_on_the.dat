5|$|After the book's publication, Szalavitz {{continued}} {{to write about}} the controversy surrounding the troubled-teen industry for Statistical Assessment Service, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reason, and The American Prospect. The House Committee on Education and Labor held additional <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter on April 24, 2008, again chaired by Representative George Miller.|$|E
5|$|Bordallo reintroduced it, as amended, at the {{beginning}} of the next Congress. It gained 30 cosponsors, bypassed the committee stage and was passed by voice vote in March 2009. Kerry reintroduced it in the Senate a month later; it eventually gained 33 cosponsors there. The Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard held <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill in June.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 Congressman Lamar S. Smith, {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, held <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> compensation issue. He questioned the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members. In November 1999 the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing payment of compensation {{to the families of}} the American Black Hawk victims.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, the Supreme Court {{continued}} <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PLI {{case about}} the statues.

5|$|In late 1994, {{following}} the 1994 Congressional elections which switched Congress from Democratic to Republican control, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania Republican William Clinger, launched {{an investigation into}} the White House Travel Office firings. In October 1995, the committee began <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter; Clinger soon accused the White House of withholding pertinent documents and sought subpoenas to compel witnesses to appear.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{has been}} outspoken {{in support of}} the city {{settling}} the Jon Burge torture case, rather than continuing to spend money in the litigation process. Preckwinkle has also been proactive in the effort to pursue compensation for victims of police brutality in the Jon Burge cases and sought <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial special prosecutor's report. She has been a critic of the decades-long delay in settling the case, and she was a proponent of the settlement.|$|E

5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{the adoptive}} couple petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States {{to review the}} case. In January 2013, the court granted certiorari and heard the case in April. In June, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision, holding that a non-custodial father did not have rights under the ICWA, and sent the case back to the South Carolina courts for further <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue. In July 2013, the South Carolina trial court {{finalized}} {{the adoption of the}} child to the adoptive couple, but this was prohibited in August by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The stay was lifted in September 2013, and the child was turned over to the Capobiancos the same month.|$|E
5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of the network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan {{to be involved in the}} wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E
5|$|Congress held <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{two bills}} {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's {{opposition}} to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E

5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Just {{four days}} later, Metro, D.C. and Prince George's County officials, and advocates {{of both the}} Branch Avenue and Rosecroft routes reached an {{agreement}} to begin construction of the Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia, pending resolution of the line's final route by December 6, 1984. The agreement called for construction of the Green Line to Waterfront Station in the summer, siting of the tunnel under the Anacostia River by June 28, and the holding of public <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remaining route between July 18 and August 3. The U.S. federal district court approved the agreement on March 7. Following the ruling, Metro {{announced that it would}} build the Anacostia Station on Howard Road between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and the Anacostia Freeway, as well as a new Metro station at the Washington Navy Yard, and would open the Green Line by 1990. Metro asked and won approval from the court to build the Navy Yard and Anacostia stations and the tunnel in June 1984.|$|E
5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held <b>hearings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E
