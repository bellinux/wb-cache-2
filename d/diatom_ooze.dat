"On the 11th of February, lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' E., and March 3, lat. 53° 55' S., long. 108° 35' E., the {{sounding}} instrument came up {{filled with a}} very fine cream-coloured paste, which scarcely effervesced with acid, and dried into a very light, impalpable, white powder. This, when examined under the microscope, was found to consist almost entirely of the frustules of Diatoms, some of them wonderfully perfect in {{all the details of}} their ornament, and many of them broken up. The species of Diatoms entering into this deposit have not yet been worked up, but they appear to be referable chiefly to the genera Fragillaria, Coscinodiscus, Choetoceros, Asteromphalus, and Dictyocha, with fragments of the separated rods of a singular silicious organism, with which we were unacquainted, and which made up {{a large proportion of the}} finer matter of this deposit. Mixed with the Diatoms there were a few small Globigerinoe, some of the tests and spicules of Radiolarians, and some sand particles; but these foreign bodies were in too small proportion to affect the formation as consisting practically of Diatoms alone. On the 4th of February, in lat. 52°, 29' S., long., 71° 36" [...] E., a little to the north of the Heard Islands, the tow-net, dragging a few fathoms below the surface, came up nearly filled with a pale yellow gelatinous mass. This was found to consist entirely of Diatoms of the same species as those found at the bottom. By far the most abundant was the little bundle of silicious rods, fastened together loosely at one end, separating from one another at the other end, and the whole bundle loosely twisted into a spindle. The rods are hollow, and contain the characteristic endochrome of the Diatomaceoe. Like the Globigerina ooze, then, which it succeeds to the southward in a band apparently of no great width, the materials of this silicious deposit are derived entirely from the surface and intermediate depths. It is somewhat singular that Diatoms did not appear to be in such large numbers on the surface over the <b>Diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> as they were a little further north. This may perhaps be accounted for by our not having struck their belt of depth with the tow-net; or it is possible that when we found it on the 11th of February the bottom deposit was really shifted a little to the south by the warm current, the excessively fine flocculent débris of the Diatoms taking a certain time to sink. The belt of <b>Diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> is certainly a little further to the southward in long. 83° E., in the path of the reflux of the Agulhas current, than in long. 108° E.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} diatoms and other silica-utilizing organisms are found, as opal sediments within pelagic deep-sea deposits. Pelagic sediments, {{containing}} significant quantities of siliceous biogenic remains, are {{commonly referred to}} as siliceous ooze. Siliceous ooze are particularly abundant in the modern ocean at high latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres. A striking feature of siliceous ooze distribution is a ca. 200 km wide belt stretching across the Southern Ocean. Some equatorial regions of upwelling, where nutrients are abundant and productivity is high, are also characterized by local siliceous ooze. Siliceous oozes are composed primarily of the remains of diatoms and radiolarians, but may also include other siliceous organisms, such as silicoflagellates and sponge spicules. <b>Diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> occurs mainly in high-latitude areas and along some continental margins, whereas radiolarian ooze are more characteristic of equatorial areas. Siliceous ooze are modified and transformed during burial into bedded cherts.|$|E

Here we document a new occurrence of Thalassionema-Thalassiothrix ooze in Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene sediment beneath the frontal boundary of the subarctic North Pacific. The ooze is a 6 m interval of siliceous sediment at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites 885 / 886 that was rapidly deposited between approximately 5. 0 and 5. 9 Ma. Bulk sediment in this interval may contain greater than 85 % pennate diatom tests. There are also abundant laminae and pockets that are composed entirely of Thalassionema and Thalassiothrix diatoms. The presence of a rapidly deposited ooze dominated by pennate diatoms indicates unusual past conditions in the overlying surface waters. Time coincident deposition of such oozes at two distinct frontal boundary locations of the Pacific suggests that the unusual surface water conditions were causally linked to large-scale oceanographic change. This same oceanographic change most likely involved (1) addition of nutrients to the ocean, or (2) redistribution of nutrients within the ocean.

The individual centimetre-scale varves form couplets, comprising diatom ooze/diatomaceous mud deposited during spring to autumn and silty clay deposited during winter. Each individual varve may contain up to 19 laminae, recording sub-seasonal to seasonal-scale processes. These intra-annual laminae contain a range of components, including pelagic faecal pellets and aggregates of diatomaceous material. The combination of these individual components in varying proportions with a heterogeneous sediment, leads {{to a range of}} laminae fabrics. These include intact monospecific Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira pacifica <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> and highly fragmented, aggregate- and faecal pellet-dominated <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> which are typically Chaetoceros spp. -dominated. Additional laminae fabrics include diatomaceous mud, stringer-type diatomaceous mud which contains discrete diatom aggregates, homogeneous and pelleted silty clay. The varved diatom succession typically commences in early spring with Thalassiosira spp. /Chaetoceros spp., followed by Chaetoceros spp. in late spring. During late spring/early summer blooms of S. costatum may be recorded, and summer to autumn production is characterised by one to several Chaetoceros spp. -dominated blooms. Inter-annual variability in diatom flux typically comprises the presence/absence of Thalassiosira spp. and S. costatum. In addition, resting spores of Chaetoceros spp., Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii and Leptocylindricus danicus are intermittently recorded. There is a major change in varve thickness from thinner varves prior to approximately 2100 yr BP to thicker varves after this date, which is attributed to increased terrigenous input throughout the varve.

40|$|Abstract: Scanning {{electron}} microscope (SEM) -based {{analyses of the}} laminated <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> encountered during Leg 138 reveal three major laminae types. The first lamina type is composed of multiple layers of approximately 20 #m thick diatom mats, which form laminae dominated by assemblages of the pennate diatom, Thalassiothrix longissima. More than one variety/subspecies of T. longissima occurs within these laminae (referred to as the T. longissima Group). The second lamina type is composed of a mixed-assemblage of several species of diatoms (centric and pennate varieties), calcareous nannofossils, and subordinate quantities of radiolarians, ilicoflagellates and foraminifera. The third lamina type is dominated by an assemblage ofnannofossils and minor amounts of those fossil components mentioned above. This last form of lamination is compositionally similar to the background sediment type, foraminifer-nannofossil ooze (F-NO).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of early diagenetic quartz formation under low-temperature conditions are still poorly understood. In {{this study we}} investigated lithified cherts consisting of microcrystalline quartz recovered near {{the base of a}} 420 m thick Miocene–Holocene sequence of nannofossil and <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> at a drill site in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1226). Precipitation seems still ongoing based on a sharp depletion in dissolved silica at the depth of the cherts. Also, palaeo-temperatures reconstructed from δ 18 O values in the cherts are in the range of adjacent porewater temperatures. Opal-A dissolution appears to control silica concentration throughout the sequence, while the solution remains oversaturated with respect to quartz. However, at the depth of the sharp depletion in dissolved silica, quartz is still saturated while the more soluble silica phases are strongly undersaturated. Hence, precipitation of quartz was initiated by an auxiliary process. A process, previously observed to assist in the nucleation of quartz is the adsorption of silica on freshly precipitated iron oxides. Indeed, a deep iron oxidation front is present at 400 m below seafloor, which is caused by upward diffusing nitrate from an oxic seawater aquifer in the underlying oceanic crust. Sequential iron extraction showed a higher content of the adsorbed iron hydroxide fraction in the chert than in the adjacent nannofossil and <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze.</b> X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy revealed that iron in the cherts predominantly occurs in illite and amorphous iron oxide, whereas iron in the nannofossil and <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> occurs mainly in smectite.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the Pliocene and Quaternary basin fill in the Gulf of California is composed of relatively fine-grained mud turbidites which have sedimentary structures that are more subtle than those of sandy turbidites in flysch deposits. Basal contacts are sharp, sometimes accompanied by thin, laminated, muddy sands; the silty body commonly appears massive, and the tops consist of a thin zone with faint burrow traces. The composition, physical properties, tex-tures, and sorting of biogenic components document graded intervals. The composition of these beds reflects source areas ranging from thick, hemipelagic <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> blankets to muddy delta foreslopes. In the Guaymas Basin, these sources lead to two end member types: I, Pale olive to moderate olive brown, nannofossil-bearing <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> to mud, cm-to-decimeter thick; and II, dark to medium olive gray to medium gray, terrigenous, silt-rich muds, from decimeters to over 12 meters thick, with low percentages of biogenic components. Type I is probably redeposited from intrabasinal bathyal slope regions, whereas Type II represents more distal transport from outer, muddy deltaic slopes. The tops of some Type I beds are pure <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> layers, the result of hydraulic sorting. In core sections recovered undisturbed by the hydraulic piston corer, mass physical property gradients for turbidites (water content, wet-bulk density, porosity, shear strength, and shrinkage) are clearly distinguished from the host sediment by their higher bulk densities and lower porosities. Basal parts of turbidites have the lowest porosities but are highly permeable and so function as conduits for pore fluids and are sites for early silica and carbonate diagenesis. This type of mud turbidite facies, commonly with intercalated mud flows, is found in the internal tectonic zones of many orogenes...|$|E

The methodology combines δ 18 O in benthic foraminifera, Uvigerina spp. abundance, Sibio, TOC, lithic fraction and Fe-XRF composition. Throughout the studied period, can be clearly distinguished the glacial periods prior to 1. 85 Ma, dominated by low Fe and sparse lithogenic grains, poorly sorted and coarser, which could reflect the dominance of stronger local trade winds with a northward ITCZ position. Surprisingly, high TOC and Si values also occurred during these low-Fe periods, albeit Uvigerina spp. did not benefit from them, indicating that this diatom productivity was not dust stimulated. These intervals correspond to Laminated <b>Diatom</b> <b>Oozes</b> (LDO), suggesting an enhanced upwelling system of rich-silica waters probably from the Southern Ocean and would have promoted a very efficient OM transport towards the deep sea, changing drastically the ecosystem.

This study allowed to reconstruct principle features of paleoceanographic evolution. In the course of penultimate and last continental glaciations (isotope stages 6 and 4 - 2) and during the later period of the last interglacial (substages 5. d- 5. a) the following conditions were characteristic of this area: low temperatures of surface water, terrigenous sediment accumulation including coarse grained ice-rafted material, minimum bioproductivity and microfossil content in sediments, low sea level, reduced water exchange with the ocean, low position of old deep Pacific water. During the interglacial optimum (substage 5. e), {{as well as in}} the last deglaciation and Holocene (stage 1) water temperature and bioproductivity increased, sea level rose, and active surface water exchange between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan took place.

40|$|Several widely correlatable {{intervals}} of laminated Thalassiothrix diatom mat deposits occur in Neogene sediments {{recovered from the}} eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The presence of laminated sediments in extensive areas of the deep open ocean floor raises fundamental questions concerning the cause of preservation of the laminations {{and the nature of}} the benthic environment during episodes of mat deposition. Traditional explanations for the preservation of laminations have centered on restriction of dissolved oxygen. Studies of benthic foraminifers through the laminated intervals show no evidence for an increase in absolute or relative abundance of species characteristic of a low oxygen environment, but rather a decrease in relative abundance of infaunal forms attesting to the impenetrability of the diatom meshwork formed by the interlocking Thalassiothrix frustules. These results support evidence from coring of the high tensile strength of the Thalassiothrix laminations suggesting that the diatom meshwork was of sufficient tensile strength and impenetrability to suppress infaunal benthic activity. Comparison of the relative abundances of foraminifers in the enclosing ôbackgroundö sediment of foraminifer nannofossil ooze and the laminated <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> shows that some epifaunal species (e. g., Cibicides spp.) increase in relative abundance within the laminated sediment, whereas others (e. g., Epistominella exigua) show a marked decrease in relative abundance.

CSF-A is the depth (m) drilled from the sea floor regardless of potential gaps and overlaps between cores. Because more than one hole was drilled at each site during Exp. 346, the core gaps recognized at one hole were fulfilled with the corresponding interval found at an adjacent hole, and a composite depth scale (CCSF-A) was defined by adjusting the original drilled depth (CSF-A) for each hole. Splicing continuous intervals from the multi-hole sequences, a single continuous sediment sequence was established, the depth scale of which was called CCSF-D.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the history of}} marine laminated sediment research and then focuses {{on the nature of}} diatom records from Quaternary laminated marine sediments. Laminated marine <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> accumulates under conditions of varying supply of different sedimentary components such as diatom frustules and terrigenous grains, in areas where the bottom water dissolved oxygen concentrations are almost depleted and preclude bioturbation. This facilitates the preservation of the seasonal succession of surface water diatom blooms, as promoted by processes such as coastal upwelling and water column stratification and subsequent collapse. These seasonally laminated sediments, or marine varves, record information about oceanographic and climatic processes over subannual to millennial timescales, from locations such as semi-enclosed seas (e. g., Gulf of California, NW Mexico), silled basins (e. g., Santa Barbara Basin, California margin and Iceberg Alley, MacRobertson Shelf, Antarctica), and the open continental margin (e. g., Peru margin).

Sediment composition from Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1240 and 1238 is used to reconstruct past changes in the atmosphere-ocean system. Particularly remarkable is the presence of laminated <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> (LDOs) during glacial periods between 1. 85 and 2. 25 ?Ma coinciding with high fluxes of opal and total organic carbon. Relatively low lithic particles (coarse and poorly sorted) and iron fluxes during these glacial periods indicate that the increased diatom productivity did not result from dust-stimulated fertilization events. We argue that glacial fertilization occurred through the advection of nutrient-rich waters from the Southern Ocean. In contrast, glacial periods after 1. 85 ?Ma are characterized by enhanced dust transport of finer lithic particles acting as a new source of nutrients in the EEP. The benthic ecosystem shows dissimilar responses to the high productivity recorded during glacial periods before and after 1. 85 ?Ma, which suggests that the transport processes delivering organic matter to the deep sea also changed. Different depositional processes are interpreted {{to be the result of}} two distinct glacial positions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Before 1. 85 ?Ma, the ITCZ was above the equator, with weak local winds and enhanced wet deposition of dust. After 1. 85 ?Ma, the glacial ITCZ was displaced northward, thus bringing stronger winds and stimulating upwelling in the EEP. The glacial period at 1. 65 ?Ma with the most intense LDOs supports a rapid southward migration of the ITCZ comparable to those glacial periods before 1. 85 ?Ma...|$|R

A close inspection of lithology reveals a clear change in lithology from a diatom nannofossil ooze to a nannofossil <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> at 6. 6 Ma. This transition is immediately followed by the occurrence of laminated <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> (LDO). Diatom absolute abundance data reveals three levels of productivity associated with pre-transitional, post-transitional, and LDO formational sediments. An increase in the absolute abundance of Thalassionema nitzschioides was the major contributor to the formation of post-transitional, and LDO sediments. The known ecological preferences of this species indicate an overall increase in nutrient availability followed by sporadic changes in nutrient availability. These changes in nutrient availability could be associated with the establishment, or increase in strength, of an upwelling cell and/or the increase in nutrients made available via upwelling due to a shoaling of the thermocline...|$|E

Diatom content {{increases}} northwards, and at most sites diatom-rich and diatom-poor sediments alternate downcore {{on a scale}} of metres. A local stratigraphy is based on relative abundance of six prominent diatom taxa:Eucampia antarctica, Rhizosolenia spp.,Thalassiosira spp.,Chaetoceros spores,Nitzschia kerguelensis and otherNitzschia species and one silicoflagellate species (Distephanus speculum). These stratigraphic units defined using diatoms are correlated with radiolarian abundance stratigraphy (Cycladophora davisiana) and with palaeomagnetic stratigraphy. Information from modern environments (phytoplankton and sediment trap studies) indicates that changes in diatom species composition are related to N-S movement of the winter ice edge and of the Antarctic Convergence...|$|E

This species is recorded between 9.57 and 7.41  Ma at Site U 1425, {{with a mean}} relative abundance of 20.0 % (SD[*]=[*] 12.7; N[*]=[*] 55) (Fig.  4 and Additional file  1). The relative abundance of C. nakasekoi fluctuates between high (>[*] 30 %) and low relative abundances (<[*] 10 %) (Fig.  4). Interestingly, the sediments collected at Site U 1425 spanning the time interval between 9.57 and 7.41  Ma correspond to lithological subunit IIIA, composed of alternating dark gray <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> and heavily bioturbated clayey diatomaceous ooze (Tada et al. 2015 a).|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} analyses {{have been}} carried out on 128 samples of Miocene to Quaternary sediments from ODP Sites 794, 795 and 797. Some clay fractions of samples from Site 797 have also been studied for rare earth elements and by Nd isotopic analyses. These three sites display similar lithological and clay assemblages (with dominant chlorite, illite and smectite) showing that the sedimentation was homogeneous throughout the whole Japan Sea Basin. Three mineralogical zones are recognized. The first zone (Lower Miocene sandy clay of Sites 794 and 797) is mainly composed of chlorite resulting from hydrothermal transformation of arc-derived smectite, due to sill injections during the initial oceanic spreading stage. The second zone (Lower Miocene to Lower Pliocene siliceous claystone and diatomaceous silty clay) is dominated by arc-derived smectite; the abundance of this mineral decreases upwards while illite and chlorite increase. This trend reflects a change of detrital source, from an eastern arc-derived source (epsilon -Nd**t>- 3. 3); variable LREE enrichment) to a western continental crust source (epsilon-Nd**t<- 9. 4; shale-like REE patterns); climatic modifications in the current dynamics are proposed as a cause for this change. The third zone (Upper Pliocene to Recent silty clay with minor <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes)</b> is characterized at Site 797 by increasing amounts of illite and chlorite. This reflects a more and more important western supply which is assumed to be related to tectonic rejuvenations of the Asian margin or climatic modifications affecting the alteration conditions or the current dynamics. At Sites 794 and 795, the more or less sharp supply of chlorite seems to be driven by the incipient subduction zone on the eastern margin of the Japan Sea...|$|R

Analysis of the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) inclination record indicates a normal magnetic polarity for the uppermost 34 m of the sequence and a distinctive abrupt polarity change {{at the bottom of the}} core. This polarity change, which spans a 27 cm thick stratigraphic interval, represents a detailed record of the Matuyama–Brunhes (M–B) transition and it is preceded by a sharp oscillation in paleomagnetic directions that may correlate to the M–B precursor event. Paleomagnetic measurements enable reconstruction of geomagnetic relative paleointensity (RPI) variations, and a highresolution age model was established by correlating the CADO RPI curve to the available global reference RPI stack, indicating that the studied sequence reaches back to ca. 800 ka with an average sedimentation rate of 4. 4 cm/ka. Orbital periodicities (100 ka and 41 ka) were found in the ChRM inclination record, and a significant coherence of ChRM inclination and RPI record around 100 ka suggests that long-term geomagnetic secular variation in inclination is controlled by changes in the relative strength of the geocentric axial dipole and persistent non-dipole components. Moreover, even if the relatively homogeneous rock magnetic parameters and lithofacies throughout the recovered sequence indicates a substantial stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet during the middle and late Pleistocene, influence of the 100 ka and 41 ka orbital periodicities has been detected in some rock magnetic parameters, indicating subtle variations in the concentration and grain-size of the magnetic minerals linked to orbital forcing of the global climate...|$|R
40|$|The sediments {{recovered}} at ODP Sites 745 and 746 in the Australian-Antarctic Basin {{are characterized}} by cyclic facies changes between clayey <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> and diatomaceous clays {{ranging in age from}} late Miocene (about 10 Ma) to Quaternary. The gravel and terrigenous sand content of the sediments is used as an indicator of the intensity of ice rafting through time. Maxima are recorded at 8. 7 - 7. 9, 6. 6 - 6. 0, 5. 0 - 4. 4, and 4. 0 - 3. 2 Ma. The maxima in more recent times are much less pronounced and occur at 2. 4 - 1. 6 and 1. 4 - 1. 0 Ma. All sand- and gravel-sized terrigenous sediment particles are of gneissic or granitic origin and originated from the East Antarctic continent. The maxima of ice rafting recorded at Sites 745 and 746 do not appear to represent local phenomena. Rather they document major advances and decays of the Antarctic ice shelves and glaciers and therefore represent events of great importance for the reconstruction of the paleoceanography of the Southern Ocean and the glacial history of Antarctica. In general, ice rafting was pronounced in the late Miocene and early Pliocene epochs, which {{are characterized by}} repeated ice advances and retreats. Ice rafting was less intensive during the late Pliocene to Quaternary time period, when ice shelves remained relative stable. The clay minerals indicate the fluctuating influence of different source areas on the delivery of fine-grained terrigenous sediment components. Part of this material may have been delivered from the Permian Amery Formation or from equivalents of this formation...|$|R

Spectral analysis was performed on time series of opal content, d 13 Corg, Ti content, and Ba content. Strong decadal to century-scale variability is present in all proxies. Opal and Ti-time series show strong variance at periods of 11, 22 and 110 -years, which are suggestive of solar forcing. Ba-time series exhibits strong variance at a period of 3 - 3. 6 -yr, consistent with possible El Niño-Southern-Oscillation (ENSO) forcing...|$|E
30|$|The {{criteria}} for defining lithological units were {{basically the same}} for ODP leg 127 / 128 and IODP expedition 346. According to Tada and Iijima (1992), unit 1 in ODP leg 127 / 128 sediments is characterized by decimeter- to meter-scale alternations of dark and light silty clay to clay and is divided into subunits 1 A and 1 B {{on the basis of}} the frequency of dark layers and the intensity of bioturbation. Unit 2 is composed of clayey <b>diatom</b> <b>ooze</b> and diatomaceous clay that is heavily bioturbated and mottled, with alternating dark and light layers and a general darkening of sediments near its base. This unit is not subdivided. Unit 3 is characterized by decimeter- to meter-scale alternating light and dark layers, the latter being faintly laminated, and by a relatively high organic carbon content.|$|E

Extant playa lakes provide vital habitat for numerous endemic species, whereas sediments from these deposystems may record signals of climate change or develop natural resources over geological time.

40|$|On Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 138, {{standard}} shipboard {{procedures were}} modified {{to allow for}} the real-time monitoring of several laboratory core-scanning systems that provide centimeter-scale measurements of saturated bulk density, magnetic susceptibility and digital color reflectance. These continuous, high-resolution data sets were used to ensure the proper offset of multiple holes and to splice together complete sedimentary sections. Typically, the spliced, continuous sediment sections were found to be about 10 % longer than the section drilled, as measured by the length of the drill string. While the source of this elongation is not yet fully understood, it must be compensated for in order to property determine sediment fluxes and mass accumulation rates. Downhole logging, in conjunction with inverse correlation techniques provided a means to determine where the distortion occurred and to correct back to true in situ depths. Downhole logging also provides a means, through the generation of synthetic seismograms, of precisely relating the paleoceanographic events found in the core record to the high-resolution seismic record. Once correlated to the seismic record, the spatial and temporal extent of paleoceanographic events can be traced well beyond the borehole. Most seismic events in the equatorial Pacific are related to rapid changes in carbonate content that, in turn, are related to both productivity events (often expressed as monospecific laminated <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes)</b> and times of enhanced dissolution. While many of these events may have oceanwide extent, others, like the absence of carbonate in the late-Miocene to Recent in the Guatemala Basin {{have been shown to be}} regional and confined to only the deeper portions of the Guatemala Basin. As we identify and trace specific paleoceanographic events in the seismic record, we can begin to explore the response of the ocean through gradients of latitude, productivity, and depth...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of both culture and {{sediment}} core studies, the ratio of germanium (Ge) to silicon (Si) in diatom shells has been proposed {{as a proxy for}} monitoring whole-ocean changes in seawater Ge/Si, a ratio affected by changes in continental weathering. However, because of the difficulties of extracting and cleaning diatom frustules from deep-sea sediments, only samples from highly pure <b>diatom</b> <b>oozes</b> in the Antarctic region have been previously analyzed. Here we present data on diatom Ge/Si ratios, (Ge/Si) opal, for the time interval between 3. 1 and 1. 9 Ma from a mid-latitude, coastal upwelling area where significant terrigenous sediment input complicated the sample processing and analyses. In general, our (Ge/Si) opal values show the same decreasing trend after 2. 6 Ma than previously measured in Antarctic sediments (Shemesh et al., 1989. Paleoceanography 4, 221 - 231), but with a noisier background that may reflect the local imprint of proximal continental input superimposed upon global changes in the ocean reservoir. The time of initiation of large-scale North Hemisphere glaciation at ~ 2. 6 Ma is characterized by a declining pattern of diatom Ge/Si ratios, which could have resulted from a global increase in the input of riverine Si due to enhanced silica weathering and/or equatorward (northward) intrusions of subantarctic waters enriched in silica. High (Ge/Si) opal ratios are associated with high opal contents from the same sediment samples and with warm climate as indicated by depleted benthic foraminiferal d 18 O values from the North and Equatorial Atlantic. Cold periods signified by enriched benthic d 18 O values, on the contrary, are associated with lower (Ge/Si) opal ratios. We interpret diatom Ge/Si values to reflect the prevailing weathering state on the continents, with greater chemical weathering during warm and wet periods of the Pliocene and less during cooler and drier intervals...|$|R
