40|$|Background: The paper {{analyzes}} a {{significance of}} <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> in contemporary national economies of select European countries (10) {{from the point}} of view of employment, gross value-added creation, supply chain establishment, and international expansion. A cause for the paper is a dissatisfactory level of economic development of certain transitional countries on one side and the high <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> shares (especially in the number of employees and in the GDP) on the other side. 	Methods: Distributive trade&# 39;s significance for a country is analyzed entirely and segmental. The data collected by Eurostat and Deloitte are analyzed and depicted graphically via usual statistical methods (relative numbers, indices and shares, tabulation and graphical depictions). 	Results: The results of the research conducted should confirm a thesis on distributive trade&# 39;s significance based on its shares in the economic structure; however, as an integrator in the value-creating chains, <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> has different significance for certain national economies, for the large-sized companies and groups (especially the retailing ones) are also expanded internationally, along with their supply chains. 	Conclusions: <b>Distributive</b> <b>trade</b> does not have an equal significance for the economic development in all countries. Equally, all the divisions within <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> do not have equal significance for the overall country&# 39;s economy, as well as for a launch of its economic development. Nevertheless, it should be necessary to analyze concentration and internationalization in detail for the sake of an evaluation of distributive trade&# 39;s significance as an integrator in value-creating chains. In that respect, some transitional countries observed do lag behind...|$|R

40|$|At {{a time of}} a {{consolidation}} and {{an increasing}} internationalisation of the <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> sector, three major phenomena have been simultaneously altering the structure of euro area trade {{for several years now}} : the success of hard discounters, the emergence of private-label products, and the growth in online shopping. All three tend to exert downward pressure on price levels. Whereas the first two factors are particularly pronounced in Belgium, online shopping is less of a factor. There have been no significant competition anomalies uncovered in the sector in Belgium. Retailers are not particularly concentrated at either the local or national level. And yet, despite improvements in recent years, Belgian regulation of the sector remains very invasive and could discourage the opening of new points of sale. Given the impact of the <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> sector’s structural characteristics on price-setting behaviour, and the differences in price levels within each country and between euro area countries, structural reforms are needed to enhance competition and take better advantage of the common market. However, even though harmonising regulations and eliminating implicit barriers should help lessen differences within the euro area, some differences are unavoidable due to consumer preferences and cultural differences from one country to the next, and even regionally. retail, regulation, competition, market structure, pricing...|$|R

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{nature of}} forecast optimization makes the rational expectations hypothesis (REH) {{a framework that}} is theoretically consistent with the expectations formation produced by economic agents under well-defined assumptions of unbiased forecasts and efficient utilization of available information. Most of the recent literature on REH testing has favored a direct procedure based on survey data to validate the theoretical soundness of REH. However, the ability of survey materials to reflect the economic agent’s true expectations remains unconvincing, as previous empirical studies on survey-based expectations have offered mixed evidence of forecast rationality. The present study involved an attempt to evaluate the forecast rationality of survey materials from the Malaysian perspective, as empirical evidence from the view of a developing nation is clearly limited. An expectational series on gross revenue and capital expenditure, spanning 1978 through 2007, was subjected to tests of unbiasedness, non-serial correlation, and efficiency to observe whether the business operational forecasts contributed by the <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> sector in Malaysia can be accepted as rational forecasts of the actual realized values. We found that both operational variables are being irrationally constructed, suggesting that forecasters in the <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> sector are not rational when they formulate business expectations. Thus, business firms in the examined sector are encouraged to incorporate more relevant information into their business operational forecasts to facilitate more accurate and realistic business forecasting. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss {{complexity}} assessment in supply chains, to describe a methodology for measuring supply chain complexity in <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> and to illustrate the measurement of supply chain complexity and mechanisms to cope with supply chain complexity in <b>distributive</b> <b>trade.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses literature on measuring supply chain complexity and uses five case studies among wholesale companies to illustrate a methodology to measure supply chain complexity and to discuss strategies to cope with supply chain complexity. Findings: The study confirms the multifaceted nature of supply chain complexity. The paper identifies eight drivers of supply chain complexity and uses these to illustrate the measurement of supply chain complexity in a wholesale environment. The paper identifies six strategies used by wholesalers for coping with supply chain complexity and identifies interrelations between supply chain complexity drivers and these strategies. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on case studies in wholesale companies; future research may include survey research, including other sectors to analyze industry differences but may also focus on other parts of the supply chain. Practical implications: The study provides insights into how to identify and measure complexity in a supply chain and what can be done to manage supply chain complexity. Originality/value: The measurement approach is new to supply chain management and is based on multiple drivers of supply chain complexity. The research is focused on wholesalers, which is a segment that has received limited academic attention in supply chain research to date. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|The article aims at {{researching and}} {{presenting}} structural changes and global trends in <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> of European Union, resulted from liberalization of economic activities within the EU. During the last decades, EU trade went through deep transformation and structural changes. Traditional <b>distributive</b> <b>trade</b> {{has been replaced}} by organized and concentrated distribution. Even though, there are many developing trends which unify the EU trade, still there are some differences specific for particular countries. Level of development, structure of trade network, as well as structure of retail forms, differ from one country to another. Developing patterns of retail forms differ from one country to another. For instance, hypermarkets have reached mature stage in France, Germany and Belgium, just have started developing in Italy and are in developing stage in Spain. “Hard” discount shops are already one mature concept in Germany and Netherlands, while in France, they have just started developing. Regardless of differences between particular national and regional markets within EU, almost all countries participate in increased trend of internationalization, concentration and dislocation of traditional retail towards modern sale forms, which have more subsidiaries. However, degree of concentration in some countries is still quite different. While just a few companies control the markets in Scandinavia, France, Great Britain and Germany; in Italy there is not a company with similar comparable size or market strength. Trend of business globalization have emphasized the area of international retail as an important topic.

40|$|The <b>distributive</b> <b>trades</b> sector, {{which is}} {{primarily}} {{accounted for by}} wholesale and retail trade, is not only economically important in its own right, but also relevant to monetary policy. Ultimately, it is retailers who set the actual prices of most consumer goods. They are the main interface between producers of consumer goods and consumers, with around half of private consumption accounted for by retail trade. The “value added” of this intermediation service can be substantial, as this accounts for, on average, about 25 % of consumer prices. The purpose of this report is to analyse the structural features of the <b>distributive</b> <b>trades</b> sector and the developments within it, {{as well as how}} these may influence prices and price dynamics. This report contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the impact of the structural features of the <b>distributive</b> <b>trades</b> sector on prices and price-setting behaviour, thereby improving on previous research in this area.
