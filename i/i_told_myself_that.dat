25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{used to be}} a real leftist. I {{remember}} Arik Sharon [...] coming here, to my house, a {{few months}} before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! I {{never did}} so till <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that,</b> if possible, {{you should be}} my own. Do you {{remember}} when you poked the fire for me at Hendon Hall?" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the days}} {{went by and}} nothing unusual happened, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> joyfully, <b>that</b> {{experience}} was working the cure. I believed that soon a womanly scorn would heal effectually the wound which Sidney Sanderson had inflicted.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my lord. This is {{a matter}} in which I could obey no friend, no father. I have had to ask <b>myself,</b> and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not dare to love above my station in life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it was. When I was {{in church}} that morning <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I never, never, could be happy unless {{you came to}} me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{sent him}} reeling {{across the room}} till he fell in the corner. Then I walked out, closing the sitting-room door behind me,--out into the {{corridor}} {{and up the stairs}} into my own room. Then I locked and bolted my own door and looked at my watch. It was a quarter to three. I took a Bradshaw from my bookcase, packed a few clothes myself, set an alarm clock for seven o'clock in the morning, and turned into bed. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I would not think. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> there was no such person in the world as Felicia, that she had never lived, that she was only part of this nightmare from which I was freeing myself! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I would go to sleep, and I stayed awake until daylight. All the time there was only one thought in my brain! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{image of}} Edith Croyden filled my mind. In vain <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> {{she was a}} {{stranger}} to me: that--beyond her longitude--I knew nothing of her. In some strange way this girl had seized hold of me and dominated my senses.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> then <b>that</b> my fancy had vested {{her tone}} and look with a kindliness {{far beyond that}} which they contained, and as I thought of how I had deemed {{impatient}} the little gesture wherewith she had greeted Geneviève's interruption I laughed again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the courage?" [...] {{repeated}} Allan. He {{paused a}} moment. [...] "Oh, I know!" [...] he resumed, putting his hand gayly on Midwinter's shoulder. [...] "You're still {{shy of the}} Milroys. What nonsense, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> your peace was made at the cottage!" ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{scarcely}} stirred {{for nearly}} an hour, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> wearily, <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> too, might perhaps catch a little rest. The day had been a perpetual strain. I was not expecting or intending to sleep soundly, but I felt a merciful relief in lying quietly {{by the side of}} Marjorie.|$|R
60|$|This {{is exactly}} what {{happened}} after I regained the house. I went upstairs for a few minutes to arrange my hair and bathe my eyes. Then I walked straight down to the drawing-room, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I was prepared for anything that might take place.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{that moment}} Kearny tumbled from the steamer's side into the river. He could not swim, so the crew threw him a rope and drew him back aboard. I {{caught his eye}} and his look of pathetic but still bright and undaunted {{consciousness}} of his guilty luck. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> although {{he might be a}} man to shun, he was also one to be admired.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said, 'yes. While I {{have you}} with me, and baby, I can bear anything. While you will tell me {{everything}} that happens, I will bear everything. And, John, when you were out just now, and when I am alone and trying to pray, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I {{ought not to be}} unhappy; for I would sooner have you and baby and all these troubles, than be back at Chesterton--without you.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "After {{working at}} it for five years, <b>I</b> finally <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> unless {{something}} amazing happened at the NEMO festival in Boston, I was basically quitting. As {{with the rest of}} my life, it all came down to the wire. We played that show, and a month later we were receiving major airplay." [...] - Sahaj ...|$|R
60|$|Over {{and over}} again <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> bitterly, <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> had been near enough to the vessel which bore Bertha Nugent to {{converse}} with Mary Phillips {{without the aid of}} a speaking-trumpet, I should have tried to reach that vessel, no matter what the danger or the difficulties. I should have launched a raft--I should have tried to swim--I should have done something.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of it," [...] said Isabel,--"thought of it very often, till <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> conduct such as that would be inexpressibly base. What! to eat his bread after refusing him mine when it was {{believed}} to be so plentiful! I certainly have not face enough to do that,--neither face nor courage for that. There are ignoble things which require audacity altogether beyond my reach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had meant}} {{to ask you to}} be my wife; simply that. But you shall not have the pain of making me a {{positive}} refusal. As I rode here to-day I thought of it. During my frequent rides of late I have thought of little else. But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I had no right to do it. I have not even a house in which it would be fit that you should live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not. I {{have tried}} myself, and now I {{think that it}} would not hurt me. There was a time in which I owned to myself that it would be very bitter, and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> I hoped,--that I hoped that you would wait. But now, I have {{acknowledged}} to myself the vanity and selfishness of such a wish. If I really love you am I not bound to want what may be best for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wept {{the first}} six months almost without ceasing, and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if I would be strong and resist I must weep no more. If a bird in a cage once takes to pining he is sure not to live long. There are few of us here the news of whose death would not give {{pleasure}} to those who shut us up, and I for one resolved that I would live in spite of all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{was on the}} Blue Devils' 2014-15 NCAA Championship team. After Rasheed Sulaimon was dismissed, Jones {{was moved}} into the {{starting}} lineup. “I’ve definitely tried to grasp it and take ahold of it,” Jones said.. “Obviously we didn’t want Rasheed to leave, {{but at the same}} time, personally, I was ecstatic about it. <b>I</b> just <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> it was my moment now, and I had to just take advantage of it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Persuasion {{is not at}} command; but pardon me, if I cannot even {{endeavour}} {{to persuade}} him. <b>I</b> have <b>myself</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> Miss Thorpe is engaged. He knows what he is about, and must be his own master." ...|$|R
2500|$|Luque {{was fined}} {{after a game}} against Feyenoord in November 2007 for a half-time altercation in the {{changing}} rooms with teammate Luis Suárez, which caused manager Adrie Koster to substitute them both before the second half. It was reported in July 2008 that the former had no future at Ajax; technical director Danny Blind told Sportweek: [...] "Ajax has told Luque {{that he has to}} leave the club. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Albert <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> we don't want to go on with him and if I've told it to him, I really don't know who else I should inform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear friend," [...] he was saying, [...] "forgive me if I startled you. Forgive me if I thrust {{myself in}} here without leave, {{at such a}} time, in such a manner. But... you see how it is with me. I am a fugitive. In {{the course of my}} distracted flight, not knowing which way to turn for safety, I thought of you. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if I could but safely reach your house, I might find sanctuary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I went on {{asking myself}} questions. And is it {{possible}} that I, who by all his friends will be regarded as a nobody, who am an American,--with merely human workaday blood in my veins,--that such a one as I should become his wife? Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> it was not possible. It was not in accordance with the fitness of things. All the dukes in England would rise up against it, and especially that duke whose good-will would be imperative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They laid {{a charge}} upon me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} sacred charge. Listen, my love--listen, and hate me! I have been to detectives. I paid them money to hunt you down; I have done this, I who love you. No, don't draw your arms away. I have done this. It was before I knew. Oh, I have suffered! God! how I have suffered! It has been an agony to me. You will forgive me! I will not let you go unless you forgive me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} I say. I have no one. It is no use asking questions,--not now, {{at such a}} time as this. And I did not mean to complain. Complaining is weak and foolish. <b>I</b> have often <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could bear anything, and so I will. When I can bring myself to think of what I have lost in my father I shall be better, even though I shall be more sorrowful. As it is, I hate myself for being so selfish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She has come. I {{have known}} she would, since that evening I saw her [...] on the mountain; {{and last night}} she came, and we have sat and looked [...] into each other's eyes. You will say, of course, that I am mad--that [...] I have not {{recovered}} from my fever--that I have been working too [...] hard--that I have heard a foolish tale, {{and that it has}} filled my [...] overstrung brain with foolish fancies: <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> all <b>that.</b> [...] But the thing came, nevertheless--a creature of flesh and blood? a [...] creature of air? a creature of my own imagination?--what matter? it [...] was real to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} to say to him,--nothing; not a word. He knows what he has to expect from me, for <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> him. He is acting with his eyes open, and so am I. If he marries Miss Crawley, he must live on his own means. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>myself</b> so plainly, <b>that</b> he can want no further intimation." [...] Then Mrs. Grantly knew that she was absolved from the burden of yesterday's message, and she plumed herself on the {{prudence}} of her conduct. On the same morning the archdeacon wrote the following note:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not I,’ {{returned}} Otto, ‘I never changed. Do you remember, Seraphina, {{on our way}} home, {{when you}} saw the roses in the lane, and I got out and plucked them? It was a narrow lane between great trees; the sunset at the end was all gold, and the rooks were flying overhead. There were nine, nine red roses; you gave me a kiss for each, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> every rose and every kiss should stand for a year of love. Well, in eighteen months there was an end. But do you fancy, Seraphina, that my heart has altered?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you told}} me about your gallivanting about France with a young lady, I thought for a moment that you might have been in love with her; but then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> you were as good as married to Maria van Duyk, and that the other was merely the {{daughter}} of your old friend, to whom you were bound to be civil. Now I know you are really in love with her, and not with Maria, I will try my luck there, that is, if she doesn't break her heart and die when she hears of the French girl." ...|$|E

40|$|If {{you were}} to ask a student what his or her least {{favorite}} subject is, {{you would not be}} surprised to hear that it is math. Math is very difficult for many students and can also be incredibly boring. They may find lectures to be boring and the homework to be long and tedious. I do not want my students to feel this way about the subject which brings me so much joy. For as long as I can remember, <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will not be that teacher who assigns 30, or even 15, repetitive book problems as homework. I believe this is not effective for several reasons. Therefore I want to establish alternative homework and class work assignments for my students to complete. I think these will be more interesting to my students, which means they will put more time and effort into completing the assignments. I also think that the lessons will demonstrate how mathematics can be used to model real world phenomena rather than just the plug and chug method so many of us grew up with...|$|R
60|$|At that, {{being not}} {{altogether}} dead to shame, <b>I</b> winced, and <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> my behaviour was unworthy, and that I was practising a detestable deception. Yet some indulgence I may justly claim {{in consideration of}} how far I was victim of circumstance. Did I tell him that I was Bardelys, I was convinced that I should never leave the chateau alive. Very noble-hearted was the Vicomte, and no man have I known more averse to bloodthirstiness, but {{he had told me}} much during the days that I had lain abed, and many lives would be jeopardized did I proclaim what I had learned from him. Hence I argued that any disclosure of my identity must perforce drive him to extreme measures {{for the sake of the}} friends he had unwittingly betrayed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, I want you, {{now that}} you know my very ugly history, [...] to {{consider}} this. Whilst I was married, I was faithful to my [...] husband; since then I have been faithful to my self-respect.

And that time has come, dear. [...] You know that I love you! Your coming has been the great [...] awakening joy of my life.
