5|$|In the Malay Seri Rama and the Indonesian-Javanese Rama Keling, Ravana {{wants to}} possess Mandodari, {{the mother of}} Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like the real one. Rama's father has a union with this pseudo-Mandodari, {{resulting}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of Sita, who is nominally Ravana's daughter.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of the legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E

5|$|In North America, a Canadian {{study of}} 27,749 {{children}} in Quebec showed that thiomersal {{was unrelated to}} the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> cohorts with no thiomersal when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism, suggesting that thiomersal could not be {{the primary cause of}} autism. A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism.|$|E

With Butch's four and Pierre's five they have the distinction of winning the most Stanley Cups of any father-son combination in NHL history. Bobby and Brett Hull are the only other father and son to have won the Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the Thai Ramakien, Hanuman helps Vibhishana (here called Phipek) kill a demon. Hanuman then marries Trijata (Benchakai); {{their union}} results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of a son, Asurapada, a demon with a monkey head. In the Malay version, {{after the great}} war, Vibhishana {{requests}} that Hanuman wed his daughter Trijata (Seri Jati). Hanuman agrees, {{on the condition that}} he remain with her for only a month. While Hanuman leaves for Ayodhya with Rama, Trijata gives birth to his son Hanuman Tegangga (Asurapada). The Javanese and Sundanese Wayang puppet tradition also portrays Trijata as the wife of Hanuman.|$|E

5|$|The Tamil text Kanda Puranam narrates {{about the}} birth of Shasta {{identified}} with Aiyanar. The text tells just before the tale that Vishnu is Shiva's Shakti (wife and power) Parvati in a male form. The legend begins with Shiva's request and Vishnu's agreement to show his illusionary Mohini form, that he assumed for the distribution of amrita. Shiva {{falls in love with}} Mohini and proposes a union with her. Mohini-Vishnu declines saying that union of two same sex women was unfruitful. Shiva informs Mohini-Vishnu that he was just one of forms of his Shakti. Thereafter, their union resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of a dark boy with red locks, who was named Hariharaputra. Further, he was also known as Shasta and Aiyannar.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E

Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.|$|E

5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} the guise of a comic book; FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{receives}} a letter from Shaineh Berkowitz (Pattie Tierce), a single mother who claims to have been mysteriously impregnated, while unconscious, by an unknown presence 18years ago, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of her son, Izzy (Stewart Gale). Now, following a similarly unexplained attack, she is pregnant again. She has heard about Mulder's expertise in the paranormal from The Jerry Springer Show and wants him to investigate. Mulder and his partner, special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), travel to rural Albion, Indiana. They meet Shaineh and her son Izzy and learn that the description of the creature that attacked her, with a lumpy head and two mouths, is very similar to a comic book character invented by Izzy. His monstrous creation, called The Great Mutato, is inspired by a mysterious creature that has been seen by many of the locals. Izzy and his friends take the agents to a wooded area where they see Mutato (Chris Owens) from a distance.|$|E

5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E
5|$|Despite loving Nikki, Victor {{begins to}} fall for Ashley Abbott (Brenda Epperson) and they have an affair, enraging Nikki to sleep with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Ashley’s brother and Victor’s {{business}} rival. Ashley becomes pregnant and Victor leaves Nikki, but when Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, Victor returns to her and Ashley aborts the child. When Nikki goes into remission, Victor {{wanted to be with}} Ashley, who had moved on with her psychiatrist Steven Lassiter (Rod Arrants); Steven later dies, and while Ashley wanted Victor back, he had returned to Nikki in an attempted to salvage their marriage, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of their son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Victor and Jack later hire Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton) to write a biography on Victor, when in reality, Jack wanted the book to be a tell-all expose on Victor. Leanna later writes a chapter about Victor’s affair with Ashley and Nikki’s illness, causing Victor to believe Nikki was behind the publication. He divorces her and marries Leanna to prove to the press that he didn’t want to be with Ashley; their marriage was invalid, as the divorce wasn’t finalized. Victor later takes over Jack’s family company, Jabot Cosmetics, replacing him with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). As a result, Jack spitefully marries Nikki, causing her relationship with Victor to become bitter. Victor marries Ashley, and years later; he tells Jack that he will give him back Jabot Cosmetics if he divorces Nikki. He agrees to do so, but Jack wasn’t given full control of the company due to a legal loophole. Victor has a heart attack during a confrontation with Jack, and while he leaves him for dead, Victor recovers. As Jack and Nikki’s marriage strained to due her alcoholism and pain killer addiction, she reconnected with Victor, who had decided to divorce Ashley.|$|E
