5|$|Fischer had {{not played}} {{competitive}} chess for eighteen months, and many thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> return. Then, to general surprise and delight, {{he agreed to}} participate in the Soviet Union vs. the Rest of the World in 1970 in Belgrade.|$|E

Jones denied assaulting Powell-Lexing, saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> get into a physical fight with a woman. Jones was charged with assault. Despite the alleged assault, Powell-Lexing continued as part of Bell's defense team.|$|E
5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again score more than six goals in a season, this made him more an effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.|$|E
5|$|Many people {{weighed in}} on the {{decision}} on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising {{the integrity of the}} game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> had done it without Bascom's blessing.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} month, Abebe {{returned to}} Tokyo {{to win his}} second Mainichi Marathon. In 1966 he ran marathons at Zarautz and Inchon–Seoul, winning both. The following year, Abebe did not finish the Zarautz International Marathon in July 1967. He had injured his hamstring, an injury from which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> recover. Abebe had begun to limp, and the 1966 Incheon–Seoul Marathon was the last marathon he ever completed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be able to film his stories.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Would</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> wake up? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> realise her presence? Oh! then {{he could}} care nothing about her. Probably he was {{thinking}} of the girl he had pulled up a cliff in the Alps. But why did he come to this place to think of her? ...|$|R
5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views {{on the subject of}} the orders in the ministry, objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} birth of James and Reuben, Morris became {{severely}} ill. During his illness, a man named Gad Farnam moved into the Morris's home to care for him day and night. The two families became very close and Gad's daughter Rhoda, only five {{years old at the}} time of the illness, later became Morris's second wife. It was at this point in Morris's life that he accepted that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> realize his early dream of becoming a minister.|$|E
50|$|Nat {{is sent to}} {{a mental}} {{hospital}} where he falls deeper into mental illness, whimpering about the baby ostriches that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> now <b>never</b> {{have the chance to}} raise.|$|R
50|$|After the conviction, {{the then}} Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, placed Hutchinson {{on the list}} of prisoners whose life {{sentences}} should mean life, meaning that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> be released.|$|R
50|$|Lolita {{polarized}} contemporary critics, but is well-received today. Kubrick later commented, however, {{that if he}} {{had realized}} how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, <b>he</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have made the film.|$|R
5|$|Narayan {{argued that}} {{appreciation}} of the sarangi and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience. He attributed the lack of sarangi students {{to a lack of}} competent teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving the instrument. The Pt (Pandit) Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to sarangi students. Narayan has stated he was skeptical the sarangi would survive and said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> give up promoting the instrument.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{attorney}} William Shea {{was attempting}} to create the Continental League, a rival league to Major League Baseball. Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league. Wismer was willing; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins' principal owner, George Preston Marshall, and realized <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> own the Washington franchise. Wismer, while wealthy, {{was not nearly as}} rich as the other potential team owners.|$|E
5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} communism, and was thus unfit to be president. He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit {{to lead the country}} in ridding the {{government}} of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from the wife of a serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> cash that check.|$|E
5000|$|On July 29, 2016, Donahue {{suffered}} a catastrophic, paralyzing stroke. [...] According to reports published several weeks later, doctors told his family that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> {{play the guitar}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] Miss Cotton pursued; [...] "that {{if he really}} {{appreciated}} her in the highest way, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wish <b>never</b> to do an undignified or trivial thing in her presence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Van Astrachan made a {{dead halt}} {{at the idea}} of Dick Follingsbee. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> receive that man under his roof, he said, and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> enter his house; and when Mr. Van Astrachan once said a thing of this kind, as Mr. Hosea Biglow remarks, [...] "a meeting-house wasn't sotter." ...|$|R
5|$|Two {{years after}} being {{acquired}} by Calgary in a draft-day trade, {{he left the}} Flames in another such deal. At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft on June 20, 2008, the Flames granted his request and sent Tanguay to the Montreal Canadiens, along with a fifth round draft pick, {{in exchange for a}} first round pick in 2008 and a second rounder in 2009. Tanguay accepted the trade to Montreal despite previously saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> want to play for the Canadiens and expressing worries about being a French-Canadian player in the Montreal spotlight.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} his execution, Bonnet {{wrote to}} Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising {{to have his}} own arms and legs cut off as assurance that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually hanged at White Point Garden, in Charles Town, on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> recover.|$|E
50|$|Jørgensen {{elected to}} play for the Faroe Islands, the {{homeland}} of his mother, as <b>he</b> believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> play for Denmark. He won most of his caps whilst playing for Coventry City.|$|R
50|$|Nellum had to redshirt the 2009 {{season at}} USC, after being {{shot in the}} leg by two gang members. Nellum was told by doctors that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>never</b> again reach world-class speeds as a runner.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth smiled. He was {{too well}} acquainted with his comrade's manner to take offence at this remark, and the man's devotion to the girl who, <b>he</b> knew, <b>would</b> <b>never</b> regard him {{as more than a}} friend also had its effect.|$|R
