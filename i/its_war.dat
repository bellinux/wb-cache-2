5|$|By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria ended <b>its</b> <b>war</b> {{with the}} Ottoman Empire and {{prepared}} to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial forces, and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the Victorian ship HMCSS Victoria was {{dispatched}} {{to help the}} New Zealand colonial government in <b>its</b> <b>war</b> against Māori in Taranaki. Victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against Māori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} <b>its</b> <b>war</b> against Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V of Macedon to attempt to extend his power westward. According to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, {{an important factor in}} Philip's decision {{to take advantage of this}} opportunity was the influence of Demetrius of Pharos.|$|E
5|$|The army's {{official}} flag is the 3:5 ratio Union Jack, {{although a}} non-ceremonial flag flies at the Ministry of Defence building in Whitehall {{and is often}} used at recruiting and military events and exhibitions. It represents the army on the Cenotaph at Whitehall in London, the UK memorial to <b>its</b> <b>war</b> dead. Each British Army unit has a set of flags, known as the colours—normally a Regimental Colour and a Queen's Colour (the Union Jack).|$|E
5|$|American {{public opinion}} blamed the {{violence}} on British interference in American affairs through financial and munitions {{support for the}} Indians. This led to a further deterioration of relations with Britain and was a catalyst of the War of 1812, which began six months later. By the time the US declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch <b>its</b> <b>war</b> against the United States in alliance with the British. In preparation, the Natives soon rebuilt Prophetstown. Frontier violence in the region would continue until well after the War of 1812, although Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the Battle of the Thames.|$|E

5|$|As the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army made {{preparations}} for <b>its</b> <b>war</b> against Vietnam, state-controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory {{messages to the}} Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on {{the second anniversary of}} its establishment, on 17 April 1977. On 30 April 1977, the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the Kampuchean reply {{came in the form of}} a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Châu Đốc, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnam People's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a demilitarised zone between the opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off <b>its</b> <b>war</b> debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing {{the present value of}} the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
5|$|However, a major rift {{of opinion}} {{existed between the}} Japanese {{government}} and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally {{under the control of}} the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors even before he left for Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanking. He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in <b>its</b> <b>war</b> on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E

25|$|When the Seljuq Turks did {{encounter}} the Byzantines, they had chosen {{a good time}} to attack; Byzantium was faced with weak rule, Norman conquests and the schism whilst the Abassid Caliphate had recently been seriously weakened with <b>its</b> <b>wars</b> against the Fatimid dynasty.|$|R
25|$|In England, King William III {{sought to}} {{modernize}} the kingdom's finances to pay for <b>its</b> <b>wars,</b> and thus the first government bonds were issued in 1693 and the Bank of England was set up the following year. Soon thereafter, English joint-stock companies began going public.|$|R
5|$|In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded {{and quickly}} {{defeated}} by the Axis powers. Yugoslavia was partitioned, {{and as part of}} this, the Germans established a military government of occupation in an area roughly the same as the pre-1912 Kingdom of Serbia, consisting of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. They did this to secure two strategic lines of communication – the Danube river, and the railway line that connected Belgrade with Salonika in occupied Greece, and thence by sea to North Africa. The German occupied territory of Serbia was also rich in non-ferrous metals such as lead, antimony and copper, which German needed to support <b>its</b> <b>war</b> effort.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese {{forces in}} Manchukuo had {{sporadic}} border clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted {{the doctrine of}} Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to <b>its</b> <b>war</b> with the United States and the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|Japan was a {{signatory}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated harsh repercussions for Germany. In the Pacific, Japan gained Germany's islands {{north of}} the equator (the Marshall Islands, the Carolines, the Marianas, the Palau Islands) and Kiautschou/Tsingtao in China. Article 156 of the Treaty also transferred German concessions in Shandong to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China, an issue soon {{to be known as}} Shandong Problem. Chinese outrage over this provision led to demonstrations, and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement influenced China not to sign the treaty. China declared the end of <b>its</b> <b>war</b> against Germany in September 1919 and signed a separate treaty with Germany in 1921. This fact greatly contributed to Germany relying on China, and not Japan, as its strategic partner in East Asia for the coming years.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, {{friction}} between recently arrived white settlers and goldseekers in Utah and Colorado and local Ute groups resulted in several skirmishes and incidents. In the same period, the Ute sometimes {{allied with the}} United States in <b>its</b> <b>wars</b> with the Navajo, for example in 1863, and with the Apache.|$|R
5|$|Operation Enduring Freedom is the {{official}} name used by the United States Government for <b>its</b> <b>War</b> in Afghanistan, together with three smaller military actions {{under the umbrella of}} its Global War on Terrorism. The war began on October 7, 2001 with the response of the United States and United Kingdom to the September 11 attacks in New York City and Arlington, Virginia. In early 2005, Murphy was assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE as officer in charge of Alpha Platoon and deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} <b>its</b> <b>war</b> with Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V {{of the kingdom of}} Macedon in northern Greece to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries, along with emissaries from Hannibal, were captured by a Roman fleet. Desiring to prevent Philip from aiding Carthage in Italy and elsewhere, Rome sought out land allies in Greece to fight a proxy war against Macedon on its behalf and found partners in the Aetolian League of Greek city-states, the Illyrians to the north of Macedon and the kingdom of Pergamon and the city-state of Rhodes, which lay across the Aegean from Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} <b>its</b> <b>war</b> with Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V {{of the kingdom of}} Macedonia, located in the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.|$|E
5000|$|A change {{came about}} in 1878 when the British Colonial Office overthrew the elected Cape {{government}} and a new bout of imperial expansionism began in southern Africa, under the reactionary new government of Gordon Sprigg.

Medstead was one one of the first villages in the United Kingdom to receive broadband. The village has six Grade II listed buildings, including the 12th century St Andrew's Church and <b>its</b> <b>war</b> memorial, a farmhouse and a Victorian wheelhouse with a working donkey wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} throughout 1918 had heavily depleted the Australian units, {{which had}} been unable to make good their losses, and on 5 October, the entire Australian Corps was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation. The battalion remained out of the line until the war ended in November, after which they began to demobilise. The process was slow as personnel were repatriated back to Australia in drafts and consequently the battalion was not disbanded until March 1919. Throughout the war, casualties amongst the 28th totalled 787 killed and 2,241 wounded. The battalion received 17 battle honours for <b>its</b> <b>war</b> service, which were bestowed in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by the displacement {{of most of the}} Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the majority were soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and <b>its</b> <b>war</b> crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
