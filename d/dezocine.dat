50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> is {{generally}} administered intravenously (as Dalgan) to relieve post-operative pain in patients. Because {{of its high}} efficacy, it is often administered at a base dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Respiratory depression, a side-effect of <b>dezocine,</b> reaches a ceiling at 0.3-0.4 mg/kg. It has potent analgesic results, and greater pain-relieving ability than morphine, codeine, and pethidine.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} agents {{are used as}} analgesics, {{including}} pentazocine, phenazocine, <b>dezocine,</b> and eptazocine.|$|E
50|$|Due to its partial agonist nature at the MOR, <b>dezocine</b> has {{significantly}} reduced side effects relative to opioid analgesics acting as full agonists of the MOR such as morphine. Moreover, <b>dezocine</b> {{is not a}} controlled substance {{and there are no}} reports of addiction related to its use, indicating that, unlike virtually all other clinically-employed MOR agonists (including weak partial agonists like buprenorphine) and for reasons that are not fully clear, it is apparently non-addictive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> {{is unusual}} among opiates {{as it is}} one of the only primary amines known to be an active opioid (along with bisnortilidine, an active {{metabolite}} of tilidine). It is a mixed agonist-antagonist as with other drugs in this class, and despite having a stronger respiratory depressant effect than morphine, <b>dezocine</b> shows a ceiling effect on its respiratory depressive action so above a certain dose this effect does not get any more severe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> {{possesses}} affinities (Ki) of 3.7 nM, 31.9 nM, and 527 nM for the μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors (MOR, KOR, and DOR), respectively. It is {{a partial}} agonist of the MOR and a silent antagonist of the KOR. In {{addition to its}} opioid actions, <b>dezocine</b> {{has been found to}} act as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), with pIC50 values of 5.86 for the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5.68 for the norepinephrine transporter (NET).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> (INN, USAN) (brand name Dalgan) is a marketed opioid {{analgesic}} of the benzomorphan group. First synthesized in 1970, it acts at mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. <b>Dezocine</b> {{is a mixed}} agonist/antagonist of opioid receptors. It is related to other benzomorphans such as pentazocine, with a similar profile of effects that include analgesia and euphoria. Unlike many other benzomorphans however, it is a silent antagonist of the κ-opioid receptor, and in accordance, does not produce side effects such as dysphoria or hallucinations at any dose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> is {{generally}} administered intravenously. It {{can also be}} administered in intramuscular doses, and is given singularly rather than continuously. <b>Dezocine</b> {{has been found to}} be an effective painkiller comparable to meperidine (pethidine), and so is a more effective analgesic than pentazocine, but causes relatively more respiratory depression than pentazocine. It is a useful drug for the treatment of pain, but side effects such as dizziness limit its clinical application, and it can produce opioid withdrawal syndrome in patients already dependent on other opioids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> {{hydrobromide}} is a pale white crystal powder. It has {{no apparent}} odor. The salt is soluble at 20 mg/ml, and a 2% solution has a pH of 4.6.|$|E
5000|$|Phenazocine {{was invented}} in the 1950s. [...] It {{was one of a}} number of benzomorphan opioids (including pentazocine, <b>dezocine,</b> and cyclazocine) {{developed}} in the search for non-addictive strong analgesics.|$|E
50|$|With {{regards to}} its potency, {{it has a}} Bmax of 3326 fmol/mg of protein in HEK cells. <b>Dezocine</b> is five times as potent as {{pethidine}} and one-fifth as potent as butorphanol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> was {{patented}} by American Home Products Corp. in 1978. Clinical trials ran from 1979-1985, before its {{approval by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986. As of 2011, dezocine's usage is discontinued in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Cyclazocine {{is a mixed}} opioid agonist/antagonist {{related to}} <b>dezocine,</b> {{pentazocine}} and phenazocine. This family of opioid drugs is called the benzomorphans or benzazocines. It is a KOR agonist and MOR partial agonist, and also has high affinity for the DOR.|$|E
50|$|As of 2011, <b>dezocine</b> is {{not used}} in the United States or Canada. It is not commercially {{available}} in either of these countries, nor is it offered as a prescribed analgesic for postoperative care. In China however, {{it is commonly used}} after surgery.|$|E
50|$|Propiram {{exhibits}} weak {{opioid antagonist}} {{activity on the}} mu receptor—quite a bit weaker than its agonist effects—and the effect on kappa and delta opioid, sigma receptors, or the NMDA system are not well understood. Other drugs of the partial mu-opioid agonist/antagonist type include meptazinol, buprenorphine, butorphanol, phenazocine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, <b>dezocine</b> and its relatives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dezocine</b> has an {{intramuscular}} bioavailability of 97%. It has a mean t1/2 α {{of fewer}} than two minutes, and its half-life is 2.2 hours. Its binding affinity varies {{with regards to the}} receptor type, as it acts as a partial agonist primarily on mu-opioid receptors. At kappa-opioid receptors, it acts as an antagonist. Overall, it has a high efficacy as an analgesic.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>dezocine</b> {{begins with the}} condensation of 1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone with 1,5-dibromopentane through use of NaH or potassium tertbutylate. This yields 1-(5-bromopentyl)-1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone, which is then cyclized with NaH to produce 5-methyl-3-methoxy-5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydro-5,11-methanobenzocyclodecen-13-one. The product is then treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to yield an oxime. A reduction reaction in hydrogen gas produces an isomeric mixture, from which the final product is crystallized and cleaved with HBr.|$|E
50|$|Pentazocine is a synthetically-prepared prototypical mixed agonist-antagonist {{narcotic}} (opioid analgesic) drug of the benzomorphan {{class of}} opioids {{used to treat}} moderate to moderately severe pain. Pentazocine is sold under several brand names, such as Fortral, Sosegon, Talwin NX (with the μ-antagonist naloxone, will cause withdrawal in opioid dependent persons on injection), Talwin, Talwin PX (without naloxone), Fortwin (Lactate injectable form) and Talacen (with acetaminophen). This compound may exist as one of two enantiomers, named (+)-pentazocine and (−)-pentazocine. (−)-pentazocine is a κ-opioid receptor agonist, while (+)-pentazocine is not, instead displaying a ten-fold greater affinity for the σ receptor. Usually, in its oral formulations, it is combined with naloxone so as to prevent people from crushing the tablets, dissolving them in a solvent (like water) and injecting them for a high (as naloxone is not orally bioavailable it produces no effect when the formulation is used orally, but it blocks the opioid effects of pentazocine if injected intravenously for a high). Related drugs include phenazocine, <b>dezocine,</b> cyclazocine and several chemicals used in research on the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Buprenorphine and <b>dezocine</b> are partial {{agonists}} of the MOR but antagonists of the KOR. Contrarily, eptazocine is an antagonist of the MOR but an agonist of the KOR; {{the same}} is also true for nalorphine and levallorphan. A variety of partial agonists or mixed agonists-antagonists of the MOR and KOR are also marketed, and include butorphanol, levorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and phenazocine. All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists. With the sole exception of nalorphine, all of the preceding are used as analgesics (by virtue {{of the fact that}} both MOR and KOR agonism independently confer pain relief). However, these opioid analgesics have atypical properties in comparison to the prototypical pure MOR full agonist opioid analgesics, such as less or no risk of respiratory depression for MOR partial agonists and antagonists, reduced or no euphoria, abuse potential, and dependence liability with MOR partial agonists/antagonists, and use- and dose-limiting side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations with KOR agonists. In addition, by virtue of its KOR antagonism, buprenorphine (as buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461) or buprenorphine/naltrexone to block its MOR agonism) is under investigation for the treatment of depression and cocaine dependence, as are other KOR antagonists such as CERC-501 (LY-2456302) and, previously, JDTic and PF-4455242 (both discontinued due to toxicity concerns).|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} of neuropathic pain (NP) currently remains clinically challenging. In {{an attempt to}} identify novel targets of known opioids, we found that <b>dezocine,</b> a non-addictive opioid, inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake through their transporter proteins which open the potential for <b>dezocine</b> to manage NP. In the present study, the effect of <b>dezocine</b> on NP was observed in a rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI). The paw withdrawal latency (PWL) and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were used to evaluate thermal hyperalgesia and mechanic allodynia for nociceptive response. PWL and PWT tests were performed at 11 : 00 AM starting from 1 day before CCI surgery and 1, 3, 7, 10 days after right sciatic nerve ligation in {{the presence or absence}} of daily intraperitoneal injection of <b>dezocine.</b> The results demonstrated that the CCI-induced thermal and mechanical pain hypersensitivity was attenuated by <b>dezocine</b> significantly and persistently without sign of tolerance, indicating that <b>dezocine</b> could be an alternative medication for the {{treatment of}} NP.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} oxycodone versus <b>dezocine</b> for postoperative analgesia in patients with cervical cancer treated with radical surgery. Materials and Methods: Fifty-one cases of cervical cancer treated with radical surgery were included in the present study and divided into oxycodone group (n = 26) and <b>dezocine</b> group (n = 25). Patients in the oxycodone group were given with oxycodone 1 mg/kg plus tropisetron 0. 1 mg/kg diluting to 100 ml by 0. 9 % saline for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after surgery. Moreover, patients in the <b>dezocine</b> group were given with <b>dezocine</b> 0. 6 mg/kg plus tropisetron 0. 1 mg/kg diluting to 100 ml by 0. 9 % saline for PCIA after surgery. The visual analog scale (VAS) and Ramsay sedation score of the two groups were recorded in the time point of 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The adverse event-related drugs were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: The VAS score was significantly lower in oxycodone group compared to <b>dezocine</b> group in the time point of 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Pall 0. 05).

Two researchers independently screened literature, extracted data, and evaluated bias risks in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then used RevMan 5. 2 to perform the meta-analysis. Results: A total of six RCTs were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed that 1) the preinjection of <b>dezocine</b> can reduce the incidence of etomidate-induced myoclonus (relative risk [RR] = 0. 25, 95 % CI [0. 13, 0. 50], P< 0. 0001), which is consistent with the result of subgroup analysis; 2) the preinjection of <b>dezocine</b> can reduce the incidence of mild, moderate, and severe myoclonus; 3) <b>dezocine</b> was not related to an increasing incidence of etomidate-induced dizziness and nausea (RR = 2. 83, 95 % CI [0. 66, 12. 08], P= 0. 6); and 4) <b>dezocine</b> did not reduce heart rates after the administration of etomidate (mean difference = 1. 06, 95 % CI [– 4. 08, 6. 19], P= 0. 69).

Methods: A total of 126 women in early pregnancy (up to 14 weeks’ gestation) who underwent induced abortion at Cangzhou Central Hospital from May 2012 to May 2013 were randomly assigned to a control (propofol) group (n= 63) or an intervention (propofol + <b>dezocine)</b> group (n= 63). Wake-up time, orientation force recovery time, incidence of adverse reactions, postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score, analgesic effect, and respiratory and circulatory monitoring before the operation, 5 minutes into the operation, and 5 minutes after the operation were compared between the two groups. Results: The surgical procedure and anesthesia were performed successfully in all patients. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and oxyhemoglobin saturation in the intervention group were significantly higher than in the control group; however, heart rate was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group 5 minutes into the operation (all P< 0. 05). There were no statistically significant differences in these parameters before surgery and after recovery. The postoperative VAS score (2. 82 ± 0. 72), Ramsay score (2. 65 ± 0. 65), and anesthetic effect in the intervention group were better than in the control group (3. 90 ± 0. 84 and 2. 21 ± 0. 49, respectively), and all differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). The wake-up time (3. 41 ± 0. 79 minutes) and orientation force recovery time (4. 28 ± 0. 92 minutes) were all significantly shorter (P< 0. 05) in the intervention group than in the control group, as was the incidence of adverse reactions (7. 94 % versus 26. 98 %, respectively). Conclusion: Adverse reactions of propofol combined with <b>dezocine</b> in painless induced abortion are less while the analgesic effect is better.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production. Efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand β-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. Results Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44, 441 and SKF 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = β-endorphin > etorphine = lofentanil = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine = <b>dezocine</b> = metazocine ≥ xorphanol. The rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > <b>dezocine</b> > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine > nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>> β-endorphin. Conclusion These results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. Furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of several medications for acute biliary colic. MethodsTwo hundred and forty patients with acute biliary colic admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 2012 to January 2014 {{were selected for}} retrospective analysis and randomly divided into four groups, namely raceanisodamine hydrochloride group (group A), phloroglucinol group (group B), tramadol hydrochloride (group C), and <b>dezocine</b> group (group D), with 60 cases in each group. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions were compared between the four groups using analysis of variance for continuous data and chi-square test for categorical data. ResultsVAS scores were decreased significantly after the treatment in each group (P＜ 0. 01) and the score in group D was the lowest (P＜ 0. 01). In terms of time to pain relief, the time in group A was the longest, and that in group D was the shortest, with significant difference (P＜ 0. 05). As for clinical efficacy, the overall response rate in group D was the highest, while that in group A was the lowest, with significant difference (P＜ 0. 05). The incidence of adverse reactions in groups C and D was the lowest, while that in group A was the highest, with significant difference (P＜ 0. 01). ConclusionThe clinical efficacy of <b>dezocine</b> and tramadol hydrochloride is better than that of raceanisodamine hydrochloride and phloroglucinol, and the former two are worthy of further clinical application. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of sex in determining responses to opioid anal-gesics {{has been well}} established in rodents and monkeys in assays of short-lasting, phasic pain. The purpose of this inves-tigation was to use a capsaicin model of tonic pain to evaluate sex differences in hyperalgesia and -opioid-induced antihy-peralgesia in Fischer 344 (F 344) rats. Capsaicin injected into the tail produced a dose-dependent thermal hyperalgesia in males and females, with the dose required to produce a com-parable level of hyperalgesia being 3. 0 -fold higher in males than in females. These sex differences were modulated by gonadal hormones, inasmuch as gonadectomy increased the potency of capsaicin in males and decreased its potency in females.
