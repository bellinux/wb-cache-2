40|$|As {{the data}} from space {{missions}} and laboratories improve, a research domain combining plasmas and charged dust is gaining in prominence. Our solar system provides many natural laboratories such as planetary rings, comet comae and tails, ejecta clouds around moons and asteroids, and Earth’s noctilucent clouds for which to closely study plasma-embedded cosmic dust. One natural laboratory to study electromagnetically-controlled cosmic dust has been provided by the Jovian dust streams and {{the data from}} the instruments which were on board the Galileo spacecraft. Given the prodigious quantity of dust poured into the Jovian magnetosphere by Io and its volcanoes resulting in the dust streams, the possibility of dusty plasma conditions exist. This paper characterizes the main parameters for those interested in studying dust embedded in a plasma with a focus on the Jupiter environment. I show how to distinguish between dust-in-plasma and dusty-plasma and how the Havnes parameter P can be used to support or negate the possibility of collective behavior of the dusty plasma. The result of applying these tools to the Jovian dust streams reveals mostly dust-in-plasma behavior. In the orbits displaying the highest <b>dust</b> <b>stream</b> fluxes, portions of orbits E 4, G 7, G 8, C 21 satisfy the minimum requirements for a dusty plasma.

40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} dust {{measurements}} obtained during the seventh orbit of the Galileo spacecraft about Jupiter. The most prominent features observed are highly time variable <b>dust</b> <b>streams</b> recorded throughout the Jovian system. The impact rate varied {{by more than}} {{an order of magnitude}} with a 5 and 10 hour periodicity, which shows a correlation with Galileo’s position relative to the Jovian magnetic field.
