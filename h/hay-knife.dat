6000|$|Very often, as his <b>hay-knife</b> crunched down {{among the}} sweet-smelling grassy stems, he would survey mankind {{and say to}} himself: [...] "Here and {{everywhere}} be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves, though wanted by their families, the country, and the world; while I, an outcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and despised by all, live on against my will!" ...|$|E
60|$|She promised mechanically, in her agitation; and {{the same}} evening at dusk Henchard left the town, to whose {{development}} he {{had been one of}} the chief stimulants for many years. During the day he had bought a new tool-basket, cleaned up his old <b>hay-knife</b> and wimble, set himself up in fresh leggings, kneenaps and corduroys, and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood, discarding for ever the shabby-genteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days.|$|E
60|$|The man was of fine figure, swarthy, {{and stern}} in aspect; {{and he showed}} in profile a facial angle so {{slightly}} inclined as to be almost perpendicular. He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than {{the remainder of his}} suit, which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn buttons, breeches of the same, tanned leggings, and a straw hat overlaid with black glazed canvas. At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket, from which protruded at one end the crutch of a <b>hay-knife,</b> a wimble for hay-bonds being also visible in the aperture. His measured, springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer; while in the turn and plant of each foot there was, further, a dogged and cynical indifference personal to himself, showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds, now in the left leg, now in the right, as he paced along.|$|E

The engine, like others in use thereabout, shed steam and hot water round it from every leaky joint, and kept Harry busy feeding it with birch billets and liquid from the well. There were sheaves to pitch to the separator, grain bags to be filled and hauled to the straw-pile granary, while between times we drove wagon-loads of chaff and straw {{bouncing}} behind the bronco teams to complete that altogether western structure. Its erection is simple. You drive stout birch poles into the sod, wattle them with willow branches, and lash on whatever comes handiest for rafters; then pile the straw all over it several fathoms thick, and leave the wind and snow to do the rest. When it has settled into shape and solidity it is both frost and rain proof, and often requires a <b>hay-knife</b> to get into it.|$|E
