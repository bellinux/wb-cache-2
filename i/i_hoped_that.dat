5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E

Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this.

2500|$|Former {{legislative}} colleague Ron Gomez described Gunter {{as having}} what urban people call [...] "street smarts, that innate ability, also common to many rural folk, to smell a phony an acre away, {{to be suspicious}} of everyone who didn't dress or talk like him and to cut {{to the heart of}} a matter with cold precision. His politics were populist in nature. He was regularly graded high by organized labor and low by business and professional associations", such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gomez said that he and Gunter did not become friends but [...] "shared a mutual respect. Whether I shared Carl's beliefs or he disliked the way I talked, we realized that we both got to the House the same way and for the same reason: we were there to represent the people of our respective districts. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> all {{the other members of the}} House practiced that philosophy." ...|$|E
