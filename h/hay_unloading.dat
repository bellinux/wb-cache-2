Television ads highlighting the effort, as well as one portraying his family in gushing terms and showing him shirtless, received a poor public response and were a factor in his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien, leading in the polls as late as mid-October. He responded with ads that accused O'Brien of being a failed watchdog for state pension fund losses in the stock market and that associated her husband, a former lobbyist, with the Enron scandal. These were effective in capturing independent voters. O'Brien said that Romney's budget plans were unrealistic; the two also differed on capital punishment and bilingual education, with Romney supporting the former and opposing the latter.|$|E

5000|$|Over the decades, {{the site}} {{had been used}} as a Dairy barn housing cows, a chicken barn and finally a veal {{operation}} during its farming life. The 13 sided barn was originally constructed to house cows who supplied their milk to the two creameries located in the Village of Jefferson. [...] "The cows were kept in stalls {{on the first floor of}} the barn and horses pulled wagons of hay to the second story via a bridge which led to large doors on the east side. (No longer in use.) After the <b>hay</b> was <b>unloaded,</b> the horses would then be led forward around the inside of the barn and through to the same doors they entered. This was far less dangerous than having the horses back out through doors to maneuver the steep bridge, especially during severe winters." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{middle bay}} {{was used for}} <b>unloading</b> <b>hay</b> wagons, {{threshing}} (thrashing) grain and other work. The foundation was typically not quarried stone but fieldstone and had no basement thus are called a ground barn. The timbers used were typically one solid piece running {{the full length of}} the building sometimes over forty feet long. The cows often stood on the ground rather than on a wood floor, their heads facing the middle bay in what is called a tie-up (not individual box stalls). Also the breeds of cows were usually smaller than today. English barns were built before the New England practice of connecting the barn to the house was popular so these barns are usually separate from the house although they could have been connected to the house at a later date. Houses and barns in New England built before the early 19th century typically face south rather than facing a road, the later orientation.|$|R

[...] She said Romney was [...] "trying to mask a very conservative set of belief systems"; while saying she would not criticize his membership in the LDS Church, she attacked his substantial donations to Brigham Young University, objecting to their bar on expressions of homosexuality. [...] O'Brien came out in support of same-sex marriage. [...] Romney declared support for faith-based initiatives. Romney campaigned as a pro-choice candidate who would protect a woman's right to an abortion, and he rejected the endorsement of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a pro-life organization.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} round barns tend to {{have several}} flat sides, usually twelve or sixteen. They {{also tend to be}} wood-sided while the later round barns are more often faced with brick or glazed tile. The interior design of round barns shifted as well. The early round barns had cattle stanchions on the first floor with the whole of the loft used for hay and feed storage. Later barns possessed a central space which rose up from the ground level through the entire building. The cattle stanchions in this variation of round barn were arranged around a circular manger on the lower level. Above the stanchion level a circular wagon drive allowed <b>hay</b> to be <b>unloaded</b> into the central mow as the wagon circled the perimeter. The final stage of interior design in round barns included a storage silo {{through the center of the}} structures. These were not really added until silos became fixtures of American farms. Sometimes the central silo would project up through the roof.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} some bank barns called a [...] "High-Drive Bank Barn" [...] allowed for wagons to enter {{directly}} into the <b>hay</b> loft making <b>unloading</b> the <b>hay</b> easier. Sometimes the high-drive was accessed by an earthen or wood ramp and sometimes the ramp was covered like a bridge {{to make it more}} durable. In the Pennsylvania Barns the animals were housed in the basement level. In many other bank barns the tie-ups were on the upper-ground level and below the stables a basement usually acted as a manure collection area. Many bank barns simply have a small incline leading up to the loft area as opposed to a ramp. Some bank barns are constructed directly into existing hillsides while others are fitted with built up earthen and stone areas to create the trademark bank. The design is similar to English barns except for bank and basement aspects. The basement space could be utilized for animals while the area above, easily accessed by wagon because of the bank, could be used for feed and grain storage. Bank barns {{can be thought of as}} English barns raised up on an exposed full basement.|$|R
500|$|Her {{cargo of}} 88 lorries, {{anti-aircraft}} guns, spare parts for aircraft, ammunition, communications equipment, coke and 400500 tons of <b>hay,</b> was <b>unloaded</b> in Tromsø on 27 April, {{as part of}} the Allied support of the Norwegian forces fighting the German invasion of their country. The cargo was put to use in the supply and defence of the Tromsø area, except for the hay, which was quarantined by the Norwegian authorities at Ringvassøy for fear of foot-and-mouth disease. The coke on board Alster had been placed by the Germans in a [...] layer covering the deck. The supplies on Alster were transferred to the Norwegians by the Allied naval commander Lord Cork after the Norwegian authorities had made repeated request for weapons and other war matériel, and was intended to be a first effort before the arrival of larger quantities of arms and ammunition promised to the Norwegians. The lorries and weapons from Alster were received, assessed and distributed by Norwegian military personnel under the command of Major Karl Arnulf, who had arrived in Tromsø on 7 May 1940, having made his way from German-occupied South Norway. The communications equipment included both a mobile radio transmitter, which was used as a spare for Tromsø radio broadcasting station, as well as large quantities of field telephone equipment which was sent to the units of the Norwegian 6th Division on the Narvik front. The field equipment from Alster replaced the old and worn field telephone systems in use up to that point. Training on the German equipment was provided by Swedish volunteers. In order to satisfy British naval regulations with regards to prize cargoes, the British consul in Tromsø observed the unloading of Alster, and wrote an affidavit listing what had been given to the Norwegians, which was sent to the Admiralty. While docked in Tromsø in May 1940, Alster had 70 captive Germans on board. At Tromsø, Alster was manned by Norwegian sailors, replacing the British prize crew.|$|R
5000|$|The English barn (also {{known as}} a three-bay barn, Connecticut barn, Yankee barn, thirty-by-forty and {{sometimes}} confusingly called a New England barn) was built from a very early date in the northeast United States. The defining characteristics are the big, swinging doors on the sidewall with strap hinges mounted on pintles and three or sometimes four bays. The doors being on the side walls creates the spatial arrangement of the bays being the main divisions of these barns. The English barns were built {{during the period of}} using scribe rule framing (the irregular timbers were laid out and scribed to fit together). The framing was raised in sidewall assemblies, made with hewn timbers, in northern New England frequently had common purlin roofs, and often framed with the English tying joint on flared (gunstock) posts although these are not defining characteristics. The middle bay was used for <b>unloading</b> <b>hay</b> wagons, threshing (thrashing) grain and other work. The foundation was typically not quarried stone but fieldstone and had no basement thus are called a ground barn. The timbers used were typically one solid piece running the full length of the building sometimes over forty feet long. The cows often stood on the ground rather than on a wood floor, their heads facing the middle bay in what is called a tie-up (not individual box stalls). Also the breeds of cows were usually smaller than today. English barns were built before the New England practice of connecting the barn to the house was popular so these barns are usually separate from the house although they could have been connected to the house at a later date. Houses and barns in New England built before the early 19th century typically face south rather than facing a road, the later orientation.Similarities between the English and New England barn are that buildings were used for multiple purposes: the cows were in tie-ups {{on one side of the}} main floor, typically a narrower space on the warmer side of the building, and hay storage and a stable were in the other side, typically the colder side. Both types of barns were sometimes built with big doors on both ends of the drive floor so a wagon team could drive through and generally called a drive through barn. Occasionally the back door was small and only used for ventilation or winnowing. There were likely loose poles called a scaffold on the beams above the drive floor and loft floors above the tie-ups. There may be a transom window above the barn doors and windows were used as needed in some of the walls, but more windows are likely to be found in the New England barn. The roofs of the three-bay barns frequently have no overhang on the eaves or sidewalls, but some New England barns have original, built in roof overhangs.There is a rare class of barn which are framed like an English barn but originally designed with the doors on the gable end. In general terms these are called a transitional barn and show the transition between the two distinct styles. (Some English barns were later converted to gable entry and there is usually evidence where the old side-doors were located.) ...|$|R
