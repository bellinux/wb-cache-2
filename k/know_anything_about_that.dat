500|$|The Daddies {{have often}} been criticized for their seeming {{juxtaposition}} of lurid subject matter and profanity with jazz and swing music, though Perry has boldly defended the band's predilection towards [...] "darker" [...] lyricism and visuals, calling to attention {{his interest in the}} era's film noir and avant-garde artistic movements. A prominent example of this includes the two music videos for the Daddies' hit single [...] "Zoot Suit Riot", which – in addition to being written about the 1943 race riots – both featured pervasive surrealist imagery inspired by the films of Luis Buñuel, specifically his 1929 short Un Chien Andalou. [...] "We wanted to be darker, weirder and stranger", Perry stated in a 2012 interview, [...] "and unfortunately, with other [...] bands it was 'Back then everyone dressed nice and was nice'. That's not true. You don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> era at all".|$|E
500|$|On 14 and 15 April 1993, Holland was {{the mission}} {{commander}} of a two-ship training mission to a bombing range near Guam in the Pacific Ocean. During the mission, Holland flew his B-52 {{closer to the}} other B-52 than regulations allowed. Holland also asked his navigator to videotape the bombs falling from the aircraft from inside the bomb bay, also against regulations. Holland's navigator later brought the video {{to the attention of}} three Fairchild USAF officers. The first, Lieutenant Colonel Bullock, the current 325th Bomb Squadron commander, did not do anything about it and may have even tried to use the videotape as leverage to coerce the navigator into accepting a position as mission scheduler for the wing. The second, the deputy operations group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harper, told the crew member to conceal the evidence. The third, the DO, allegedly responded to reports of the video by stating, [...] "Okay, I don't want to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> video—I don't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 May 2011, {{after many}} whisperings {{about whether the}} movie would go ahead or not, Kaya Scodelario {{announced}} on Twitter [...] "I genuinely don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> have no idea if it's even happening." [...] Scodelario continued by saying, [...] "I would still love to do the Skins movie" [...] {{and that she would}} enjoy working with the cast again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{always wanted}} to see how things look over in that part of New York," [...] {{declared}} Tom, [...] "and if we run into that Andy Royce I'm going to question him and see if he <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> diamond ring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never dreamed}} of it, my dear; indeed, I didn't, when the old lady come here with her tantrums; but now, it's as plain as a pikestaff. If I'd a' <b>known</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> my dear, I shouldn't have made so free about Buggins; indeed, I shouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do {{you want}} to know? You musn't think about such things, a boy like you! It's a great pity <b>that</b> you ever <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Bittridge business. It's made you too bold. But it seems to have been meant to drag us down and humiliate us in every way." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the All-Star break, Walker {{participated in}} the Home Run Derby, placing second with 19 home runs. [...] Both he and Tony Gwynn of the Padres, also a selectee that year's All-Star Game, were batting near [...]400, and right fielders for teams in the National League West division. They were jointly interviewed, as batting [...]400 {{is one of the}} most {{difficult}} achievements in all of sports. [...] Asked just how challenging it is, Gwynn, known to be a very studious hitter, elaborated with what he later termed a [...] "complete dissertation." [...] Walker responded, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stuff. [...] I just hit the ball." [...] While neither player wound up achieving the statistic over any full season, Gwynn won that year's National League batting championship and Walker was second.|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s a {{very odd}} thing," [...] said Captain Sellers, shaking his head. [...] "I {{never lost a}} glue-pot before in my life—never. Do you <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> charwoman that’s helping you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{characters}} in the series are portrayed as knowing little, if anything, of Draper's history and true identity; Harry Crane remarks, [...] "Draper? Who <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> guy? No one's ever lifted that rock. He could be Batman for all we know." [...] Clues are given through flashbacks, confessions, and clandestine visits with figures from his past.|$|R
60|$|In {{one room}} only things were different, and neither Mrs. Ellis nor Mr. Harrison, {{nor any of}} the household, <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It was the {{principal}} guest-chamber on the first floor--a large and handsomely furnished apartment. Barely an hour ago it had been left in spotless order {{by a couple of}} painstaking servants. Just now it had another aspect.|$|R
500|$|In 2014 David Coulthard gave an {{interview}} to Charles Bradley in Autosport where he claimed that indeed an agreement between McLaren and Williams was in place. [...] "Ron [...] had made that deal with Frank , which none of us <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> if we helped Williams {{in their quest to}} beat Ferrari they wouldn't {{get in the way of}} helping McLaren. Ron would probably still deny it today. That's what happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Society!" [...] muttered the lad. [...] "I don't want to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I {{should like}} {{to make some money}} to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I hate it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> father," [...] said Polly. [...] "He's had his answer, and I'm {{thinking}} he won't ask for another." [...] Upon this the breeches-maker {{looked at his}} daughter, but made no other reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{would he}} <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Tom? He wasn't {{near the house}} when the ring was lost. And besides, if {{he had taken the}} ring, he wouldn't be so poverty-stricken. He could pawn a four-hundred-dollar ring for quite some money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{lot of new}} {{men have}} taken to racing <b>that</b> no one <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about.</b> <b>That</b> fellow who bought George's horse, for instance; you'd never have seen his nose in Tattersalls when I was a young man. I find when I go racing I don't know half the colours. It spoils the pleasure. It's no longer the close borough that it was. George had better take care what he's about. I can't imagine what we're coming to!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, nobody <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>THAT.</b> But {{one thing}} is certain, he doesn't go there any longer. And Rosemary didn't look well all the spring. I hope her visit to Kingsport will do her good. She's been gone {{for a month and}} will stay another month, I understand. I can't {{remember}} when Rosemary was away from home before. She and Ellen could never bear to be parted. But I understand Ellen insisted on her going this time. And meanwhile Ellen and Norman Douglas are warming up the old soup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe it was, Uncle Barney. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But I do {{know that}} Ruth has told me that her father never wanted nor tried to do you any injury. He claims {{that it was all}} a mistake, and that you should have given him a chance to explain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I don't <b>know</b> <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Captain," [...] said Burke, [...] "or {{what he is}} after, but I'm {{pretty sure}} that he won't dare {{to do anything to}} Shirley as long as I keep him in sight. And now I'm going to bear down on him again to hail him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> my friend. Maybe I was cut. I {{used to be}} {{drinking}} a good deal them days. Maybe I didn't say anything of the kind,--only it suited {{you to go back}} and tell her so. Anyways I disremember it altogether. Anyways he wasn't dead. And I ain't dead now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, they are. Think of Glasslough, or Popplecourt, or Hindes! If they <b>knew</b> <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>about</b> you <b>that</b> you didn't {{want to have}} known,--about a {{young lady}} or anything of that kind,--don't you think they'd tell everybody?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I be wrong? Did {{a period}} of idleness ever help a man in any profession? And is it not {{acknowledged}} by all who <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>that</b> continuous labour is more necessary in our profession than in any other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} a gang of road-cutters (who had been sent out by the towns interested in the route) came into town from Hazleton, and I had a talk with the boss, a very decent fellow, who gave a grim report of the trail beyond. He said: [...] "Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> trail. Jim Deacon, the head-man of our party when we left Hazleton, was only about seventy miles out, and cutting fallen timber like a man chopping cord wood, and sending back for more help. We are now going back to bridge and corduroy the places we {{had no time to}} fix as we came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking of stopping," [...] said I, [...] "I am {{very glad}} that I {{did not do}} as I was advised to do {{and go on to}} the Cheltenham. I do not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> hotel, but I am sure it is not so charming as this {{delightful}} little inn with its picturesque surroundings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, very well. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I saw {{him coming}} away from here, {{and it may}} be as well to tell you that I have made up my mind. Linda Tressel is not the sort of young woman that I took her to be, and I shall have nothing more to say to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no--he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>THAT.</b> That's {{half the}} battle here--that you can never hear politics. We don't talk them. I mean to poor young wretches of all sorts. And yet it's always as charming as this; it's as if, by {{something}} in the air, our squalor didn't show. It puts us all back--into the last century." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to have no fun of this," [...] said Foster Portney, with a grave shake of his head. [...] "If I <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> matters, <b>that</b> storm will be an extra heavy one." [...] And the events of the next hour proved that he was right.|$|R
60|$|ALICE HEMINGWAY. I {{am afraid}} {{he loves her}} very hard. That is why she is here. They had to send her away. Billy was making life miserable for her. They were little {{children}} together--playmates. And Billy has been, well, importunate. And Loretta, poor child, does not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> marriage. <b>That</b> is all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Margaret," [...] said he, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> is the {{crushing}} truth. I {{can find out}} nothing at all.

6000|$|... "A title? What do {{you mean}} by a title?" [...] asked Newman. [...] "A count, a duke, a marquis? I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I don't know who is and who is not. But I say I am noble. I don't exactly know what you mean by it, but it's a fine word and a fine idea; I put in a claim to it." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry had {{to admit}} that it was true that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> big cousin. If Grandfather Frog said that he had one, it must be so, for Grandfather Frog is very old and very wise, and he knows a great deal. Still, it was very hard for Jerry to believe that he had a big cousin of whom he had never heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Tom; but I do {{know that}} he acted the strangest. I {{asked him if he}} was working, and he said no-- that he had been unable to get a job of any kind. Then I {{questioned}} him about why he had left Hope, and he said it was because he could not get along with some of the hired help and with Miss Harrow." ...|$|E
