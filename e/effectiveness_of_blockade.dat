40|$|Background. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>blockade</b> of the {{inwardly}} rectifying K ' current (IK 1) in {{prevention of}} arrhythmias is unknown. We {{have examined the}} antiarrhythmic potential of a new selective IKI blocker, RP 58866, in rat, rabbit, and primate (marmoset) isolated hearts in the settings of acute ischemia and reperfusion. Methods and Results. In concentration-response studies (n= 12 per group), the drug reduced ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) in rat from control incidence of 100 to 50 %o, 17 % (p< 0. 05), and 0 % 7 (p< 0. 05) at 1, 3, and 10 gmol/L, respectively. RP 58866 produced significant bradycardia at the 3 - and 10 -,gmol/L concentrations and significant QT interval widening at all three concentrations (p< 0. 05). When rat hearts (n= 12 per group) were paced (5 Hz) via the left atrium to prevent bradycardia, the antiarrhythmic effects of 10 -,umol/L RP 58866 were unmodified (ischemia-induced VF incidence was reduced by drug from 83 % in control hearts to 8 %; p< 0. 05). Similarly, pacing did not prevent the drug's QT-widening activity at 90 % repolarization (QT 90 was 64 ± 3 msec in control hearts versus 128 ± 17 msec {{in the presence of}} 10,umol/L of drug after 10 minutes of ischemia; p<O. 05). These values are similar to equivalent values in unpaced hearts (65 ± 3 msec in control hearts versus 159 ± 15 msec with 10,umol/L of drug; p<O. 05). In separate groups of rat hearts (n= 10 per group) subjected to 10 minutes of ischemia...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The role of p 38 MAPK in ischemic {{preconditioning}} (IP) {{is still}} equivocal, {{insofar as the}} p 38 MAPK-inhibitor SB 203580 abolished IP in rats, rabbits and dogs, but not in pigs. Blockade of p 38 MAPK prior to the sustained ischemia also generated contradictory findings, insofar as p 38 MAPK acted as trigger in dogs but as mediator in rats. We have now tested whether the two structurally unrelated p 38 MAPK-inhibitors, BIX- 645 and SB 203580, abolished infarct size (IS) reduction by IP in pigs and whether their effects depended {{on the time of}} administration. METHODS: Sixty-five enflurane-anesthetized pigs underwent 90 min low-flow ischemia and 120 min reperfusion without or with one preceding cycle of 10 min preconditioning ischemia and 15 min reperfusion. Pigs received BIX- 645 (1 mg/kg, i. v.) or SB 203580 (10 microM, i. c.) prior to either IP or the sustained ischemia. RESULTS: IS (% TTC-staining) was reduced by IP [4. 8 +/- 3. 1 (S. E. M.), P < 0. 05] compared to placebo (25. 8 +/- 5. 5). BIX- 645 or SB 203580 per se had no effect on IS (23. 5 +/- 5. 2 and 21. 8 +/- 4. 4, respectively). IS reduction by IP was abolished by BIX- 645 (26. 2 +/- 6. 4 or 25. 5 +/- 4. 7) and SB 203580 (19. 9 +/- 4. 3 or 16. 7 +/- 4. 7), given either prior to IP or the sustained ischemia, respectively. The supernatant of homogenized myocardial biopsies taken during the sustained ischemia from preconditioned pigs receiving either BIX- 645 or SB 203580 inhibited the anisomycin-stimulated ATF- 2 phosphorylation in cultured Rat 1 fibroblasts. This in vitro inhibition of ATF- 2 phosphorylation correlated to the actual IS. CONCLUSION: The attenuation of the IS-reducing effect of IP depends on the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>blockade</b> of p 38 MAPK activity. p 38 MAPK is a mediator of IP in pig...|$|E

40|$|Endogenous opioid {{systems are}} {{implicated in the}} {{reinforcing}} effects of ethanol and may play a substantial role in modulating the central reinforcing effects of ethanol early in ontogeny. This possibility was explored {{in the present study}} through the use of an olfactory conditioning paradigm with centrally administered ethanol serving as an unconditioned stimulus (US). In Experiment 1, newborn rat pups were treated with either a selective mu antagonist CTOP or kappa selective antagonist nor-BNI prior to olfactory conditioning. Experiment 2 tested the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> an alternative, shorter-duration kappa opioid antagonist GNTI in altering ethanol reinforcement. Experiment 3 investigated whether the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> pharmacological <b>blockade</b> <b>of</b> opioid receptors was due to the disruption of learning per se using an olfactory aversive conditioning paradigm with intraoral quinine serving as a US. Central administration of either mu or kappa opioid antagonists prior to conditioning disrupted the reinforcing effects of ethanol in newborn rats. The kappa opioid antagonist GNTI was as effective as nor-BNI. These effects of opioid antagonists on ethanol reinforcement are unlikely to be due to a disruption of all types of conditioning, since CTOP did not affect aversive reinforcement to intraoral infusions of quinine. The present results support the hypothesis that in newborn rats, the reinforcing properties of ethanol are mediated by the endogenous activity at mu and kappa opioid receptors...|$|R

50|$|ASIC1a {{channels}} specifically open {{in response}} to pH 5.0-6.9 {{and contribute to the}} pathology of ischemic brain injury because their activation causes a small increase in Ca2+permeability and an inward flow of Ca2+. ASIC1a channels additionally facilitate the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptor channels upon initial depolarization, contributing to the major increase in intracellular calcium that results in cell death. A possible mechanism of ASIC1a channel-mediated cell death is due to the activation of other channels, leading to elevated Ca2+ which creates signaling pathways for apoptosis and necrosis in the cell. Gene knockout studies as well as ASIC blockades have shown to reduce brain infarct volume by as much as 60%, suggesting ASIC channels {{play a major role in}} the development of the pathological states resulting from acidosis and ischemia induced neuronal injury. The effects of both ASIC and NMDA blockades have been studied to determine the roles of both channels in Ca2+ toxicity and assess their respective contributions. The use <b>of</b> <b>blockade</b> for both channels provides greater neuroprotection than using a blockade for just one channel, and the ASIC <b>blockade</b> creates prolonged <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the NMDA <b>blockade.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) transformation into an inflammatory phenotype in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{is not fully}} understood. FLS interactions with invading leukocytes, particularly T cells, {{are thought to be}} a critical component of this pathological process. Resting T cells and T cells activated through the T-cell receptor have previously been shown to induce inflammatory cytokine production by FLS. More recently, a distinct population of T cells has been identified in RA synovium that phenotypically resembles cytokine-activated T (Tck) cells. Using time lapse microscopy, the interactions of resting, superantigen-activated, and cytokine-activated T cells with FLS were visualized. Rapid and robust adhesion of Tck and superantigen-activated T cells to FLS was observed that resulted in flattening of the T cells and a crawling movement on the FLS surface. Tck also readily activated FLS to produce interleukin IL- 6 and IL- 8 in a cell contact-dependent manner that was enhanced by exogenous IL- 17. Although LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 co-localized at the Tck-FLS synapse, blocking the LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 interaction did not substantially inhibit Tck effector function. However, antibody blocking of membrane tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α on the Tck surface did inhibit FLS cytokine production, thus illustrating a novel mechanism for involvement of TNF-α in cell-cell interactions in RA synovium and for the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> TNF-α <b>blockade</b> in the treatment of RA...|$|R

The effects <b>of</b> NMDA receptor <b>blockade</b> and ASIC 1 a blockade were compared. Specific ASIC 1 a blockade by the tarantula toxin psalmotoxin, PcTX, administered intracerebroventricularly as late as 5 h after 60 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reduced infarct volume by > 50 %; the protection persisted for at least 7 days. Protection was also demonstrated after permanent MCAO. In penumbral cortex alkaline pH preceded acid pH and infarction. Attenuating brain acidosis by NaHCO 3 or blocking ASIC 1 a with PcTX were both protective. NMDA blockade produced additive neuroprotection and the presence of PcTX prolonged the time window <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> NMDA <b>blockade.</b> Neuroprotection by PcTX was also achievable by intranasal administration.

Now that the acute manifestations of the disease generally can be controlled with immunosuppressive drugs, ANCA-associated vasculitis has become a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder. The need to develop safer and more effective treatment has led to great interest in the mediators of chronic inflammation. There are many lessons to be learned from studies of other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

These have culminated in the widespread introduction of anti-TNF therapy not only in RA but also in Crohn disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and several other chronic inflammatory disorders. Following a similar investigative pathway, studies that show the importance of TNF production by leukocytes and intrinsic renal cells in glomerulonephritis have been followed by the demonstration <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> TNF <b>blockade</b> in several experimental models of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis. In experimental autoimmune vasculitis, improvement in disease was paralleled by a reduction in leukocyte transmigration, as demonstrated by intravital microscopy. The benefit of infliximab (a mAb to TNF) in ANCA-associated vasculitis was recently reported in a prospective open-label study. However, the use of etanercept (a soluble TNF receptor fusion protein) was not found to be of significant benefit in a randomized, controlled trial in patients with Wegener granulomatosis. Therefore, there is a need for further evaluation of the use of anti-TNF antibodies in patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis...|$|R
40|$|Costimulation {{blockade}} is {{a promising}} strategy for preventing allograft rejection and inducing tolerance. Using a fully allogeneic mouse model, {{we tested the}} <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the combined <b>blockade</b> <b>of</b> the CD 40 ligand and the inducible costimulator (ICOS) on islet allograft survival and {{in the prevention of}} autoimmune diabetes in the NOD mouse. Recipients treated with blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to ICOS and the CD 40 ligand had significant prolongation of graft survival, with 26 of 28 functioning for > 200 days. Long-term engrafted mice maintained antidonor proliferative and cytotoxic responses, but donor-specific immunization did not induce graft rejection, and challenge with second, same donor but not third-party grafts resulted in long-term acceptance. The immunohistology of tolerant grafts demonstrated the presence of CD 4 +CD 25 + T-cells expressing Foxp 3, and islet/kidney composite grafts from tolerant mice, but not from mice lacking lymphocytes, were accepted indefinitely when transplanted into na B 6 mice, suggesting that recipient T-cells were necessary to generate dominant tolerance. Combined anti-ICOS and anti 9 ̆ 6 CD 40 ligand mAb therapy also prevented diabetes in NOD mice, with only 11...|$|R
