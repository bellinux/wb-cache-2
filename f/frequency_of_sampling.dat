50|$|The NMR {{measurement}} made by both {{a laboratory}} instrument and a logging tool {{follow the same}} principles very closely. An important feature of the NMR measurement is {{the time needed to}} acquire it. In the laboratory, time presents no difficulty. In a log, there is a trade-off between the time needed for polarization and acquisition, logging speed and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> The longer the polarization and acquisition, the more complete the measurement. However, the longer times require either lower logging speed or less frequent sampling.|$|E
50|$|Digital audio is {{composed}} of a rapid series of numeric samples that encode the changing amplitude of an audio waveform. To accurately represent a wideband waveform of substantial duration, digital audio requires {{a large number of}} samples at a high sample rate. The higher the rate, the more accurate the waveform; a lower rate requires the source analog signal to be low-pass filtered to limit the maximum frequency component in the signal, or else high-frequency components of the signal will be aliased. Specifically, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> (a.k.a. the sample rate) must be at least twice the maximum frequency component in the signal; this maximum signal frequency of one half the sampling frequency is called the Nyquist limit.|$|E

Then the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the fused images is quantifying and the spatial resolution of the image is determined based on the the variation <b>of</b> signal <b>frequency</b> in image fusion. The high frequency information in the high resolution image is the information with the frequency between the Nyquist <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> high <b>sampling</b> rate and the Nyquist <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> low <b>sampling</b> rate. Finally, some fusion methods and remote sensing images are used to validate the proposed method.

Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote [...] "With its loping, unthreatening hip-hop beats and its looped B.B. King sample, [...] "Standing" [...] had all the appeal of an adult novelty for most listeners—it {{was something that was}} out of the ordinary, to be sure, but not something that you would want to investigate much further. Sadly, Primitive Radio Gods' debut mini-album, Rocket, proves those doubters right." [...] Erlewine criticized the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> in the album, stating [...] "Most of Rocket sounds exactly like somebody messing around with a four-track, more intent on capturing sounds, not songs. Usually, this would at least result in some interesting sounds, but O'Connor hasn't even managed that", and concluded with [...] "At its core, Rocket sounds like a demo tape with one promising song".|$|E
5000|$|A phasor network {{consists}} of phasor measurement units (PMUs) dispersed throughout the electricity system, Phasor Data Concentrators (PDC) {{to collect the}} information and a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at the central control facility. Such a network is used in Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS), {{the first of which}} began in 2000 by the Bonneville Power Administration. [...] The complete network requires rapid data transfer within the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> of the phasor data. GPS time stamping can provide a theoretical accuracy of synchronization better than 1 microsecond. [...] "Clocks need to be accurate to ± 500 nanoseconds to provide the one microsecond time standard needed by each device performing synchrophasor measurement." [...] For 60 Hz systems, PMUs must deliver between 10 and 30 synchronous reports per second depending on the application. The PDC correlates the data, and controls and monitors the PMUs (from a dozen up to 60). [...] At the central control facility, the SCADA system presents system wide data on all generators and substations in the system every 2 to 10 seconds.|$|E
50|$|This {{section is}} more {{specific}} {{with regard to}} how the ground is investigated using methods such as excavating or drilling. <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> and testing can be decided with the following in mind, {{the determination of the}} character and structure of all the strata and ground water conditions, the determination of the properties of the strata and the use of special techniques should ‘normal’ techniques not give satisfactory results. Shallow trial pits go to a maximum depth of 4-5 metres, comprehensive records should include the location and orientation of the pit and the face logged. Samples should be taken as soon as the pit is opened and closed as soon as possible properly - there are however advantages to leaving them open for a time. Samples are taken from deep trial pits and shafts at certain sites if necessary and if below the water table can become a more complicated process. Boring augers are in common use. There are two types of rotary drilling, open hole drilling and core drilling. The selection of the type and method used can depend on ground conditions and time and cost constraints. Recovered cores should be maintained as near as possible to its natural state until it is stored. In most cases it is inevitably disturbed. Another method is wash boring which is most applicable to sands, silts, and clays. However, these are not representative of the character and consistency of the penetrated strata. Ground water conditions are determined from water level in boreholes and the use of standpipe, hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic piezometers. Water samples should be representative and stored in appropriate containers. Backfilling should be well compacted to obviate the flow of groundwater to any aquifer below and/or settlement. The use of cement based grout can be used - bentonite is also used to decrease shrinkage. Sampling quality can be classified to determine depending on their disturbance and other factors such as, wet or dry ground. Samplers should conform to the standard. Sampling takes different forms i.e. - continuous sampling, the sand and window sampler and block sampling. Due to the cost of sample acquisition, samples should be treated with great care. Good methods of handling and labelling should be established.|$|E

40|$|The {{exposure}} of general population in Croatia to ochratoxin A (OTA) was checked in several studies by measuring its concentration either in food samples or in human blood. The concentration of OTA {{in food and}} the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> OTA-positive <b>samples</b> show high variability {{from year to year}} according to the meteorological conditions. Regional variability in OTA contamination of cereals, wine and beans is also significant. However, while higher OTA concentrations and higher number <b>of</b> OTA-positive <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> cereals and beans are found {{in the northern part of}} Croatia, wine from the southern part of Croatia contains higher OTA concentrations. These differences are due to the distribution of different moulds, producers of OTA that specifically contaminate various commodities.

Practical maintenance data contains large number <b>of</b> censoring <b>samples,</b> information uncertainty <b>of</b> which makes it hard to evaluate reliability of aileron actuator. Considering that true lifetime <b>of</b> censoring <b>sample</b> has identical distribution with complete sample, if censoring sample is transformed into complete <b>sample,</b> conversion <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> censoring <b>sample</b> can be estimated according to <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>sample.</b> On the one hand, standard life table estimation and product limit method are improved on the basis <b>of</b> such conversion <b>frequency,</b> enabling accurate estimation <b>of</b> various censoring <b>samples.</b> On the other hand, by taking such <b>frequency</b> as one <b>of</b> the weight factors and integrating variance of order statistics under standard distribution, weighted least square estimation is formed for accurately estimating various censoring <b>samples.</b> Large amounts <b>of</b> experiments and simulations show that reliabilities of improved life table and improved product limit method are closer to the true value and more conservative; moreover, weighted least square estimate (WLSE), with conversion <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> censoring <b>sample</b> and variances <b>of</b> order statistics as the weights, can still estimate accurately with high proportion of censored data in samples.
