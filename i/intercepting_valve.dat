2500|$|Cross {{compound}} locomotives have {{a fundamental}} design issue, {{which is that}} if the HP cylinder is stopped [...] "on center", the locomotive cannot start. [...] To resolve this, all practical cross compound locomotives have some form of starting valve, which allows admission of HP steam into the LP cylinder on starting. [...] In some cases this is manually operated by the locomotive driver, while in other cases it is automatic; in the latter case the valve {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "intercepting valve". [...] The primary difference between various forms of cross compound locomotives is in the design and operation of the <b>intercepting</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|An <b>intercepting</b> <b>valve</b> was {{arranged}} in the high-pressure cylinder casting, {{through which the}} engine could be worked in simplex mode when required. Upon starting, the valve would feed boiler steam directly to the low-pressure cylinders for a few revolutions of the coupled wheels, just sufficient to give the engine additional power at starting, after which it automatically cut off and the working would become compound. By means of a steam cock in the cab, the driver could also admit boiler steam to the low-pressure cylinders for additional power while ascending steep inclines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{governor}} rate limits {{may result in}} slow response that interacts {{with that of a}} reheat turbine to create unstable frequency oscillations. The origin of these oscillations is explained with a linear analogue, while nonlinear simulation shows that the oscillations evolve into a limit cycle due to gate limits. A control scheme to stabilize the frequency oscillations through control of the <b>intercept</b> <b>valve</b> is developed and tested in the paper...|$|R
50|$|The {{first four}} had Stephenson valve gear inside and Walschaerts valve gear outside, while the {{following}} 53 had just Walschaerts. The first eight locomotives were built at New Zealand Railways Department's Addington Workshops, the rest by A & G Price of Thames. The first twenty-seven were built with <b>intercepting</b> <b>valves</b> allowing full simple operation. This feature was later removed from {{all but the}} first four, and the last thirty were built without and classified as AD until 1915.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the automatic devices, alarms, and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet stop and control valves, the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant overspeed protection instrumentation and controls and the main steam and reheat steam control and stop valving arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for overspeed protection. The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine overspeed condition above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4. Assessment of the risk to essential plant systems and struc-tures from potential turbine missiles is reviewed under SRP Section 3. 5. 1. 3. 1. The PSB reviews the turbine generator system and the components and subsystems normally provided with this equipment with respect to the following considera-tions: a. The general arrangement of the turbine and associated equipment with respect to safety-related structures and systems and balance of plant. b. The types and locations of main steam stop and control valves, reheat stop and <b>intercept</b> <b>valves,</b> and associated piping arrangements...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{transients}} which {{are expected to}} occul with moderate frequency result in unplanned decreases in heat removal by the secondary system. Each transient covered in this SRP section should be discussed in individual sections of the safety analysis report (SAR), {{as required by the}} Standard Format (Ref. 1). The transients to be evaluated are: 1. Loss of External Load In a loss of external load event an electrical disturbance causes loss of a signif-icant portion of the generator load. This loss of load situation is different from the loss of ac power condition considered in Standard Review Plan (SRP) Section 15. 2. 6 in that offsite ac power remains available to operate the station auxiliaries (such as reactor coolant pumps). The onsite emergency diesels are therefore not required for the loss of external load transient. Immediate fast closure of the turbine control <b>valves</b> (TCV) and <b>intercept</b> <b>valves</b> is initiated whenever a loss of generator load takes place. For a boiling. water reactor (BWR), a fast TCV closure (0. 150 - 0. 2 sec) causes a sudden reduction in steam flow and results in a reactor pressure surge. For a BWR without select rod insert (SRI), reactor scram occurs. For a pressurized water reactor (PWR) there is also a sudden reduction in steam flow, and this causes the pressure and temperature in the shell side of the steam generator to increase. The latter effect, in turn, results in an increase in reactor coolant temperature, a decrease in coolant density, an increase in water volume in the pressurizer, and an increase in reactor coolant pressure. For a PWR with an integrated control system, reactor power can be run back to a lower level on TCV closure...|$|R
40|$|The District Meter Areas (DMA) {{design is}} an {{innovative}} methodology of water networks management, {{based on the}} pressure patterns control and on the water flows monitoring, {{in order to reduce}} water losses and to optimize the water systems management. A District Meter Area is an area supplied from few water inputs, into which discharges can be easily measured to determine leaks. So, the DMA design represents an alternative to the traditional approach based on heavy looped distribution network. In the present paper the DMA design of the “Napoli Est” water distribution system (approximately 65. 000 ÷ 70. 000 customers), performed {{with the support of the}} Water Agency ARIN S. p. A., is discussed. After analysis of authorized consumption, by means of a monitoring campaign of water flows over the area, the system water balance was performed, showing significant water losses, as a consequence of high pressure patterns. This situation was confirmed by the high number of maintenance operations performed in the area during the year 2005. In order to characterize the piezometric heads on the network, ARIN S. p. A. supplied to the installation of six pressure transducers in the most vulnerable areas. The water level in the supply reservoir was also measured in order to estimate its influence on the network pressure heads. Hydraulic simulations were carried out with the EPANET software version 2. 0 applied to a network layout resulted from the system “skeletonization”, achieved by eliminating out of order pipes, integrating pipelines of same diameter and roughness, replacing dead-end branches and small networks supplied by a single junction with an equivalent discharge. After the skeletonizated network was calibrated, several hypothesis of designing and implementing DMA to reduce physical losses were performed, providing adequate operating pressure of the system. Many numerical simulations were performed to guarantee adequate head pressure especially for peak hours demand, break of transmission mains and fire hydrant service. A chlorine residuals analysis was also effected, by simulating the transport and decay of chlorine through the network. District Meter Areas, therefore, were designed, and the corresponding hydraulic and water quality investigations and simulations were carried out. Six District Meter Areas were planned, assembling 14 <b>intercepting</b> <b>valves</b> and 9 pressure reducing valves to prevent the downstream pressure head from exceeding the set value, achieving a remarkable water saving, approximately equal to 34...|$|R
50|$|The Von Borries system {{consisted}} of a combined <b>intercepting</b> and starting <b>valve</b> which, when starting, automatically admitted boiler steam into the receiver pipe between the high- and low-pressure cylinders. When the high-pressure cylinder began to exhaust steam into the receiver pipe, the starting valve was automatically closed and normal compound working ensued. A Von Borries compound could not work as simplex at starting because the high-pressure cylinder exhausted into a closed receiver pipe under all conditions. In this respect, the Von Borries system differed essentially from four-cylinder compound systems for locomotives, {{in which the two}} high-pressure cylinders could be made to exhaust to atmosphere by means of a relief valve, operated from the cab by the driver.|$|R
