5|$|Many {{insects are}} parasites of other insects {{such as the}} {{parasitoid}} wasps. These insects are known as <b>entomophagous</b> parasites. They can be beneficial due to their devastation of pests that can destroy crops and other resources. Many insects have a parasitic relationship with humans such as the mosquito. These insects are known to spread diseases such as malaria and yellow fever and because of such, mosquitoes indirectly cause more deaths of humans than any other animal.|$|E

Evidence suggests that evolutionary precursors of Homo sapiens were also <b>entomophagous.</b> Insectivory also features to various degrees amongst extant primates, such as marmosets and tamarins, and some researchers suggest that the earliest primates were nocturnal, arboreal insectivores.

25|$|Like many ant-eating animals, the numbat has {{an unusually}} long, narrow tongue, coated with sticky saliva {{produced}} by large submandibular glands.

The digestive system is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other <b>entomophagous</b> animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton. Numbats are apparently able to gain a considerable amount of water from their diets, since their kidneys lack the usual specialisations for retaining water found in other animals living in their arid environment. Numbats also possess a sternal scent gland, which may be used for marking their territories.|$|E

50|$|Insects form an {{important}} part of the food chain, especially for <b>entomophagous</b> vertebrates such as many mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. Insects play {{an important}} role in maintaining community structure and composition; in the case of animals by transmission of diseases, predation and parasitism, and in the case of plants, through phytophagy and by plant propagation through pollination and seed dispersal. From an anthropocentric point of view, insects compete with humans; they consume as much as 10% of the food produced by man and infect one in six humans with a pathogen.|$|E
50|$|The larvae, {{like those}} of other Asiloidea, have an <b>entomophagous</b> diet and they live as predators. They are {{generally}} found on dry, sandy soils and dry litter.

The observation of the behaviour of known forms highlights voracious feeding and agile movements. When exposed to light, the larvae of the Therevidae dig back into the substrate with rapid movements.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} {{takes place in}} 1-3 years. The postembryonic {{development}} consists of four larval stages (instars) and one pupa. The larvae of the first instar differ from other stages in both ethology and trophic regime. The larvae of most known asilids live in the soil {{or in the case}} of some taxonomic groups, in rotting organic material, usually wood and the bark of dead trees. With regard to feeding behavior, most of the literature gives the larvae of the Asilidae as <b>entomophagous,</b> but there are doubts about the real nature of the trophic regime and its mechanisms. The entomophagy of some species had indeed been already hypothesized by some authors of the nineteenth century, based on the findings of larvae of asilids associated with larvae of other insects, but Melin (1923) asserted that, in reality, predation was occasional and secondary to the plant-based diet. More recent studies have confirmed the entomophagy of some asilids without extending this species's feeding behavior for the whole family. Less certain, however, is the mechanism of implementing entomophagy: in general, the behavior is cited as predation, but for some species may be ectoparasitoids. Musso (1983) described the feeding behavior of the larvae of Machimus rusticus and its evolution during postembryonic development : in particular, the larvae of the first instar does not feed on insects, those of the second instar feed on secretions by larvae of beetles (and may cause death), while the larvae of the third and fourth instars actually behave like predators. In short, the feeding behavior of larval asilids can configure as intermediate between predation and ectoparasitism.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePopulations of herbivorous {{insects are}} {{naturally}} consumed by other predacious or predatory insect species. These <b>entomophagous</b> insects are thus plant-dwelling organisms {{that use the}} plant for several vital functions and are affected by plant traits at the evolutionary, organism and population levels. Many <b>entomophagous</b> species are used for the biological control of insect pests worldwide. The aim of this chapter is to provide an exhaustive review of mechanisms underlying the interactions between plants and <b>entomophagous</b> insects, including those governing life history traits at the individual level, {{as well as those}} acting on population and community structure and dynamics. We detail how properties of host-infested plants determine parasitism behaviour, development (in the case of parasitoids) and nectar consumption by adult <b>entomophagous</b> insects. We detail how plants respond to and benefit from natural enemies attacking insect herbivores. We also illustrate how plant architecture, the vegetation communities and their climatic correlates can influence predator and parasitoid behaviour and populations. This chapter considers the biology and ecology of the interactions and mentions some implications for the biological control of plant pests...|$|E

40|$|A tissue {{sampling}} protocol has been devised {{for studying the}} functional surfaces of chiropteran small intestine and drawing comparisons within and between species. The goal was to obtain minimally biased stereological estimates of villous and microvillous surface areas and the numbers of microvilli. The approach is illustrated using the intestines of 3 bats (from frugivorous and <b>entomophagous</b> groups) {{and is based on}} the use of vertical sections and cycloid test arcs. A sampling scheme with 3 levels was employed. At level 1 (macroscopy), primary mucosal area was estimated from intestinal length and perimeter. Amplification factors due to villi were estimated at level 2 (light microscopy, LM) whilst microvillous amplifications were estimated at level 3 (transmission electron microscopy, TEM). The absolute surfaces, lengths and diameters of microvilli were used to calculate packing densities and absolute numbers. Estimated villous surface areas of the entire small intestine were 44. 4 cm 2 (Miniopterus inflatus, <b>entomophagous),</b> 410 cm 2 (Epomophorus wahlbergi, frugivorous) and 237 cm 2 (Lisonycteris angolensis, frugivorous). Corresponding microvillous surface areas were 0. 11, 1. 69 and 1. 01 m 2 whilst the numbers of microvilli per intestine were 4. 5, 23. 4 and 8. 8 x 10 (11).

40|$|The {{disposability}} of {{high numbers}} of <b>entomophagous</b> insects for their use in biological control strategies is an old objective carried on, between others, by the rearing in different kinds of artificial diets. The definition and the perfecting of these diets are at first based on nutritional studies. Food or carcass analyses, nutritional balance studies, and deletion/supplementation methods allow to evaluate the different nutritional needs. Nitrogen sources are the most critical needs especially with fast growing <b>entomophagous</b> insects. Lipids and carbohydrates mainly constitute energy sources with storage possibility. Other nutrients such as salts and vitamins are also needed, and sometimes some specific polyunsaturated fatty acids. There are other important physiological requirements, concerning the digestion process, the respiration, or the hormonal balances. Physico-chemical factors such as Osmotic Pressure and pH often show critical values for the normal development, mostly of endoparasitoid insects. For egg parasitoids and predators, {{the presentation of the}} food is of prime importance for a normal food intake, and finally for the success of the rearing. Sterilization of the diet or incorporation of preservative agents is often necessary for preventing bacterial or fungal contaminations. Many successes were obtained for artificial rearing of <b>entomophagous</b> insects, but ultimate efforts are still needed for crucial improvements and supports that may lead to the extension of the use of this biological control strategy...|$|E
