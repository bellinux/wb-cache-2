5000|$|Fail active {{operational}} can {{be installed}} on systems (such as aircraft AutoLand systems) that have {{a high degree of}} redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active operational) and a second failure can be detected - at which point the system will turn itself off (uncouple, <b>fail</b> <b>passive).</b> One way of accomplishing this is to have [...] "three of everything." ...|$|E
5000|$|If {{a single}} failure occurs below {{decision}} height AUTOLAND FAULT will be displayed, however {{at that point}} the aircraft is committed to landing and the autoland system will remain engaged, controlling the aircraft on only two systems until the pilot completes the rollout and brings the aircraft to a full stop on the runway or turns off the runway onto a taxiway. This is termed [...] "fail active." [...] However, in this state the autoland system is [...] "one fault away" [...] from disengaging so the AUTOLAND FAULT indication should inform the flight crew to monitor the system behavior very carefully and be ready to take control immediately. The system is still fail active and is still performing all necessary cross checks so that if one of the flight control computers decides that {{the right thing to do}} is order a full deflection of a control surface, the other computer will detect that there is a difference in the commands and this will take both computers off line (<b>fail</b> <b>passive)</b> at which time the flight crew must immediately take control of the aircraft as the automatic systems have done the safe thing by taking themselves off line.|$|E
50|$|PowerHA can run {{on up to}} 32 {{computers}} or nodes, each {{of which}} is either actively running an application (active) or waiting to take over when another node <b>fails</b> (<b>passive).</b> Data on file systems can be shared between systems in the cluster.|$|R
30|$|The re-association process uses {{fixed length}} orphan scan on each {{physical}} channel {{to discover the}} parent coordinator and re-synchronize with it. If orphan scan <b>fails,</b> <b>passive</b> scan is then used to find new coordinator. Because mobile node cannot re-synchronize with parent coordinator after cell change, performing orphan scan is unnecessary and time-consuming.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{utilization of}} manipulators in hazardous or hard-to-reach environments ha e {{led to a}} corresponding increase {{on the study of}} fault tolxant control methods for these mechanisms, ranging from robot design and trajectory planning to fault detection and isolation and post-failure control algorithms. [n this article we focus on post-failure control of a mechanical manipulator {{from the point of view}} of optimal control, and present a novel method for controlling the positions of the <b>failed,</b> <b>passive</b> joints, in an optimal way.

5000|$|From an {{avionics}} safety perspective, a CAT IIIc landing is the [...] "worst-case scenario" [...] {{for safety}} analysis because {{a failure of}} the automatic systems from flare through the roll-out could easily result in a [...] "hard over" [...] (where a control surface deflects fully in one direction.) This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason Autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected - at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, <b>fail</b> <b>passive).</b> One way of accomplishing this is to have [...] "three of everything." [...] Three ILS receivers, three radio altimeters, three flight control computers, and three ways of controlling the flight surfaces. The three flight control computers all work in parallel and are in constant cross communications, comparing their inputs (ILS receivers and radio altimeters) with those of the other two flight control computers. If there is a difference in inputs, then a computer can [...] "vote out" [...] the deviant input and will notify the other computers that [...] "RA1 is faulty." [...] If the outputs don't match, a computer can declare itself as faulty and, if possible, take itself off line.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} fipexide, {{administered}} at different intervals after the learning {{trial of a}} single step-through type passive avoidance situation was studied. The administration of fipexide immediately after the learning trial resulted in a long-lasting facilitation of passive avoidance behaviour. On the contrary, the administration of this compound 1 h prior to the retention test <b>failed</b> to influence <b>passive</b> avoidance behaviour. The results suggest that fipexide facilitates memory consolidation but does not influence retrieval processes...|$|R
30|$|Another {{interesting}} work {{trying to}} detect the existence of hypervisor is also named “hypervisor introspection” (HI) (Wang et al. 2015), but the concept is different with our HVI. HI uses the “VM suspend side-channel” {{to detect the}} existence of passive VMI, thus an attacker can execute the malicious activity in the interval of monitoring. However, the author also clearly states that the HI method could not defend active introspection which HVI does, and it may also <b>fail</b> when the <b>passive</b> VMI randomizes monitoring interval.|$|R
40|$|IT {{was shown}} by Ando and Baba (1969) that {{antiserum}} obtained by immunising chickens with Pasteurella multocida did not inhibit {{the growth of}} P. multocida in vitro, and <b>failed</b> to produce <b>passive</b> immunity in normal chickens. The present paper describes investigations into the immune mechanisms of chickens against P. multocida involving either {{the removal of the}} bursa of Fabricius, which controls humoral immunity, or the thymus, which controls cellular immunity.

I explore an analysis in which the shapes follow from general conditions on the shape of the verb, without specific statements for categories such as "suffixed ALIGNMENT AND WEIGHT IN THE TIGRINYA VERB STEM 3 imperfective" or "passive imperfective".

40|$|The Personal Body. Attached Liquid Liquidator (PBALL) is {{conceived}} as a passive, capillary driven contingency wastewater disposal device.

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out {{evaluating}} the protective activity of immunization with common enterobacterial antigen (CA) against challenge with heterologous gram-negative bacilli. Active immunization of mice with Escherichia coli 0 : 14 elicited titers of antibody to CA of 1 : 640 or greater but completely failed to enhance resistance to challenge by mouse virulent strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae or E. coli. Similarly, two lots, 324 and 422, of rabbit antisera to CA <b>failed</b> to afford <b>passive</b> protection to mice challenged with K. pneumoniae or E. coli. A third lot, 166, of rabbit antisera to CA did passively protect mice. The protective activity of antisera 166 was demonstrated to reflect its content of antibody to another cross-reactive antigen, Re determinant, of gram-negative bacilli which has previously been shown to protect against infections with heterologous bacilli rather than any protective effect of antibody to CA. These studies failed to demonstrate any protective activity of antibody to CA against challenge with heterologous CA containing gram-negative bacilli...|$|R
40|$|Underactuated {{manipulators}} are robot manipulators {{composed of}} both active and passive joints. The advantages of using such systems {{reside in the}} fact that they weight less and consume less energy than their fully-actuated counterparts, thus being useful for applications such as space robotics. Another interest reside in the reliability or fault-tolerant design of fully-actuated manipulators. If any of the joint actuators of such a device fails, one degree of freedom of the system is lost. It is usual in this situation to simply brake the failed joint and try to resume the task with less degrees of freedom available [7]. Following the methodology proposed in this work, the <b>passive</b> (<b>failed)</b> joint can still be controlled via the dynamic coupling with the active joints, and so the system can still make use of all of its degrees of freedom originally planned. The methodology proposed in this paper uses the dynamic coupling between the passive and the active joints in order to bring the pass [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria {{isolated}} from potato tubers <b>fail</b> to undergo <b>passive</b> osmotic swelling when suspended in isotonic Na+ acetate or phosphate, in NaCl following addition of tripropyltin, or in Na+ nitrate following addition of an uncoupler. Swelling under {{each of these}} conditions in mitochondria from other sources {{has been attributed to}} the inward movement of Na+ on an endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger. Such a monovalent cation/H+ exchanger has also been implicated in respiration-dependent cation extrusion and contraction of swollen mitochondria. Potato mitochondria swollen in chloride and nitrate salts extrude ions and contract when respiration is initiated. The contraction reaction is slower and less efficient than that in beef heart mitochondria, but like the latter, is sensitive to uncouplers and stimulated by nigericin, butacaine, and Mg 2 +. These comparative studies suggest that a cation+/H+ exchanger is present in potato tuber mitochondria, but that it functions exclusively as a cation-extruding mechanism. They further suggest that cation+/H+ exchange activity is not identical in mitochondria from different sources and that these exchange components may have a directionality and regulatory features which differ with the metabolic needs of the source tissue...|$|R
40|$|Semiactive {{vibration}} dampers offer an attractive compromise between the simplicity and <b>fail</b> safety of <b>passive</b> devices, and the weight, cost, {{and complexity of}} fully active systems. In addition, the dissipative nature of semiactive dampers ensures they always remain stable under closed loop control, unlike their fully active counterparts, However undesirable limit cycle behavior remains a possibility, which is not always property considered during the controller design. Smart fluids provide an elegant means to produce semiactive damping, since their resistance to flow can be directly controlled by the application of an electric or magnetic field. However the nonlinear behavior of smart fluid dampers {{makes it difficult to}} design effective controllers, and so a wide variety of control strategies has been proposed in the literature. In general, this work has overlooked the possibility of undesirable limit cycle behavior under closed loop conditions. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate how the experimentally observed limit cycle behavior of smart dampers can be predicted and explained by appropriate nonlinear models. The study is based upon a previously developed feedback control strategy, but the techniques described are relevant to other forms of smart damper control...|$|R
40|$|On Saturday 7 February 2009, 173 {{people lost}} their lives and more than 2000 houses were {{destroyed}} in bushfires (wildfires) in the Australian State of Victoria. The scale of life and property loss raised fundamental questions about community bushfire safety in Australia, in particular {{the appropriateness of the}} &lsquo;Prepare, stay and defend or leave early&rsquo; policy. This paper presents findings from research undertaken as part of the Australian Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre&rsquo;s (CRC) &lsquo; 2009 Victorian Bushfires Research Taskforce&rsquo;. The research examined factors influencing patterns of life and property loss and survival across the fires through mail surveys (n&frac 14; 1314) of fire affected households. Just over half of the respondents (53 %) stayed to defend their homes and properties, whereas the remainder left before or when the fires arrived (43 %) or sheltered in a house, structure, vehicle, or outside (4 %). Results reveal a survival rate of 77 % for houses that were defended by one or more household members, compared to 44 % for unattended houses. The paper identifies inadequate planning and preparedness and the tendency for people to wait until they are directly threatened before taking action as major factors leading to late evacuation, <b>failed</b> defence and <b>passive</b> shelter...|$|R
40|$|Laterally {{spreading}} nonliquefied crusts can exert large loads on {{pile foundations}} causing major damage to structures. While monotonic load tests of pile caps indicate that full passive resistance may be mobilized by displacements {{on the order of}} 1 – 7 % of the pile cap height, dynamic centrifuge model tests show that much larger relative displacements may be required to mobilize the full passive load from a laterally spreading crust onto a pile group. The centrifuge models contained six-pile groups embedded in a gently sloping soil profile with a nonliquefied crust over liquefiable loose sand over dense sand. The nonliquefied crust layer spread downslope on top of the liquefied sand layer, and <b>failed</b> in the <b>passive</b> mode against the pile foundations. The dynamic trace of lateral load versus relative displacement between the “free-field” crust and pile cap is nonlinear and hysteretic, and depends on the cyclic mobility of the underlying liquefiable sand, ground motion characteristics, and cyclic degradation and cracking of the nonliquefied crust. Analytical models are derived to explain a mechanism by which liquefaction of the underlying sand layer causes the soil-to-pile-cap interaction stresses to be distributed through a larger zone of influence in the crust, thereby contributing to the softer load transfer behavior. The analytical models distinguish between structural loading and lateral spreading conditions. Load transfer relations obtained from the two analytical models reasonably envelope the responses observed in the centrifuge tests...|$|R
40|$|Tight-seal whole-cell patch clamp {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} investigate the mechanism whereby passive depletion of stores activates the Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + current (ICRAC) in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells. Passive depletion of stores was achieved by dialysing cells with different concentrations of Ca 2 + chelators. Low concentrations generally evoked a submaximal ICRAC, which developed slowly and monophasically. Higher concentrations resulted in a biphasic current in which the initial slow monophasic component developed into a faster and bigger second phase. The kinetics of ICRAC {{as well as its}} final amplitude were not affected by Ca 2 + chelators that had different affinities or speeds of binding. Exogenous Ca 2 + binding ratios ≥ 16 670 were necessary to fully activate ICRAC. Because the Ca 2 + binding ratio within the stores is presumably low, this indicates that other factors like Ca 2 + transport across the stores membrane are rate limiting for passive store depletion. Heparin and Ruthenium Red both <b>failed</b> to affect <b>passive</b> Ca 2 + leak from the intracellular stores. Treatment with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) pump blockers dramatically altered the kinetics of activation of biphasic currents, and increased the amplitude of monophasic ones. Our results suggest that SERCA pumps are very effective in preventing ICRAC from activating passively, and are responsible for the phasic nature of the current, its time course of development and its overall extent...|$|R
40|$|Picornaviruses are {{a family}} of positive-strand RNA viruses that are {{responsible}} for a variety of devastating human and animal diseases. An attenuated strain of mengovirus (vMC 24) is serologically indistinguishable from the lethal murine wild-type mengovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Immunogen-specific stimulation of vMC 24 -immune splenocytes in vitro demonstrates preferential activation of CD 4 + lymphocytes. vMC 24 -immune splenocytes adoptively transferred to naive recipients conferred protection against lethal EMCV challenge. Immune splenocytes, expanded in vitro, were > 92 % CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of these expanded cells engendered protection against lethal challenge. In vivo depletion of CD 4 + T lymphocytes prior to lethal challenge abrogated survival of transfer recipients, confirming that CD 4 + T lymphocytes were essential for protection. Subsequent rechallenge of vMC 24 -immune splenocyte recipients with a greater EMCV dose elicited serum neutralizing antibody titers paralleling the high titers observed in vMC 24 -immunized mice. Unexpectedly, an augmented humoral response was absent in vMC 24 -specific CD 4 + T-cell recipients after the secondary challenge. Moreover, comparably low serum neutralizing antibody titers <b>failed</b> to protect <b>passive</b> transfer recipients when correspondingly challenged. vMC 24 -immune splenocytes expanded in vitro (> 94 % CD 4 +) lysed vMC 24 -infected A 20. J target cells. The ability to transfer protection with primed CD 4 + T cells, in the absence of primed B lymphocytes or immune sera, is novel for picornaviral infections. Consequently, mechanisms such as CD 4 + cytolytic T-lymphocyte activity are implicated in mediating protection...|$|R
40|$|The rifting cycle initiates {{with stress}} buildup, release as {{earthquakes}} and/or magma intrusions/eruptions, and visco-elastic rebound, multiple episodes of which combine {{to produce the}} observed, time-averaged rift zone architecture. The aim of our synthesis of current research initiatives into continental rifting-to-rupture processes is to quantify the time and length scales of faulting and magmatism that produce the time-averaged rift structures imaged in active, <b>failed</b> rifts and <b>passive</b> margins worldwide. We compare and contrast seismic and geodetic strain patterns during discrete, intense rifting episodes in magmatic and amagmatic sectors of the East African rift zone that span early- to late-stage rifting. We also examine the longer term rifting cycle {{and its relation to}} changing far-field extension directions with examples from the Rio Grande rift zone and other cratonic rifts. Over time periods of millions of years, periods of rotating regional stress fields are marked by a lull in magmatic activity and a temporary halt to tectonic rift opening. Admittedly, rifting cycle comparisons are biased by the short time scale of global seismic and geodetic measurements, which span {{a small fraction of the}} 102 – 105 year rifting cycle. Within rift sectors with upper crustal magma chambers beneath the central rift valley (e. g., Main Ethiopian, Afar, and Eastern or Gregory rifts) seismic energy release accounts for a small fraction of the deformation; most of the strain is accommodated by magma intrusion and slow-slip. Magma intrusion processes appear to decrease the time period between rifting episodes, effectively accelerating the rift to rupture process. Thus, the inter-seismic period in rift zones with crustal magma reservoirs is strongly dependent upon the magma replenishment cycle. This comparison also demonstrates that intense rifting events, both magmatic and amagmatic, produce the long-term fault displacements and maintain the along-axis rift architecture through repeated episodes. The magmatic events in particular accommodate centuries of inter-seismic strain, implying that inter-seismic-plate opening rates in late stage rifts should be extrapolated to the past with caution...|$|R
