25|$|The airport {{passenger}} terminal has four <b>jetway</b> gates (two {{of which are}} operational) and two ramp level gates for regional carriers. The terminal also houses two baggage carousels and a TSA installed passenger and baggage screening system.|$|E

50|$|By using a {{retractable}} tunnel design, loading bridges may retract {{and extend}} varying lengths. Some airports use fixed walkways to effectively extend {{the reach of}} a loading bridge. The fixed walkway extends out from the terminal building and connects to the loading bridge rotunda. Occasionally, fixed bridges lead to multiple loading bridges. There are some <b>jetways</b> (such as several older bridges on the north terminal at Edmonton International Airport) that sit directly on the ground, as opposed to supports. These <b>jetways</b> are often used by small airlines or airplanes that are sometimes too low for conventional <b>jetways</b> (such as the Dash 8 and CRJ).|$|R
25|$|The airport {{recently}} completed a US$22 million renovation, including, among other things, larger gates, new plumbing, and building <b>jetway</b> loading bridges as previous boarding and deplaning required all passengers to walk across the tarmac to their gates.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1960s (1968–70), the only Oldsmobile professionally {{made into a}} {{limousine}} was the Toronado, known as the AQC <b>Jetway</b> 707. The 707 rode on six wheels. Between 52 and 150 were {{believed to have been}} built.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major method}} of cost {{reduction}} was to utilize secondary airports, which are generally less congested and charge less to lease space {{though they may}} be farther from the advertised destination. To save even more money at the airport, passengers boarded directly from the apron instead of using the <b>jetway,</b> saving both loading/unloading time as well as operating costs. Finally, ticket sales were entirely online. This not only saved on employee costs, but completely eliminated the need for a reservations call center.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} named after Sitka's former mayor Rocky Gutierrez. It {{features}} a single terminal with <b>jetway</b> with air service operated year round by Alaska Airlines and seasonally by Delta Air Lines regional affiliate Delta Connection operated by SkyWest Airlines. There is a single paved runway located on a causeway that juts off Japonski Island. Deceased tuberculosis patients from the nearby SEARHC/Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital were buried on airport grounds {{and had to be}} relocated during construction. That section of the airport is still unofficially called The Mausoleum.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 2005, forty-four-year-old Rigoberto Alpizar, a {{passenger}} aboard American Airlines Flight 924, {{claimed to have}} a bomb in his carry-on luggage while boarding the flight's second leg to Orlando, Florida after arriving on a flight from Quito, Ecuador; the flight had just arrived from Medellín, Colombia.

5000|$|The Main Terminal is {{used for}} all {{commercial}} flights, domestic and international. It has two <b>jetways</b> and 3 remote positions.|$|R
25|$|In December 2002, a new International Arrivals Building opened west of Terminal B. This {{structure}} {{houses the}} Federal Inspection Station and has one <b>jetway</b> for deboarding aircraft. Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft {{as large as}} a Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, which included the building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB. International departures will be handled from the existing terminal complex.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 3 {{uses the}} <b>Jetway</b> system. The overall layout {{is similar to}} that of {{airports}} in Europe and North America, with multiple levels and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by escalators and moving walkways. The upper level departures hall, with an area of over , is equipped with 110 check-in counters and as well as flight information display systems. A small shopping mall, known as Buy & Bye, is open to both travellers and the general public. The mall, which includes shops, restaurants and a post office, was planned to be a draw for non-flyers too. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. The arrivals hall is located on the ground floor where there are also 20 additional check-in counters (serving Star Alliance airlines). Car rental counters are located in an intermediate level situated between the departing and arriving passenger halls. Terminal 3 has two synagogues.|$|E
25|$|The International Terminal is {{composed}} of Boarding Areas A and G. The terminal was designed by Craig W. Hartman of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and opened in December 2000 to replace the International Departures section of Terminal 2. It is the largest international terminal in North America, and is the largest building in the world built on base isolators to protect against earthquakes. Food service focuses on quick service versions of leading San Francisco Bay Area restaurants, following other SFO terminals. Planners attempted to make the airport a destination in and of itself, not just for travelers who are passing through. The international terminal is a common-use facility, with all gates and all ticketing areas shared among international airlines and several domestic carriers. Common-use terminal equipment (CUTE) is used at check-in counters and gates. All international arrivals and departures are handled here (except flights from cities with customs preclearance). The International Terminal houses the airport's BART station, adjacent to the garage leading to Boarding Area G. The SFO Medical Clinic is located next to the security screening area of Boarding Area A. All the gates in this terminal {{have at least two}} <b>jetway</b> bridges except gates A2 and A10, which have one. Gates A1, A3, and A11 can accommodate two aircraft. Six of the gates are designed for the Airbus A380, making SFO one of the first airports in the world with such gates when it was built in 2000. Gates A9 (9A, 9B, 9C) and G101 (101A, 101B, 101C) have three jetways for boarding. Four other gates have two jetways fitted for A380 service.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{completing}} the repair and run-up of the faulty engine {{that had caused}} a rejected takeoff due to an engine oil warning at Berlin Tegel during the late 1980s, a Dan-Air Boeing 727-200 Adv collided with a <b>jetway</b> at the airport's terminal building while maintenance engineers taxied the aircraft back to its stand. This badly injured the ground crew member manning the <b>jetway</b> and ruptured the fully refuelled aircraft's centre wing tank at the left wing root. As a result, a large quantity of jet fuel spilled onto the tarmac. The maintenance engineers' failure to pressurise the aircraft's hydraulics had resulted in a complete loss of hydraulic pressure just before reaching the stand, {{making it impossible to}} steer the aircraft and rendering the brakes ineffective. > Captain Alan Carter] ...|$|E

2500|$|The jet age {{arrived at}} SFO in March 1959 when TWA {{introduced}} Boeing 707-131 jetliners with nonstop service to New York Idlewild Airport (which was subsequently renamed JFK Airport in 1963). United then constructed a large maintenance facility at San Francisco {{for its new}} Douglas DC-8 jets, which were also flying nonstop service to New York. In July 1959 the first <b>jetway</b> bridge was installed at SFO, {{which was one of}} the first in the United States. The cover of the January 3, 1960 American Airlines system timetable contained this message: [...] "NOW! 707 JET FLAGSHIP SERVICE – NONSTOP SAN FRANCISCO – NEW YORK: 2 FLIGHTS DAILY" [...] Also in 1960, Western Airlines was operating [...] "champagne flights" [...] with Boeing 707 jets and Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets to Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego and Portland, OR.|$|E
