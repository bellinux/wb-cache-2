25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E

500|$|In the 2008–09 season, Nasri {{appeared}} in only three matches {{with the national}} team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost {{a year and a}} half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." [...] The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, [...] "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I told myself I need to work <b>harder,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure I don't miss the next one." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 19, 2013, Paramount {{announced}} that a sequel to the film {{is in the works}} due to overseas box office numbers. Hansel & Gretel producers Ferrell, McKay, Messick, and Flynn were reported to return. In June 2013, McKay officially confirmed his involvement and said that [...] "everyone feels like as good as the first one is, we can really jack it up a level with the second one. So, fingers crossed everyone will come back" [...] (including Renner and Arterton). McKay suggested that Paramount might insist <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film rated PG-13 this time. Talking about Wirkola's [...] "pretty insane" [...] ideas for the second film, McKay said this could be one of those instances where the sequel does go further than the first one." [...] Regarding the storyline, he offered one hint: [...] "Think of different kinds of witchcraft." [...] It was revealed that the sequel will have a 2016 release date.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly favorable, calling it [...] "the only show with any sense of mystery." [...] John Teti of The A.V. Club found the episode to have a [...] "fantastic premise for a Peter Griffin adventure" [...] but went on to state that he gives the episode [...] "points for a strong first half, but I wish that the writers had pushed {{themselves}} a little <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this one go the distance." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E
500|$|Bear McCreary {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} compose music for the series in July 2013. Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary {{to work with a}} full symphonic orchestra, typically featuring 50 or 70 players, with over 90 for [...] "important" [...] episodes. Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score [...] "a modern edge". Since Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was [...] "a sense that it had to connect" [...] to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens. McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode. Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound—"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] but also [...] "intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people." [...] McCreary had to work <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted [...] "the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation." ...|$|E

500|$|At the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Columbus severed {{their ties}} with Filatov, trading {{him to the}} Ottawa Senators in {{exchange}} for a third-round pick. Filatov left his family vacationing in the Dominican Republic and joined the Senators for their development camp at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa. He made the Senators out of training camp, but was a healthy scratch several times, splitting his time with Ottawa and the Binghamton Senators of the AHL. In November 2011, the Ottawa Citizens Allen Panzeri reported from sources in Columbus that Filatov had refused to play the style the Blue Jackets asked of him, saying to his coach, [...] "Filly [...] don't do rebounds." [...] In December, the Senators offered Filatov the choice to play {{the rest of the season}} with CSKA Moscow of the KHL and Filatov agreed. Senators General Manager Bryan Murray suggested it was better for his development as Murray felt that Filatov needed to work on becoming stronger and compete <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it in the NHL. Head Coach Paul MacLean felt Filatov's struggles in the NHL were surprising, considering he had 12 points in 15 games in the AHL. Filatov himself stated that he had to get better. MacLean had hoped that Filatov would have stayed and worked on his game in Binghamton, but Murray explained that it was more lucrative for Filatov to play in the KHL than at Binghamton, and did not block the transfer. Filatov did not immediately agree to terms with CSKA. For a few days it appeared that Filatov would not sign a contract with CSKA, so the Senators assigned him to Binghamton and threatened to suspend him in order to remove him from the Senators' salary cap. On December 18, 2011, Filatov agreed to a contract with CSKA Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Parcells instituted {{numerous}} changes {{before the}} 1984 season. He changed {{half of the}} roster, getting rid of players he deemed problematic, overhauled the team's strength training program, and trained the players <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them more resistant to injury. The Giants {{had a problem with}} player abusing drugs in the early 1980s, and Parcells decided he had to take a stand. He estimates that he released 20–30 players due to drug use in his first three years as head coach, some after giving them second chances. He would often call their mothers to tell them of the players habits in an attempt to get them off drugs, and several times he recounts crying along with players as he released them. Simms won the starting job back for the season, and Brunner was released. Parcells announced the decision by saying, [...] "e gives us our best chance to win right now." [...] Simms responded by throwing for 4,044 yards, making him the first Giant to reach 4,000yards passing in a season. The Giants had a resurgent season, highlighted by a midseason stretch where they won five of six against opponents such as the defending conference champion Redskins, the Dallas Cowboys and their new co–tenants at Giants Stadium, the Jets. With two games left the Giants had a 9–5 record and a chance to win their first divisional title in 21 years. Yet {{despite the fact that they}} lost those final two games to finish 9–7, the Giants still made the playoffs as a Wild Card. In the first round, they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16-13 in Anaheim before losing, 21–10, to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. Standout performers included Rob Carpenter and Joe Morris, who split running back duties, combining for over 1,300yards and 11 touchdowns. Four receivers had over 30 catches on the year, including tight end Zeke Mowatt and receiver Bobby Johnson who tied for the team lead with 48 catches each. Phil McConkey returned punts and kickoffs. Parcells installed five new starters on defense, including Leonard Marshall at defensive end and Jim Burt at nose tackle, and the team's first round pick was used to draft Michigan State linebacker Carl Banks, who would become a key member of the Giants' linebacking corps for the next several seasons.|$|E

She tried to remember him as he had been at Silverdale, and in the first months of their marriage, and not as he had afterwards become. There was no question in her mind, now that it was given her to see things more clearly, that she might have tried harder, much <b>harder,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their marriage a success. He might, indeed, have done more to protect and cherish her. It was a man's part to guard a woman against the evils with which she had been surrounded.
