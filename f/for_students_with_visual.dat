40|$|This study {{explored}} {{issues surrounding}} {{the validity of}} Pennsylvania's Alternate System of Assessment (PASA) <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments. The PASA is a performance-based assessment that assesses a sub-set of math and reading skills delineated by the State's alternate standards. Data from 286 {{students with visual impairments}} who took the 2005 Level A PASA at grades 3 / 4 or 7 / 8 were analyzed. Descriptive and statistical analyses compared achievement on the PASA between three groups {{of students with visual impairments}} at different levels of functional vision as well as to a matched group of peers without visual impairments. The latter comparison investigated differential item functioning (DIF) on each individual test item using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. In addition, types of accommodations made <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments to provide access to the assessment and potential factors contributing to test bias were documented. Overall, the study confirmed expected patterns of accommodation selection by functional vision level with layout/set-up accommodations being the most frequently used. It also revealed a set of test items flagged for DIF statistically that did not always coincide with the test items judgmental reviewers would expect to be problematic or different <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments. Among the three functional levels and the students with visual impairments as a whole, 29 instances of DIF in which a test item may have been potentially harder were found. In addition, there were 12 instances where a test item may have potentially been easier. A qualitative logical analysis highlighted a variety of variables that interact with the decision-making process to pinpoint potential reasons for the presence of DIF. Under-accommodation, the frequency of lucky guesses, score change patterns, and experience level with content were all factors suspected of contributing to performance on different types of test items. Discussion of these variables as well as interesting patterns in accommodation selection or the absence of accommodation selection is included.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of Ramadan fasting on the amplitude of accommodation (AA), near point of convergence (NPC), positive and negative fusional vergences (PFV and NFV, respectively) in visually healthy fasters. Methods: AA, NPC, PFV and NFV at far (6 m) and near (40 cm) were measured in 30 male students. Nutritional habits in a week before each examination visit were assessed with the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Results: Mean age and fasting average experience were 23. 9 and 10 years, respectively. AA and NPC showed significant changes (p< 0. 05) during Ramadan; but there was no significant difference before and after Ramadan in these parameters. NFV blur, break and recovery points at far significantly reduced in Ramadan than before (p= 0. 003, p= 0. 005, p= 0. 003, respectively) with insignificant compensation after Ramadan. Results showed that there was no significant correlation between changes in diet pattern and AA, NPC and distant NFV variations (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Some visual problems may be reported at far and near visual tasks during Ramadan; but most of the problems may be resolved after it.

The {{background}} {{of this research}} {{is the fact that the}} achievement of student of MTs in Klaten regency is still low in mathematics. The teaching alternative which is implementated is constructivism teaching by using power point media. The goals of this research are 1) to test the differences between the student's achievement using computer media and model kit; 2) to know the influence of differences of learning style to student's learning achievement; 3) to know the interaction/the influence between the teaching by computer media with power point and the model kit observed from student's learning style to student's learning achievement. This research belonged to a quasi experiment. The population of the research is the whole students of MTs in grade VII in Klaten regency. By then sample choosing is done by stratified cluster random sampling way. Data collecting is done by: 1) distributing questionnaire to decide the student's learning style, from the total sample 101 a students from the experiment group and 107 a studenrs from the control group, we get 111 students having visual learning style, 55 students having auditorial learning style and 42 students having kinesthetic learning style. 2) giving test to find the result of <b>student's</b> achievement, <b>with</b> the mean of 53. 73 on the experiment group, 46. 42 on the control group, 48. 55 <b>for</b> the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> learning style, 51. 22 on the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> auditorial learning style, and 52. 1 on the <b>students</b> <b>with</b> kinesthetic learning style. The data we get from this research is analized by using two-ways variance analysis in different cell and level of signification 0. 05. The result of this research show 1) the learning process by using computer as media create better achievement compared with the model kit. This case shown in the analysis calculation result that Fobs= 12. 881 > 3. 84 =Ftab; 2) the learning style does not influence the <b>student's</b> learning achievement, <b>with</b> the analysis Fobs= 0. 71 < 3. 00 = Ftab; 3) there is no interaction between learning style and use of learning media toward the <b>student's</b> learning achievement, <b>with</b> analysis result Fobs= 0. 286 < 3. 00 = Ftab...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to measure the level of comfort and knowledge that educational diagnosticians possess regarding the unique learning needs, assistive technology, special accommodations, agencies, required visual impairment related Individual Educational Plan documents, and special evaluation considerations appropriate <b>for</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> a vision loss. Teachers of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments were surveyed to gauge their perception of educational diagnosticians’ knowledge of the field of visual impairment and diagnosticians were also surveyed to determine their comfort level in the management of a caseload of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments. Research question were based on how TVIs rated the comfort level and knowledge of educational diagnosticians to effectively manage a caseload of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments, how diagnosticians rated their own comfort level and knowledge to manage a caseload of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments, where TVIs and diagnosticians agreed that {{there is a lack of}} knowledge or awareness on the part of the diagnostician when it comes to managing a caseload of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments, and what TVIs and diagnosticians believe can be done to better prepare diagnosticians to work <b>with</b> <b>students</b> who are visually impaired. Data collected for this study found that collaboration among a team of professionals, including TVIs and diagnosticians, provided benefit to students who are visually impaired. Survey responses from diagnosticians indicated they would like more training in low-incidence disabilities such as visual impairment to prepare them to manage a caseload of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} about the {{relationship}} between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> disabilities and their peers and between <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> disabilities and their teachers during training assisted by educative informatics. These ICT will not always be sufficient without the cooperation of the teachers and the peers. Interviews of ten <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> disabilities highlight the importance of this cooperation. Even if the development of educative informatics technologies and legislative framework of this last ten years are in progress, difficulties <b>for</b> these <b>students</b> keep on being unknown. Only the <b>student</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> disabilities himself knows his own needs and the adaptation required consequently it places him {{at the heart of the}} interactional process...|$|R
