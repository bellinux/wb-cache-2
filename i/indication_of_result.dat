40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{in progress}} {{on the development of}} a social timeline that aims to enrich feedback for people learning music within an online community. This interface is novel because it uses multiple layers for group discussions rather than the single layer found in websites such as SoundCloud. Multi-layered timelines are commonly used for audio and video editing, but have not been used for collaborative annotation of music recordings (to avoid confusion we refer to the timeline as multi-layered not multi-track which normally refers to multiple audio channels). We tabulate key features of 15 competing systems to justify our claim that the multi-layered social timeline is a novel design pattern for exchanging feedback about musical performances. 49 classical music students used a prototype of the system over five months to upload and discuss rehearsals of an ensemble piece which was then publicly performed.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{properties}} of a recently proposed observationally viable alternative to homogeneous cosmology with smooth dark energy, the timescape cosmology. In the timescape model cosmic acceleration is realized as an apparent effect related to the calibration of clocks and rods of observers in bound systems relative to volume–average observers in an inhomogeneous geometry in ordinary general relativity. The model {{is based on an}} exact solution to a Buchert average of the Einstein equations with backreaction. The present paper examines a number of observational tests which will enable the timescape model to be distinguished from homogeneous cosmologies with a cosmological constant or other smooth dark energy, in current and future generations of dark energy experiments. Predictions are presented for: comoving distance measures; H(z); the equivalent of the dark energy equation of state, w(z); the Om(z) measure of Sahni, Shafieloo and Starobinsky; the Alcock–Paczy´nski test; the baryon acoustic oscillation measure, DV; the inhomogeneity test of Clarkson, Bassett and Lu; and the time drift of cosmological redshifts. Where possible, the predictions are compared to recent independent studies of similar measures in homogeneous cosmologies with dark energy. Three separate tests with <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> in possible tension with the CDM model are found to be consistent with the expectations of the timescape cosmology...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Special Major (Gerontological Studies and Corporate Organization)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. The {{problem that}} this project seeks to examine {{is that of}} {{multidisciplinary}} placement and job viability for Gerontology graduates. With {{the growth of the}} aging population and the desire to adjust the market to the changing needs of the aging population, Gerontology graduates must separate themselves as marketable as an interdisciplinary graduate with multidisciplinary application in career and industry. The researcher utilized focus groups via chain-referral or snowball sampling methods of recruiting. The participants were required to be employed in the semirural Northern California region. Both quantitative demographic data and qualitative industry specific data were collected and analyzed to assess viability of a Gerontology graduate in multidisciplinary industries. Due to a lack of large participation and variability of participants, conclusions and recommendations drawn are not strong but provide good <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> for future studies. The market appears to be growing and strong with anticipated growth as the demographics shift toward an aged society, industries are educated on the value added benefits of hiring a Gerontology graduate, and Academia continues to grow Interdisciplinary Gerontology as a distinct discipline and field of study.
