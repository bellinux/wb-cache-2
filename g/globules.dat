5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid <b>globules</b> in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the <b>globules</b> hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We study {{different}} {{regimes in}} the dynamics of swelling of a long polymer chain from a compact <b>globule.</b> Depending on the age or degree of self-entanglement inside of the <b>globule,</b> we consider the limiting cases of “freshly formed ” <b>globule</b> and “old ” <b>globule.</b> Considering the density of polymer in a <b>globule,</b> which influences the mobility of solvent inside of the <b>globule,</b> we also distinguish “wet ” and “dry” initial configurations. For each of these regimes, we discuss the leading dissipation mechanism governing the dynamics of swelling.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of molten <b>globule</b> {{state as a}} distinct intermediate in the denaturation process in proteins is well documented. However, the structural characterization of such an intermediate is far from complete. We have, using fluorescence and fluorescence quenching, studied the molten <b>globule</b> state of bovine alpha-lactalbumin. Unlike the native state, where all the 4 tryptophans are buried in the protein, 2 tryptophans are exposed in the molten <b>globule</b> state. Using the hydrophobic photoactivable reagent [H- 3]diazofluorene, we observe an increased hydrophobic exposure in the molten <b>globule</b> state. These structural characteristics conform to the current views on the molten <b>globule</b> state, i. e. it has similar secondary structure but a poorly defined tertiary structure. Our fluorescence studies indicate the {{involvement of}} a premolten <b>globule</b> state in the native to molten <b>globule</b> state transition. This premolten <b>globule</b> state exists at pH 5. 0 and has a very compact structure involving increased hydrophobic interactions in the protein interior. These results are also supported by circular dichroism studies...|$|R

This molecular <b>globule</b> has a shape resembling a human hand, with an extended finger that points toward its likely source of ionizing radiation. The dominant ionizing source of the <b>globule</b> is either the WNL star WR 25 (HD 93162), the O 4 If-type star Tr 16 - 244, or perhaps both. We estimate a mass-loss rate of ~ 2 e- 5 Msun/yr from the main evaporating surface of the <b>globule,</b> suggesting a remaining lifetime of 10 ^ 5. 3 to 10 ^ 6 years. We find a total mass for the entire <b>globule</b> of more than 6 Msun, in agreement with previous estimates. The hydrogen column density through the <b>globule</b> is a few times 10 ^ 22 /cm 2. Although a few reddened stars are seen within the boundary of the <b>globule</b> in near-IR continuum images, these may be background stars. We do not detect a reddened star {{at the apex of}} the finger, for example, down to a limiting magnitude of K= 17. However, considering the physical properties of the <b>globule</b> and the advancing ionization front, it appears that future star formation is likely in the Finger <b>globule,</b> induced by radiation-driven implosion.

The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the spores of T.plumbeoviolaceus {{appear to be}} a light pink to flesh color.

The basidia (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5µm. The cuticle of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in potassium hydroxide, the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in Melzer's reagent causes the pigment to form <b>globules.</b> Cystidia are common in the hymenial tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow at the apex (lageniform), measuring 30–40µm long by 7–9µm thick.

40|$|Five mutant α–lactalbumins, {{with one}} or two amino acid substitution(s) in the B helix, were {{engineered}} to examine the relation between the stability of the molten <b>globule</b> state and the hydrophobicity of these amino acids. The mutation sites (Thr 29, Ala 30 and Thr 33) have been chosen on the basis of comparison of the amino acid sequences of goat, bovine and gunea pig α–lactalbumin, in which the guinea pig protein shows a remarkably more stable molten <b>globule</b> than the other proteins. The recombinant proteins were expressed Escherichia coli and then purified and refolded efficiently to produce the active proteins. The stability of the molten <b>globule</b> state of these engineered proteins has been investigated by urea–induced unfolding transition under an acidic condition (pH 2. 0), where the molten <b>globule</b> state is stable in the absence of urea. The results show that the molten <b>globule</b> state is stabilized by the amino acid substitutions which raise the hydrophobicity of the residues, suggesting that the hydrophobic core in a globular protein {{plays an important role in}} the stability of the molten <b>globule</b> state. The change in stabilization free energy of the molten <b>globule</b> state caused by each amino acid substitution has been evaluated, and molecular mechanisms of stabilization of the molten <b>globule</b> state are discussed...|$|R

In a prospective first attempt to understand the complexities in a biological system, the interfacial properties of polar lipids from milk fat <b>globule</b> membrane and intact milk fat <b>globule</b> membrane were studied using langmuir film balance. Monolayers were studied at oil/water interface where a low melting anhydrous milk fat fraction was used as oil phase and ultrapure water was used as water phase.

40|$|Although {{the molten}} <b>globule</b> {{state has been}} {{proposed}} as a major intermediate of protein folding, it has proven difficult to obtain thermodynamic data characterizing this state. To explore another approach for characterizing the molten <b>globule</b> state, salt-induced formation of the molten <b>globule</b> state of horse cytochrome c at pH 1. 8 was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry. By titrating the acid-unfolded cytochrome c with sodium perchlorate, an exothermic reaction was observed. The titration curve obtained from the heat was cooperative and agreed well with the conformational transition curve measured by CD at 222 nm. This result indicated that the salt-induced conformation change is well approximated by a two-state transition between the acid-unfolded and molten <b>globule</b> states. The heat for formation of the molten <b>globule</b> state estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry {{was consistent with the}} enthalpy change for unfolding of the sodium perchlorate-stabilized molten <b>globule</b> state at pH 1. 8, which was measured by differential scanning calorimetry and CD. These results indicate that the heat of titration largely reflects the enthalpy change of the conformational transition. From these results, we consider that isothermal titration calorimetry will become a useful approach for investigating the molten <b>globule</b> state...|$|R
5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger <b>globules</b> through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E

Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents.

On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish <b>globules</b> of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E

40|$|A recent high angular {{resolution}} extinction map toward the most opaque molecular <b>globule,</b> <b>Globule</b> 2, in the Coalsack Nebula revealed that {{it contains a}} strong central ring of dust column density. This ring represents a region of high density and pressure that is likely a transient and possibly turbulent structure. Dynamical models suggest that the ring has formed {{as a result of}} a sudden increase in external pressure which is driving a compression wave into the <b>Globule.</b> Here we combine the extinction measurements with a detailed study of the C 18 O (1 - 0) molecular line profiles toward <b>Globule</b> 2 in order to investigate the overall kinematics and, in doing so, test this dynamical model. We find that the ring corresponds to an enhancement in the C 18 O non-thermal velocity dispersion and non-thermal pressure. We observe a velocity gradient across the <b>Globule</b> that appears to trace two distinct systematic subsonic velocity flows that happen to converge within the ring. We suggest, therefore, that the ring has formed as two subsonic flows of turbulent gas merge within the <b>Globule.</b> The fact that the outer layers of the <b>Globule</b> appear stable against collapse yet there is no centrally condensed core, suggests that the <b>Globule</b> may be evolving from the outside in and has yet to stabilize, confirming its youth.

40|$|The molten <b>globule</b> {{state of}} alpha-lactalbumin is the best-characterized folding {{intermediate}} of globular proteins {{and has been}} studied intensively by various spectroscopic and physiochemical techniques, including stopped-flow CD and fluorescence spectroscopies, a hydrogen-exchange technique, 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, disulfide-exchange chemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, and calorimetric techniques. This review summarizes recent studies. Major findings about {{the structure of the}} molten <b>globule</b> state are: 1) It is highly heterogeneous, having a highly structured alpha-helical domain with the beta-sheet domain being significantly unfolded; and 2) it is not a nonspecific, collapsed polypeptide but already has a native-like tertiary fold. These structural characteristics are essential to fully understand the thermodynamic properties of the molten <b>globule</b> state which are described in connection with a recently proposed computational approach to predict the structure of the molten <b>globule</b> state of a protein. Mutant proteins in which the stability of the molten <b>globule</b> state was changed were constructed. Studies of the equilibrium unfolding and kinetic refolding of the mutant proteins will provide further insight into the molten <b>globule</b> state as a folding intermediate. In spite of an initial expectation that the structure recognized by an Escherichia coli chaperone, GroEL, is the molten <b>globule,</b> the interaction of GroEL with alpha-lactalbumin in the molten <b>globule</b> state is much weaker than the interaction with more unfolded states of alpha-lactalbumin, a disulfide-reduced form, and disulfide rearranged species...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat <b>globules</b> rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the <b>globules,</b> the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated <b>globules,</b> the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million <b>globules,</b> held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual <b>globules</b> can. The fat <b>globules</b> in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E
25|$|Unhomogenized {{milk and}} cream contain {{butterfat}} in microscopic <b>globules.</b> These <b>globules</b> are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from {{the other parts of}} the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat <b>globules.</b> In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.|$|E
25|$|Homogenization is {{a process}} that reduces the size of fat <b>globules</b> by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing {{turbulence}} that breaks up the larger fat <b>globules</b> so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of homogenization is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to shake or stir the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the shelf-life of the product.|$|E
40|$|Backgound: The molten <b>globule</b> {{state is}} an {{intermediate}} between the native and the fully unfolded states of globular proteins and is {{purported to be}} an obligatory on-pathway intermediate of protein folding. The molten <b>globule</b> state of α-lactalbumin has been best characterized, but two major issues {{have yet to be}} clarified. At which stage of the kinetic refolding is the molten <b>globule</b> state stably organized? And what is the major driving force that stabilizes the molten <b>globule</b> state? We address these questions in this paper. ResultsWe have investigated the refolding kinetics of α-lactalbumin using stopped-flow CD and fluorescence, acrylamide quenching and pulsed hydrogen exchange NMR techniques. A burst-phase intermediate was observed to form within 15 ms. The intermediate was characterized by pronounced, hydrogen-bonded secondary structure, exposure of hydrophobic surfaces and the absence of tertiary structure. Furthermore, the stability of the secondary structure is the same as that in the equilibrium molten <b>globule</b> state. ConclusionThe burst-phase intermediate in α-lactalbumin refolding is identical with the molten <b>globule</b> state. Two different models, the hydrophobic collapse model and the secondary-structure coalescence model, of protein folding are discussed {{on the basis of the}} present results. The importance of solvent-separated hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the molten <b>globule</b> state is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The fractal <b>globule</b> is {{a compact}} polymer state that emerges during polymer {{condensation}} {{as a result}} of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal <b>globule</b> into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10  Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Here, we present the concept of the fractal <b>globule,</b> comparing it to other states of a polymer and focusing on its properties relevant for the biophysics of chromatin. We then discuss properties of the fractal <b>globule</b> that make it an attractive model for chromatin organization inside a cell. Next, we connect the fractal <b>globule</b> to recent studies that emphasize topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories. We discuss how theoretical predictions, {{made on the basis of}} the fractal <b>globule</b> model, can be tested experimentally.

25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat <b>globules</b> through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the <b>globules</b> and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat <b>globules</b> are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|E
