5|$|Between his 1820 {{graduation}} and 1821, when {{effects of the}} Wallachian uprising led to the School ceasing its activities, he was kept as Lazăr's assistant teacher, tutoring in arithmetics and geometry.

5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed. <b>During</b> <b>those</b> events, Asellus was {{supposed}} to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop {{so that she would}} find her true identity so that she would decide to live as a human being or as a mystic. These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008 Republican primary, {{states that}} ran early {{primaries}} were punished by {{a reduction of}} 50% {{in the number of}} delegates they could send to the national convention. Extension of this idea would set timing tiers, under which states that ran earlier primaries would send proportionally fewer delegates to the national convention, and states that waited would get a higher proportional number of delegates to the convention. For example, the party allowed primaries before March 1 to send 40% of delegates; <b>those</b> <b>during</b> March could send 60%; <b>those</b> <b>during</b> April could send 80%; <b>those</b> <b>during</b> May could send 100%; and <b>those</b> <b>during</b> June could send 120%.|$|R

Born in Oiretumu, a settlement {{on the island of}} Mauke, Tapoki's debut at the Olympics was in the 2004 Athens games when she was 20 years old; she represented the Cook Islands in the same event <b>during</b> <b>those</b> games. Tapoki was placed in the first heat during the 15 August qualification round, which included 19 athletes. The athletes were given three opportunities to throw the discus.

5|$|Between May 29 and June 2, the Israel Defense Forces {{constantly}} bombarded the Egyptians in Isdud with Napoleonchik cannons and Givati patrols harassed the Egyptian lines.

The 3rd Company of the 53rd Battalion, commanded by Yosef Geva, was tasked with harassing the enemy lines, while the 1st Company of the 54th Battalion, commanded by Aryeh Kotzer, was ordered to assault several targets. In his book In the Fields of Philistia, Uri Avnery, {{who participated in the}} battles, wrote of the harassment operation that <b>during</b> <b>those</b> days the Egyptians were fearing an Israeli attack and were firing in all directions and launching flares in hopes of discovering their enemy.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated <b>during</b> <b>those</b> 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E

The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage <b>during</b> <b>those</b> attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E
