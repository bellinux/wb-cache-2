During this period, Slater Gator also scored victories on Main Event over Los Matadores and Gold and Stardust. Slater's brief winning streak was ended when Slater Gator were defeated by Los Matadores on the August 25, 2014 edition of Raw. Slater Gator then began a feud with Adam Rose and his bunny, who has attacked Slater on many occasions. In his return to Raw on November 17, 2014, he returned in Uncle Sam attire and became the next victim against Rusev. Later at Survivor Series, Slater remained and Titus O'Neil lost to Adam Rose and The Bunny. In December 2014, a warrant for Slater's arrest was issued, rendering him inactive until all legal issues are resolved. The charges were dropped on January 15, 2015. Slater returned to action in a dark match against Luke Harper on February 3, 2015. On the February 12, 2015 edition of SmackDown, Slater Gator competed in a tag team turmoil match, where they were quickly defeated by the team of Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E
25|$|In 1958-59 the MCC {{had insisted}} on fewer upcountry matches, on this tour they were {{increased}} {{and as a result}} New South Wales lost its return match with the tourists, though Sydney did get two Tests. The Victoria Park Oval was a lovely ground, surrounded by bowling greens, croquet lawns, cricket and football fields, public parks and a zoo. The Country XI were overawed by Fred Trueman (4/45) in the first innings, with Len Coldwell taking 3/25 and David Allen 3/34 helping him dismiss them for 138. John Murray was wicket-keeping again after his injury in the Third Test and showed no ill effects. The MCC made 451/8 in return with David Sheppard (93) and captain Colin Cowdrey (97) added 151 before both getting out within minutes of stumps in the 98 degree heat. Graveney making the fastest century of the tour, 106 in 81 minutes and hit four sixes and Barry Knight hit a powerful 70. The Country XI survived the day to earn a draw even though Allen took 3/51, they made 227/5 thanks to the 24-year-old chemist Ian Drake. Drake was 'run out' on 59 when he hit the ball to the fence and Umpire Clare signalled a boundary, but Ray Illingworth picked <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> foot inside and threw it to Murray, who broke the wicket and Umpire Miller gave him out. Cowdrey called him back to continue the innings and he made 101, the first century by a Country player against the MCC since the war.|$|E

The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for Shanley's script. Ebert, who awarded the film the full four stars, highlighted Streep's caricature of a nun, who [...] "hates all inroads of the modern world", while Kelly Vance of The East Bay Express remarked: [...] "It's thrilling to see a pro like Streep step into an already wildly exaggerated role and then ramp <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> few notches just for the sheer hell of it.

500|$|In 1919, H. W. Evans {{recorded}} {{the existence of}} a similar custom which had existed in Solva, Pembrokeshire circa 1840, during his mother's childhood.

According to Evans' description, this Mari Lwyd consisted of a sheet that had been sewn together along two adjacent sides to make a cone, which was then stuffed with hay and decorated with buttons for eyes and harvest gloves for ears, thus resembling an animal's snout. An individual could conceal themselves under the sheet and use a hay fork inserted into the hay to hold <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>A</b> similar custom appears in an account from 1897, in which an entity known as the Bwca Llwyd ("Grey Bogy") was described; it involved an imitation horse's head being made from canvas and stuffed with hay, being carried about using a hay fork on All Hallow's Eve.|$|E

500|$|After the Pixies {{broke up}} in 1993, Santiago {{had stayed in}} touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first.

He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" [...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited.

In developing the radio stations, the team wanted to reinforce the game's setting by collating a variety of songs from the 1980s and therefore performed extensive research. The radio stations were published by Epic Records in seven albums—known collectively as —alongside the game in October 2002.
