40|$|During {{november}} 2008, {{intense and}} concentrated rainfall occurred causing numerous mass movements, changing significantly the morphology of valleys and slopes and reaching directly {{the population of}} the municipalities of Vale do Itajaí.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Frozen debris lobes (FDLs) {{are large}} masses of soil, rock, {{incorporated}} organic material, and ice moving down permafrost-affected slopes in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska. Here {{we focus on}} FDL-A, which is an impending geohazard to the Dalton Highway, located just under 40 m away from the embankment. We present the results of multi-faceted research, including field-based studies, <b>GIS</b> analysis, <b>laboratory</b> testing of soil samples, and slope stability analysis. Subsurface instrumentation indicates that major movement of FDL-A occurs in a shear zone 20. 6 to 22. 8 m below the ground surface, with temperature-dependent internal flow as a secondary movement mechanism. Field observations indicate the presence of massive, infiltration ice associated with cracks {{on the surface of}} the lobe. Surface measurements show an overall average rate of movement of 1. 2 cm per day, which is an increase over historic rates. The GIS analysis also provided insight into the movement and instability of FDL-A, and provided groundwork for a GIS protocol to examine catchment and lobe features of all FDLs along the highway corridor. The slope stability analysis required a back analysis to determine soil strength parameters at failure, resulting in cohesion values between 43 to 53 kPa and friction angles between 10 ° and 16 °. The modeling results indicated a high sensitivity to cohesion and pore water pressure. This is critical since the melting of massive ice and thawing of frozen soil will increase pore water pressure and lower shear strength, resulting in the acceleration of FDL-A towards the Dalton Highway...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of coastal zones {{has become a}} complicated issue. The majority of the human population lives along the coast, where their activities, together {{with a range of}} environmental changes, have altered the natural ecosystem processes and caused changes in coastal wetlands. To ensure sustainable use of coastal resources, a comprehensive set of modelling tools can help managers to make decisions. This study uses Comerong Island (southeastern NSW, Australia) as a case study to demonstrate the importance of modelling modifications to environmental change. Several data-based modelling approaches are employed to explore how human activities have altered this estuarine island setting over the last sixty years (1949 - 2014). Multi-temporal changes in land cover, shorelines and sediment delivery are estimated from remote sensing data, <b>GIS</b> analysis, and <b>laboratory</b> tests on water and sediment samples (grain size, X-ray diffraction and loss on ignition and water analysis). Results show there are significant changes to the areal extents and elevation of mangroves, saltmarshes and shorelines in the wetlands on Comerong Island over the time period of analysis, including northern accretion (0. 4 km 2), eastern, middle and southern erosion (0. 7 km 2) of the island.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} results from the assessment of the salinity status of a highly productive agricultural area, under a semiarid climate. The objectives were to: identify the origin of salts, assess seasonal changes of salt contents, and examine spatio-temporal and vertical variability of the presence and composition of salts. Soil samples from the surface horizon, and topsoil samples, soil profiles, water samples and salt precipitates on aggregates were collected in January and July 2009. High electrical conductivity was mainly the result of the poor low quality irrigation water. However, ions responsible for salinity were chlorides, sulfates, calcium, magnesium and sodium, while phosphates, ammonium, nitrates, and potassium were associated with fertilizers. SEM-EDX (scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray) analyses suggested that calcium sulfate came from both irrigation water and from a pedogenic source, as indicated by differences in crystal morphology and seasonal occurrence, which indicates that primary salinization is also a contributor to soil salinity in the area studied. Significant differences were reported between seasons. The electrical conductivity and concentrations of chloride, sulfates, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and nitrite are significantly higher in July. The observed differences were caused by the effect of soluble salt movement through evaporation and capillary rise, resulting in precipitation of salts on the surface. Multivariable, <b>GIS</b> and advanced <b>laboratory</b> analysis have confirmed to be useful techniques to identify the salts sources, spatial distribution of anions, and identification of vulnerable areas...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between}} the physical, pedological and anthropogenic influences on landslide occurrence on the midslopes within and outside Mt Elgon National Park was carried out. One of the landslides occurred in a protected pristine forest environment within the Park while the other two were located at sites deforested for cultivation within and outside the National Park. Field based surveys, <b>GIS</b> techniques and <b>laboratory</b> tests were used to collect and analyze the data. A household survey was undertaken to establish the main community livelihood strategies, the drivers of land use change and implications for land degradation on the mid slopes of Mt Elgon. Aerial photographs taken in 1960 and orthophoto maps formed the benchmark for the analysis of the respective land use changes between 1995 and 2006, using 30 m Landsat TM and 20 m SPOT MS images in IDRISI Andes GIS environment. Landslide sites were mapped using a Magellan Professional MobileMapperTMCX and terrain parameters were derived using a 15 M Digital Elevation Model. A hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach was employed to generate land cover maps from which the areal extent of three land cover classes (agricultural fields, woodlands and forests) was calculated. Particle size distribution and atterberg limits were used to test the hypothesis that soils at the landslide sites are inherently ‘problem soils’ where slope failure can occur even without human intervention. Shear strength parameters (internal of friction and cohesion) were used calculate the slope factor of safety to ascertain slope stability at pristine and disturbed landslide sites. Results from the socio-economic survey revealed that smallholder subsistence agriculture and encroachment on the National Park resources are the main sources of livelihoods for the communities surrounding the Park. The communities also have a strong socio-cultural attachment to the National Park, as it is the source of items used during traditional rituals like circumcision. Encroachment is driven by the high population pressure and the prevalent political climate. Farmers mainly use slash and burn technique to prepare land for cultivation and those close to the National Park are reluctant to adopt appropriate farming and soil conservation practices due to the uncertainties surrounding their future on such plots. Slash and burn iii techniques were observed to accelerate various forms of erosion including rills, gullies and sheet. Soil and water conservation techniques were mainly practiced on privately owned farms. The period 1960 and 1995 was characterized by minimal land use changes and no encroachment into the designated Mount Elgon National Park. Conversely, the period 1995 – 2006 marked a significant loss of woodlands and forest cover particularly on steep concave slopes (36 º – 58 º) within the National Park. The land use change trends were attributed to the prevalent land politics and exponential population growth in the region. The encroachment onto the critical slopes was noted to have induced a series of shallow and deep landslides in the area. Deforestation on Mt Elgon was reported to have both onsite and offsite climate variability and implications in the form of drought, heat waves, flash floods, economic dislocation, crop failure and associated malnutrition in surrounding low lying areas. The soils on pristine and disturbed slopes contain high amount of clay (> 10 percent), are fine textured (> 50 percent of the material passing the 0. 075 mm sieve) and highly plastic. These soil attributes imply low permeability, excessive water retention and high susceptibility to expansion and sliding. The vertic nature of soils at Nametsi was confirmed by the extremely high plasticity indices (averaging 33 percent), while, high liquid limits at Buwabwala (53 percent) and Kitati (59 percent) qualified the soils as vertisols which are associated with landslides. The results point to the fact that soils at landslide sites are inherently ‘problem soils’ where slope failure can occur even without human intervention. Therefore, the hypothesis that soils at three landslide sites are inherently ‘problem soils’ where slope failure can occur even without human intervention is accepted. Notwithstanding the fact that the study was focussed on mid-altitude slopes of Mt Elgon, the results are in tandem with investigations carried out earlier on the lower densely populated slopes, thus confirming the widespread nature of problem soils on Mt Elgon. There is an urgent need to control human population growth and restore forest cover on the heavily deforested steep slopes particularly within the National Park, and restrain communities from encroaching on the pristine slopes of Mt Elgon. This will be achieved if the politicians, Park Authorities and local communities jointly participate in the design and implementation of CFMs. Future research could focus on climate change implications of deforestation of Mt Elgon environments and quantification of carbon loss related to deforestation and soil degradation in the mountain environment...|$|R

In the early fifties, when the action was successfully completed, Hungary {{was the first in}} the World to have such detailed soil information (1 : 25, 000 scale maps and complementary data base in the form of explanatory booklets) for the whole country. These maps still represent a valuable treasure of soil information at the present time. Consequently, their digital reambulation and GIS adaptation is a challenging task, which has been initiated by the <b>GIS</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of RISSAC recently. GIS processing of the Kreybig soil maps started in 1998. The experimental project financed by RISSAC endeavours the GIS application and the integration of soil data available at various institutions, in different scale and processing level. The aim of the project is the development of the soil module of a Hungarian production database for the determination of the optimal functions of agriculture in a given region, together with the harmonization of agricultural production and the protection of land and environment...|$|E
40|$|In future lunar exploration, spatial {{disorientation}} may {{become an increasingly}} critical issue for astronauts as the area of exploration increases from several kilometers in the Apollo missions to over one hundred kilometers from the main base station in future landed missions. To address this problem, the Mapping & <b>GIS</b> <b>Laboratory</b> at The Ohio State University, working with partners, is developing a Lunar Astronaut Spatial Orientation and Information System (LASOIS) designed to provide astronauts with continuous navigation updates. Due to specific environmental conditions on the lunar surface (lack of familiar landmarks, ambiguous depth and shading cues, etc.), a multiple-sensor approach is proposed to overcome challenges to astronaut orientation. In this approach, data from on-suit sensors (stereo cameras, MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and foot-mounted pressure sensors) and from off-suit sensors (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera) are integrated through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) technique is used to compensate for distance errors while data from vision sensors are used to compensate for any IMU gyro drift. The spatial information generated by this integrated-data approach will be provided to astronauts through a wrist-mounted OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) interface. Extensive field tests incorporating all of the above-mentioned sensors were performed in a Lunar-lik...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some reflections {{about the}} importance of developing new forms of cartographic products of communication, and the insertion of the user as the central creative agent of the informations representation which is demanded. Aiming that, the principles of multimedia cartography are taken once it is considered that the mapping is the representation of the real world and must be dynamic, allowing the interactivity and allowing the user to change the perspective projection or the level of detail of information. It was therefore created a virtual model of navigation from Rio de Janeiro's downtown in order to ascertain the degree of objectivity of the model with ordinary users. The navigation models incorporates virtual interactivity between the user, the map and also the landscape of the area represented, and users can choose to display topographic maps, or the view of the azimuth's view of the navigable landscape. For this, the methodology developed by the <b>GIS</b> <b>Laboratory</b> at UFMG applies the concepts of virtual reality to study the landscape from a set of photographs, with 50 % overlap between them, allowing the effect of depth and dimensionality. After testing the model was checked for its effectiveness as products of cartographic communication the interactivity between the reader, the map and landscape, contributing to a new form of relationship with the represented space while the user is the central actor in this process.

40|$|Presentación realizada como parte de la mesa redonda "Where is Cultural Heritage in INSPIRE?". 21 st Annual {{meeting of}} the European Association or Archaeologists. Glasgow, 2 - 5 de septiembre de 2015 Although {{there is not a}} {{thorough}} implementation of Cultural Heritage within the INSPIRE Directive, it is included in the Protected Sites theme, therefore considered as reference data. IDEARQ is an interoperable archaeological SDI developed from the Cultural Heritage Application Schema (CHAS), a proposal that endeavors an adequate integration of Cultural Heritage data within INSPIRE. The data model proposed by the CHAS tries to integrate real-world cultural entities (archaeological sites, in this case) inside the INSPIRE Directive, left apart by the Protected Sites Data Specification that focuses only on the legal definition of the protected site. IDEARQ is a platform aimed at the dissemination of georeferenced archaeological data series of the Iberian Peninsula (mainly analytical as well as documentary), product of the research carried throughout many years within the archaeological research groups in the Institute of History of the Center for Social Sciences and Humanities CCHS of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). It has been jointly developed by the <b>GIS</b> <b>Laboratory</b> (uSIG) and the Landscape Archaeology and Remote Sensing Laboratory (LabTel) of CSIC. It provides OGC-compliant WMS based on the localization of archaeological sites, gathering data relative to the chronological and typological characterization of the sites and related information as a basis for the organization of substantiva research results. Nowadays, the platform includes data series on postpaleolithic rock art, radiocarbon dates and bibliography. Peer reviewe...|$|E
