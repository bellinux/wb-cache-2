In some countries which ban worker strikes, the whipsaw strike is illegal and employers {{are able to}} work with government law enforcement officials to end its use. In countries where the whipsaw strike is permitted, employers often counter this form of strike by locking out all employees who work for the <b>employer</b> <b>association</b> and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1980 's, {{industrial}} relations structures and processes in Australia {{have been subject}} to significant changes, particularly {{in the direction of a}} greater focus upon productivity, flexibility and other issues at the workplace level.

He was the son of Dr. James Douglas, developer of the Copper Queen mine {{and a member of the}} board of directors of the Phelps Dodge Corporation. Douglas was a political opponent of Hunt and had virulently attacked him for refusing as governor to send the state militia to suppress strikes in the mining industry. Douglas was also {{president of}} the American Mining Congress, an <b>employer</b> <b>association.</b> He had won office by vowing to break every union in every mine and restore the open shop. Determined to keep Bisbee free of IWW influence, in 1916, Douglas established a Citizens' Protective League, composed of business leaders and middle-class local residents. He also organized a Workmens' Loyalty League, some of whose members were IUMMSW miners.|$|E
2500|$|The Farmer-led NRLB {{tried to}} extend this {{reasoning}} to employer associations, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The situation involved cases where a union negotiated {{a contract with}} many employers in the same industry simultaneously. If the union struck one employer in the group, could the other employers lock out its workers? [...] In Morand Bros. Beverage and Davis Furniture, the Herzog board said no. [...] But what if these were whipsaw strikes? [...] The Farmer board in Buffalo Linen Supply Co. held that whipsaw strikes against employers in an <b>employer</b> <b>association</b> were not protected by the NLRA. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters appealed the decision in Morand Bros. Beverage. Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the NLRB in NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goal of a}} whipsaw strike may vary. [...] In some cases, {{the strike}} is {{conducted}} only against an employer the union believes is considering quitting the <b>employer</b> <b>association.</b> In other cases, the job action is conducted against a strong employer who is committed to staying in the employer group. The strike serves as an example to keep other, weaker businesses (which have a greater incentive to leave the employer group) in line. [...] Sometimes, a whipsaw strike {{is used as a}} bargaining tool. [...] For example, the strike may be directed at an employer or employers in the group which the union believes are holding up an agreement, or to keep employers off balance in negotiations, weaken the employer group's economic strength, and exercise the union's economic power.|$|E
40|$|The free {{circulation}} {{of workers and}} services in the European Union after its latest enlargements has been believed to foster a ‘race to the bottom’ in wage standards. This paper explains the strategies of national <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> towards labour market regulations geared to protect national wage standards {{in the context of}} labour mobility. First, this article shows that employers in non-tradable sectors confronted with strong trade unions support the regulation of wage standards in order to prevent foreign competitors from using lower wages as a competitive advantage. Second, the strategies of national <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> (as protagonists, consenters or antagonists) are explained by sectoral power relationships within <b>employer</b> <b>associations,</b> trade union power resources and the risk of unilateral public intervention. A comparative case study analysis of regulation processes in Austria, Switzerland and Ireland shows that <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> dominated by firms in non-tradable sectors are protagonists of wage regulation, while <b>employer</b> <b>associations</b> dominated by firms in tradable sectors consent to negotiate with trade unions about wage regulation in order to ensure labour acquiescence, or contain unilateral public intervention...|$|R

[...] The organization's membership, which had hovered at the 1,000-member mark for 60 years, remained stable.
