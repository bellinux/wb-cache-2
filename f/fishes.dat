5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine <b>fishes,</b> whereas continental freshwater <b>fishes</b> are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical <b>fishes</b> represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony <b>fishes</b> (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned <b>fishes).</b> This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E

5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all bony <b>fishes</b> (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned ancestors of the tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned <b>fishes</b> (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted on August 2014 at Nagari Tikalak, X Koto Singkarang, Solok Regency, West Sumatera.

This reseach uses survey method.

5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous <b>fishes.</b> Ray-finned <b>fishes</b> (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned <b>fishes</b> (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned <b>fishes</b> contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. When they finally returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous <b>fishes,</b> the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and <b>fishes.</b> Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and <b>fishes</b> including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony <b>fishes.</b> In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of <b>fishes,</b> in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few <b>fishes</b> specializing in preying on octopus.

Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
50|$|Declining <b>fish</b> {{stocks have}} caused illegal <b>fishing</b> {{practices}} to increase.

40|$|The cleaner <b>fish</b> Labroides dimidiatus {{affected}} the pigmented monogenean parasite Benedenia lolo on the <b>fish</b> Hemigymnus melapterus (Labridae) held in aquaria.

This difference was more pronounced on large <b>fish.</b> In the absence of cleaner <b>fish,</b> small <b>fish</b> had almost as many monogeneans as large fish; they also had more small monogeneans than the large <b>fish,</b> suggesting small <b>fish</b> were more vulnerable to infection by monogeneans than larger <b>fish.</b> This suggests that the cleaner <b>fish</b> L. dimidiatus {{has the potential to}} control benedeniine monogeneans on captive <b>fish</b> and highlights the importance of taking into account <b>fish</b> size in studies of the effect of cleaner <b>fish</b> on ectoparasites...|$|R

5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony <b>fishes,</b> and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger <b>fishes</b> and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings.

5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony <b>fishes</b> (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming <b>fishes</b> in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony <b>fishes</b> are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fish</b> farming {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a more sustainable alternative to traditional capture of wild <b>fish.</b> However, <b>fish</b> farming {{has been found to}} have negative impacts on nearby wild <b>fish</b> and farming of predatory <b>fish</b> like salmon can rely on <b>fish</b> feed that is based on <b>fish</b> meal and oil from wild <b>fish.</b>|$|R
