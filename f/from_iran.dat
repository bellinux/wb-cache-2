5|$|Money {{comes from}} Lebanese {{business}} groups, private persons, businessmen, the Lebanese diaspora involved in African diamond exploration, other Islamic groups and countries, and the taxes {{paid by the}} Shia Lebanese. Hezbollah says that {{the main source of}} its income comes from its own investment portfolios and donations by Muslims, however, Western sources maintain that Hezbollah actually receives most of its financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid <b>from</b> <b>Iran</b> and Syria. Iran is said to have given $400 million between 1983 and 1989 through donation. The situation has been changed due to economic problems, but Iran still funds humanitarian actions carried on by Hezbollah. According to reports released in February 2010, Hezbollah received $400million <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> The US estimates that Iran has been giving Hezbollah about US$60–100million per year in financial assistance. Other estimates are as high as $200-million annually. In 2011 Iran earmarked $7 million to Hezbollah’s activities in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{distributed}} {{in areas of}} Asia, the Americas, and Europe. It fruits in summer and fall (fall and winter in California).

In South America, it is known from Chile. In Asia, the mushroom has been collected <b>from</b> <b>Iran</b> and China.|$|E

5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived <b>from</b> <b>Iran</b> with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion <b>from</b> <b>Iran</b> in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs, while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with about half the wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black.|$|E

One of the more outstanding pieces of sculpture in Iran is the Savashi Canyon Relief, carved around 1800, that was commissioned by Shar Fath-Ali Shah Qajar to commemorate his hunting exploits.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is found}} in Turkey. It {{can also be found}} in Iran, in the provinces of Kerman, Gilan, Mazandaran, Fars, Hormozgan, Lorestan and Khorasan. However, until 2012, all the records <b>from</b> <b>Iran</b> were listed as Theodoxus doriae. In Africa this species occurs in Algeria, and {{possibly}} (or probably) in Morocco, where there are records which some authors consider to be reliable. However, instead of one species, Theodoxus fluviatilis, Brown (1994) recognized three species in northwestern Africa: Theodoxus numidicus, Theodoxus maresi, Theodoxus meridionalis.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the populations}} of cheetah in India saw a drastic fall. The last {{physical}} evidence of the cheetah in India {{was thought to be}} three individuals, all shot by the Maharajah of Surguja (a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1,360 tigers), in 1947 in eastern Madhya Pradesh, but a female was sighted in Koriya district, present-day Chhattisgarh, in 1951. During the early 2000s, scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs obtained <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> India asked Iran to transport one live pair to India, or, if that was not possible, allow them to collect sperm and eggs of the cheetah pair in Iran itself. However, Iran rejected both proposals.|$|E

Eastern diets were {{introduced}} to Europeans as well. Indian muslins, cottons, pearls, and precious stones were sold in Europe, as well as weapons, carpets, and leather goods <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the near and far East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that {{was involved in the}} trade system.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} Armenian to visit North America was Martin the Armenian <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> He was an Iranian Armenian tobacco grower who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618. In 1653–54, two Armenians from Constantinople {{were invited to}} Virginia to raise silk worms. A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, but most moved as individuals and did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies. The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in the 1830s from Cilicia and Western Armenia. Hatchik (Christopher) Oscanyan, a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1835 to pursue higher education. He later worked for the New York Herald Tribune and became the New York Press Club president. Many Armenians followed him and went to the US for education.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in North America, and is particularly common in the Pacific Northwest; its range extends north to Alaska and east to North Carolina. In the Puget Sound area of the U.S. state of Washington, it is found in association with Douglas-fir, fir, and hemlock. Along the Oregon Coast it has been collected under lodgepole pine. In addition to North America, the mushroom is widespread in Europe, and its presence has been documented in Italy, Germany, and Scotland. The species is common in the latter location, but becoming increasingly rare in several European countries, such as Norway, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Increased pollution in central Europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom's decline there. Reports <b>from</b> <b>Iran</b> in 2008 and Korea in 2010 were the first outside Europe and North America.|$|E

Based on the article Israel imports only a quarter of pistachios from US and about half of its pistachios from Britain and Germany, whereas these two countries are not producers of pistachio at all and the source is very likely to be <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> Furthermore, in 1998 Israeli government punished the Hamama Brothers Co. for illegally importing 105 tonnes of pistachio <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> Israeli newspaper Ynet reported in 2007 that US government once again asked Israeli government to stop importing pistachios <b>from</b> <b>Iran.</b> In 2008 US ambassador to Israel, Richard H.
