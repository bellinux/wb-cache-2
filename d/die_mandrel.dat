40|$|Aiming at {{assessing}} the stress distribution {{on the surface}} of a <b>die</b> <b>mandrel</b> during the extrusion of ceramic products, the flow of wet ground clay was simulated both in a ram extrusion device and by a FEM based model, considering the von Mises crite-rion for the flow stress, the associative flow rule and the rigid-viscoplastic constitu-tive equation. The friction between clay and die is approached by the Tresca bound-ary condition, which proves a more realistic approach than the Coulomb friction law for the contact conditions between a plastically deforming material and a rigid sur-face. The Tresca friction factor and the material parameters of the constitutive model are determined through comparison of experimental and theoretical results. The dis-tributions of clay sliding velocity and normal and frictional stress on the mandrel sur-face are then assessed through the numerical simulation model. It is found that no sticking areas appear on the mandrel surface...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the first step of the {{extrusion}} blow moulding process as part of a global optimisation process encompassing several steps: optimisation of the part thickness, optimisation of the parison thickness that will guarantee the specified thickness profile and optimisation of the extrusion conditions (namely, the sequence of the <b>die</b> <b>mandrel</b> movements) required to obtain the optimal parison thickness distribution. A high density polyethylene (HDPE) extrusion blow moulded tamper evident container was studied using a finite element based analysis (FEA) {{in order to determine the}} optimized thickness distribution required for the blown part, considering its mechanical specifications. Several tests corresponding to the requirements for UN homologation for dangerous substances transportation were performed using a commercial software. Non-linear models were used to better describe the mechanical part behaviour. The results obtained at this stage were used to redesign the blown part. In future work this optimised design will be used as an input for optimising the subsequent stages. One of the authors (R. P.

40|$|The {{aluminium}} extrusion process {{is based on}} simple principles, but allows profiles with the most complex cross-sectional shapes to be produced {{at a very high}} rate. One of the greatest challenges of {{aluminium extrusion}} is to control material flow and dimensional variability of thin-walled high-strength profiles, for which the demand is growing. The die outlet geometry and the temperatures of the billet and tools must be carefully tuned in order to secure satisfactory material flow conditions. Due to the high pressures in the container, the deformation of the extrusion dies and the distortion of the die outlet may be significant and must be compensated for. The thermal conditions in the extrusion press must also be controlled. Even in the age of numerical modelling much trial and error is needed to make certain that the product satisfies the customer requirements. If simple and effective process control could be implemented, the cost and dimensional variability of extruded profiles could be significantly reduced. This would not only secure the continued use of extruded profiles in old markets but also open new ones. The main objective of this study has been to establish useful and simple methods for measuring the pressure at the interface between the die and the billet and the deformation of the die during hot extrusion of aluminium. Pressure measurement data may be used to establish {{a better understanding of the}} extrusion process and to carefully evaluate the many numerical extrusion models that are presently being developed and refined for the purpose of predicting profile shape and properties. A most important task is the evaluation of constitutive models used to describe bulk material and friction behaviour. The requirements for such models should be viewed in relation to common flow instability phenomena such as buckling. Sensors may in the future be integrated in intelligent extrusion dies in order to make certain that temperature and flow condition changes are as small as possible and to prevent overloading of extrusion dies during production. It is of the utmost importance that dimensional variability is detected early. This study has consisted of many parts. The first step was a careful evaluation of sensor designs using the Capacitec HPC- 75 high-temperature capacitive displacement probes and the Capacitec 4004 amplifier series. The feasibility of high- and low-temperature pressure measurement was demonstrated through various types of compression testing. The capacitive sensors were repeatedly tested in a hot air furnace to 650 ºC, and results were satisfactory for all but one of the sensors. The sensor sensitivity to temperature changes that occur during extrusion is usually less than 10 % of the full sensor response. The pressure sensors have been repeatedly tested in several dies for aluminium rod extrusion. The feasibility of, and a method for, performing useful measurements in the high-temperature extrusion environment have been demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is better than ± 10 % of full scale of 200 MPa when the effects of temperature changes are compensated for. The measurement repeatability is of a similar magnitude for genuinely replicated measurements. The measurement resolution is better than 1 %. It is firmly believed that the measurement and calibration technology may be further improved, and that the measurement accuracy may be better than 5 % of full scale. Rod extrusion experiments allowed the quality of the finite element modelling approach to be evaluated. The code ALMA 2 π was used, and material data of the Zener-Hollomon flow rule have been obtained by compression testing. Simulated and measured results of the ram force, die face pressure and liner force generally differed less than 10 %. The estimated die outlet temperature change was systematically 10 ºC too high. As there are significant differences between extrusion and compression testing, the use of material data from compression testing amounts to an extrapolation of data. Experiments did not demonstrate that the approach is unacceptable, but plots showing the deviation between experimental and estimated ram force and outlet temperature data indicated that there are a number of parameter combinations that are equally good as or even better than those obtained through compression testing. Very high accuracy determination of flow parameters may be difficult. Measurement errors significantly complicate matters. The pressure sensors may be used to study practical extrusion problems and to establish a better understanding of metal flow and the significance of die deformation. Thin strip extrusion experiments were performed to gain insight into the thermo-mechanics of flow instability (buckling). The feasibility of performing pressure measurement during the extrusion of thin strips was demonstrated, but sensors were not properly calibrated. The first round of the experiments was run with a die outlet 78. 5 mm wide and 1. 7 mm thick, and a container diameter of 100 mm. During extrusion of AA 6060 flow instability phenomena were not encountered. A second round of experiments was performed with non-instrumented dies and somewhat thinner profiles (1. 1 and 1. 4 mm). Flow instability in the form of buckling was provoked for high outlet temperatures, and many replicate experiments were performed. The shape of the buckled thin strip was also measured continuously with a laser triangulation technique during extrusion at high speed. Due to limitations related to the experimental set-up, neither the resolution nor the accuracy of the approach was entirely satisfactory. Nonetheless, the feasibility of the approach was demonstrated, and it is quite possible to improve the measurement technique. Capacitive pressure measurement techniques have been combined with methods for measuring the deformation of the mandrel and the straining of the bridges to study the behaviour of dies during tube extrusion. Capacitec capacitive probes were used to measure bridge strains. High temperature Kyowa strain gauges were also used for the same purpose. The <b>die</b> <b>mandrel</b> deflection was measured by conventional displacement transducers connected to the mandrel and the die cap by rods. Only measurements by the capacitive sensors proved sufficiently reliable during measurements. The study revealed that the state of stress in dies for hollow profiles may be very close to critical. The die face pressure at the top face of the mandrel exceeded 500 MPa. Two rounds of industrial experiments were performed with a U-profile that proved most difficult to extrude. In the first round of experiments, the flow stability was not satisfactory, and plugging of the outlet ruined experiments. The second round was more successful, and sensors were used to record the die face pressure on-line. The experiments demonstrated the feasibility of industrial experiments, but clearly indicated that further development of the sensors should be performed. It is important that sensors are made more durable, and that calibration techniques are further developed. Practical die designs that allow simple integration of sensors in the press should be developed. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{drawing process}} using {{tools such as}} <b>dies,</b> plugs and <b>mandrels</b> has been {{conventionally}} applied {{as a means of}} miniaturizing tubes. However, {{it is not easy to}} scale down the conventional process to micro sizes for many reasons related to the tools used in the process.

40|$|One of the {{prospective}} applications of wrought AM 30 magnesium alloy {{is in the}} form of hollow circular extrusions.

40|$|Abstract. Tube bending is {{a complex}} process with multi-factor {{coupling}} effect and multiple defects occurring. The wall thinning, {{as one of the}} important defects in tube bending, determines the bending quality.

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem.

If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die.

40|$|Purpose: This paper reports {{results of}} {{in-house}} experimentation and an exhaustive literature search on heat treatment of H 13 tool steel. Heat treatment strategy {{practiced by the}} industry is described in detail. Effect of various types of heat treatment on fracture toughness and hardness is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Because of its versatility and wide applications, aluminum has been dubbed as the metal of the millennium. Commercial extrusion of aluminum alloys is a cyclic hot-working process. The magnitude of the thermal and mechanical stresses generated in the die and relevant tooling is therefore {{a major factor in}} extrusion. The <b>die</b> and <b>mandrel</b> (used for hollow profiles) are the most important tools subject to wear and are, at the same time, the most highly stressed tools in extrusion. For reliability and durability of an extrusion die, the load carrying capacity of the tool steel, its high-temperature fatigue properties, and its wear resistance become critically important. To withstand large stresses, the steel should have high strength and toughness, and to resist wear it should have high hardness and surface integrity. This combination of high toughness and high hardness is usually achieved through specific heat treatment and surface hardening sequences. Findings: Toughness (expressed in terms of plane-strain fracture toughness KIC or Charpy impact energy CVN) and hardness (HRC) of H 13 steel vary in a nonlinear manner against tempering temperature. Toughness shows a decreasing-increasing trend, while hardness exhibits an opposite increasing-decreasing pattern with increasing tempering temperature. Research limitations/implications: Optimum heat treatment strategy for commercial aluminum estrusion dies (H 13 steel) appears to be tempering in the 525 - 550 ºC temperature range, to get the best combination of high toughness and high hardness Originality/value: Experimental data from closely monitored heat treatment and mechanical testing has been added to the available published data. Careful and judicious extrapolatiopn-intrapolatioon has also been carried out to complete the data matrices. Analysis of the resulting variation pattersns provideds a good scientific foundation for devising an optimal heat treatment strategy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe rotary draw bending(RDB) {{of large}} {{diameter}} thin-walled (LDTW) tube needs the strict cooperation of multiple processing parameters to avoid possible multiple defects. Due {{to the specific}} properties, the bending behaviors of LDTW commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) tube are much more complex to achieve precise deformation. With the CP-Ti tube of 50. 8 mm (out diameter, D) × 0. 508 mm (wall thickness, t) × 101. 6 mm (bending radius, R) as a representative component, the bending behaviors of LDTW CP-Ti tube under different processing conditions were investigated. With experiments and analytical analysis, the bending characteristics of the CP-Ti tube were identified. Then, based on the orthogonal experimental design, a series of three-dimensional FE models of RDB for LDTW CP-Ti tube were established, {{and the effects of}} processing parameters on the bending behaviors were numerically investigated. The results show that: 1) Wrinkling is the primary behavior for the LDTW CP-Ti tube in RDB, and the larger the difference between the maximum wall thickening and the maximum wall thinning degrees of the bent tube, the larger the wrinkling tendency; 2) The bending behaviors of the LDTW CP-Ti tube are very sensitive to the some processing parameters, and the wrinkling is significantly affected by the mandrel shank diameter, while the wall thinning is remarkably affected by the clearance between wiper <b>die</b> and tube, <b>mandrel</b> shank diameter.
