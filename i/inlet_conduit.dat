40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical {{framework for the}} design and/or analysis of baffles to reduce floatables discharges from combined-sewer overflows (CSOs). This simple analytical framework, which is supported with a spreadsheet model, is described and compared to its predecessors to illustrate its advantages. These advantages include ease of use, improved applicability to typical installation configurations, and refined analyses of floatables-removal mechanisms. Refined analyses include a simple accounting for flow path through a chamber—including a provision for situations where the invert of the <b>inlet</b> <b>conduit</b> is at a higher elevation than {{the bottom of the}} baffle—and a simple accounting for floatables capture via the underflow (dry-weather connection) during overflow conditions. Results of the model are compared to the results of the previous approaches and to available laboratory test data for four test cases. Examples of the model application to actual cases in the City of New York are available from the author. Finally, possible areas for future improvement in the model approach are identified. 1...|$|E

For this reason T-mixers have been studied in the {{literature}} and its working flow regimes have been identified, {{as well as the}} instabilities leading to the onset of these flow regimes. However, in most of the available theoretical studies it is assumed that only one working fluid is used, i. e. that the same fluid at the same thermodynamic conditions is entering the two <b>inlet</b> <b>conduits</b> of the mixer. Conversely, the practical use of micro-devices often involves the mixing of two different fluids or of the same fluid at different thermodynamic conditions. In this case the scenario of possible flow regimes can be substantially different from that observed for a single working fluid. To investigate this aspect, the present work aims at identifying the flow regimes in a T-mixers when water at two different temperatures is entering the mixer, the viscosity and density depending on temperature. The effect of the temperature difference on the flow regimes in a 3 D T-mixer is investigated by DNS and stability analysis, and the results are compared to the case in which a single working fluid is employed...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 52). Currently {{many patients}} die {{because of the}} end-stage heart failure, mainly due to the reduced number of donor heart transplant organs. Studies show that a permanent left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a battery driven pump which is surgically implanted, increased the survival rate of patients with end-stage heart failure and improved considerably their quality of life. The <b>inlet</b> <b>conduit</b> of the LVAD {{is attached to the}} left ventricle and the outflow conduit anastomosed to the ascending aorta. The purpose of LVAD support is to help a weakened heart to pump blood {{to the rest of the}} body. However LVAD can cause some alterations of the natural blood flow. When your blood comes in contact with something that isn't a natural part of your body blood clots can occur and disrupt blood flow. Aortic valve integrity is vital for optimal support of left ventricular assist LVAD. Due to the existence of high continuous transvalvular pressure on the aortic valve, the opening frequency of the valve is reduced. To prevent the development of aortic insufficiency, aortic valve closure during LVAD implantation has been performed. However, the closed aortic valve reduces wash out of the aortic root, which causes blood stagnation and potential thrombus formation. So for this reason, there is a need to minimize the risks of occurring blood clot, by having more knowledge about the flow structure in the aorta during LVAD use. The current study focuses on measuring the flow field in the aorta of the LVAD assisted heart with two different types of aortic valve (Flat and Finned) using the SDSU cardiac simulator. The pulsatile pump that mimics the natural pulsing action of the heart also added to the system. The flow field is visualized using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Furthermore, The fluid mechanics of aorta has been studied when LVAD conduit attached to two different locations (proximal and distal to the aortic valve) with pump speeds of 8, 000 to 10, 000 revolutions per minute (RPM). As LVAD speed increases, the velocity of the defined area (close to the proximal anastomosis) increases linearly but inversely the stagnation index decreases. We observed that with Finned valve attachment, the stagnation value is lower than the flat valve so the results suggest that D 1 valve has lower risk of thrombosis close to the aortic valve...|$|E
40|$|Efficient mixing {{between two}} or more fluids in small volumes is a key target in many processes. Among the most common micro-devices, T-shaped micro-mixers are widely used. For this reason T-mixers have been studied in the {{literature}} and their working flow regimes have been identified and characterized. In particular the transition between the vortex regime and the engulfment regime received large attention because {{the onset of the}} engulfment regime promotes significantly the mixing process. In most of the available theoretical and numerical studies it is assumed that the same fluid at the same thermodynamic conditions is entering the two <b>inlet</b> <b>conduits</b> of the mixer. Conversely, the practical use of micro-devices often involves the mixing of two different fluids or of the same fluid at different conditions. The goal of this thesis is the study of the vortex and engulfment regime in a T-mixer when water at two different temperatures is entering the mixer. In particular we focus on the effect of the temperature onset of the engulfment regime. While density variations are weak and can be neglected, variations in viscosity can be significant for water, depending on the temperature difference of the two streams entering the mixer. Therefore, the considered flow configuration can be used to study the effects of viscosity variations on the vortex and the engulfment regimes. A specific T-mixer geometry is considered here which has been previously characterized in details by direct numerical simulation (DNS) and stability analysis when only one working fluid is employed. Here we use the same tools, i. e. DNS and stability analysis, to investigate the case in which water at two different temperatures is entering the mixer and we consider temperature jumps up to 40 °C. In first place the case of a plane T-mixer it has been studied: we characterized the imperfect pitchfork bifurcation that occurs when water at different temperatures is considered and we validated the linear stability code. Then we describe the effect of the temperature on the flow regime for the 3 D case studied by means of DNS. The analysis shows the effect of the temperature jump on the vortical structures and on the fluid motion both for the vortex and the engulfment regime and describes the transition process that leads from the first to the second flow configuration. Moreover the degree of mixing for different values of the temperature jump and of the Reynolds number has been investigated. Finally we compared the results obtained with DNS and global stability analysis both for the values of the critical Reynolds and for the perturbation field. The result are in agreement and show that higher values of the temperature jump promote the onset of the engulfment regime...|$|R

Envisaging this facet present endeavour attempts to develop a computational model for designing runner conduit lateral dimension in a plastic injection mould through which thermoplastic melt gets injected. At outset injection phenomenon is represented by governing equations on the basis of mass, momentum and energy conservation principles [1]. Embracing Hagen Poiseuille flow problem analogous to runner conduit injection the manuscript uniquely imposes runner <b>conduit</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet boundary conditions along with relative to appropriate assumptions; governing equations evolve a computation model as criteria for designing. To overwhelm Non-Newtonian’s abstruse Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch correction factor has been adopted byaccommodating thermoplastic melt behaviour towards the final stage of derivation. The resulting final computational model is believed to express runner conduit dimensions as a function of available type of injection moulding machine specifications, characteristics of thermoplastic melt and required features of component being moulded. Later the equation so obtained has been verified by using dimensional analysis method...|$|R

The valve then closes and the turntable rotates to index the next bottle beneath the reservoir at the filling station, and the operation is repeated to fill the latter bottle.

40|$|Successful {{anatomic}} fitting {{of a total}} {{artificial heart}} (TAH) is vital to achieve optimal pump hemodynamics after device implantation. Although many anatomic fitting studies have been completed in humans prior to clinical trials, few reports exist that detail the experience in animals for in vivo device evaluation. Optimal hemodynamics are crucial throughout the in vivo phase to direct design iterations and ultimately validate device performance prior to pivotal human trials. In vivo evaluation in a sheep model allows a realistically sized representation of a smaller patient, for which smaller third-generation TAHs {{have the potential to}} treat. Our study aimed to assess the anatomic fit of a single device rotary TAH in sheep prior to animal trials and to use the data to develop a three-dimensional, computer-aided design (CAD) -operated anatomic fitting tool for future TAH development. Following excision of the native ventricles above the atrio-ventricular groove, a prototype TAH was inserted within the chest cavity of six sheep (28 – 40 [*]kg). Adjustable rods representing <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>conduits</b> were oriented toward the center of each atrial chamber and the great vessels, with conduit lengths and angles recorded for future analysis. A three-dimensional, CAD-operated anatomic fitting tool was then developed, {{based on the results of}} this study, and used to determine the inflow and outflow conduit orientation of the TAH. The mean diameters of the sheep left atrium, right atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were 39, 33, 12, and 11 [*]mm, respectively. The center-to-center distance and outer-edge-to-outer-edge distance between the atria, found to be 39 [*]±[*] 9 [*]mm and 72 [*]±[*] 17 [*]mm in this study, were identified as the most critical geometries for successful TAH connection. This geometric constraint restricts the maximum separation allowable between left and right inlet ports of a TAH to ensure successful alignment within the available atrial circumference.

40|$|Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions comprise a complex series of processes involving {{withdrawal from the}} magma chamber, magma ascent along the conduit and eruption column dynamics. Numerous studies have modeled the different sub-domains of a volcanic system, but their interplay has seldom been analyzed. To this end, we developed C 3 (C-cubed, that stands for Chamber, Conduit and Column), a new integrated model that describes the dynamics of an explosive eruption {{as a series of}} steady state regimes and as a function of geometry and initial conditions of the magma reservoir. We used Global Sensitivity Analysis to quantify the role of the relevant model parameters and describe the interplay between the different volcanic sub-domains. In particular, we analyzed the evolution of a sustained explosive eruption in order to identify the conditions for buoyant, super-buoyant and collapsing columns. Input data were based on field reconstructions of Quaternary explosive eruptions in the Vulsini Volcanic District (Roman Province, central Italy). Model results show that: 1) the column regime, although affected by complex interactions among several factors, mostly depends on the conduit radius, the volatile content (i. e. supersaturation concentration {{at the top of the}} chamber) and length of the conduit, in decreasing level of importance; 2) the amount of mass erupted is independent of the conduit radius and depends mostly on volatile supersaturation, the radius of the magma chamber, the length of the conduit and the overpressure at the conduit inlet; 3) the mass flow-rate, column height and duration of the eruption are largely controlled by the conduit radius; 4) the flow pressure and density at the conduit exit are mostly controlled by the <b>conduit</b> <b>inlet</b> overpressure at the onset of the eruption, and by the length of the conduit at the end of the eruption; 5) the exit velocity from the conduit is mostly controlled by the volatile content, the length of the <b>conduit</b> and the <b>inlet</b> overpressure. In this model framework, and with specific reference to selected Plinian events of the Vulsini Volcanic District, simulation results show that column collapse is not achieved for reasonable eruption durations (order of hours) and conduit widths (tens of meters). This is consistent with field reconstructions suggesting that column collapse did not likely occur and that pyroclastic flows were therefore generated by independent mechanisms from ring fissures and/or multiple vents concomitant to caldera collapse. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of fundamental flow {{conditions in the}} magma chamber plus conduit system–such as pressure, velocity, mass flow-rate, erupted mass, etc. –during sustained magmatic explosive eruptions was investigated. To this aim, simplified one-dimensional and isothermal models of magma chamber emptying and conduit flow were developed and coupled together. The chamber model assumed an homogeneous composition of magma and a vertical profile of water content. The chamber could have a cylindrical, elliptical or spherical rigid geometry. Inside the chamber, magma {{was assumed to be}} in hydrostatic equilibrium both before and during the eruption. Since the time-scale of pressure variations at the conduit inlet–of the order of hours–is much longer than the travel time of magma in the conduit–of the order of a few minutes–the flow in the conduit was assumed as at steady-state. The one dimensional mass and momentum balance equations were solved along a circular conduit with constant diameter assuming choked-flow conditions at the exit. Bubble nucleation was considered when the homogeneous flow pressure dropped below the nucleation pressure given the total water content and the solubility law. Above the nucleation level, bubbles and liquid magma were considered in mechanical equilibrium. The same equilibrium assumption was made above the fragmentation level between gas and pyroclasts. Due to the hydrostatic hypothesis, the integration of the density distribution in the chamber allowed to obtain the total mass in the chamber as a function of pressure at the chamber top and, through the conduit model, as a function of time. Simulation results pertaining to rhyolitic and basaltic magmas defined at the Volcanic Eruption Mechanism Modeling Workshops (Durham, NH, 2002; Nice, France, 2003) are presented. Important flow variables, such as pressure, density, velocity, shear stress in the chamber and conduit, are discussed as a function of time and magma chamber and conduit properties. Results indicate that vent variables react in different ways to the pressure variation of the chamber. Pressure, density and mass flow-rate show relative variations of the same order of magnitude as the <b>conduit</b> <b>inlet</b> pressure, whereas velocity is more constant in time. Sill-like chambers produce also significantly longer and more voluminous eruptions than dike-like chambers. Water content stratification in the chamber and the increase of chamber depth significantly reduce the eruption duration and volume. Maximum erupted mass fractions of about 0. 2 are computed for small water-saturated and shallow chambers...|$|R
40|$|Cayuga Lake {{serves as}} a {{drinking}} water source {{as well as a}} popular recreational lake. It is the second largest of the Finger Lakes (New York, USA), with a long narrow shape. Concerns exist regarding the lake’s phosphorus and turbidity loadings, specifically on the southern shelf (also where three point sources discharge: two waste water treatment plants and Cornell’s Lake Source Cooling Facility). Cayuga Inlet, along with Fall Creek, flow into the southern end and account for 40 % of the total inflow to the entire lake. Studies indicate Cayuga Inlet and Fall Creek account for 87 % of the bioavailable phosphorus load specifically entering in the southern shelf. A number of complex physical processes establish exchange and transport between the lake and the inlet. Understanding which mechanisms control transport of loadings is essential to evaluating the processes that govern water quality. Using data collected over the summer and fall months in 2015 and 2016 along Cayuga Inlet, from the inflowing tributaries, through the inlet, and out to the southern lake, we examine various physical mechanisms and their influence on turbidity loads. Velocity profiles in Cayuga Inlet are captured with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and High Resolution (HR) acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP), and turbulence measures with an acoustic Dopper velocimeter (ADV). Water quality sondes are used to monitor turbidity and temperature along with a widely-distributed set of thermistors to obtain a detailed description of temperature structures throughout the area of interest. Data from United States Geographical Survey (USGS) gage stations as well as local meteorological stations are utilized to more fully understand forcing mechanisms important to flow behavior in Cayuga Inlet. Our results suggest flow through Cayuga Inlet is continuously influenced by barotropic seiches in Cayuga Lake while occasional large baroclinic events occur, the largest of which transport lake water into Cayuga Inlet. Over the stratified season exchange flows are typical and largely forced by temperature differences between the tributaries and southern lake bounding the inlet. The predominant wind stress is along the axis of the lake and the inlet and sets up seiching behavior in the lake which influences flow behavior in the inlet. A strong wind stress also increases vertical mixing in the inlet. Minimal sediment resuspension occurs in the inlet and generally, the <b>inlet</b> is a <b>conduit</b> through which suspended sediment is advected. The tributaries carry significant turbidity loads into the inlet during runoff events, which in two layer flows under conditions of cooler tributary temperatures relative to the inlet and southern lake, typically appear in the lower layer. In the spring, when the southern lake is expected to be cooler than that observed over the summer and fall deployment periods analyzed here and tributary flows are expected to warm faster, significant turbidity loads may pass through the top layer of the inlet with more frequency. At times turbidity loads in the southern lake are transported by seiching back into the inlet and again in two layer flows typically appear in the appropriate stratified layer based on the southern lake temperature relative to the inlet and tributaries...|$|R
