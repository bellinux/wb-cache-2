[...] While a few Hall of Fame defencemen, such as Red Kelly and Doug Harvey, were known for having offensive ability, they were {{the exception rather than}} the norm in the NHL before Orr's arrival. Orr's offensive style has influenced countless defencemen who followed him. His speed – most notably a rapid acceleration – and his open-ice artistry electrified fans as he set almost every conceivable record for a defenceman. When Orr and the Bruins visited cities, attendance was usually a sell-out. According to long-time Bruins coach and general manager Harry Sinden, [...] "Bobby became a star in the NHL about the time they played the National Anthem for his first game with us". Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote that during the [...] "Orr years. Those Bruins were the top draw <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>town</b> every day for five seasons.

2500|$|Owing to {{the nature}} of the ceremonies and the {{necessity}} of commencing at an early hour, it was impossible to accommodate a large congregation at the consecration of the church. Two days later, on 8 May, Cardinal Wiseman returned for the opening ceremony and High Mass, at which he preached. It was the octave day of the Ascension and hence the text chosen for the sermon. Secular newspaper reports of the time state that the Cardinal preached standing at the centre of the Altar, and that it was long!
