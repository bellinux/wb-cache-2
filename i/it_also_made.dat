5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|In February, Rivers {{submitted}} {{a bill to}} provide more funding for food banks and other charitable causes. The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the donations received by utilities separate from gross income, allowing {{for it to be}} tax-free. The bill passed in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed {{to make it to the}} Senate floor.|$|E
5|$|Machine Head's sixth studio album, titled The Blackening, was {{released}} in North America on March 27, 2007. It entered the Billboard 200 at number 53, the highest charting position for the band at that time, with first-week sales of 15,000. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the top 20 in several European countries.

5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|When unoccupied, the {{children}} tended {{to their own}} needs and played with toy marbles and hobby horses. Some learned to count by playing hide and seek. Play was primarily for inculcating virtuous traits like courage and loyalty, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> life more tolerable. Black and white children played together {{before the age of}} ten, but separated afterwards based on the demands of work. Children often helped the adults, and performed chores (like fetching wood or water) that quickly escalated into full work responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the {{reformatory}} he used his time to begin writing a lengthy poem. He published it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own touch to the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1851, a {{new state}} {{constitution}} was created and ratified. Among the constitution's new clauses was {{an extension of the}} terms of representatives to two years and senators to four years. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. The new constitution delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only convened a session every two years. The new constitution also placed new limits on the General Assembly's power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state level laws that were only applied to one town or county.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Miguel {{released}} Romance, {{a collection}} of classic Latin ballads, the oldest of which {{dates back to the}} 1940s. The album was produced by Armando Manzanero and arranged by Bebu Silvetti, and was credited for revitalizing the bolero genre. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> history as the first Spanish-language album to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. A follow-up to Romance was released in 1994 under the title Segundo Romance (Second Romance), which was produced by Miguel, Juan Carlos Calderón and Kiko Cibrian. Both albums received a platinum certification by the RIAA in the United States and also became successful in countries outside of Latin America and the United States, such as Finland and Saudi Arabia, selling over twelve million copies combined.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{understood}} {{the problems facing}} his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held in the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe (where the family had vast domains), the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the Austrian position in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift {{the center of the}} Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the recovery of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.|$|E

5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{then made}} short {{work of the}} Kings, {{defeating}} them in four straight, before eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in five games {{to set up a}} rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal. This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 4–2 victory in Montreal on May 25, 1989. The clinching win was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on Montreal Forum ice. Al MacInnis captured the Conn Smythe as playoffs' most valuable player, while long-time captain Lanny McDonald announced his retirement. The 1989 Stanley Cup win gave Flames co-owner Sonia Scurfield (Ralph's widow) the distinction of being the first (and as of 2013, only) Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the Cup. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> Kwong one of the few to have his name on both the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the release}} of Spirit in November 2007, the song peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital {{download}} sales.

However, it was more successful on the US Adult Pop Songs and Pop Songs charts, peaking at numbers 23 and 24, respectively. As part of promotion, a music video was shot in New York City and featured Chace Crawford as Lewis's love interest. In January 2009, she performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E

5|$|Guadeloupe {{was taken}} over as a British colony for the {{remainder}} of the war, only restored to France after Napoleon's abdication in 1814. The following year, during the Hundred Days, Guadeloupe's governor Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois declared for the Emperor once more, requiring another British invasion, although of much smaller size and duration, to restore the monarchy. The fall of Guadeloupe marked the end of the final French territory in the Caribbean; the entire region was now in the hands of either the British or the Spanish, except the independent state of Haiti. The lack of French privateers and warships sparked a boom in trade operations, and the economies of the Caribbean islands experienced a resurgence. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> a significant reduction in French international trade and had a corresponding effect on the French economy. Finally, the capture of the last French colony struck a decisive blow to the Atlantic slave trade, which had been made illegal by the British government in 1807 and was actively persecuted by the Royal Navy. Without French colonies in the Caribbean, there was no ready market for slaves in the region and the slave trade consequently dried up.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism.|$|E

5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
