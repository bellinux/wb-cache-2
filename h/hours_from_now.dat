40|$|The Crossbow Technology 700 series {{vertical}} gyros (VG) and inertial {{measurement units}} (IMU) have a specification for bias stability at constant temperature. What does bias stability mean? Figure 1 shows a typical output of rate vs. {{time for a}} VG 700 CA unit. Note that the peak-to-peak noise is about 0. 38 deg/sec or about 1400 deg/hr. How can we measure a bias of less than 20 deg/hr? Bias is a long term average of the data. It is meaningless {{in terms of a}} single data point. To measure the bias, we must first take a long sequence of data, and find the average value. Clearly, in Fig 1, the bias is about 0. 15 deg/sec. Bias stability refers to changes in the bias measurement. For example, what would the bias be if we took data two <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> <b>now?</b> To measure bias stability, we need to measure the bias many times and see how the bias changes over time. Even this leaves some open questions: for how long should we average the data; how many times should we measure the bias to make a valid measurement of the bias stability? Figure 1. VG 700 CA rate output Fortunately, all of these questions have been worked out already.

40|$|It {{often happens}} that {{philosophical}} problems arise through noticing that our {{thoughts about the}} world cannot be quite right; and {{in most of these}} cases this is so because we have discovered that two (or more) statements we used to regard as true cannot both (or all) be true if taken together. The problem of free will is a case in point. On the one hand, we are absolutely sure that there are at least some cases where we make decisions, and that in making them we are free and hence responsible for these decisions. We cannot {{imagine what it would be}} like to live in a community in which there is no such thing as responsibility. On the other hand, the results arrived at in the natural sciences seem to show that freedom as we intuitively understand it does not exist. Freedom appears to be impossible in a world where everything runs its ordinary course and no irregularities happen. But why is that so? Why does our natural way of looking at the world fail to fit the scientific way of looking at it? Let’s try to take a first step towards giving an answer to this question by looking at a simple example. I am lying in bed; the alarm clock starts ringing. I really ought to get up, for in an <b>hour</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> a meeting of the faculty board will be opened. But it’s been a late night, and it would nice to lie in.
