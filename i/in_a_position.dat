5|$|A few works relate Trijata to Vibhishana <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> {{other than}} his daughter. The Ananda Ramayana and the Marathi Bhavartha Ramayana of Eknath regard Trijata as the wife and the sister of Vibhishana (thus sister of Ravana) respectively. The Jain version, the Vasudevahindi of Samghadasa Gani, says Trijata is a sister of Ravana, Vibhishana, Kumbhakarna, and Shurpanakha. Jayamangala's {{commentary}} on the Bhattikavya also describes Trijata as Ravana's sister.|$|E
5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> to rule the entire Republic under an {{unofficial}} principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains.

Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E

American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E

5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber.

Purpose: Immobilized {{skeletal}} muscle placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shortened <b>position</b> displays disuse atrophy, whereas when placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stretched <b>position</b> it does not. We hypothesized that characteristics of disuse atrophy such as attenuated rates of protein synthesis and induction of the repressors of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) signaling, regulated in development and DNA-damage response (REDD) 1 and REDD 2, and atrogenes, Muscle Atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and Muscle Ring Finger 1 (MuRF 1), would not manifest in {{skeletal muscle}} immobilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stretched <b>position.</b> Methods: Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats {{were subjected to}} unilateral hindlimb immobilization for 3 days. Ten were immobilized in plantarflexion with the soleus muscle placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shortened <b>position,</b> while another ten were immobilized in dorsiflexion, with the soleus muscle placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stretched <b>position.</b> Soleus muscles from immobilized hindlimbs were compared to contralateral non-immobilized hindlimbs. Results: Soleus muscles immobilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shortened <b>position</b> exhibited disuse atrophy, an attenuated rate of protein synthesis (30 % of the non-immobilized limb), repressed mTORC 1 signaling as assessed by phosphorylation of p 70 ribosomal protein S 6 kinase 1 (p 70 S 6 K 1) on Thr 389 (15 % of the non-immobilized limb), and induction of REDD 1, REDD 2, MAFbx and MuRF 1 gene expression (350 %, 600 %, 250 %, and 200 % of the non-immobilized limb, respectively). Soleus muscles immobilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stretched <b>position</b> exhibited no differences between immobilized and non-immobilized muscles for muscle mass, rate of protein synthesis, p 70 S 6 K 1 phosphorylation, or induction of REDD 1, REDD 2, MAFbx or MuRF 1. In addition, soleus muscles immobilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stretched <b>position</b> exhibited elevated Akt Ser 473 and Forkhead box O 3 a (FoxO 3 a) Ser 253 phosphorylation, which suggests that FoxO 3 a-mediated induction of atrogenes is inhibited by Akt signaling. Conclusion: Skeletal muscle immobilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stretched <b>position</b> is protected from changes associated with disuse atrophy. Research funded by NIH DK- 15658...|$|R
