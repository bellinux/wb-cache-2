This simulation allows changing most of its parameters, such as the number of elements in the PSD array, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> the viewing/scanning angle, the object rotation, translation, sample/scan/simulation time, etc. In addition, results show {{for the first time the}} possibility of scanning an object in 3 D when using an a-Si:H thin film 128 PSD array sensor and hardware/software system. Moreover, this sensor technology is able to perform these scans and render 3 D objects at high speeds and high resolutions when using a sheet-of-light laser within a triangulation platform. As shown by the simulation, a substantial enhancement in 3 D object profile image quality and realism can be achieved by increasing the number of elements of the PSD array sensor as well as by achieving an optimal position response from the sensor since clearly the definition of the 3 D object profile depends on the correct and accurate position response of each detector as well as on the size of the PSD array...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An active {{vision system}} {{can control the}} gaze <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> mounted <b>vision</b> sensors and can {{overcome}} many shortcomings <b>of</b> other passive <b>vision</b> systems which have fixed vision sensors. Furthermore, most visual servoing approaches are concerned with a vision sensor or a passive stereo vision system which has fixed relative coordination between two cameras. In this paper, the problem of controlling a motion by visual servoing with an active stereo vision system is addressed. The main goal is to track the object with our active vision system. Firstly, we discuss how to stack image Jacobians in an active stereo vision system and how to control the active stereo cameras based on images. Next, we introduce our active vision system, which has a fast and simple system architecture that uses a high-speed serial communication bus (IEEE 1394 a). It is manipulated by a distributed and jerk-bounded control algorithm to ensure smooth system motion. Finally, simulation and experimental results show both {{the validity of the}} proposed definition of the stacked Jacobian to control the system and the feasibility of the proposed the control method.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{considers}} a sensor management problem where {{a number of}} road bounded vehicles are monitored by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a gimballed vision sensor. The problem is {{to keep track of}} all discovered targets and simultaneously search for new targets by controlling the pointing <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vision</b> sensor and the motion of the UAV. A planner based on a state-machine is proposed with three different modes; target tracking, known target search, and new target search. A high-level decision maker chooses among these sub-tasks to obtain an overall situational awareness. A utility measure for evaluating the combined search and target tracking performance is also proposed. By using this measure it is possible to evaluate and compare the rewards of updating known targets versus searching for new targets in the same framework. The targets are assumed to be road bounded and the road network information is used both to improve the tracking and sensor management performance. The tracking and search are based on flexible target density representations provided by particle mixtures and deterministic grids...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the conflict between traditional Marxist attitudes toward war {{and the problem of}} the nuclear revolution. It shows how the advent of the nuclear revolution in the 1950 s undermined traditional Marxist-Leninist concepts of war, and then goes on to argue that this development must be placed at the centre of contemporary Marxian IR if it is to have explanatory power in the twenty-first century. To make this case directly, it engages with Justin Rosenberg’s revival of Trotsky’s idea of uneven and combined development and its subsidiary law of ‘the whip of external necessity’, and argues that the whip can remain salient today only if one accepts the political utility of nuclear war. The impasse created by the nuclear revolution, it concludes, points Marxist IR in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> classic Marxist <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> supranationalism and human unity...|$|R

40|$|Current {{understanding}} in locomotion research is that, for humans, navigating natural environments {{relies heavily on}} visual input; in contrast, walking on even ground in man-made obstacle and hazard-free environments is so highly automated that visual information derived from floor patterns should not affect locomotion and in particular have {{no impact on the}} <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> travel. The <b>vision</b> literature on motion perception would suggest otherwise; specifically that oblique floor patterns may induce substantial veering away from the intended <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> travel due to the so-called aperture problem. Here, we tested these contrasting predictions by letting participants walk over commonly encountered floor patterns (paving slabs) and investigating participants' ability to walk "straight ahead" for different pattern orientations. We show that, depending on pattern orientation, participants veered considerably over the measured travel distance (up to 8 % across trials), in line with predictions derived from the literature on motion perception. We argue that these findings are important to the study of locomotion, and, if also observed in real world environments, might have implications for architectural design...|$|R
40|$|The last {{section of}} the book offers lessons for action.

In order to move in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vision,</b> van Est argues for three important steps. First, we must reflect on emerging equity and quality issues early in the development of new technologies rather than after they are produced. Van Est challenges researchers to develop constructive suggestions to strengthen equity and equality. Second, we need to mobilize the public rather than wait for people to get interested in nanotechnology. Van Est envisions people of all walks of life weighing in on what they want our nano-enabled future to be. To make this possible we need to stimulate public participation on many levels, including the active engagement of civil society organizations and experts like social scientists, policy makers, and politicians. Third, and perhaps most important for this volume, van Est encourages ELSI-researchers to play {{a more active role in}} the public and political debate so their insights may have a larger impact in society. Publishing in academic journals... or even Yearbooks... may not reach a sufficient audience to make change possible. To further the cause of equity in a meaningful way, academe needs to connect with the larger world. —eds...|$|R

A large body of empirical research has demonstrated the ubiquitous nature of the interactions that take place between vision and touch, with the former typically dominating over the latter. Many studies have investigated the influence of visual stimuli on the processing of tactile stimuli (and vice versa). Other studies, meanwhile, have investigated the effect of directing a participant’s gaze either toward or else away from the body-part receiving the target tactile stimulation. Other studies, by contrast, have compared performance in those conditions in which the participant’s eyes have been open versus closed. We start by reviewing the research that has been published to date demonstrating the influence <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> on the processing of tactile targets, that is, on those stimuli {{that have to be}} attended or responded to.
