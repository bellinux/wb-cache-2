Coast-cross fodder, kikuyu grass, and stylosanthes were planted in 33 -m 2 paddocks with two densities (m 2 /animal) : D 1 = 3 m 2 /animal and D 2 = 1 m 2 /animal. The design was a randomized complete block with a 3 x 2 factorial (three grasses and two densities) and three replications. Grass canopy height, grass mass, morphological composition (leaf, stem, and dead material), losses due to grazing, poultry weight gain and consumption, and concentrate {{feed conversion ratio}} and efficiency were evaluated. At {{the end of the}} experiment, forage and leaves masses were considered low to stylosanthes in D 2 (0. 28 to 0. 03 kg/m 2) and to kikuyu grass in D 1 (0. 13 to 0. 05 kg/m 2) and in D 2 (0. 11 and 0. 03 kg/m 2), respectively. In addition, the grass canopy height was considered low for stylosanthes (6. 50 cm) that could jeopardize the entry of new poultry lot. The three grass species had similar weight gain and revealed better results for 3 m²/ chicken (3. 20 kg/animal). Coast-cross fodder, kikuyu grass, and stylosanthes, with some exceptions, can be considered suitable for grazing <b>fattening</b> <b>poultry</b> at 3 m 2 /animal at the evaluated time of the year (autumn). ...|$|E

40|$|LORENZ (1943) {{demonstrated}} that di-J ethylstilbestrol {{could be used}} for fattening cockerels when it was im-planted subcutaneously. Thayer et al. (1944) reported that feeding estrogens in fattening rations produced high quality, fully fattened market chickens. Thayer et al. (1945) found 3, 4 dianisylhexene- 3 to be more efficient for <b>fattening</b> <b>poultry</b> than diethylstilbestrol when fed orally. Levels of 40 to 50 mgs. of dianisylhexene per pound of feed, fed for a 3 to 4 week fattening period, did not appear to affect growth rate but body fat was increased. Improvement in the market quality of birds was noted by Sykes et al. (1945) when the birds were fed diethylstilbestrol up to 12 weeks of age. No consistent dif-ference in feed consumption or feed utili-zation of the lots was reported by these workers. Glazener and Jull (1946) have shown that diethylstilbestrol fed for a three-week period improved dressing ap-pearance and rate of gain in male birds. Lorenz (1945 a) reported that subcu-taneous implantation of diethylstilbestrol pellets did not markedly affect growth but increased fat deposition. The feeding of diethylstilbestrol had no effect on the birds. Lorenz (1945 b) reported that oral administration of dimethyl ether of di-ethylstilbestrol and hexestrol dimethyl ether produced moderate fattening, but the fattening was definitely less than that produced by implanted pellets of diethyl-stilbestrol...|$|E
40|$|In December 2010, a {{contamination}} of vegetable oils for animal feed {{was found in}} the federal German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Industrial fatty acids with high dioxin concentrations were mixed in with vegetable oils for animal feed and then used for feed production. Con-taminated feed was distributed to various poultry and pig fattening farms as well as laying hen and milk production farms and fed to animals. The control authorities of the Federal States have analysed the dioxin concentrations of meat, egg and milk samples from the farms in question. Only few samples of pork, meat of laying hens and eggs contained dioxin concentrations that exceed the maximum levels per-mitted by the European Union. In milk and meat of <b>fattening</b> <b>poultry</b> maximum levels were not exceeded. Based on its risk assessment, BfR concludes that neither acute nor long-term adverse health effects are expected for consumers even if eggs or pork with the highest measured concentrations are consumed {{over an extended period of}} time. In regard to dioxin, it is not the daily intake of dioxin that is critical for its effects on human health, but rather the amount present in the human body – the body burden. Dioxins accu-mulate in the human body over time. As a result of background exposure, every human be-ing takes in traces of dioxins through foods on a daily basis. Due to the fact that in recent decades the primary sources of dioxins in the environment were eliminated, the dioxin con-tamination of food has decreased considerably. Official controls in food and feed in regard to compliance with maximum levels are carried out on a regular basis. Information gained by the results of the official controls provides options and strategies for a reduction of the human dioxin body burden by identification and elimina-tion of the source of contamination...|$|E
40|$|Livestock {{production}} in Ethiopia has, for long, remained subsistence with limited market-orientation and poor institutional support. Farmers and pastoralists produce and keep animals for various valid reasons, with little market-orientation. However, producing {{for the market}} requires re-orientation of the production system and development of a knowledge based and responsive institutional support services. Institutional support services of extension, research, input supply, rural finance and marketing are key areas of intervention that can {{play a central role}} in the transformation of subsistence mode of {{production in}}. to market orientation. Livestock production systems in Ethiopia can be broadly categorized into crop-livestock mixed systems, pastoral and agro-pastoral system, urban and peri-urban production systems. The demand for institutional support services for livestock development in these production systems vary significantly. The way extension system is structured in Ethiopia may not be in the best interest of farmers and pastoralists and lacks the responsive capacity to the demands for livestock services. In fact, most often livestock development issues are left to development projects and NGOs that have limited scope, coverage and duration. The major inputs for livestock development include animal genetic resources, feeds and forages, veterinary drugs, vaccines, machinery equipment and utensils as well as knowledge. The experience so far has been the supply of improved (exotic?) animal genetic resources for dairy development, sheep production (meat and wool), improved poultry (broiler and egg production), supply of bee colonies, provision of forage seeds and planting material, dairy goats, provision of processing equipment and utensil (dairy, apiculture), drug supply and vaccination services. Most of these activities have been mainly supplied, by the government or government sponsored projects. Limited credit facilities to support livestock asset accumulation and development have been provided by microfinance institutions, food security projects, small-scale micro enterprises and NGOs. The contribution of the private sector in livestock input has been limited to supplies of veterinary drugs and services, roughage and concentrate feeds, and processing equipment and utensils. Recent trends show that there is an encouraging move to involve the private sector in input supplies such as production of beehives. Due to the recent increase demand for live animals and animal products in the domestic and export markets, there has been a renewed interest to promote market-oriented livestock production. As a result, a lot of interventions are happening to engage farmers and pastoralists in a more market-oriented livestock production in areas where the resources offer the opportunities. For example, a lot of activities are happening in apiculture production, small ruminants breeding and fattening, cattle <b>fattening,</b> <b>poultry</b> production and dairy production. Institutions such as microfinance, small-scale and micro enterprises, NGOs, women affairs office are involved in these activities with limited engagement of the Office of Agriculture and Rural Development at Woreda levels. The demand for input supply, particularly for improved animal genetic resources has increased substantially with poor response of the supply side. There is a gap in coordination of efforts and in basing livestock development interventions on scientific knowledge with the value chain in mind. The extension system has to be able to respond to the increasing demand for improved and market-oriented livestock development if farmers, pastoralists and the private commercial producers are to benefit themselves and contribute to the development of the national economy.

At the end, randomly selected 12 birds from each group were killed humanly. Gross lesions were noted and liver and kidney samples were processed for histopathological studies. The results demonstrated a protective effect of propolis particularly upon the liver of broiler chickens, in which it reduced the intensity of regressive lesions.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Abstract: Bearing in mind certain established European Union {{regulations on}} the conventional extensive broiler rearing {{system as well}} as poultry breeding specificities of our country, experimental investigations were organised {{with the aim of}} making a comparison between broiler growth in two different non-industrial rearing systems. The systems included extensive <b>fattening</b> in a <b>poultry</b> house and free-range rearing. The fattening period in both rearing systems lasted up to the 63 rd day of broiler age. During the fattening period chicken growth was controlled by individual chicken weighing on a weekly basis. Based on the research results it was determined that the growth of broilers in both rearing systems was similar up to the 49 th day of age. The differences established were small and statistically insignificant (P> 0. 05). The controls at 56 and 63 days of age showed somewhat higher differences in mean body weights of chicks. The difference determined on the 63 rd day was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). From the results mentioned it could be concluded that the differences in broiler growth between the rearing systems examined increased with the prolongation of the fattening period.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the investment efficiency of the specialized agricultural projects considering different dimensions. These dimensions include: capital turnover, pay back period, return to investment, production safety ratio and price safety ratio. Data have been obtained from unpublished technical and economic feasibility studies recorded at the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank. Cross-section data covering the period 1982 / 1986 for 176 projects or about 20 % of the total specialized agricultural projects in the Kingdom has been utilized to represent the majority of the specialized agricultural projects in the Kingdom. Due to the non-availability of actual data on the productivities of projects, the average pay back ratio of every kind of projects was used as a base to calculate the criteria of investment efficiency. It is concluded that according to the return of capita, milk projects rank first among other activities practiced in the Kingdom. Broiler, wheat production, layers production, Iamb fattening, Iamb breeding and vegetable production in green houses all followed milk projects. The ranking was not the same for the financed agricultural projects till 1987.

40|$|Only {{two years}} after the great {{expansion}} of "AGROŽIV" company, it was evident that mycotoxins have great impact on all segments of poultry production. During that year we were for the first time faced up with problems in <b>poultry</b> <b>fattening.</b> It was not possible to explain the present problems only by bacterial and viral infections, so we assumed that there is another reason for the observed clinical picture. From that time we started to pay more attention on contamination of poultry feed with mycotoxins. In the four years' period, from 1988 to 2002, 57 samples were analyzed for the presence of mycotoxins. Mycotoxicological investigations revealed the presence of T- 2 toxin in 19 samples at concentrations less than 0. 3 mg/kg, in 18 samples at concentration of 0. 5 mg/kg, and in 3 samples 1. 0 mg/kg. Beside this, type A trichotecene DAS was found in 6 of tested samples, and ochratoxin A and in 1 sample. Clinical picture and damages varied depending on mycotoxins' concentrations and poultry age. To exceede this problem in animal production we tried to use the organic and anorganic mycotoxin adsorbents as additives of poultry feed, but the results were not satisfactory enough. So, we resumed that if we really want to resolve problem of mycotoxins we have to start from the field production of poultry feed components...|$|R

40|$|According to Chapter 1 oft the GlHV, dated December 3 rd, 1997 feedlots of <b>Poultry</b> <b>fattening</b> are {{required}} to collect Data from the housing conditions of the animals. Taking these fattening data into consideration during official veterinarian Examinations is designed to getting the best possible Information about the flock. Results of the ante mortem examination are to be examined or explained by its origination, {{to be able to}} determine the general health condition of a herd. This Research was done with the goal of tracing possible causes of Fibrinous Serositis, by taking into consideration the Information of the flock of origin as well as the corresponding data at slaughter. In Course of the Study, 48. 000 male Turkeys of the meat hybrids BIG- 6 were observed regularly every four weeks during the fattening and afterwards from the meat inspection. The 10 chosen Turkey feedlots were split into two groups due to occurred cases of Fibrinous Serositis to date. The Living Turkeys were monitored with an examination sheet, which was divided into three sections, called the farm record. In Terms of the operating data, the data of the management and other factors including a clinical examination, there were differences between the herds of Group 1 and Group 2 regarding Stables (Size, etc.) Caretakers, Hygiene (change of clothes, Desinfection, Cleanliness of feeding tins), time between fattening periods, control measure of Alphitobius diaperinus, Concentration of Ammonia in the air, number of animals that died in the fattening and weight of the individual animals. Often it was just one flock that tipped the scale and made the difference to the other group. During the meat inspection, the differences between the surveyed Herds were able to be determined. Differences were found during the following parameters: - Number of animals that died in the fattening - Carcasses unfit for human consumption - Percentage of the carcasses which are unfit in respect to the number of Animals in the origin flock - Percentage of Turkeys displaying Fibrinous Serositis - Number of the Animals with breast blisters The selection that was made in respect to the Fibrinous Serositis was maintained. Summing up the husbandry conditions and taking into consideration the determined code, there is an explicit difference between the two groups. Group 1 has much better results to Fibrinous Serositis than Group 2. Two feedlots whose results differed severely were compared to determine the differences. The following differences were determined, and they should, if necessary, be examined further in future investigations: - distance of Stable to cadaver place - habits of clothes - changing of the caretakers - cleanliness of feeding tins - stocking density This leads to the conclusion, that the meat inspection do confirm the circumstances of fattening. This makes clear, that the Hygienic circumstances of the keeping of the animals is influential. If the abattoir files too many negative reports, an intervention is recommended and regarded helpful. Due to the differences between the groups, it is possible to give parameters, that could be seen as ways to determine the origins of Fibrinous Serositis. The following points are of special interest, taking into consideration the parameters that have shown differences between the two groups: - human caretaking - Hygiene - Time between fattening periods - (Concentration of Ammonia in the air) - Number of animals that died in the fattening It was found out, that the smallest possible differences can "open a window", or cause the spreading of facultative pathogenic micro-organism. The Studies have shown, that the general standard of Hygiene alone cannot be held responsible for Fibrinous Serositis, but that bad hygienic circumstances are perhaps beneficial to the origins of the disease. <br...|$|R
