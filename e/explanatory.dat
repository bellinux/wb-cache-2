5|$|Apparent {{teleology}} is {{a recurring}} issue in evolutionary biology, {{much to the}} consternation of some writers, and as an <b>explanatory</b> style it remains controversial. There are various reasons for discomfort with teleology among biologists.|$|E

5|$|Sections 9A(3)(b) and 9A(3)(c) of the Interpretation Act {{contemplate}} {{the use of}} <b>explanatory</b> statements to a tabled bill or a speech made by a minister {{on the occasion of}} the motion for the second reading of the bill as interpretive aids. However, they do not permit reference to other <b>explanatory</b> statements or speeches. The statements the court may refer to under these provisions are strictly the statements concerning the bill in question.|$|E
5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her <b>explanatory</b> account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's <b>explanatory</b> account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{argues for}} the need to study cells with {{physical}} methods, as morphology alone had little <b>explanatory</b> value. He notes that in mitosis the dividing cells look like iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a force field.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>explanatory</b> {{note to the}} proposal, it aims at {{utilisation}} of {{already existing}} specific conditions as regards firearms ownership in the Czech Republic (2.75% of adult population having concealed carry license) for security purposes {{as a reaction to}} current threats – especially isolated attacks against soft targets. While there is constitutional right to self-defense, its practical utilization without any weapon is only illusory.|$|E
5|$|Mawson buried Mertz in his {{sleeping}} bag under rough-hewn blocks of snow, {{along with the}} remaining photographic plates and an <b>explanatory</b> note. Mawson staggered back into the Cape Denison hut a month later, missing the Aurora by a matter of hours; she had waited for Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis for three weeks until—concerned by the encroaching winter ice—Davis had sailed her out of Commonwealth Bay and back to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Since 2000, archaeological {{investigations}} have been undertaken {{to find out}} more about the vessels and their states of decay. <b>Explanatory</b> labels have been provided. One barge has been scheduled as an ancient monument and several are included in the National Register of Historic Vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Antiquities Committee {{sponsored}} a travelling {{exhibition of the}} finds from the 1554 wreck from 1977 to 1981, which visited 20 museums across Texas. The exhibition showed an anchor, cannons and the remaining parts of the keel and stern post. Display cases held <b>explanatory</b> text, illustrations and artifacts.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or <b>explanatory</b> power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and <b>explanatory</b> success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful <b>explanatory</b> tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled <b>explanatory</b> power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Suggesting {{the passing}} of a single day, The Loves of the Plants is divided into four cantos, all written in heroic couplets. A preface to the poem {{outlines}} the basics of the Linnaean classification system. Guiding the reader through the garden is a “Botanic Muse” who is described as Linnaeus's inspiration. Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller. The poem is not a narrative; instead, reminiscent of the picaresque tradition, it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty-three separate species which are accompanied by extensive <b>explanatory</b> footnotes.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised <b>explanatory</b> {{treatise}} {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E
25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, {{one wants to}} know if the estimated regression equation is any better than simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample mean (if not, it is said to have no <b>explanatory</b> power). The null hypothesis of no <b>explanatory</b> value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has <b>explanatory</b> power, is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no <b>explanatory</b> power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{for each}} <b>explanatory</b> {{variable}} of interest, {{one wants to}} know whether its estimated coefficient differs significantly from zero—that is, whether this particular <b>explanatory</b> variable in fact has <b>explanatory</b> power in predicting the response variable. Here the null hypothesis is that the true coefficient is zero. This hypothesis is tested by computing the coefficient's t-statistic, as {{the ratio of the}} coefficient estimate to its standard error. If the t-statistic is larger than a predetermined value, the null hypothesis is rejected and the variable is found to have <b>explanatory</b> power, with its coefficient significantly different from zero. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of a zero value of the true coefficient is accepted.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Levine's paper Conceivability, Identity, and the <b>Explanatory</b> Gap {{takes up}} where the criticisms of conceivability arguments, such as the {{inverted}} spectrum argument and the zombie argument, leave off. Levine agrees that conceivability is flawed {{as a means of}} establishing metaphysical realities, but points out that even if we come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical, there is still an <b>explanatory</b> problem.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the heart}} of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental {{reflection}} arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances — a method hospitable to the formation of <b>explanatory</b> hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification. Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to <b>explanatory</b> hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, though he himself was a mathematician of logic and a founder of statistics.|$|E

25|$|However, such an {{epistemological}} or <b>explanatory</b> problem {{might indicate}} an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, {{even if not}} proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.|$|E
