Using quarterly data over the 2000 â€“ 2010 period, LM unit root test is employed which endogenously determines {{up to two}} structural breaks in level and trend. The empirical findings suggest a combination of stationary and nonstationary results for real <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation. Besides, the internal stationarity or nonstationary interactions of real and nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are investigated by inflation. The results indicate that stationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation cause stationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> At the same time nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and inflation could cause a stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> with respect to cointegration. Stationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> cause to nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> while nonstationary nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and stationary inflation could cause stationary or nonstationary real <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> </p...|$|R

(2) For which countries do the desired <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> according to the original Taylor rule and the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> of the euro area differ most and in which respect? The second part includes the accession countries in the analysis. (3) The last question applied to both currency areas (old and potential new) is whether the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> gaps change over time. To answer these questions, first the appropriateness of using the original Taylor rule are calculated and these country-specific <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are compared with the euro area <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> The gaps between the individual <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and the aggregated <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> are calculated using measures like the mean error and the root mean squared error.

Amongst the variables used in pricing these derivative products is the short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> A numbers of short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models that are used to fit the short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exist.

50|$|To hedge {{costs on}} the sale of {{variable}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> bonds, which can rise and fall with the market, local governments, such as Baltimore, purchased <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps which exchange a variable <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for a fixed <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> In a swap deal, when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> rises, the swap seller pays the local government the increased cost on the bond, while when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> falls, the swap seller saves and pays the local government the decreased cost on the bond. The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swap mechanism generally works well, however, between 2007 and 2010 the payments to local governments on their swaps artificially decreased but the cost on their bonds remained at actual market rates.
