40|$|Experimental alcohol-induced liver {{injury is}} {{exacerbated}} by a <b>high</b> <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> diet rich in linoleic acid. We postulated that bioactive oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs) {{play a critical role}} in the development/progression of alcohol-mediated hepatic inflammation and injury. OXLAMs are endogenous ligands for transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1). Herein, we evaluated the role of signaling through TRPV 1 in an experimental animal model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Chronic binge alcohol administration increased plasma OXLAM levels, specifically 9 - and 13 -hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids. This effect was associated with up-regulation of hepatic TRPV 1. Exposure of hepatocytes to these OXLAMs in vitro resulted in activation of TRPV 1 signal transduction with increased intracellular Ca 2 + levels. Genetic depletion of TRPV 1 did not blunt hepatic steatosis caused by ethanol, but prevented hepatic injury. TRPV 1 deficiency protected from hepatocyte death and prevented the increase in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, including tumor necrosis factor-α, IL- 6, macrophage inflammatory protein- 2, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. TRPV 1 depletion markedly blunted ethanol-mediated induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, an important alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation mediator, via fibrin accumulation. This study indicates, for the first time, that TRPV 1 receptor pathway may be involved in hepatic inflammatory response in an experimental animal model of ALD. TRPV 1 -OXLAM interactions appear to play a significant role in hepatic inflammation/injury, further supporting an important role for dietary lipids in ALD...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} {{health effects}} in children from exposure at current ambient levels of ozone are well documented; however, evidence for acute effects from other criteria pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and respirable particles is inconsistent. Whether chronic effects result from long-term exposure {{to any of}} these pollutants during childhood is an important unresolved question. Establishing whether acute or chronic effects result from childhood exposure and identifying sensitive subgroups may require integration of biologic mechanisms of lung defenses, injury, and response into the study design and statistical models used in analyses. This review explores the theoretical basis for explaining such adverse effects in light of our contemporary understanding of mechanisms of lung injury and response at the cellular and molecular levels. The rapidly evolving understanding of the effects of air pollution on cellular and molecular levels presents an opportunity to develop and refine innovative biologically based hypotheses about the effects of childhood exposure. We hypothesize that children with low fruit and vegetable intake, low antioxidant levels, <b>high</b> <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake, or who have inherited certain alleles for genes involved in lung defenses and immune response regulation may be at increased risk for adverse effects. Because responses to air pollutants of interest are complex and involve a number of pathophysiologic processes, the magnitude of main effects of dietary factors, genes, and gene-environment interactions may be modest for individuals; however, each may make an important contribution to the population burden of preventable respiratory diseases.

This study was a randomized, cross-over, controlled feeding study with 3 phases of 25 d each aimed at determining whether baseline CRP concentrations modulate the serum lipid response to diets differing in fat type and quantity. Participants were adult men and women, age 19 – 65 y, with LDL-cholesterol concentrations of 3. 37 – 4. 66 mmol/L. All participants consumed 3 diets differing in the type of snack, either low or high in fat: low-fat (30. 8 % of energy), moderate in fat and saturated fat (37. 9 and 11. 4 % of energy, respectively), or moderate in fat and polyunsaturated fat (36. 3 and 9. 7 % of energy, respectively). Using baseline CRP as a continuous variable, CRP × diet interactions on change in serum lipoprotein_a (P = 0. 045) and HDL-cholesterol (P = 0. 06) were observed. When we used previously established categories to define CRP concentrations (low, 3 mg/L), we found a CRP × diet interaction on change in triglyceride concentrations (P = 0. 03) and trends for CRP × diet interaction on change in LDL (P = 0. 06) and total cholesterol (P = 0. 07). If replicated, these results suggest that considering baseline CRP concentrations when prescribing dietary interventions to lower lipid concentrations may be useful.

40|$|Pancreatic lipase is a {{lipolytic enzyme}} {{involved}} in the hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides for absorption and utilization. Both amount and type of dietary fat {{have been shown to}} regulate pancreatic lipase; however, the mediator(s) and mechanisms for this regulation have not been identified. These studies examined the effects of dietary fat ranging in polyunsaturated to saturated ratio (PIS ratio) from 0. 3 to 7. 9 at low fat (11 % of energy, LF) and moderate fat (40 % of energy, MF) levels, including both pre-absorptive and post-absorptive effects, on lipase content (activity), synthesis, mRNA levels and plasma ketones. Amount of fat independently increased lipase activity (p < 0. 0005), synthesis (p < 0. 004) and mRNA levels (p < 0. 0001). Type of fat, however, affected lipase activity, but not its relative synthesis and mRNA levels. Lipase activity was significantly increased in rats fed MF diets with a <b>high</b> <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> (90 % for corn oil; 172 % for safflower oil), but not significantly affected in rats fed a saturated fat (lard) or monounsaturated fat (olive oil). These results suggest that amount of fat regulates pancreatic lipase pre-translationally, whereas type of fat, specifically the degree of saturation, regulates pancreatic lipase post-translationally. Blockage of chylomicron transport out of the enterocyte with Pluronic L- 81 enabled evaluation of pre-absorptive, presumably hormonally mediated, and post-absorptive, presumably peripherally mediated effects of dietary fat. Pluronic L- 81 treatment decreased lipase activity 50 % (p < 0. 003) and mRNA levels 60 % (p < 0. 007) relative to control. However, Pluronic L- 81 interacted with amount and type of dietary fat resulting in a blunted effect in the MF safflower group (20 % lower activity and mRNA levels).

Objective: The objective was to examine whether vitamin E intake and serum a-tocopherol concentrations were prospectively associ-ated with exocrine pancreatic cancer. Design: We conducted a cohort analysis of prediagnostic vitamin E intake (4 tocopherols, 4 tocotrienols), serum a-tocopherol con-centrations, and pancreatic cancer in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study of male Finnish smokers aged 50 – 69 y at baseline. During follow-up from 1985 to 2004 (maximum: 19. 4 y; median: 16 y), 318 incident cases were diagnosed among cohort participants with complete serum samples (n 29, 092); 306 cases had complete dietary data (n 27, 111). Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, smoking history, his-tory of diabetes mellitus, and/or serum cholesterol were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % CIs. Results: Higher a-tocopherol concentrations were associated with lower pancreatic cancer risk (highest compared with lowest quintile, HR: 0. 52; 95 % CI: 0. 34, 0. 80; P for trend 0. 03; continuous HR: 0. 91; 95 % CI: 0. 84, 0. 99). Polyunsaturated fat, a putative prooxidant nutrient, modified the association such that the inverse a-tocopherol association was most pronounced in subjects with a <b>high</b> <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake (ie,. 9. 9 g/d; highest compared with lowest quintile, HR: 0. 38; 95 % CI: 0. 20, 0. 70; P for trend 0. 03; continuous HR: 0. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 75, 0. 97; P for interaction 0. 05 and 0. 02, respectively). No associations were observed for dietary tocopherols and tocotrienols. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that higher a-tocopherol concentrations may play a protective role in pancreatic carcinogenesis in male smokers.

Diets were fed for a further 8 weeks, rats were then killed, their colons fixed in formalin saline and stained with methylene blue to quantify ACF number. Fecal samples were collected and the fecal water was isolated for quantification of heme and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Increasing red meat density correlated positively, while increasing dairy protein density correlated negatively with rate of weight gain (p< 0. 05). Dietary intake was not significantly affected by protein type or density. The 32 % whey protein group had significantly less ACF in the proximal colon in comparison to the 16 and 32 % red meat groups (p< 0. 05).
