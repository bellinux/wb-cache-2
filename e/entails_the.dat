5|$|Fortune's novels all {{follow the}} same basic theme: a heroine — a priestess and initiatrix who is magically {{experienced}} and assertive — who meets a man and saves him from himself. In her later novels this <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.|$|E
5|$|While {{induction}} <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> transient {{activation of}} CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) {{is characterized by}} their persistent activation. During this stage, PKMz (Protein kinase Mζ) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, {{they are able to}} carry out the phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Score Entertainment {{published}} the Case Closed Trading Card Game on June 29, 2005. The game <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> use of three customized decks of cards, which players buy and collect. Representing characters, events, and objects in Case Closed, these cards {{are used by}} players to fulfill certain conditions to solve a case and win the game. Certain cards are used to foil {{the progress of the}} player's opponents. An English unofficial guidebook to the series titled The Case Closed Casebook: An Essential Guide was published by DH Publishing Inc. on March 25, 2008.|$|E

Conversely, the second sentence doesn't <b>entail</b> <b>the</b> first. The sentence exactly three students ran fast can be true, even though {{the number of students who}} merely ran (i.e. not so fast) is greater than 3.|$|R

5|$|Manchester has {{the largest}} UK office market outside London {{according}} to GVA Grimley with a quarterly office uptake (averaged over 2010–14) of approximately 250,000 square ft – equivalent to the quarterly office uptake of Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle combined and 90,000 square feet more than the nearest rival Birmingham. The strong office market in Manchester has been partly attributed to 'Northshoring', (from offshoring) which <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> relocation or alternative creation of jobs away from the overheated South to areas where office space is possibly cheaper and workforce market {{may not be as}} saturated.|$|E
5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it <b>entails.</b> <b>The</b> ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E

5|$|The 767-200 ceased {{production}} in the late 1980s, superseded by the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and Israel Aerospace Industries has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> installation of a side cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned {{as a replacement for}} Douglas DC-8 freighters.|$|E
5|$|Underwater diver {{training}} is normally {{given by a}} qualified instructor {{who is a member}} of one of many diver training agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. Diving hand signals are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.|$|E
5|$|Croatia and Hungary {{have agreed}} to the Cultural Cooperation Programme, which defines {{cooperation}} and cultural exchange {{in the fields of}} music, theatre and dance, and with respect to the arts, museums, galleries, literature, publishing, libraries, archives, film and cultural-heritage protection. The programme was agreed to on 7 November 2011 in Budapest by secretaries of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and the Hungarian Ministry of National Resources. The programme pertains to the 20122014 period and represents a continuation of cultural cooperation through cultural exchange, outside the framework of formal agreements. Cultural, educational and scientific cooperation between the two countries is covered by a treaty of 16 March 1994, with additional treaties regulating diploma recognitions since 16 June 1997 and additional treaties and protocols on scientific and technological cooperation signed in 2002 and 2009. The scientific and educational cooperation <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> awarding of scholarships and bilateral research projects.|$|E

5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one <b>entails.</b> <b>The</b> three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{stations}} {{are set up}} in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling {{stations are}} open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
