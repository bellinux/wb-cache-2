60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the side}} of my bed, {{actually}} quivering with excitement.|$|E
60|$|We {{took our}} bags into the Custom House and opened them, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> mine, and {{immediately}} went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the foot}} of the couch near to the font-like basin of water, and She sank down softly on to the other end.|$|E
60|$|I couldn't help it. I {{was tired}} and warm and so disappointed. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> right <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the rustic seat behind me and burst into tears, as the story-books say.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the wayside, {{where she}} took a place beside me, and I told her all that matter much as I have written it, my {{thoughts}} about her father's dealing being alone omitted.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> limply <b>on</b> a {{ledge and}} tried to look matters fairly in the face. I could not swim; calls for help could not reach anybody; my only hope lay in the chance of {{somebody}} passing down the shore or of some boat appearing.|$|R
60|$|The kind frank way {{in which}} this was said quite won my heart, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the old cask, and told the sailor all my sorrows.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chair, and Mr. Stillwell {{began to}} look over his letters. I {{wondered}} what would happen next, but I was not quite prepared for what did happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{she said}} and dropped into a chair against the light, looking away from me across the wide green space of {{afternoon}} sunshine. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a little sofa, at a loss also.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{rose from}} his office chair, and I got up, too. My head swam, {{there was no doubt}} about it, and I felt a certain {{heaviness}} of limbs as if they had grown bigger since <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> that chair. <b>I</b> made my bow.|$|R
6000|$|So flattered, by {{the best}} of flatterers, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to write <b>on</b> my theme; and that evening, at firelight time, I read to my little senate as follows:-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> the grass, and plucked, one by one, {{the weeds}} from her grave; the tears trickled more slowly down my cheeks, and {{ceased to be}} bitter. It was a comfort {{to think that she}} had died before sorrow and poverty came upon her child, and that all his great {{expectations}} were blasted.|$|R
60|$|A rabbit came {{bounding}} {{across the}} hill {{between us and}} the house. I threw down my suit-case and pursued it hotfoot. After I had run twenty yards and seen it disappear, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the grass and wept disconsolately.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the rocks}} to take, not a sketch,--for who can sketch a {{mountain}} torrent?--but to note {{down on paper}} a kind of diagram, from which afterwards I might reconstruct an image of this feathery, frisky son of Kuhleborn.|$|E
60|$|It was {{of small}} use {{to follow him}} further, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{prostrate}} yellow birch to rest and listen awhile in the vast silence, and to watch anything that might be passing through the cold white woods.|$|E
6000|$|And in {{five minutes}} more she shut it up. I was glad of this. [...] "Now," [...] thought I, [...] "I can perhaps get her to talk." [...] <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> by her <b>on</b> the floor.|$|R
60|$|Thinking thus, desolation {{took hold}} of me and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a rock and covered my face with my hands that I might not see the tears, which I knew were {{gathering}} in my eyes, as they fell from them. Yes, there {{in the midst of}} that awful solitude, I, Hubert of Hastings, whose soul it filled, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> like a lost child and wept.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{beside him}} <b>on</b> a sack, {{and for some}} time we did not speak, taking each other in. One of his legs was lame, so {{that he had to}} keep it {{stretched}} out all the time; and awfully tired he looked, grey-tired.|$|R
60|$|His manner {{surprised}} me; {{he did not}} {{now seem}} like the Marcos Marcó I had travelled with that day. Touched with his words, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the stocks facing him, and begged him {{to tell me what}} I could do for him.|$|E
60|$|That was interesting; so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a rock to watch. Whenever I took my {{eyes from}} him a moment, it was {{difficult}} to find him again, so perfectly did his plumage blend with the white ice upon which he stood motionless.|$|E
60|$|He muttered {{through his}} teeth, “Mal. Je ne dors plus.” He moved off {{to stand at}} the window {{with his back to the}} room. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a sofa that was there and put my feet up, and silence took {{possession}} of the room.|$|E
6000|$|I glanced {{about for}} a seat, {{and was going to}} take that in which Mrs. Alderling used to pose for him, but he called out with sudden sharpness, [...] "Not that!" [...] and without {{appearing}} to notice, I found a box which <b>I</b> inverted, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{frequently}} {{tried to}} persuade myself that the contents of my essay could not be true; but the more I reflected on the authorities on which they were founded, the more I gave them credit. Coming in sight of Wade's Mill, in Hertfordshire, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> disconsolate <b>on</b> the turf by the roadside, and held my horse. Here a thought came into my mind, that if {{the contents of the}} essay were true, it was time that somebody should see these calamities to an end." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Stagger Lee" [...] is Garcia and Hunter's {{interpretation}} of the oft-covered and diversely-arranged standard, [...] "Stack O' Lee Blues". Garcia and Hunter also brought the ballad [...] "If I Had the World to Give," [...] an atypical work in their oeuvre. According to Hunter, [...] "Jerry and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and <b>on</b> a lark decided to write a romantic song, just for the heck of it. We were feeling sensitive because someone said 'Oh you write songs about guys for guys.' Something that would sound good in an old '50s cocktail loungethat was the idea." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the sofa}} beside her, {{and told her}} all, without one word of excuse or concealment, from our last parting to the day of Césarine's death in Haiti: and she held my hand and listened all the while with breathless wonderment to my strange story.|$|E
60|$|Tears were in Maud’s eyes, and I {{do believe}} they were for me. I could have wept myself. Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost? He had done his work well. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and left me and I entered the house where I found my mother sitting, still in her festal robes, like one who waits. She looked at my face, then asked what troubled me. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a stool at her feet and told her everything.|$|E
6000|$|Saying which, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again. (How Mr. Coombes {{came to be}} in my chair, {{instead of}} at {{the other side of the}} room, where he had been all the evening; and why he never offered to apologise when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> right <b>down</b> <b>on</b> top of him; and why young Biffles should have tried to palm himself off upon me as my Uncle John, and induced me, under that {{erroneous}} impression, to shake him by the hand for nearly three minutes, and tell him that I had always regarded him as father,--are matters that, to this day, I have never been able to fully understand.) ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{a couple}} of hours afterwards, just as the sun was sinking, who should walk up to my wagons but Saduko himself, {{accompanied}} by a woman whom I recognised at once as his wife, the Princess Nandie, who carried a fine baby boy in her arms. Rising, I saluted Nandie and offered her my camp-stool, which she looked at suspiciously and declined, preferring to seat herself on the ground after the native fashion. So I took it back again, and after <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> it, not before, stretched out my hand to Saduko, who by this time was quite humble and polite.|$|R
6000|$|... "With a rusty dagger-fragment in one hand, {{and a bit}} of a wine-jar in another, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> me <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ruinous green sofa I {{have spoken}} of, and bethought me long and deeply of these same Buccaneers. Could it be possible, that they robbed and murdered one day, reveled the next, and rested {{themselves}} by turning meditative philosophers, rural poets, and seat-builders on the third? Not very improbable, after all. For consider the vacillations of a man. Still, strange as it may seem, I must also abide by the more charitable thought; namely, that among these adventurers were some gentlemanly, companionable souls, capable of genuine tranquillity and virtue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't done {{anything}} with it. Nadel {{thought he would}} take hold of it at one time, but he dropped it again. After all, I don't suppose it could be popularized. Fulkerson wanted to offer it as a premium to subscribers for 'Every Other Week,' but <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the stool}} and opened my note-book. I headed the page: [...] "Sunrise in July: {{observations}} and emotions," [...] and I wrote down at once, lest I should forget it, that towards three o'clock a faint light is discernible, {{and added that}} this light gets stronger as the time goes on.|$|E
6000|$|He left us. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> one of {{the chairs}} in the hall, and did my best to compose myself. Benjamin walked to and fro, deep in thought. [...] "Both of them fond of him," [...] I heard my old friend say to himself. [...] "Half monkey, half man--and both of them fond of him. That beats me." ...|$|E
60|$|Nine o'clock! {{and nothing}} done yet to {{facilitate}} our escaping from Crickgelly to {{the regions of}} civilized life the next morning. I was pleased to hear, when I knocked at the door, that Alicia's voice sounded firmer as {{she told me to}} come in. She was more confused than astonished or frightened when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> by her <b>on</b> the sofa, and repeated the principal topics of my conversion with Mrs. Baggs.|$|R
60|$|Grace {{received}} {{me with an}} angelic smile; but, I almost gasped {{for breath}} as I noticed the prodigious change that had come over her in so brief a space. She now {{looked more like a}} being of another world than ever; and this, too, immediately after coming from the refreshment of a night's rest. I kissed her forehead, which had an unnatural chill on it, I thought; and I felt the feeble pressure of an arm that was thrown affectionately round my neck. <b>I</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the transom, still holding my sister's hand. Grace looked anxiously at me for half a minute, ere she spoke, as if to ascertain how far I was conscious of her situation.|$|R
60|$|As for me, I strolled off quietly, sketch-book in hand, up to {{the broken}} brink of the great crater. I had nothing in {{particular}} to do that morning, having in fact by this time quite exhausted the first ledge or Floor of the Strangers: and I could accomplish no work, now I had finished there, till Frank returned from town with the rope to lower us down to the Floor of the Hawaiians, the next ledge that I thought of mapping. So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a jagged peak of hardened cinders, cemented together by molten volcanic matter, and began in a lazy, idle, half-sleepy kind of way to sketch a distant point of the interior crater.|$|R
