500|$|Generally, {{critics and}} fans were {{disappointed}} Mr. Eko was killed after {{being on the}} show for only one season. Kristin Dos Santos of E! called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. In response to Mr. Eko's death, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "I'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje—his acting was up there with Terry O'Quinn's, Elizabeth Mitchell's, and Michael Emerson's. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the sacrifice the island demanded". Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that his death [...] "sucked hard, and loud, and long". IGN listed Eko's death as number one on its list of [...] "Top 10 Lost Deaths".|$|E
500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By that <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> some cheese-paring clerk {{or other}} of the King's Ships, so I gave him the price. I forget it now, but it worked out to thirty pounds--carved, gilt, and fitted in place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut, tut, Reddy! Tut, tut!" [...] {{retorted}} Granny. [...] "Be fair-minded. We stole that dinner from Bowser the Hound, and Old Man Coyote {{stole it}} from us. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{no worse than}} we are, {{when you come to}} think it over. Now is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. He {{spent several}} days here before you came. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> an old, retired, and very rich silk {{manufacturer}} from Lyons, they say, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{alone in the}} world, for he always looks sad and dreamy, and doesn't talk with anybody. His name is Theophile Magnan.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Said Zev Buffman, a Broadway {{producer}} and financier for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, [...] "When Andy {{was at the}} theater, he was a joy. But he wasn't there enough," [...] adding that of the five people to play Joseph up to that point, Gibb was the best actor. He also said after Gibb's death, [...] "We'd lose him over long weekends. He'd come back on Tuesday, and he'd look beat. He was like a little puppy – so ashamed when he did something wrong. He was all heart, but he didn't have enough muscle to carry through." [...] An unnamed co-star in Dreamcoat was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{he spent most of}} his time in his hotel room in front of the TV. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> frightened and insecure. That's what happens when you're the baby brother of the Bee Gees." [...] Commenting after Gibb's death, Solid Gold producer Brad Lachman stated, [...] "... was a very charming, vulnerable and charismatic performer. He clearly meant well. He wasn't being difficult. He was going through problems he couldn't deal with. He wanted everyone to love him. He had so much going for him, and he just couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> all right," [...] put in {{the office}} boy, with the freedom that seemed natural to him. [...] "Only <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{dependent}} on his uncle for money. Maybe if it wasn't for that, he would have pitched into his uncle more than he did. But say! You said something was stolen. What was it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pretty badly rattled." [...] Jeff stopped {{himself in}} the vague laugh of one who remembers {{something}} ludicrous, and turned his face away.|$|E
6000|$|He {{thought he}} saw a gleam of {{comprehension}} in the girl's eyes, and made a gesture of protest. [...] "No," [...] he assured her, [...] "I'm not fit to brush her little shoes. For that matter, though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> my comrade, Nasmyth isn't either. What is perhaps more to the purpose, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> quite aware of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dogged if I {{know what}} to make of it," [...] sighed Fulkerson, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> having a talk with Conrad that's soured on him. I reckon maybe he came back expecting to find that boy {{reconciled}} to the glory of this world, and Conrad's showed himself just as set against it as ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed," [...] said she. [...] "I {{heard that}} you were {{with him at the}} end, and I caught stray words from her ladyship of what had passed. Lord Rotherby had the {{information}} from the tipstaff who went to arrest Sir Richard Everard. <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> your--your foster-father, as you called him; and I came to tell you how deeply I sorrow for you in your sorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know we hit him, {{but that}} isn't {{saying he is}} killed," [...] said Shep. [...] "Although {{by the way he}} rolled over <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pretty badly wounded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do love to play--I mean--I like to drum on the piano, but I haven't had {{any real}} training. Mr. Judique {{used to say}} I would 've been a good pianist if I'd had any training, but then, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just {{flattering}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't blame you, Mrs. Roberts," [...] he said. [...] "I know it wasn't your doing. But {{your husband}} wasn't just himself, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> fightin' mad on general principles, {{and it was}} just my luck to get in the way, that was all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bostil, I've a grand hoss," [...] replied Burthwait. [...] "He's {{four years}} old, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> fer <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born wild, an' you never seen him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "he's sure a daisy, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> can <b>be</b> taught, and {{the first}} thing is to let him see you're not afraid of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laziness, I guess,--too much work," [...] said old Cap'n Billy. [...] "What <b>he</b> wants <b>is</b> a {{wife with}} money. There ain't a better doctor anywhere. I've heard 't up to Boston, {{where he got}} his manifest, they thought {{everything}} of him. He's smart enough, but he's lazy, and <b>he</b> always <b>was</b> lazy, and harder'n a nut. He's a curious mixtur'. 'N' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> {{on the lookout for}} somethin' of this kind ever sence he begun practising among the summer boarders. <b>Guess</b> <b>he's</b> had an eye out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, Sam, I think he looked a bit strange in his eyes. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> all right. I'd not worry too much if I was you. He'll be back before long. Maybe Doctor Havens was out {{and he had to}} wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Then I expect I'll have {{to resign}} me club," [...] Lundie goes on. [...] "I don't think that's ever {{been done before}} by an ex-officio member. I must ask the secretary." [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> kinder bunkered for the minute, or maybe 'twas the lordship comin' out on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was very}} much {{surprised}} at your determination to give up Brill, and join Dick. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> afraid Dick would have to shoulder the business alone. And by the way, Tom," [...] went on the youngest Rover, earnestly, [...] "somehow it doesn't seem just right to me that I should put all this work off on you and Dick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Attorney Finney {{has been}} there this morning," [...] {{continued}} Bunce, [...] "and by his looks <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not so well pleased as <b>he</b> once <b>was,</b> and it has got abroad somehow that the archdeacon has had down great news from London, and Handy and Moody are both as black as devils. And I hope," [...] said the man, trying to assume a cheery tone, [...] "that things are looking up, and that there'll be an end soon to all this stuff which bothers your reverence so sorely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> not <b>been</b> {{much of a}} one {{for writing}} to his friends. He's had a bad time lately. You have to pay some time or other. We bring them on ourselves—silly devils as we are.—I beg your pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] and I {{produced}} writing {{materials with}} alacrity; for <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do. He sat down, wrote a few lines, folded, sealed, and addressed a letter, {{and held it}} out to me.|$|R
60|$|Rectus had {{to agree}} to all Mr. Chipperton said--or, at least, he couldn't differ with him,--for he didn't know {{anything}} on earth about the matter, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> glad enough when he got through. I'm sure I was. Rectus didn't say anything except {{that he was very}} sorry that the Chipperton family had to go home, and then he walked off to his room.|$|E
6000|$|... "To Chicago, I think. He {{talked to}} himself a good deal. Said {{something}} about Chicago and St. Paul and Seattle. I {{asked him if}} he was on business {{and he said he was}} going to pick up nuggets of gold. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> poking fun at me," [...] went on the boy, sheepishly. [...] "But he paid me two dollars for driving him over," [...] he added, with satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume {{you knew}} Mr. Landa was dead," [...] she added, and at Clementina's look of astonishment, {{she said with}} a natural satisfaction, [...] "Mm! died the thutteenth day of August. I presumed somehow you'd know it, though you didn't see a great deal of 'em, come to think of it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a good man; too good for her, I guess," [...] she concluded, in the New England {{necessity}} of blaming some one. [...] "She sent us the papah." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he stammered, [...] "no! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> not. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> well.... <b>I</b> wish...." [...] He stopped; {{her white}} face seemed to flash scorn, despair, and entreaty on him all at once. And turning, {{she left him}} {{standing}} there.|$|R
6000|$|... "By gum!" [...] {{said the}} General, laughing. [...] "Don't wonder you're surprised. Grant has stuff in him. They kicked him around Springfield awhile, {{after the war}} broke out, for a {{military}} carpet-bagger. Then they gave him for a regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on. He fixed 'em. He made 'em walk the plank. He made 'em march halfway across the state instead of taking the cars the Governor offered. Belmont! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont. Then his boys broke loose when they got into the town. That wasn't Grant's fault. The Rebs came back and chased 'em out into their boats on the river. Brinsmade, you remember hearing about that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nell, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you punished {{the fellow}} enough. Maybe he's only a {{conceited}} softy. But I don't like {{that sort of}} thing. It isn't Western. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> won't <b>be</b> so smart next time. Any fellow would remember being hit by Blanco Jose. If you'd been up on Diablo we'd have to bury Mr. Chase." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cornelia scorned {{this poor}} attempt of her mother. [...] "If I can't succeed as men succeed, {{and be a}} great painter, {{and not just a}} great woman painter, I'd rather be excused altogether. Even Rosa Bonheur: I don't believe her horses would have been {{considered}} so wonderful if a man had done them. I guess that's what Mr. Ludlow meant, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. I guess if a girl wants to turn out an artist she'd better start by being a boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lapham {{started the}} mare up and drove swiftly homeward. At last his wife stopped crying and {{began trying to}} find her pocket. [...] "Here, take mine, Persis," [...] he said kindly, {{offering}} her his handkerchief, and she took it and dried her eyes with it. [...] "There {{was one of those}} fellows there the other night," [...] he spoke again, when his wife leaned back against the cushions in peaceful despair, [...] "that I liked the looks of about as well as any man I ever saw. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a pretty good man. It was that Mr. Sewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw him slide an Episcopalian Prayer-book up his sleeve, {{and when}} I {{looked over the}} edge of the {{stretcher}} there was half-a-dozen enlisted men --privates--had just quit digging and was standing to attention by their spades. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right on the General not expecting me to dinner; but it was all of a piece with their sloppy British way of doing business. Any God's quantity of fuss and flubdub to bury a man, and not an ounce of forehandedness in the whole outfit to find out whether he was rightly dead. And I am a Congregationalist anyway! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He used to {{complain}} of me for lettin' Arty get {{out into the}} stable among the horses; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> won't <b>be</b> troubled that way much more," [...] said the mother; and then something in Miss Northwick's face seemed to stay her in her wild talk; and she asked, [...] "Want I should call him for you?" ...|$|R
40|$|We {{need more}} than a {{humanitarian}} response […] We need political leadership and action,’ Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said on 8 March 2016. Referring {{to the fact that}} ‘Europe is now seeing record numbers of refugees, and migrants, arriving on its shores’, Grandi stressed that ‘this emergency {{does not have to be}} a crisis, it can be managed’. Grandi, who was speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, did not mention to what extent, in recent years, the militarisation of migration and border controls has been explicitly bound with notions of humanitarianism. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> aware that the current focus on both the humanitarian and security-related aspects of the phenomenon suggests a more complex logic of threat and benevolence that allows for a security-humanitarian response...|$|R
6000|$|... "He may, because, after I {{discovered}} that the box was gone, I questioned him pretty closely as to {{who had been in}} the offices. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> knows something <b>is</b> wrong." ...|$|R
