40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} with simultaneous {{flame ionisation}} and electroantennographic detection (GCEAD) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis (GCMS) of abdominal extracts of adult male Dermestes haemorrhoidalis Kuster (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) revealed {{the presence of}} electrophysiologically and behaviourally active compounds to its conspecific males and females. Isopropyl dodecanoate (3), isopropyl (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoate (5), isopropyl tetradecanoate (6), isopropyl (Z) - 9 -hexadecenoate (7) and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>hexadecanoate</b> (8) were detected in male abdominal extracts only. Analysis of collected male headspace volatiles revealed the presence of six EAD-active compounds (3), (5), (6) and isopropyl tridecanoate (4) plus two unidentified compounds (1) and (9). Synthetic compounds (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) showed EAD activity with antennae of both sexes in contrast to synthetic (8) which showed EAD activity with female antennae only. Male and female antennae of D. haemorrhoidalis reacted with high receptor potentials to isopropyl (Z) - 9 -dodecenoate (2), although this compound itself was detected in neither male nor female abdominal extracts or headspace volatiles. Petri dish bioassays indicated that male abdominal extracts and compounds (2), (3), (5) and (6) aroused and attracted conspecific male and female beetles significantly (...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the nine compounds identified in the interdigital secretion of the bontebok, Damaliscus dorcas dorcas, in a previous study, 76 compounds belonging to different compound types, were identified in the interdigital secretions of the bontebok and the blesbok, D. d. phillipsi. These compounds include alkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, terpenoids, γ-lactones, an isopropyl ester, long-chain hydroxyesters, 2 - substituted pyridines, phenols, steroids, and dimethylsulfone. No qualitative {{differences were found between}} secretions from the two sexes or from animals from different habitats. Although no attempt was made to correlate territorial behavior or other behavioral phenomena with the qualitative composition of interdigital secretions from individual animals, available information seems to indicate that quantitative differences probably do not have a major semiochemical function. Only two species of bacteria, Bacillus brevis and Planococcus citreus, were found in the interdigital pouches of male and female members of the two subspecies, regardless of the habitat of the animals. B. brevis synthesized, among other unidentified constituents, (Z) - 3 -penten- 2 -ol, 2 -hexanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, tetradecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, heptadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, (Z) - 9 -hexadecenoic acid, and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>hexadecanoate</b> in vitro, while P. citreus produced, among others, the γ-lactones dodecan- 4 -olide and (Z) - 6 -dodecen- 4 -olide, {{which is one of the}} major constituents of the interdigital secretions of both subspecies. Some components of the interdigital secretions are not present in the interdigital glandular tissue, and the possibility is discussed that these compounds could be produced by microbiological activity in the interdigital pouch.

40|$|Abstract: A none fermenting {{suspension}} of Baker's yeast in petrol containing {{a small amount}} of water reduces a variety of fl-keto esters to the corresponding opttcally active fl-hydroxy esters. Homochiral 13 -hydroxy esters are valuable starting materials for the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of chiral products. 1 Optically active 13 -hydroxy esters are usually prepared by the asymmetric reduction of 13 -keto esters using either a synthetic chiral reducing agent 2 (or chiral catalyst with achiral reducing agent), or by using an oxido-reductase enzyme, often as intact yeast cells. 3 The latter process is particularly attractive in terms of cost, however the traditional way of carrying out yeast reductions uses a fermenting solution of the yeast in an aqueous solvent system 3 This can cause synthetic problems, particularly with large scale reactions due to the relatively large quantities of solvent required, the hydrophobie nature of some J 3 -keto esters, and the hydrophilic nature of many 13 -hydroxy esters. Recently however, Smallridge et al. reported that a none fermenting {{suspension of}} Baker's yeast in an organic solvent (optimally petrol) was capable of reducing ethyl acetoacetate 1, giving ethyl 3 -hydroxybutanoate with similar enantiomeric excess and yield to those obtained using fermenting Baker's yeast. 4 Additionally, Seebach et al. have reported the use of a mixture of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>hexadecanoate</b> and soybean phospholipids as the reaction medium for the reduction of 13 -keto-esters using Baker's yeast. 5 In this paper, we report the reduction of a variety of 13 -keto esters by Baker's yeast in petrol, and show that in some cases the results contrast with those obtained in aqueous solution...|$|E
