An empirical {{study was conducted}} using monthly data on inbound tourism, total <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products for the period between 2000 and 2012, in Portugal. The results reveal that inbound tourism and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products are cointegrated. Therefore a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables can be inferred. The Granger causality test results suggest that inbound tourism in Portugal stimulates growth <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> in general. Furthermore, <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> agro-food products also stimulate inbound tourism. Our empirical findings provide important policy implications concerning international tourism and trade. inbound tourism; exports; agro-food products; cointegration; Granger causality; Portugal; international tourism; trade...|$|R

Following the Engle-Granger approach to cointegration, long-term equilibrium as well as short-term correlation between the observed variables was identified. <b>Exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services and gross domestic product (GDP) in Croatia move together. If the two observed variables move away from equilibrium, they will return to their long-term equilibrium state at a velocity of 24. 46 % in the subsequent period.

2500|$|Sidon is {{the third}} largest city in Lebanon and {{the capital of the}} South Governorate. It lies on the Mediterranean sea, 40km north of Tyre and 40km south of the capital Beirut. Sidon has been {{inhabited}} since very early in prehistory. It {{was one of the most}} important Phoenician cities and may also have been the oldest. From here, and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonizing party went to found the city of Tyre. Like other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors. At the end of the Persian era in 351 BC, it was invaded by the emperor Artaxerxes III and then by Alexander the Great in 333 BC when the Hellenistic era of Sidon began. Under the successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organized games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. The historical core of Sidon is a Mamluk-era old city that extends between the Sea Castle and the St. Louis Castle. Located on a promontory jutting into the sea, this walled medieval city is very well preserved and is still inhabited today. The old City resembles a vaulted maze with narrow alleyways and winding streets. Arched pathways connect the different neighborhoods of the city. On street level, numerous souvenir shops and mini-markets can be found with old-fashioned bakeries making crunchy whole wheat bread, called [...] "Kaak". A lot of the alleys take the name of their residents' occupations like the [...] "Carpenters' Alley" [...] and the [...] "Tailors' Alley". Several mosques dating back to the Umayyad Era are still preserved and are open to the public. Sidon's Old City is home to many ancient churches and old stone mosques that were built above pagan temples. Sidon was used as the official port of trade by Damascus and Mount Lebanon for the import and <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> with Egypt and Europe. Sidon's mercantile community was portrayed in its infrastructure: a large number of caravanserais, the biggest of which is [...] "Khan El Franj", old harbors with multiple quays, and the Sidon Sea Castle, a fort that guards the port.|$|E
2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E
