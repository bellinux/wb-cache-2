Freeman sparked controversy in 2011 when, on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, he accused the Tea Party movement of racism.|$|E
2500|$|Ōfuna had a {{reputation}} for intimidation and for torturing their inmates in an attempt to get military information, and was nicknamed the [...] "Torture Farm" [...] by its inmates. As the prisoners sent to Ōfuna were primarily officers, who might have inside knowledge of Allied Strategy, or others working in critical areas such as communications and submarines, it was the goal of the Japanese to extract as much information as possible in a short time. The names of the prisoners held at Ōfuna was not divulged to the Red Cross, and the camp was so secret that even local inhabitants were not aware of its existence. As relayed to a submarine prisoner: [...] "You have survived the sinking of a submarine. No one survives the sinking of a submarine. No one knows you're alive. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> questions. This man and this man are going to shoot you if you don't answer the questions, and no one will know you were alive." [...] In some cases, the inmates were told by their captors that they were regarded as war criminals, since 90 percent of the crews of the merchant vessels sunk by American submarines were civilians, and that as war criminals, they would be given only half the rations as normal prisoners of war.|$|E

40|$|Powerpoint: [URL] {{blending}} and {{the indirect}} framing of directive constructions Speakers resort to pseudo-directive constructions {{when attempting to}} get someone to do something without giving the impression of restricting the addressee's freedom of choice of action or without impinging upon the addressee's self-assessment that s/he has that freedom of choice. One efficient (i. e. face-saving) strategy consists in blending a covert coding of the speaker's authority and an overt coding of the addressee's freedom of non-compliance into the same construction. This is generally done compressively, both at the formal and conceptual levels. In XXXX (2005), we showed that the you (don't) want to/ wanna X construction (e. g. {{you want to make}} a left turn, you don't wanna miss that) displayed the main properties of a grammatical blend (Fauconnier and Turner 1996), among which the dual inheritance principle and, above all, compression (morphosyntactic and conceptual). In this case, grammatical blending successfully frames the directive as collaborative work (the speaker appears as willing to help the addressee) and thus mitigates the inherent coerciveness of the act. In this paper I will show that grammatical blending may serve the same function in expansive (pseudo-) directive strategies: (1) A- I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> leave. B- You're kicking me out? A- No, I'm not saying that. B- Ok, then I can stay? ( [...] .) A- I'm <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> leave. B- Are you kicking me out? A- No. (2) I told you again not to take any photographs. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay behind. (3) I'm afraid I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> check with the Defense Department. (4) Mister, you can say anything you want about me, but I'm gonna have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> talk about my horse that way. In this construction (I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> X) the driving force of the illocutionary intent (Speaker wants Addressee to X > structural type: 'Speaker <b>asks</b> Addressee <b>to</b> X') is disguised as something impending (<b>going</b> <b>to)</b> and extrinsic from the speaker's own will (have to). The compositional combination of directive strategies is blended into a composite construction. However, despite its internal complexity, the expanded construction assumes some morphosyntactic and prosodic unity, insofar as each of its formal components displays a high degree of collostruction strength to the composite structure (Stefanowitsch and Gries 2003, 2005). This paper will show that compression - a defining property of conceptual integration (Fauconnier and Turner 2000) - does not (always) correspond in a one-to-one fashion with morphosyntactic chunking in a grammatical blend. This observation will be corroborated by empirical research on innovative directive strategies in Japanese (Smith 1992, Sunaoshi 1995, Takano 2005). Those case studies, combined with a critical examination of recent works on the topic (Fauconnier and Turner 2002, Mandelblit 2000, etc.), will form the basis for a renewed (and expanded) definition of grammatical blending. Finally, these newly defined constructional integration networks will be described in light of the Fuzzy Construction Grammar framework (Desagulier 2005). REFERENCES Blum-Kulka, S. 1989.
