5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E

40|$|Emotion Induced Blindness (EIB) {{refers to}} the <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> the {{identification}} of a neutral target image that follows a threatening or fearful distractor image. It {{has been suggested that}} valence plays a significant role in driving the perceptual <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> EIB. Recent findings from the literature suggest that arousal has a very important role in biasing early cognitive functions. Hence, in the present study, we systematically investigate the role of valence (Experiment 1) and arousal (Experiment 2) <b>in</b> determining the <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> EIB. The results suggest that when valence is controlled for, the stimuli with higher arousal level lead to greater <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> target detection. Moreover, under high arousal condition, both positive and negative stimuli lead to significantly greater <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> target detection. Present study suggests that <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> EIB is sensitive to the arousal component of the emotional image as compared to valence. The arousal biased competition account that explains the effect of arousal on cognitive processing can sufficiently explains the current results...|$|R
5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> the motor control of speech production. The speech {{of a child with}} developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E

5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E
40|$|Objective and methods: We {{compared}} the health burden of eating-disordered behavior {{with that of}} overweight in a community-based sample of women aged 18 - 42 years residing in the Australian Capital Territory region of Australia. Participants (n= 4643) completed self-report measures of eating disorder psychopathology, health-related {{quality of life and}} health service utilization. Body mass index (BMI) was derived from self-reported height and weight. Results: Overweight was associated with marked <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> physical health functioning and comparatively little <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> psychosocial functioning, whereas eating-disordered behavior was associated with marked <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> psychosocial functioning and comparatively little <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> physical health functioning. Further, (1) <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> psychosocial functioning associated with eating-disordered behavior was greater than <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> physical health functioning associated with overweight, and (2) <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> physical health functioning associated with eating-disordered behavior was greater than <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> psychosocial functioning associated with overweight. Overweight and eating-disordered behavior were associated with similarly elevated rates of primary care consultations during the past 6 months and of lifetime treatment from a health professional for an eating or weight problem. Conclusions: In young adult women, the health burden of eating-disordered behavior may be more substantial than previously recognized. Better information concerning the spectrum of disordered eating that exists at the population level needs to be made available. Eating-disordered behavior warrants greater attention when considering the public health burden of obesity and in developing programs to reduce this burden. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is now {{classified}} as an autoimmune astrocytopathic disease targeting aquaporin 4 (AQP 4).

Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Studies {{of quality}} of life among {{individuals}} with eating disorders have relied almost exclusively on clinical samples. We examined <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> {{quality of life in}} a community sample of women with eating disorders recruited as part of an epidemiological study. Methods: Measures of health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 12 -item Short-Form Physical and Mental Component Summary scales) and subjective well-being (WHOQOL-BREF Psychological Functioning and Social Relationships subscales) were completed by women with eating disorders (n = 159), primarily variants of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, and a comparison group of healthy women (n = 232). Results: When compared with healthy women, women with eating disorders reported substantial <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> aspects {{of quality of}} life relating to mental health, although item-level analysis indicated considerable variation in the extent to which specific aspects of emotional well-being were affected. <b>Impairment</b> <b>in</b> social relationship and in physical health was less pronounced and due, at least in part, to between-group differences in age, body weight and demographic characteristics. <b>Impairment</b> <b>in</b> certain aspects of perceived physical health was, however, apparent among women with eating disorders, even after controlling for between-group differences in body weight. Conclusions: Community cases of women with eating disorders experience marked <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> quality of life as this relates to mental health functioning and at least some <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> physical health functioning. Personality characteristics and ego-syntonic aspects of eating-disordered behaviour may complicate the interpretation of findings relating to <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> specific aspects of quality of life. 8 page(s...|$|R
