Cyclical unemployment is due to variation in the economic cycle and is responsive to stimulus measures, while structural unemployment is unrelated to the economic cycle and is unresponsive to stimulus measures. For example, a general reduction in employment across multiple industries would likely be cyclical, while a skills or <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> for available jobs would be structural issue.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We {{evaluate}} {{the contribution of}} (18) F-choline PET/CT in the delineation of gross tumour volume (GTV) in local recurrent prostate cancer after initial irradiation using various PET image segmentation techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with local-only recurrent prostate cancer (median= 5. 7 years) after initial irradiation {{were included in the}} study. Rebiopsies were performed in 10 patients that confirmed the local recurrence. Following injection of 300 MBq of (18) F-fluorocholine, dynamic PET frames (3 min each) were reconstructed from the list-mode acquisition. Five PET image segmentation techniques were used to delineate the (18) F-choline-based GTVs. These included manual delineation of contours (GTV(man)) by two teams consisting of a radiation oncologist and a nuclear medicine physician each, a fixed threshold of 40 % and 50 % of the maximum signal intensity (GTV(40 %) and GTV(50 %)), signal-to-background ratio-based adaptive thresholding (GTV(SBR)), and a region growing (GTV(RG)) algorithm. <b>Geographic</b> <b>mismatches</b> between the GTVs were also assessed using overlap analysis. RESULTS: Inter-observer variability for manual delineation of GTVs was high but not statistically significant (p= 0. 459). In addition, the volumes and shapes of GTVs delineated using semi-automated techniques were significantly higher than those of GTVs defined manually. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-automated segmentation techniques for (18) F-choline PET-guided GTV delineation resulted in substantially higher GTVs compared to manual delineation and might replace the latter for determination of recurrent prostate cancer for partial prostate re-irradiation. The selection of the most appropriate segmentation algorithm still needs to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} 18 F-FDG PET/CT on target volume delineation in gynaecological cancer. Methods F-FDG PET/CT based RT treatment planning was performed in 10 patients with locally recurrent (n[*]=[*] 5) or post-surgical residual gynaecological cancer (n[*]=[*] 5). The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined by 4 experienced radiation oncologists first using contrast enhanced CT (GTV CT) and secondly using the fused 18 F-FDG PET/CT datasets (GTV PET/CT). In addition, the GTV was delineated using the signal-to-background (SBR) ratio-based adaptive thresholding technique (GTV SBR). Overlap analysis were conducted to assess <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatches</b> between the GTVs delineated using the different techniques. Inter- and intra-observer variability were also assessed. Results The mean GTV CT (43. 65 cm 3) was larger than the mean GTV PET/CT (33. 06 cm 3), p[*]=[*] 0. 02. In 6 patients, GTV PET/CT added substantial tumor extension outside the GTV CT even though 90. 4 % of the GTV PET/CT {{was included in the}} GTV CT and 30. 2 % of the GTV CT was found outside the GTV PET/CT. The inter- and intra-observer variability was not significantly reduced with the inclusion of 18 F-FDG PET imaging (p[*]=[*] 0. 23 and p[*]=[*] 0. 18, respectively). The GTV SBR was smaller than GTV CT p[*]≤[*] 0. 005 and GTV PET/CT p[*]≤[*] 0. 005. Conclusions The use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT images for target volume delineation of recurrent or post-surgical residual gynaecological cancer alters the GTV in the majority of patients compared to standard CT-definition. The use of SBR-based auto-delineation showed significantly smaller GTVs. The use of PET/CT based target volume delineation may improve the accuracy of RT treatment planning in gynaecologic cancer. </p...|$|R

Ben Bernanke stated in November 2012: [...] "The slow pace of employment growth has been widespread across industries and regions of the country.

50|$|Although trade-dislocated {{workers are}} not {{significantly}} different from workers displaced by other reasons, they present some slight differences. They tend to be older, less educated, more tenured and production-oriented, have higher earnings on the lost job and fewer transferable skills, and the prevalence on women is higher than for other displaced workers. These characteristics are associated with limited labor mobility and reemployment difficulties, especially for workers with obsolete skills who do not receive additional training, no matter the reason of displacement. Furthermore, asymmetric information in absence of good job-search skills and <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> lead to prolong unemployment. Hence, trade-displaced workers face longer periods to find a new job and have low reemployment rates (63% during the last two decades according to Kletzer, 2005). Reemployment is particularly challenging for older workers. The DOL (2012) reports that in 2012 reemployment rates for workers ages 55 to 64 and 65 years and over were 47 and 24% respectively while the rate for those ages 20 to 54 was about 62%.|$|E

Methods: We sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI to estimate population structure and genetic diversity of A. obliqua geographic collections in Brazil. Results: A total of 153 specimens from the Amazon Forest, Atlantic Rainforest, Cerrado, and Caatinga were analyzed. A total of 20 haplotypes were found. The highest diversity levels were observed in collections from the Amazon Forest.

Those places are classified into seven clusters of community performance reflecting opportunity/vulnerability, and their spatial patterns are mapped.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} the extraordinarily highrates of unemployment among black youth can be linked to a <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the residences of black youth and the jobs they might occupy. Chicago's labor market is examined in detail. The paper reports that black youth do in fact seem to live further from jobs than white youth do. However, the differences are not great enough to generate large differences in employment rates unless geographic search costs are very high. To explore the possible impact the differences really do have,a wide variety of models are examined and estimated. These models uniformly reject the hypothesis that a <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> is a major cause for black-white differences. Blacks who live near large concentrations of jobs seem to fair only slightly better than those who live far from such concentrations. And in areas where whites and blacks live in close geographic proximity, the racial employment differences remain very large. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of the spatial job search patterns of black, white, and Latino workers in Los Angeles. We find that blacks and Latinos tend to search in areas where employment growth is low, whereas whites tend to search in areas where it is high. Moreover, over half of the mean racial and ethnic differences in the quality of spatial job search (as measured by mean employment growth in areas searched) is explained by racial residential segregation. In addition, racial segregation is a more important explanation of racial differences in spatial job search quality than systematic differences in social networks and job search meth-ods, though these factors matter. Spatial job search quality has a positive and sig-nificant effect on the employment of whites and blacks, but not Latinos, and explains nearly 40 percent of the difference between white and black employment rates. These results are consistent with the existence of spatial mismatch in urban labor markets and imply that racial residential segregation limits the job opportu-nities of blacks, {{and to a lesser extent}} Latinos, in metropolitan areas.

40|$|In cities worldwide, the <b>geographic</b> and {{functional}} <b>mismatch</b> between urban governance structures {{and the actual}} dynamics of urban activities has hindered efforts to achieve sustainable and equitable development at the metropolitan scale. Overcoming this mismatch requires coordination between typically fragmented government agencies-and this coordination requires inter-organizational collaboration. In Portugal, the twin challenges of declining urban centers and sprawling suburbs, combined with {{the absence of a}} metropolitan planning structure, have heightened the importance of inter-agency collaboration, especially in terms of land use and transportation. In contrast to typical studies of policy integration, which tend to focus on barriers to collaboration, in this thesis I examine forces which contribute to its emergence. I consider two questions: first, what conditions and factors have actually led to inter-organizational collaboration in the Portuguese context? Second, what is the potential for a particular scenario-building process to lead to further collaboration among those who participated? Study of existing collaborative arrangements reveals five conditions which appear to contribute to the emergence of collaboration. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of scenario-building workshops conducted with stakeholders in Portugal suggests that these exercises have increased the likelihood of the future collaboration among participants to a small degree. Finally, recognizing that collaboration is necessary, but not sufficient, for better metropolitan-level development, I suggest ways in which government policy can take advantage of pro-collaboration forces. by Lisa Rayle.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of online auctions has grown immensely with the eBay site being the largest auction site. One {{issue that has}} not received sufficient attention in the eBay auction literature {{is the effect of}} reserve-prices (or minimum prices) on the probability of a sale. Studies that have included this variable in their empirical specifications include Lucking-Reiley et al. (2000), Eaton (2002) and Jin and Kato (2002). However, all these studies used the book-price itself to determine its effect on auction outcomes. This study used alternative specifications of the reserve-price to determine if there were different effects of this variable on the probability of sale of baseball cards. These alternative specifications combined the reserve-price with the published book-prices for the baseball cards being sold. None of the three specifications of the reserve-price affected the probability of a sale including a binary variable representing reserve to book-price ratios > 2. 00.

40|$|Students from low-income {{families}} are greatly underrepresented at selective {{colleges and universities}} in the United States. In an attempt to increase applications from low-income students, some institutions have developed programs involving increased recruitment of and more attractive financial aid packages for students from {{low-income families}}. However, relatively little research has looked at the factors that are important in the college application decision-making process, and in particular how the importance of some factors may be different for low-income students. This paper uses data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort to analyze the factors influencing students 2 ̆ 7 college application decisions, with a focus on the decision to apply to a selective four-year institution. We analyze how the influence of distance from a student’s home during high school to a selective college or university and average tuition levels at selective institutions located nearby vary with the a student’s family income. Our results show that the further a student lives from a selective college, the less likely they are to apply to one, and this effect seems to be stronger than that of average tuition levels in the student’s state. Although the effect of distance does not differ for low-income students, they are most heavily impacted due to the <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> of low-income students and selective institutions. Personal, family (in particular, parent’s education) and high school characteristics also prove to be very influential when students are deciding whether or not to apply to a selective institution...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the study is to assess the {{contribution}} of (18) F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine ((18) F-FET) positron emission tomography (PET) in the delineation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in patients with high-grade gliomas compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 patients with high-grade gliomas. Seven image segmentation techniques were used to delineate (18) F-FET PET GTVs, and the results were compared to the manual MRI-derived GTV (GTV(MRI)). PET image segmentation techniques included manual delineation of contours (GTV(man)), a 2. 5 standardized uptake value (SUV) cutoff (GTV(2. 5)), a fixed threshold of 40 % and 50 % of the maximum signal intensity (GTV(40 %) and GTV(50 %)), signal-to-background ratio (SBR) -based adaptive thresholding (GTV(SBR)), gradient find (GTV(GF)), and region growing (GTV(RG)). Overlap analysis was also conducted to assess <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the GTVs delineated using the different techniques. RESULTS: Contours defined using GTV(2. 5) failed to provide successful delineation technically in three patients (18 % of cases) as SUV(max) < 2. 5 and clinically in 14 patients (78 % of cases). Overall, the majority of GTVs defined on PET-based techniques were usually smaller than GTV(MRI) (67 % of cases). Yet, PET detected frequently tumors that are not visible on MRI and added substantially tumor extension outside the GTV(MRI) in six patients (33 % of cases). CONCLUSIONS: The selection of the most appropriate (18) F-FET PET-based segmentation algorithm is crucial, since it impacts both the volume and shape of the resulting GTV. The 2. 5 SUV isocontour and GF segmentation techniques performed poorly and should not be used for GTV delineation. With adequate setting, the SBR-based PET technique may add considerably to conventional MRI-guided GTV delineation...|$|E
40|$|Cities {{started the}} {{unprecedented}} growth about {{one hundred years}} ago. Their importance and significance are reflected by their high productivities and spatial concentrations. The understanding on urban development would help improve urban management and policies and increase wellbeing of urban residents. The three related essays in this dissertation try to improve the understanding {{from the perspectives of}} employment centers and agglomeration economies, interactions between labor and housing markets, and the behavior of local governments. The first essay examines the role of employment centers on economic development. The theoretical literature suggests that agglomeration economies are the main force behind the formation and evolution of employment centers, as well as behind economic growth in general. Applying the birth model to employment centers in Maryland, I find agglomeration effects are increased by the centers, particularly those with high employment size or industrial diversity. Ignoring employment centers may overestimate the agglomeration effects when using the fixed distance measurement. Policy implications are local officials may use employment centers as a vehicle to promote economic growth. In the second essay I test the impact of job loss on housing foreclosures. A great challenge in this study, as well as in interactions between labor and housing markets in general, is the <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> between employment and residential locations. This partially explains the mixed effects of job loss on foreclosures found in the literature. In order to gauge this effect, I develop a job loss vulnerability index using home-work commuting pairs. After fixing the attenuation bias from measurement errors, I find that job loss {{plays an important role in}} foreclosure decisions. This essay provides evidence for impact from labor market bust to housing market depression. The third essay estimates the spending pattern of off-budget revenues. The literature assumes different spending preferences of budgetary and off-budget revenues, but empirical evidence are scarce due to the lack of off-budget data. I use land revenues to proxy off-budget revenues in Chinese cities. I find that off-budget revenues do not crowd out budgetary expenditures, and they tend to support visible and tangible projects, rather than some other traditional public spending items that are not quite obvious...|$|E
40|$|In its {{continuing}} {{move toward}} resource independence, Mongolia has recently {{entered a new}} agricultural era. Large crop fields and center-pivot irrigation have been established in the last 10 years across Mongolia's "Breadbasket": the Bulgan, Selenge and Tov aimags of northcentral Mongolia. Since meteorological records are typically short and spatially diffuse, {{little is known about}} the frequency and scale of past droughts in this region. We use six chronologies from the eastern portion of the breadbasket region to reconstruct streamflow of the Yeruu River. These chronologies accounted for 60. 8 % of May–September streamflow from 1959 to 1987 and 74. 1 % from 1988 to 2001. All split, calibration-verification statistics were positive, indicating significant model reconstruction. Reconstructed Yeruu River streamflow indicates the 20 th century to be wetter than the two prior centuries. When comparing the new reconstruction to an earlier reconstruction of Selenge River streamflow, representing the western portion of the breadbasket region, both records document more pluvial events of greater intensity during 20 th century versus prior centuries and indicate that the recent decade of drought that lead to greater aridity across the landscape is not unusual in the context of the last 300 years. Most interestingly, variability analyses indicate that the larger river basin in the western breadbasket (the Selenge basin) experiences greater swings in hydroclimate at multi-decadal to centennial time scales while the smaller basin in the eastern portion of the breadbasket (the Yeruu basin) is more stable. From this comparison, there would be less risk in agricultural productivity in the eastern breadbasket region, although the western breadbasket region can potentially be enormously productive for decades at a time before becoming quite dry for an equally long period of time. These results indicate that farmers and water managers need to prepare for both pluvial conditions like those in the late- 1700 s, and drier conditions like those during the early and mid- 1800 s. Recent studies have indicated that cultures with plentiful resources are more vulnerable when these resources become diminished. Thus, the instrumental records of the 20 th century should not be used as a model of moisture availability. Most importantly, the <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> between precipitation, infrastructure, and water demand could turn out to be particularly acute for countries like Mongolia, especially as these patterns can switch in space through time...|$|E
40|$|The future {{availability}} {{of the natural resources}} (water and land) needed for food production is highly uncertain. Evidence shows diminishing natural resources and growing food demand throughout many parts of the world. China is one of the countries that face the challenge of managing its finite water and land resources to support their population. Difficulties mainly arise from: (1) the <b>geographic</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the location of water resources and available land; (2) a large and growing number of population; and (3) limited natural resources per capita. This thesis presents a systematic approach to evaluate the effects of water and land constraints on food production and applies it to China as a case study. Based on the basic principle of water and land balance, crop resource requirements, and per capita consumption, the assessment of natural resources limitations on food production can be formulated into an optimization model, with the objective function maximizing the number of people fed subject to resource constraints. This formulation makes it possible to systematically and efficiently evaluate the effects of natural resource constraints for such a complex and large scale study regions such as China. Even though our approach is based on the basic principle, we incorporate several significant features into the model to realistically represent the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in climate, land use, and crop requirements. Our analysis is conducted at a detailed spatial resolution of 0. 5 ' by 0. 5 ', includes water movement at the same resolution, accommodates the mixture of crops in people's diet, and distinguishes irrigated from rain-fed agriculture. Our optimization model presents an average long term analysis. The model is developed and calibrated to reproduce long-term observed conditions during the nominal period of 1990 - 2000. We then use the model together with globally and locally available data to make future predictions of China's food production capacity during the future period of 2046 - 2065. These future predictions include the impacts of the South-to-North Water Diversion project and projected climate change. The future climate scenarios are taken from the general circulation model predictions and represent diverse seasonal and regional patterns. Regionally, land is a limiting factor in the south, while water is a limiting factor in the north. Our results suggest that irrigation and multiple-cropping are keys in enhancing China's food production capacity to support increasing population. The spatial and seasonal distribution of rainfall changes is critical for agriculture in meeting future food requirements under climate change. by Piyatida Hoisungwan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
