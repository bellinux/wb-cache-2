In his league debut, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. [...] Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, [...] "you'll do". Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: [...] "Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. [...] I told him I wasn't a stick boy, I was a hockey player. So <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> nothing but a fresh busher [...] and the name stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote longhand letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album {{and there were a}} couple of tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and explain why I wanted to use some of his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> free to do whatever because he knew what I was doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} July, her coach had {{suggested}} that she was ready for an Ironman, despite the relatively low volume of her training. She said of Sutton, [...] "my training was more geared to standard distance, with not much high volume. I don't seem to need high-volume work like three-hour runs. I've done none of these since I've been with Brett. Some {{of the other girls}} will. This is why he is so special: he has an ability to spot potential even if the athlete can't. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ready even on the training I was doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Neuhaus: [...] "I {{learned a}} lot from him, even though he kept saying that {{there was nothing he could}} teach me. Music is written to be played and listened to and has always seemed to me to be able to manage without words... This was exactly the case with Heinrich Neuhaus. In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he taught me the meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted. And so he left me to do as I liked." ...|$|E

Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up. He was telling me {{to go out there and}} don't be afraid to make mistakes. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being too hard on myself." ...|$|E

Took me about three weeks to recover from the six weeks of touring!" [...] In December, he played three shows with the group at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California.|$|E
2500|$|As a non-devout Jew, Zeldis felt {{disconnected}} from her people {{and wanted to}} explore her heritage. She moved to Israel in 1949 {{at the age of}} eighteen, becoming a Zionist and working on a kibbutz. [...] It was here that Zeldis met her future husband, Hiram Zeldis. The two went back to the US to marry, and then returned to the kibbutz. Zeldis began painting, yet had little confidence in the quality of her work. However, Aaron Giladi, a well known Israeli artist visited the kibbutz and praised Zeldis’s paintings. Zeldis was overwhelmed by his regard and his request for two paintings, saying, [...] "I lost my voice from excitement—I couldn’t go to his lecture I was so emotionally upset. I heard afterwards that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a great artist". [...] Giladi’s compliments came with constructive criticism; his suggestion to paint larger intimidated Zeldis. After trying and failing to use larger canvases she stopped painting for a period of time, which was extended by childbirth and a permanent move to Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. I guess maybe I cleaned out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave me the name. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a fellow who, if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and put me in the hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E
