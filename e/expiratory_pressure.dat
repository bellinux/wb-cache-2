40|$|ABSTRACT. This report {{documents}} {{a specific}} {{situation in which}} indirect calorimetry produced large overestimations of oxygen consumption and energy expenditure of a patient on a respirator. High positive-end <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures</b> combined with high fractional concentrations of O 2 led to perforation of lung parenchyma with considerable loss of O 2, which produced subcutaneous emphysema and recurrent pneumothoraces. Typ-ical calculations for determining energy expenditure from O 2 consumption, therefore, could not be employed. Calculations utilizing the volume of CO 2 expired, however, were less sensitive and variable during this time period. Resting energy expendi-tures were calculated from the volume of CO 2 expired by using 5. 52 kcal/ 1 as the caloric equivalent of CO 2. This procedure does not overestimate energy needs when a physiological gas leak exists (high positive-end <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and hig...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the interaction between increased intra-abdominal pressure and Positive-End <b>Expiratory</b> <b>Pressure.</b> METHODS: In 30 mechanically ventilated ICU patients with a fixed tidal volume, respiratory system plateau and abdominal pressure were measured at a Positive-End <b>Expiratory</b> <b>Pressure</b> level of zero and 10 cm H 2 O. The measurements were repeated after placing a 5 kg weight on the patients' belly. RESULTS: After the addition of 5 kg to the patients' belly at zero Positive-End <b>Expiratory</b> <b>Pressure,</b> both intra-abdominal pressure (p< 0. 001) and plateau pressures (p= 0. 005) increased significantly. Increasing the Positive-End <b>Expiratory</b> <b>Pressure</b> levels from zero to 10 cm H 2 O without weight on the belly did not result in any increase in intra-abdominal pressure (p= 0. 165). However, plateau pressures increased significantly (p< 0. 001). Increasing Positive-End <b>Expiratory</b> <b>Pressure</b> from zero to 10 cm H 2 O and adding 5 kg to the belly increased intra-abdominal pressure from 8. 7 to 16. 8 (p< 0. 001) and plateau pressure from 18. 26 to 27. 2 (p< 0. 001). Maintaining Positive-End <b>Expiratory</b> <b>Pressure</b> at 10 cm H 2 O and placing 5 kg on the belly increased intra-abdominal pressure from 12. 3 +/- 1. 7 to 16. 8 +/- 1. 7 (p< 0. 001) but did not increase plateau pressure (26. 6 +/- 1. 2 to 27. 2 +/- 1. 1 -p= 0. 83). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a 5 kg weight onto the abdomen significantly increased both IAP and the airway plateau pressure, confirming that intra-abdominal hypertension elevates the plateau pressure. However, plateau pressure alone cannot be considered a good indicator for the detection of elevated intra-abdominal pressure in patients under mechanical ventilation using PEEP.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Hayek {{oscillator}} is {{a negative}} pressure cuirass that can operate at a range of frequencies to provide ventilation, and is a technique which could potentially be used on a general ward. This study examined the effect of different frequencies and different ranges of inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures</b> on gas exchange, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in normal subjects. METHODS: Eight normal subjects received five minute periods of ventilation using the Hayek oscillator at five different frequencies, and a combination of two spans of inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures</b> and two mean chamber pressures. A "sham" or control period was also performed at each frequency. Measurements were made of changes in gas exchange, spontaneous respiratory rate, and blood pressure before and after ventilation. RESULTS: There was significant intersubject variation in all results, independent of their height and weight. "Sham" settings acted as true controls in terms of gas exchange, but produced a fall in respiratory rate at 30 oscillations/min. The lower oscillatory frequencies of 30 and 60 oscillations/min produced the greatest increase in oxygenation, decrease in end tidal carbon dioxide pressure, and decrease in spontaneous respiratory rate. These effects were most significant at higher spans of pressure and were different from "sham" settings. No adverse effects were observed on blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The Hayek oscillator can provide assisted ventilation for short periods in normal conscious subjects with no adverse side effects on blood pressure. Maximal changes in gas exchange and {{a significant reduction in}} the spontaneous respiratory rate are seen when a combination of lower frequencies (30 and 60 oscillations/min) and higher spans of pressure are used...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} use clinical measures to investigate the presence of skeletal muscle damage in the inspiratory muscles. Methods: Ten healthy subjects underwent 60 minutes of voluntary inspiratory threshold loading (ITL) at 70 % of maximal inspiratory pressure. Maximal inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> mouth <b>pressures,</b> delayed onset muscle soreness on a visual analogue scale and plasma creatine kinase were measured prior to ITL, and at repeated time points after ITL (4, 24 and 48 hours post-ITL). Results: Delayed onset muscle soreness was present in all subjects 24 hours following ITL (intensity = 22 Â± 6 mm; significantly higher than baseline p = 0. 02). Muscle soreness was reported primarily in the anterior neck region, and was correlated to the amount of work done by the inspiratory muscles during ITL (r = 0. 72, p = 0. 02). However, no significant change was observed in maximal inspiratory or <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures</b> or creatine kinase.

40|$|SUMMARY Continuous positive-pressure {{ventilation}} (CPPV) decreases {{cardiac output}} by decreasing {{right and left}} ventricular end-diastolic volumes. To investigate the mechanism(s), we measured cardio-vascular responses to CPPV before and after opening the chest and holding the lungs away from the heart. <b>Expiratory</b> <b>pressure</b> was adjusted to achieve similar lung volumes when the chest was open and closed (12 cm H 2 O). Increasing <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressure,</b> when the chest was closed and evacuated, decreased cardiac output, ventricular end-diastolic volumes, and transmural ventricular end-diastolic pressures measured relative to lateral and posterior epicardial surface pressure (P< 0. 05). Transmural ventricular end-diastolic pressures measured relative to lateral pleural surface pressure did not change signifi-cantly, indicating {{that the increase in}} thoracic pressure was greater at the lateral and posterior epicardial surfaces than at the lateral pleural surface. Opening the chest and holding the lungs away from the heart eliminated the decrease in cardiac output and ventricular end-diastolic volumes during increased <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressure.</b> Pericardectomy did not affect the cardiovascular responses to increased <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressure.</b> We, therefore, conclude that decreased cardiac output and ventricular end-diastolic volumes during CPPV result from the effects of increased thoracic pressure on cardiac filling.

40|$|Purpose: Ultramarathon running {{offers a}} unique {{possibility}} {{to investigate the}} mechanisms contributing to the limitation of endurance performance. Investigations of locomotor muscle fatigue show that central fatigue is {{a major contributor to}} the loss of strength in the lower limbs after an ultramarathon. In addition, respiratory muscle fatigue is known to limit exercise performance, but only limited data are available on changes in respiratory muscle function after ultramarathon running and it is not known whether the observed impairment is caused by peripheral and/or central fatigue. Methods: In 22 experienced ultra-trail runners, we assessed respiratory muscle strength, i. e., maximal voluntary inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures,</b> mouth twitch pressure (n = 16), and voluntary activation (n = 16) using cervical magnetic stimulation, lung function, and maximal voluntary ventilation before and after a 110 -km mountain ultramarathon with 5862 m of positive elevation gain. Results: Both maximal voluntary inspiratory (âˆ’ 16 % Â± 13 %) and <b>expiratory</b> <b>pressures</b> (âˆ’ 21 % Â± 14 %) were significantly reduced after the race. Fatigue of inspiratory muscles likely resulted from substantial peripheral fatigue (reduction in mouth twitch pressure, âˆ’ 19 % Â± 15 %; P < 0. 01), as voluntary activation (âˆ’ 3 % Â± 6 %, P = 0. 09) only tended to be decreased, suggesting negligible or only mild levels of central fatigue. Forced vital capacity remained unchanged, whereas forced expiratory volume in 1 s, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, and maximal voluntary ventilation were significantly reduced (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Ultraendurance running reduces respiratory muscle strength for inspiratory muscles shown to result from significant peripheral muscle fatigue with only little contribution of central fatigue. This is in contrast to findings in locomotor muscles. Whether this difference between muscle groups results from inherent neuromuscular differences, their specific pattern of loading or other reasons remain to be clarified...|$|R
