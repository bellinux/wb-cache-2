However, {{in the modern}} era, power systems contain levels of harmonics which {{can no longer be}} ignored by engineers, planners, energy conservationists and economists. The directions of power flows have to be considered when harmonics are present in the power network. A methodology and new formulae for individual and overall efficiency and energy usage is developed at each frequency (f 1, h and H) and forms the main contribution to research in this field. Two case studies were conducted; a measurement based laboratory experiment set-up and a simulated case study. In the set-up, measurements of current, voltage and power at different points in the network for the 1 st, 5 th and 7 th frequencies were taken. Current and voltage results were used for hand calculations to prove the measured power flows and directions. The measurements were taken with a Fluke 345 three-phase <b>harmonic</b> power quality <b>analyzer.</b> For the simulated case study, a network was investigated using the DIgSILENT and SuperHarm software packages. Their results were compared and it was found that DIgSILENT is the preferred package for power results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Presence of {{harmonics}} in a {{power system}} {{is a major concern}} to power engineers for many years. With increasing use of nonlinear loads in power systems, the harmonic pollution becomes more serious. When the magnitudes and orders of harmonics are known, reconstructing the distorted waveform is simple. Adding the harmonics together, point by point, produces the distorted waveform. Decomposing a distorted waveform into its harmonic components is considerably more difficult. This process requires frequency analysis, which involves a fair amount of calculation. The wavelet transform (WT) relative to some basic wavelet, provides a flexible time-frequency window which automatically narrows when observing high-frequency phenomena and widens when studying low-frequency environments. A wavelet is a waveform of effectively limited duration that has an average value of zero. One of the widely used computation algorithm for harmonic analysis is Fast Fourier transform (FFT).

The two studies {{belong in the}} realm of computational music cognition, with a focus on automatic music analysis, which impacts information retrieval, and synthesis, which impacts the understanding of human creativity.; The first problem addresses the automatic extraction of key from audio signals. Audio key finding is challenging due to the unique characteristics of music audio, such as the harmonic series produced by individual tones. In this dissertation, I experiment with various approaches to obtain pitches from audio recordings, and discover that equal treatment of all detected pitches {{may not be the best}} approach. I then modify Chew's Spiral Array model, a mathematical model for tonality, to adapt it to audio signals. I also propose a fuzzy analysis method, inspired by the membership concept in fuzzy logic, to clarify bass notes using information from higher frequency harmonics. The results show that audio key finding can sometimes outperforms MIDI (symbolic) key finding, thus providing evidence that harmonics in music audio may be helpful for audio key finding. Sensitivity analysis on different system components reveal successful key finding strategies.; The second problem is concerned with automatic style-specific accompaniment (ASSA). The goal is to create a system that can analyze and learn the style from a small number of songs in the user’s preferred style, then automatically generate a sequence of chords to accompany the melody created by the user. The accompaniment generation process uses machine learning techniques to model melody-chord relations, and applies statistical modeling to chord transitions represented as neo-Riemannian transforms. I propose various evaluation methods, including the conducting of Turing tests. I also design several metrics to measure style specificity of generated accompaniments. I test different training strategies, and show that more data may not necessarily improve the style emulation results. System comparisons show that the accompaniments generated by the ASSA system are stylistically closer to the original than those generated by the Temperley-Sleator <b>Harmonic</b> <b>Analyzer</b> and a random chord generator...|$|E
