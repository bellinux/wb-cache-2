[...] 'We're winning, but we're very much concerned about the bad stuff.'" [...] Indicative of the diversity of opinion is a 2003 Boston Globe profile of the CAMERA media watchdog group in which Mark Jurkowitz observes: [...] "To its supporters, CAMERA is figuratively - and perhaps literally - doing God's work, battling insidious anti-Israeli bias in the media. [...] But its detractors see CAMERA as a myopic and vindictive special interest group trying to muscle its views into media coverage."

The real {{beginning}} {{of the work of}} Theosophy in the United States began in 1886, when Judge established The Path, an independent Theosophical magazine. Until this time, not much had been accomplished in the way of growth of the Society in America. [...] Mr. Judge addressed the common man in homely language and with simple reason. The Path showed that he had found himself and was now cultivating the area of his greatest usefulness, as a writer. His natural interest in the welfare of others affected everything he did, so that his articles and Theosophical talks are cast in the idiom of the common man.In his first editorial, he wrote: [...] "It is not thought that utopia can be established in a day...Certainly, if we all say that it is useless...nothing will ever be done. A beginning must be made and it has been made by the Theosophical society...Riches are accumulating {{in the hands of the}} few while the poor are ground harder every day as they increase in number...All this points unerringly to a vital error somewhere...What is wanted is true knowledge of the spiritual condition of man, his aim, and destiny...those who must begin the reform are those who are so fortunate as to be placed in the world where they can see and think out the problems all are endeavouring to solve, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that the great day may not come until after their death." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{extent to}} which Austen's novels are {{realistic}} is vigorously debated by scholars. The lack of physical description in her novels lends them an air of unreality. In Austen novels, as Page notes, there is a [...] "conspicuous absence of words referring to physical perception, the world of shape and colour and sensuous response". Yet, Austen carefully researched the background of her novels, using almanacs and read books to accurately describe the chronology and geography of her fictional worlds. Alastair Duckworth argues that she displays [...] "a concern that the novelist should describe things that are really there, that imagination {{should be limited to}} an existing order." [...] Austen's prose also repeatedly contains [...] "a relatively small number of frequently-used words, mainly epithets and abstract nouns indicating personal qualities—qualities, that is, of character and temperament rather than outward appearance". This allows readers to feel as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> the characters [...] "intimately as a mind". Many scholars view this connection between the reader and character as a mark of realism. For example, Janet Todd writes that [...] "Austen creates an illusion of realism in her texts, partly through readerly identification with the characters and partly through rounded characters, who have a history and a memory." [...] However, there is little agreement regarding the depth of Austen's characters. Butler has argued that Austen is not primarily a realist writer because she is not interested in portraying the psychology of her heroines. Seeing Austen as a polemicist against sensibility, Butler argues that she avoided [...] "the sensuous, the irrational, [...] the involuntary types of mental experience because, although she cannot deny their existence, she disapproves of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Germany's Institute for Quality and Cost Effectiveness in the Health Care Sector (IQWiG) {{reached a}} similar {{conclusion}} based on absence of conclusive double-blind comparative studies. [...] In its , IQWiG {{concluded that there}} is currently [...] "no evidence" [...] available of the superiority of rapid-acting insulin analogs over synthetic human insulins {{in the treatment of}} adult patients with type 1 diabetes. [...] Many of the studies reviewed by IQWiG were either too small to be considered statistically reliable and, perhaps most significantly, none of the studies included in their widespread review were blinded, the gold-standard methodology for conducting clinical research. [...] However, IQWiG's terms of reference explicitly disregard any issues which cannot be tested in double-blind studies, for example a comparison of radically different treatment regimes. [...] IQWiG is regarded with skepticism by some doctors in Germany, being seen merely as a mechanism to reduce costs. [...] But the lack of study blinding does increase the risk of bias in these studies. The reason this is important is because patients, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> they are using a different type of insulin, might behave differently (such as testing blood glucose levels more frequently, for example), which leads to bias in the study results, rendering the results inapplicable to the diabetes population at large. [...] Numerous studies have concluded that any increase in testing of blood glucose levels is likely to yield improvements in glycemic control, which raises questions as to whether any improvements observed in the clinical trials for insulin analogues were the result of more frequent testing or due to the drug undergoing trials.|$|E
2500|$|Within robotics, inverse {{dynamics}} algorithms {{are used}} to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's end-point move in the way prescribed by its current task. The [...] "inverse dynamics problem" [...] in Robotics Engineering was solved by Eduardo Bayo in 1987. This solution calculates how each of the numerous electric motors that control a robot arm must move to produce a particular action. Humans can perform very complicated and precise movements, such as controlling the tip of a fishing rod well enough to cast the bait accurately. Before the arm moves, the brain calculates the necessary movement of each muscle involved and tells the muscles what to do as the arm swings. In the case of a robot arm, the [...] "muscles" [...] are the electric motors which must turn by a given amount at a given moment. Each motor must be supplied with {{just the right amount of}} electric current, at just the right time. Researchers can predict the motion of a robot arm <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> how the motors will move. This is known as the forward dynamics problem. Until this discovery, they had not been able to work backwards to calculate the movements of the motors required to generate a particular complicated motion., Bayo's work began with the application of frequency-domain methods to the inverse dynamics of single-link flexible robots. This approach yielded non-causal exact solutions due to the right-half plane zeros in the hub-torque-to-tip transfer functions. Extending this method to the nonlinear multi-flexible-link case was of particular importance to robotics. When combined with passive joint control in a collaborative effort with a control group, Bayo's inverse dynamics approach led to exponentially stable tip-tracking control for flexible multi-link robots.|$|E
