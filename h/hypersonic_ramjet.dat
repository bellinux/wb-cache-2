40|$|The ACES Program {{began the}} {{investigation}} of regeneratively cooled ramjet engines for propelling aircraft at Mach 6 to 8 flight regimes while collecting and processing air for later use as oxidizer in rocket propulsion into an orbit flight mode. The Marquardt Company had as its prime task the design and demonstration of a ramjet capable of steady state operating using hydrogen as the regenerative coolant and with fuel flow limited to a theta = 1. Marquardt progressed from shell type combustors to advanced tubular combustion chambers in direct connect test rigs. The first tests were made with water cooled center bodies and plug nozzles using a pebble bed air heater to simulate flight air temperature. Later tests were made on completely H 2 cooled flight weight V/G assemblies direct connected to a SUE burner heater. Design studies were also conducted on integrated systems for take-off capability using offset turbojets connected to 2 -D or axisymmetric inlets. An 18 inch <b>hypersonic</b> <b>ramjet</b> evaluation scale model was designed based on the hot test results using a fully V/G inlet and exit nozzle. This thruster would provide 25000 lbs. of thrust with an estimated weight of 250 lbs.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} development, validation, {{and use of}} a thermal model created to predict the surface {{temperatures}} through the U. K. Ministry of Defence funded sustained <b>hypersonic</b> flight experiment <b>ramjet</b> vehicle. The sustained <b>hypersonic</b> flight experiment <b>ramjet</b> will operate at Mach 4 to 6 leading to very high airflow stagnation temperatures. It was therefore important to predict the temperatures during the flight experiment at an early design stage, before the vehicle geometry was finalized and before detailed computer-aided design models were available. The heat exchange mechanisms throughout the acceleration section of the sustained hypersonic flight experiment were predicted using a thermal resistance network incorporating convection, radiation, and conduction. The flexibility of the model allowed sustained hypersonic flight experiment Mach 4 combustion ground experiment thermal systems to be predicted using the same methodology as the flight experiment thermal model. The predicted ground experiment combustor exit temperatures showed good agreement with the measured experimental temperatures, providing confidence in the thermal modeling technique. The sustained hypersonic flight experiment thermal modeling technique was also used to aid {{the design of the}} ground experiment cooling water system, assess the reliability of thermocouple measurements, and analyze the suitability of a range of flameholder designs.

40|$|Plasma-assisted {{ignition}} {{technology has}} been proposed to boost the combustion efficiency of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>ramjets</b> during high speed fight. One technique utilises high-voltage nanosecond-duration pulses, which can generate free radicals thereby initiating ignition earlier in the combustion chamber and improving fuel efficiency. A high-voltage nanosecond pulse generator {{is an integral part}} of the system. In this thesis, a high-voltage nanosecond pulse generation system, employing an inductive voltage adder, is designed, built and tested. The high-voltage nanosecond pulse generation system, utilising multiple high-speed, high-voltage MOSFETs, can generate width-adjustable pulses (from 20 ns to 50 ns) with fast rise time (< 5 ns), fast fall time (< 20 ns) and variable amplitude using multiple switch cells. Using the inductive voltage adder, the system is configured in three different ways: single switch cell, two switch cells coupled in parallel and two switch cells coupled in series. The performance and features of each configuration are simulated and experimentally validated. The parallel-coupled two switch configuration increases the peak current capability of the system for a given MOSFET current rating. The increased distributed capacitance is a dominant factor, which leads to mismatch of the drain-to-source voltage at turn-off which increases the output pulse width. The series-coupled two switch configuration doubles the peak voltage of the output pulse. However, the increased leakage inductance is a major contributor to increased rise and fall time of the output pulse and this is demonstrated experimentally. An investigation on the impact of residual flux density on the pulse shape is also presented in this thesis. Without resetting the core, the output pulse will experience increased transient time and decreased peak amplitude. The investigation demonstrates that changing the residual flux density is an alternative method of adjusting the output pulse width where core saturation is used to terminate the pulse. The transient response of the output pulse is determined by the time constant of the leakage inductance and the load resistance. The experimental result demonstrates that the parallel coupling configuration can be used to decrease the time constant thereby improving the quality of the output pulse; series coupling increases the time constant. It is shown that reducing the leakage inductance plays key role in delivering high-quality pulses and that when utilising series coupling it may well be a requirement to also parallel-couple cells to limit the increase in leakage inductance...|$|R

40|$|Hypersonic flight {{has been}} with us since 22 September 1963, when Robert M. White flew the North American X- 15 at 4520 mph at an {{altitude}} of 354, 200 ftâa Mach number of 6. 7 ! This remarkable achievement was accomplished over six decades due to intensive research and development by a large number of scientists and engineers. In spite of that momentous achievement, designers have found the hypersonic environment to be harsh and non-forgiving. New programs since the 1960 s have often uncovered the unknown unknowns, usually the hard wayâearly flights of new systems have often revealed problems of which the designers were unaware. Such problems include: the ineffectiveness of the body flap for the Space Shuttle Orbiter, the viscous/inviscid interactions produced by the umbilical fairings that damaged the conical section tile protection system of the Gemini Capsule, and the shock/shock interaction that damaged the X- 15 A- 2 when it carried the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>ramjet</b> experiment. In order to continue to make advances in hypersonic flight a sustained and visionary effort is essential to generate required knowledge and technology. In order to better prepare for future developments in hypersonic flight, this article reviews the advances made within the past 50 years and then looks into the future, not just for new technological developments, but for new ways of thinking about the unknown challenges that lie ahead...|$|E
40|$|A technohistorical and forward-planning {{overview}} of U. S. developments in combined airbreathing/rocket propulsion for advanced aerospace vehicle applications is presented. Such system approaches fall {{into one of}} two categories: (1) Combination propulsion systems (separate, non-interacting engines installed), and (2) Combined-Cycle systems. The latter, and main subject, comprises a large family of closely integrated engine types, made up of both airbreathing and rocket derived subsystem hardware. A single vehicle-integrated, multimode engine results, one capable of operating efficiently over a very wide speed and altitude range, atmospherically and in space. While numerous combination propulsion systems have reached operational flight service, combined-cycle propulsion development, initiated ca. 1960, remains at the subscale ground-test engine level of development. However, going beyond combination systems, combined-cycle propulsion potentially offers a compelling set of new and unique capabilities. These capabilities are seen as enabling ones for the evolution of Spaceliner class aerospace transportation systems. The following combined-cycle hypersonic engine developments are reviewed: (1) RENE (rocket engine nozzle ejector), (2) Cryojet and LACE, (3) Ejector Ramjet and its derivatives, (4) the seminal NASA NAS 7 - 377 study, (5) Air Force/Marquardt <b>Hypersonic</b> <b>Ramjet,</b> (6) Air Force/Lockheed-Marquardt Incremental Scramjet flight-test project, (7) NASA/Garrett Hypersonic Research Engine (HRE), (8) National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), (9) all past projects; and such current and planned efforts as (10) the NASA ASTP-ART RBCC project, (11) joint CIAM/NASA DNSCRAM flight test,(12) Hyper-X, (13) Trailblazer,(14) W-Vehicle and (15) Spaceliner 100. Forward planning programmatic incentives, and the estimated timing for an operational Spaceliner powered by combined-cycle engines are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{combustion}} driven hypersonic {{shock tunnel}} {{has been designed}} and constructed primarily for the simulation of flows around hypersonic ramjets. This report describes the design and construction of the shock tunnel and discusses its hypersonic simulation capabilities. The construction of the shock tunnel has now been completed and it is ready for instrumentation and calibration. The driving gas is a combustible mixture of stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen diluted with 60 to 75 % helium to avoid detonation. The maximum mixture loading pressure is 2000 psi. The driven gas is air, usually at room temperature and pressure. Successful evacuation of the test section to 5 microns of mercury has been achieved. The shock tunnel {{has been designed to}} produce air at minimum stagnation temperature and pressure of 4200 Â°R and 2300 psi respectively and 0 maximum stagnation temperature and pressure of 14300 Â°R and 20, 000 psi respectively 1 at the nozzle entrance. Air at these stagnation conditions, when expanded in the test section, will completely simulate free flight conditions (i. e., pressure, temperature, unit Reynold's number, Mach number, etc.) in and around a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>ramjet</b> flying over an altitude range of 90, 000 ft to 250, 000 ft and a corresponding Mach number range of 7. 5 to 18. 5. Preliminary tests have been successful and have indicated that (a) the recoil mechanism is capable of absorbing the shock forces, (b) the gun barrels, joined end to end, produce a well aligned, rigid and strong driven section and (c) the actual recoil stroke will probably be considerably less than the initially assumed value of 4 "...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion, while {{conventionally}} {{included on}} the list of important aeronautical disciplines along with aerodynamics, structures, etc., is in itself a systems endeavor, analogous to the engineering of the entire vehicle; indeed propulsion encompasses important aspects of all the other disciplines. In recognition of this fact, the panel focused its discussion on those aspects of the key disciplines that are especially or uniquely important to propulsion. From the initial development of the airplane, the propulsion system has been {{recognized as one of the}} pacing technologies. It is perhaps because of the technological disparity between the reciprocating engine and the primitive airframe that the two remained relatively and separate, were developed somewhat independently, usually by different organizations. In recent years, the maturing of the gas turbine power plant and the advance in high-speed airframes have rendered this separation somewhat artificial. The power plant and the airframe now share common structural and aerodynamic elements; as the flight Mach number rises, the degree of interaction increases. By the year 2000, this interdependence will have increased in many respects to a point where independent design may not be practical or possible. During the period since the initiation of the aircraft gas turbine, the solid propellant rocket and the liquid propellant rocket, a vast array of other novel engines have been studied, covering the full spectrum of flight conditions from low subsonic to hypersonic and transatmospheric flight. In each instance, performance limits have been investigated under the assumption that current technology or reasonably foreseeable technology would be available for their development. Among the extensive list of advanced, high-performance concepts and cycles examined are the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>ramjet,</b> the variable cycle, runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine, the ram rocket (airbreathing and rich solid propellant rocket), and the air turborocket. At various times, these systems have come relatively close to meriting development and application. In many instances, limitations of materials and technologies curtailed development. As important and with almost equal frequency, the lack of commercial or military utility of the concept precluded the necessary funding. It is instructive to note that two former items on this list, the turbofan (bypass engine) and the high-speed turboprop, are respectively a mainstay engine and a promising development. In the case of the turbofan, its full potential could not be realized until turbine cooling technology had been developed and new materials developed to permit the construction of transonic fans. In the case of the highspeed turbopropeller engine, not only were the material and turbine technologies needed, but, in addition, the rise in fuel costs provided the impetus to take advantage of its favorable fuel consumption characteristic. As the basic technologies progress and as new missions become attractive, the engines in the foregoing list become candidates for new feasibility studies and further technology development. At the present time, the ram rocket is the prime contender to augment the range of small missiles. Of interest also is the hypersonic ram jet and its logical extension, the runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine. Much of this report deals with the development of current or near-future power plant concepts. First, the motivating factors for aeronautical propulsion research are reviewed as a reminder of the importance of continued effort in a field that has often been characterized as mature. Next, technical areas are discussed in which the panel feels additional research effort is warranted and would lead to the realization of the technological potentials between now and the year 2000. Under these guidelines, new cycles (e. g., isothermal energy exchange) were not considered by the panel. Finally, although facility requirements were not a prime consideration in the current projections, the panel believes that the increasing complexity of propulsion systems; the need for more refined interaction between propulsion system, airframe, and controls; and increasing operation in adverse weather will require test capabilities beyond those now available (see appendix). Enhanced test capability is needed in the areas of propulsion airframe integration and in largescale icing research with proper concurrent treatment of altitude, temperature, and speed...|$|E
