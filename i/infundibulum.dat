5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (<b>infundibulum).</b> Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an <b>infundibulum</b> and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an <b>infundibulum</b> and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The <b>infundibulum</b> provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the <b>infundibulum.</b> The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis {{increases the risk of}} PID.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an <b>infundibulum</b> and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and <b>infundibulum</b> as shared traits.|$|E
5|$|Two teeth, one {{complete}} and one damaged, form the known material of the gondwanathere Lavanify, first described in 1997. The teeth are high-crowned and curved; one contains a deep cementum-filled furrow {{and the other}} at least one deep pit (<b>infundibulum).</b> Lavanify appears to be most {{closely related to the}} Indian gondwanathere Bharattherium and more distantly to the other gondwanatheres, which are known from Argentina. Two other teeth, not yet fully described, may represent different tooth positions of another gondwanathere. One, a fragmentary molariform (molar or molar-like premolar—the identities of gondwanathere tooth are poorly understood) is larger and lower-crowned than the Lavanify teeth and the other, which is {{complete and}} unworn, is yet lower-crowned and has the surface obliquely oriented. Its crown consists of a W-shaped ridge with the parts separated by deep infundibula. This second tooth may also represent a completely different, yet unknown mammalian group.|$|E
25|$|The duo {{did more}} {{television}} {{in the latter part}} of their career, beginning with key roles of Bud Williams, Jr. (Elliott) and Walter Gesundheit (Goulding) in Kurt Vonnegut's Hugo-nominated Between Time and Timbuktu: A Space Fantasy (1972), adapted from several Vonnegut novels and stories. (Vonnegut had once submitted comedy material to Bob and Ray.) Fred Barzyk directed this WGBH/PBS production, a science-fiction comedy about an astronaut-poet's journey through the Chrono-Synclastic <b>Infundibulum.</b> This teleplay was first published in an edition that featured numerous screenshots of Bob and Ray and other cast members.|$|E
25|$|Willis was {{the first}} to number the cranial nerves in the order in which they are now usually {{enumerated}} by anatomists. He noted the parallel lines of the mesolobe (corpus callosum), afterwards minutely described by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr. He seems to have recognised the communication of the convoluted surface of the brain and that between the lateral cavities beneath the fornix. He described the corpora striata and optic thalami; the four orbicular eminences, with the bridge, which he first named annular protuberance; and the white mammillary eminences, behind the <b>infundibulum.</b> In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter and gives a good account of the internal carotids and the communications which they make with the branches of the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of {{cardiogenic}} area {{is in front of}} the oropharyngeal membrane and the neural plate. The growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the oropharyngeal membrane forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. The curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular <b>infundibulum</b> and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. The tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. Initially the tube remains attached to the dorsal part of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal mesoderm. This mesoderm disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity.|$|E

500|$|FMNH PM 59520 is 9.8mm high. It {{is similar}} in many respects to UA8653, but is less curved and its occlusal surface {{contains}} a large [...] (funnel-shaped cavity), filled with cementum and surrounded by enamel that penetrates deeply into the tooth. There is also either a second <b>infundibulum</b> or a cementum-filled furrow. The differences in degree of curvature and occlusal morphology suggest that this tooth represents a different tooth position than UA8653. Krause and colleagues tentatively placed this tooth in Lavanify {{in view of the}} considerable variation among other gondwanathere teeth of a single species {{and in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary.|$|E
2500|$|The AVP that is {{measured}} in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and Supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the <b>infundibulum</b> within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. However, {{there are two other}} sources of AVP with important local effects: ...|$|E
2500|$|The mare has two ovaries, usually [...] {{in length}} and [...] thick, that {{generally}} tend to decrease in size as the mare ages. In equine ovaries, unlike in humans, the vascular tissue is cortical to follicular tissue, so ovulation can only occur at an ovulation fossa near the <b>infundibulum.</b> The ovaries connect to the fallopian tubes (oviducts), which serve to move the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. To do so, the oviducts are lined {{with a layer of}} cilia, which produce a current that flows toward the uterus. Each oviduct attaches to one of the two horns of the uterus, which are approximately [...] in length. These horns attach to the body of the uterus ( [...] long). The equine uterus is bipartite, meaning the two uterine horns fuse into a relatively large uterine body (resembling a shortened bicornuate uterus or a stretched simplex uterus). Caudal to the uterus is the cervix, about [...] long, which separates the uterus from the vagina. Usually [...] in diameter with longitudinal folds on the interior surface, it can expand to allow the passage of the foal. The vagina of the mare is [...] long, and is quite elastic, allowing it to expand. The vulva is the external opening of the vagina, and consists of the clitoris and two labia. It lies ventral to the rectum. The mare has two mammary glands, which are smaller in maiden mares. They have two ducts each, which open externally.|$|E
