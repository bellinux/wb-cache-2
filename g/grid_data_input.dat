40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel optimal methodology {{for dealing with}} linear estimation problems in spatial deterministic fields, using discrete and regularly <b>gridded</b> <b>data.</b> More specifically, a unified study of various important issues that affect the theoretical analysis and practical computations associated with signal approximation problems (namely, stability, convergence, error analysis and choice of estimation model restrictions) is performed {{with respect to the}} data resolution parameter. A combination of different mathematical tools is employed for our theoretical developments, with the underlying ideas originating from the areas of deterministic collocation in Hilbert spaces, frame signal expansions, spatio-statistical collocation and multiresolution signal analysis theory. The spatio-statistical collocation principle is used to develop a new generalized multiresolution signal analysis scheme, which offers increased flexibility (in terms of scale level restrictions) and it is more powerful (in terms of approximation performance) than the classic dyadic multiresolution analyses that are associated with standard wavelet theory. Additional investigations are conducted on interpolation error analysis with respect to the data resolution level and the used estimation kernel, as well as on aliasing error propagation in convolution integral formulas using discrete <b>gridded</b> <b>input</b> <b>data.</b> Most of the theoretical developments are made with practical applications in mind, which means that an extensive (and original) treatment of the optimal noise filtering problem is also included, considering the most general case with non-stationary additive noise in the <b>gridded</b> <b>input</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{modelling}} the aliasing error in single-input single-output (SISO) linear systems with <b>gridded</b> <b>input</b> <b>data</b> is studied. First, a general linear esti-mation framework for SISO systems, {{based on the}} use of a multiresolution reference scaling kernel, is established, which includes the usual FFT-based numerical approxi-mation of geodetic convolution integrals as a special case. The output signal error is modelled {{with the help of a}} spatio-statistical parameter (sampling phase) that depends on the resolution of the <b>input</b> <b>data</b> <b>grid.</b> A frequency do-main algorithm is then developed which computes the de-cay rate of a certain output error functional with respect to the data resolution level, using the power spectra of the input signal, the chosen scaling estimation kernel, and the theoretic convolution kernel of the linear system. A simple numerical experiment is also included to compare the ac-curacy of the classic FFT approach in SISO approximation problems against the proposed generalization that utilizes an arbitrary reference scaling kernel...|$|R

40|$|Distributed glacier {{mass balance}} models enable the {{calculation}} of the mass balance for each point of a glacier surface from meteorological <b>input</b> <b>data.</b> In view of the observed enhanced down-wasting of Alpine glaciers in recent years, such models become increasingly valuable for assessment of ongoing and future glacier change. However, their potential for large-area application by using <b>gridded</b> <b>input</b> <b>data</b> sets has not been fully exploited yet. In this contribution we describe the major components of distributed glacier mass balance models and apply a model {{that is based on}} {{the calculation of}} the energy balance to a larger test site (Mischabel region) in Switzerland. We thereby force the model with <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> sets from annual precipitation, satellite-derived albedo and daily potential solar radiation as well as climatic means of meteorological variables. While the latter can easily be tuned to agree with observed mass balance distributions of specific glaciers, other nearby glaciers get unrealistically high positive or negative balances in the same simulation. Besides a variable sensitivity of individual glaciers, this hints to processes acting on a local scale, that are not yet considered in the model (e. g. snow redistribution by wind). However, the model is well suited for sensitivity studies with the included variables, and the mass balance sensitivities obtained agree well with results from previous studies (e. g. we calculate a 125 m rise of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) for a 1 °C temperature increase). Once the local processes have been included successfully, we see a large potential of forcing such models with future climate data as computed by regional climate models. The resulting changes in mass balance or ELA on a glacier-specific basis may then be used as an input for further impact models which calculate future discharge or water resources...|$|R

To assess how environmental variables and agronomic practices affect grain protein content (GPC), a novel approach based on monthly <b>gridded</b> <b>input</b> <b>data</b> has been implemented to develop empirical model, and validated on historical time series to assess its capability to reproduce observed spatial and inter-annual GPC variability. The model was applied in four Italian regions and at the whole national scale and proved reliable and usable for operational purposes also in a forecast ‘real-time’ mode before harvesting. Precipitable water during autumn to winter and air temperature from anthesis to harvest were extremely important influences on GPC; these and additional variables, included in a linear model, were able to account for 95 % of the variability in GPC that has occurred in the last 15 years in Italy.

40|$|Gridded {{rainfall}} datasets {{are used}} in many hydrological and climatological studies, in Australia and elsewhere, including for hydroclimatic forecasting, climate attribution studies and climate model performance assessments. The attraction of the spatial coverage provided by <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> is clear, particularly in Australia where the spatial and temporal resolution of the rainfall gauge network is sparse. However, the question that must be asked is whether it is suitable to use <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> {{as a proxy for}} observed point <b>data,</b> given that <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> is inherently "smoothed" and may not necessarily capture the temporal and spatial variability of Australian rainfall which leads to hydroclimatic extremes (i. e. droughts, floods) ? This study investigates this question through a statistical analysis of three monthly gridded Australian rainfall datasets – the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) dataset, the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) and the SILO dataset. To demonstrate the hydrological implications of using <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> as a proxy for gauged data, a rainfall-runoff model is applied to one catchment in South Australia (SA) initially using <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> as the source of rainfall input and then gauged rainfall data.

It should be noted that this study does not seek to identify which gridded dataset is the "best" for Australia, as each <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> source has its pros and cons, as does gauged or point data. Rather the intention is to quantify differences between various <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> sources and how they compare with gauged data so that these differences can be considered and accounted for in studies that utilise these gridded datasets. Ultimately, if key decisions are going {{to be based on the}} outputs of models that use <b>gridded</b> <b>data,</b> an estimate (or at least an understanding) of the uncertainties relating to the assumptions made in the development of <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> and how that <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> compares with reality should be made...|$|R

Differences in GGCM outputs arise {{from the use of}} different bio-physical models, setups, and <b>input</b> <b>data.</b> While algorithms have been in the focus of recent GGCM comparisons, this study investigates differences in maize and wheat yield estimates from five GGCMs based on the public domain field-scale model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) that participate in the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model 45 Intercomparison (GGCMI) project. Albeit using the same crop model, the GGCMs differ in model version, <b>input</b> <b>data,</b> management assumptions, parameterization, geographic distribution of cultivars, and selection of subroutines e. g. for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration or soil erosion. The analyses reveal long-term trends and inter-annual yield variability in the EPIC-based GGCMs to be highly sensitive to soil parameterization and crop management. Absolute yield levels as well depend not only on nutrient supply but 50 also on the parameterization and distribution of crop cultivars. All GGCMs show an intermediate performance in reproducing reported absolute yield levels or inter-annual dynamics. Our findings suggest that studies focusing on the evaluation of differences in bio-physical routines may require further harmonization of <b>input</b> <b>data</b> and management assumptions in order to eliminate background noise resulting from differences in model setups. For agricultural impact assessments, employing a GGCM ensemble with its widely varying assumptions 55 in setups appears the best solution for bracketing such uncertainties as long as comprehensive global datasets taking into account regional differences in crop management, cultivar distributions and coefficients for parameterizing agro-environmental processes are lacking. Finally, we recommend improvements in the documentation of setups and <b>input</b> <b>data</b> of GGCMs in order to allow for sound interpretability, comparability and reproducibility of published results...|$|R

One application of <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> sets is the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET). Several operational remote sensing (RS) approaches for estimating ET, such as the SEBAL, METRIC and EEFlux models, require estimates of reference ET (ETref), where ETref is expected ET from a hypothetical reference crop of clipped grass or alfalfa. <b>Gridded</b> weather <b>data</b> provide for the computation of ETref in all areas of a remote sensing image, and therefore potentially remove the need for dense weather station data. Given the increasing use of <b>gridded</b> weather <b>data</b> to estimate ETref, this study assessed the quality of <b>gridded</b> weather <b>data</b> estimates of ETref. To accomplish this evaluation, several <b>gridded</b> weather <b>data</b> sets – GLDAS- 1, NLDAS- 2, CFSv 2 operational analysis, GRIDMET, RTMA and NDFD – were compared to weather station data that were considered to represent ‘ground truth’ across the continental United States. The stations were selected to represent reference conditions when possible. The four primary weather variables – near-surface air temperature, vapor pressure, wind speed and shortwave solar radiation - required to compute ETref, plus calculated ETref itself were compared. The application of the same analysis to multiple <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> sets made comparisons among the <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> sets possible. Generally, the <b>gridded</b> weather <b>data</b> sets overestimated ETref. This was mainly due to overestimation of air temperature, shortwave radiation and wind speed, and underestimation of vapor pressure. RTMA had the most accurate weather data and the most accurate estimates of ETref due to its assimilation of vast amounts of surface weather data and its continual refinement. Surprisingly, the global data sets, GLDAS and CFSv 2, generally performed better than their North American counterparts – NLDAS and GRIDMET. All <b>gridded</b> weather <b>data</b> sets may be useful for estimating ETref and employment in remote sensing ET models provided some procedures for correcting biases are developed.
