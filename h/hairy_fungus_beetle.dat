PhillipsKnowing {{the factors}} that {{influence}} the distribution patterns, establishment and persistence of stored product insects aids {{in the development of a}} more effective pest management program in grain storage structures. This research focuses mainly on the insect communities of stored wheat and stored rice in two different geographical locations, their temporal relationships and the most important or abundant species within that community. Stored wheat was sampled for one season in Manhattan, KS and for rice stored in Beaumont, TX was sampled for two seasons. <b>Hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetle,</b> Typhaea stercorea (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) was one of the most abundant species and was present in every bin of either wheat or rice and appeared to move into and out of the grain mass. In wheat bin, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was a predominant species captured in the bin headspace, but was not frequently recovered in the grain mass. Headspace temperatures tended to be warmer than grain temperatures and outside temperatures. Other major insects recovered in wheat bin included the following groups or species: Anthicidae, Lathridiidae, Cryptolestes, foreign grain beetle Ahasverus advena (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), sawtoothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), smalleyed flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionoidea) and minute pirate bug Xylocoris favipes (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). In rice bins, the predominate species were <b>hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetle,</b> foreign grain beetle and Angoumois grain moth Sitotroga cerealella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Angoumois grain moth was one of the most abundant species in rice, and was captured in the headspace as well as below the grain surface. Rice bins varied considerably in the relative abundance of different species between bins within a season and between seasons. Foreign grain beetle and <b>hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetle</b> were especially variable among bins. Two species of weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) that are not grain pests, the sugar cane rootstock weevil, Apinocis deplanata and rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were present in high numbers in rice bins from September-December 2009...|$|E
5000|$|The Mycetophagidae or <b>hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{a family}} of beetles in the large {{suborder}} Polyphaga. The different species are between 1.0 and 6.5 mm in length. The larvae and adults live in decaying leaf litter, fungi, and under bark. Most species feed on fungi (hence the name). [...] Worldwide, the 18 genera contain around 200 species.|$|R
5|$|Many fungi {{can serve}} as source of food for insect larvae, whereas most insects eat fungi only occasionally. Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. These animals are mainly <b>beetle</b> larvae, especially <b>hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetles</b> (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially attractive for true flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|R
40|$|The Mycetophagidae (<b>hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetles)</b> of the Maritime Provinces of Canada are surveyed. Seven {{species in}} the genera Mycetophagus, Litargus, and Typhaea {{are found in the}} region. Six new provincial records are {{reported}} including Mycetophagus punctatus and Mycetophagus fl exuosus, which are newly recorded in the Maritime Provinces. The distribution of all species is mapped, colour habitus photographs of all species are figured, and an identification key to species is provided. The discussion notes that four of the species found in the region are apparently rare, possibly due to the history of forest management practices in the region; a situation similar to that of a significant proportion of other saproxylic beetles found in the Maritime Provinces...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Temperature {{profiles}} {{and insect}} populations were compared in wheat {{that had been}} aerated with low airflow rates during the summer in addition to two autumn aeration cycles, versus wheat aerated in autumn only or unaerated wheat. Tests were conducted in 2000 - 2001, 2001 - 2002, and 2002 - 2003, and data were analyzed separately for each year. Grain mass temperature profiles at depths of 0. 9 and 1. 8 m from the surface in the grain mass showed distinct declines in temperature for each aeration cycle {{during the first two}} years of the study, however, summer aeration did not result in as large of temperature declines in 2002 - 2003, partly because the summer aerated bin was loaded with warmer grain. The effectiveness of summer aeration was estimated using confined insect populations in tube cages placed on the surface of the grain and by sampling the grain for natural insect populations using pitfall probe traps. At the conclusion of the summer aeration cycle, the number of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius), red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) in the tube cages were consistently lower in bins that had not been aerated during the summer. Pitfall trap catch of rusty grain beetles, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), <b>hairy</b> <b>fungus</b> <b>beetle,</b> Typhaea stercorea (L.), foreign grain beetle, Ahasverus advena (Walt), and lesser grain borer was consistently lower in bins with summer aeration, indicating a reduction in natural insect populations. Field data support modeling simulation studies that predict lower insect populations when a summer aeration cycle is included...|$|E
