40|$|Recent {{demand for}} real time {{applications}} {{has given rise}} to a need for Quality of Service (QoS) in the Internet. Differentiated Services is one of such efforts currently pursued by IETF. Previous researchers found unfairness in the DiffServ network. To solve the unfairness problem, we propose a new TSW based three color marker (ItswTCM) which achieves proportional <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> excess bandwidth among aggregates. We have compared the fairness of our proposed ItswTCM marker with srTCM, trTCM, and tswTCM. Results show that our proposed marker performs better than the other three schemes for low to middle network provision level (	); we believe this is the region where all well provisioned network will operate. Results also show that our proposed marker is not as sensitive to the number of flows as previous markers. We point out that yellow packets {{play a significant role in}} achieving proportional <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> excess bandwidth among aggregates. We conclude that in order to achieve proportional <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> excess bandwidth, it is important to inject the right amount of yellow packets into the network.

5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive a <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since {{only one of the}} six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E

40|$|TCP Westwood (TCPW) is a sender-side only {{modification}} of TCP Reno congestion control, which exploits end-to-end bandwidth estimation to properly set {{the values of}} slow-start threshold and congestion window after a congestion episode. This paper aims at showing via both mathematical modeling and extensive simulations that TCPW significantly improves <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> high-speed networks capacity and that TCPW is friendly to TCP Reno. Moreover, we propose EASY RED, which is a simple Active Queue management (AQM) scheme that improves <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> network capacity especially over high-speed networks. Simulation results show that TCP Westwood provides a remarkable Jain's fairness index increment up to 200 % with respect to TCP Reno and confirm that TCPW is friendly to TCP Reno. Finally, simulations show that Easy RED improves fairness of Reno connections more than RED, whereas the improvement {{in the case of}} Westwood connections is much smaller since Westwood already exhibits a fairer behavior by itself. 1...|$|R

40|$|Fair {{allocation}} {{has been}} studied intensively in both economics and computer science, and <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> resources has aroused renewed interest {{with the advent of}} virtualization and cloud computing. Prior work has typically focused on mechanisms for <b>fair</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> a single resource. We provide a new definition for the simultaneous fair allocation of multiple continuously-divisible resources. Roughly speaking, we define fairness as the situation where every user either gets all the resources he wishes for, or else gets at least his entitlement on some bottleneck resource, and therefore cannot complain about not getting more. This definition has the same desirable properties as the recently suggested dominant resource fairness, and also handles the case of multiple bottlenecks. We then prove that a fair allocation according to this definition is guaranteed to exist for any combination of user requests and entitlements (where a user’s relative use of the different resources is fixed). The proof, which uses tools from the theory of ordinary differential equations, is constructive and provides a method to compute the allocations numerically...|$|R
