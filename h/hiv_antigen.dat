50|$|An HIV vaccine concept {{based on}} immune network {{theory has been}} described. The vaccine concept {{was based on a}} network theory {{resolution}} of the Oudin-Cazenave paradox. This is a phenomenon that makes no sense in the context of clonal selection, without taking idiotypic network interactions into account. The vaccine concept comprised complexes of an anti-anti-HIV antibody and an <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen,</b> and was designed to induce the production of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. A suitable anti-anti-HIV antibody envisaged for use in this vaccine is the monoclonal antibody 1F7, which was discovered by Sybille Muller and Heinz Kohler and their colleagues. This monoclonal antibody binds to all of six well characterized broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies.|$|E
50|$|For the {{detection}} of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen.</b> Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37 °C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, {{but there is no}} enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.|$|E

The historical development of <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> assays {{as well as their}} current and future applications for use in the clinical microbiology laboratory are reviewed. A detailed description of selected commercially available assays is presented, and a comparison is made of various parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, and cost. The use of the <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> assay {{as an alternative to the}} reverse transcriptase assay in virus culture applications is also discussed. In addition, the diagnostic and prognostic utility of the <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> assay is considered for various patient groups, including neonatal, high-risk asymptomatic, seronegative, and seropositive patient populations. The use of the <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> assay as an adjunct to anti-HIV antibody testing, as well as its utility in assessing the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drug therapy, is discussed. The biology of <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> expression and modulation of anti-HIV antibody titers during infection are also discussed in terms of two possible models...|$|E

40|$|In many countries, HIV testing among {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{patients is}} recommended so that both infections are appropriately treated. Cross-reacting antibodies to <b>HIV</b> <b>antigens</b> {{have been reported}} for several conditions, including TB, leprosy, malaria, and rheumatoid arthritis. To study the pattern and prevalence of cross-reacting antibodies to <b>HIV</b> <b>antigens,</b> we examined sera from 153 HIV-negative TB patients and 40 healthy individuals in Chennai, south India. We also studied the differences in cross-reactivity of various <b>HIV</b> <b>antigens</b> using two different Western blot kits. Of the 153 samples studied, 80 were tested using HIV Western blot and 73 were tested using INNOLIA. Most patients in the study had concordantly negative ELISA and rapid tests, and no subject had a positive Western blot. However, seven TB patients had antibodies that cross-reacted with <b>HIV</b> <b>antigens,</b> giving rise to an indeterminate result. While p 51 / 55 was the most frequently recognized antigen in the Western blot assay, antibodies to sgp 120 was most frequently identified in INNOLIA. Sequence similarities between the two organisms could be responsible for eliciting cross-reacting antibodies, since a few related epitopes were identified in HIV and Mycobacterium.

40|$|A new modular {{automated}} {{enzyme immunoassay}} (EIA) (Enzymun-Test HIV Ag: Boehringer Mannheim) for quantitative {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (<b>HIV)</b> <b>antigen</b> detection was evaluated by testing a panel of 1, 506 serum samples, including seroconversions, dilution series, follow-up samples from patients under antiretroviral therapy, single serum specimens from HIV-seropositive individuals in different stages of infection, potentially cross-reactive samples, and sera from HIV-negative hospitalized patients. The Abbott HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) antigen monoclonal antibody assay served as the reference assay, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (Organon Teknika) for quantitative amplification of HIV- 1 RNA was used for follow-up of patients under antiretroviral chemotherapy. The Boehringer Mannheim and Abbott EIAs showed concordant results for the early detection of <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> in all the seroconversion panels. The follow-up samples from 29 HIV-infected individuals under antiretroviral therapy gave divergent results between both antigen tests. For the detection of <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> in single serum samples from HIV-infected patients in different stages of HIV infection, a higher number of positive samples was detected with the Abbott HIV- 1 antigen monoclonal antibody assay in samples from patients in stages II and III of HIV infection. The Enzymun-Test detected three or more positive samples than did the Abbott assay among the samples of patients with AIDS. The concordance on a sample-to-sample basis between the Boehringer Mannheim and Abbott EIAs was 98. 6 %. The sensitivity of the Enzymun-Test {{in comparison to the}} reference assay was 97. 2 %; the specificity was 98. 8 %. Although no close correlation could be found between the amount of viral RNA in serum detected by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and the concentration of <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen,</b> a high HIV- 1 RNA copy number was mostly associated with high levels of <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen.</b> In conclusion, the Enzymun-Test permits accurate <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> detection and offers, in contrast to previous assays, the possibility of completely automated detection...|$|E
40|$|Serial {{blood samples}} were {{obtained}} from 21 homosexuals who had developed symptomatic primary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after a median incubation time of 14 days.

During the second and third weeks after the onset of illness p 24 antibody was detected by Western blot assay and antigen concentrations rapidly decreased to undetectable values. Dissociation of antigen-antibody complexes showed complexed antigen during the phase of declining concentrations of free antigen. Neither free nor complexed antigen was detected in any serum samples for several months thereafter, which suggested that failure to detect <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> reflected low or absent synthesis of viral protein rather than masking of antigen by antibodies.

40|$|AIMS: To {{show the}} {{presence}} of HIV infected cells in the placentas and membranes exposed to HIV during pregnancy, and to trace the possible transmission routes from mother to fetus. METHODS: Twenty three therapeutic abortions and 11 term placentas were investigated for {{the presence of}} <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> by immunostaining with HIV core protein specific antibodies and HIV nucleic acids by in situ hydridisation (ISH) with a 35 S-labelled HIV specific RNA probe. RESULTS: <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> as well as HIV RNA positive cells were rarely found in placental tissue and membranes. In therapeutic abortions <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> was shown in 10 out of 23 placentas, HIV RNA in two. <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> was detected in five out of 11 term placentas and HIV RNA in two. Infected cell types comprised syncytiotrophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, amnionic epithelium, chorionic macrophages as well as maternal lymphocytes in the intervillous space and decidua. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the transmission routes are: (1) a haematogenous route from the maternal intervillous space to villous stromal cells; (2) from chorion laeve to amnionic fluid and vice versa. Two additional transmission routes are partly suggested by the data: (1) in early gestation by direct extension from basal decidua to budding trophoblastic cells; (2) from the capsular decidua to chorion laeve and chorionic plate, entering the fetal circulation via the small veins...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (<b>HIV)</b> -associated <b>antigens</b> was simplified by the application of dot immunobinding on a nitrocellulose matrix. Antigens were detected by applying the polyethylene glycol-precipitated supernatants of experimentally infected cultures directly onto nitrocellulose strips and sequentially incubating the strips with an anti-HIV antiserum and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, species-specific antiserum. The immune reaction was developed by adding the precipitable substrate indoyl phosphate. The dot immunobinding assay was nearly as sensitive as the reverse transcriptase assay in detecting <b>HIV</b> <b>antigens</b> in experimentally infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, {{as well as in}} a T-cell line. The technique was also useful in the in vitro evaluation of antiviral agents.

40|$|HIV-associated immune-mediated renal disease. Although focal {{glomerulosclerosis}} is {{the most}} common renal disease, other proliferative glomerulonephritides are encountered in HIV-infected patients. We studied four HIV-infected patients with renal insufficiency, proteinuria, and proliferative glomerulonephritis, consistent with immune-mediated disease, to investigate the role of the virus and immune complexes in the pathogenesis of the nephropathy. Circulating immune complexes (CICs) and HIV-reactive antibodies were measured and characterized in each patient. Renal biopsy tissue was acid eluted, and the eluate analyzed. DNA extracted from biopsies was subjected to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HIV genome. CICs were detected in each patient: an IgA-p 24 <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> complex and an IgG antibody-gp 120 <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> complex in two patients; two patients had an IgG-p 24 <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> complex. Identical complexes were eluted from renal tissue in the first three patients; p 24 <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen,</b> and complement from the fourth. The eluted antibodies reacted with the HIV antigens from the isolated CICs. Direct immunofluorescence for viral antigen in the eluted glomerular tissue revealed HIV antigens; PCR confirmed the presence of gag genome in all four biopsies. We conclude both circulating and in-situ HIV antigen-specific immune complexes may be associated with glomerulonephritis in HIV infected patients.

IBBB synthesis of HIV-specific antibodies was identified (using matched serum and CSF specimens) in 7 of 11 children with PE, 4 of 9 children with SE, and 2 of 7 children with N. <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> was found (using a highly sensitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassay) in the CSF of 8 of 11 children with PE, none of the children with SE, and none of the 7 children with N. On the basis of these data, we conclude that: IBBB synthesis of HIV antibodies indicates invasion of the central nervous system but may reflect prior or current infection; and <b>HIV</b> <b>antigen</b> in CSF indicates viral expression and correlates with the occurrence of PE. These findings strongly implicate HIV as the causative agent of PE in these children.

We discuss the specific types of HIV screening programs and settings in which direct viral rapid testing would offer an important advantage. Finally, we suggest priorities in operations research that must be achieved {{to pave the way}} for the future introduction of direct rapid viral testing technologies in the HIV testing marketplace. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnostics are in a period of transition. The Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC) currently promotes the widespread use of simple rapid HIV tests [1], and some public health agencies have instituted and are expand-ing programs that use very sensitive assays (eg, antigen immunoassays or complex nucleic acid amplification assays) [2, 3]. These technologies address different im-portant deficiencies in the existing approach to HIV diagnostic testing. Although these tests also pose dis-tinct challenges, their use represents the future of HIV screening in the United States and abroad.

This procedure greatly improved the detection rate of the p 24 and gp 41 <b>HIV</b> surface <b>antigens</b> in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded, HIV positive central nervous system (CNS) tissue while restricting staining to areas of the CNS showing evidence of neuropathology. However, the technique did not improve retrieval of the gp 120 <b>antigen</b> in either <b>HIV</b> positive, formalin fixed CNS tissue or HIV infected T lymphoblasts. The inclusion of the high temperature autoclave step was validated using both HIV infected lymphoblasts and pre-adsorption of the specific antibodies with the appropriate recombinant HIV proteins. Using the methodology described here, formalin fixed CNS tissue from potential or known HIV positive cases can be processed reliably and safely. To ensure the reliability of this technique, it is recommended that an assessment of both the p 24 and gp 41 antigens is undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} a novel vaccine vector for expressing {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (<b>HIV)</b> <b>antigens.</b> We show that recombinant attenuated yellow fever vaccine virus 17 D expressing simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac 239 Gag sequences {{can be used as}} a vector to generate SIV-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses in the rhesus macaque. Priming with recombinant BCG expressing SIV antigens increased the frequency of these SIV-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses after recombinant YF 17 D boosting. These recombinant YF 17 D-induced SIV-specific CD 8 + T cells secreted several cytokines, were largely effector memory T cells, and suppressed viral replication in CD 4 + T cells...|$|R
50|$|The study regimen {{started with}} a set of three immunizations over eight weeks. These three {{injections}} were with a DNA vaccine which was intended to prime the immune system. This vaccine contained genetic material artificially modeled after - but not containing or derived from - surface and internal structures of HIV. 24 weeks (6 months) after a volunteer began the study regimen, that person would get a single injection of the study vaccine. This vaccine was a recombinant DNA vaccine based on adenovirus 5 as a live vector vaccine which was carrying artificial genetic material matching <b>HIV</b> <b>antigens</b> of the three major HIV subtypes.|$|R
