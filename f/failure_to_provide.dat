5|$|The Japanese {{government}} encouraged {{farmers to}} raise sheep throughout the 19th-century. Sheep-rearing programs began to import Yorkshire, Berkshire, Spanish merino, and numerous Chinese and Mongolian sheep breeds, encouraged by government promotion of sheep farming. However, {{a lack of}} knowledge on the farmer's part of how to successfully keep sheep, and the government's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> information to those importing the sheep they promoted, led to the project's failure, and in 1888 it was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt {{took place}} from March to June 1937 in the Canadian {{province}} of Alberta. It was a rebellion against Premier William Aberhart {{by a group}} of backbench (not part of the cabinet) members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from his Social Credit League. The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> Albertans with C$25 monthly dividends through social credit as he had promised before his 1935election. When the government's 1937budget made no move to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a confidence vote.|$|E
5|$|The song {{selection}} {{caused some}} controversy, since it underplayed Harrison's solo achievements during the 1970–75 period, {{for much of}} which he had been viewed as the most successful ex-Beatle, artistically and commercially. Music critics have also noted the compilation's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a faithful picture of Harrison's contribution to the Beatles' work, due to the omission of any of his Indian music compositions. In a calculated move by EMI and its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, the compilation was issued during the same month as Harrison's debut on his Warner-distributed Dark Horse label, Thirty Three & 1/3.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Great Depression, {{employment}} within the Rhondda Valleys continued to fall. This in turn led to a decline in public and social services, as people struggled to pay rates and rents. One of the outcomes of a lack of funds was a fall in health provisions, which in Rhondda lead to a lack of medical and nursing staff, a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> adequate sewage works and a rise in deaths from tuberculosis. By 1932 the long-term unemployment figure in the Rhondda was recorded at 63%, and in Ferndale the unemployment figure for adult males rose as high as 72.85%.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share of the blame going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1944, Göth was {{relieved}} {{of his position}} and charged by the SS with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Administration of the camp at Płaszów {{was turned over to}} SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Göth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Göth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed to a mental institution in Bad Tölz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{coordinate}} the FAA, RAF and Navy dispersed any counterstrike. Confusion owing to {{the weather and the}} lack of any centralised control of British sea and air forces caused each element to work independently of one another. This caused several friendly fire incidents, such as the attack by No. 217 Squadron on HMS Mackay. The most serious failure was Fighter Command’s <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> adequate protection to bomber and naval forces. Although the weather also prevented greater German fighter activity by the time the target area was reached, valuable time had been lost by bomber formations searching for their fighter escorts over the rendezvous positions which either never arrived or were given incorrect orders or direction too late to be acted upon. Little communication was enabled between fighter and bomber units, but also between the strike units themselves. Compounding the problems, RAF Bomber Command’s crews, which made up the majority of the strike forces, were not trained for attacks against naval targets. The only anti-shipping torpedo-bomber squadrons were No. 42 and 217 Squadrons of Coastal Command, which owing to logistical issues, were five torpedoes short of their total complement.|$|E

5|$|French women's {{rights advocates}} invited {{international}} feminists {{to participate in}} a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organization. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17-19 May, 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both is punitive measures, as well as its <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, an English suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.|$|E
