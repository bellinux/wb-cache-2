5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue,</b> cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a lethal}} rhizomelic (malformations which result in short, {{underdeveloped}} limbs) form of dwarfism, exhibiting both skeletal dysplasia (malformations of bone) and fibroblastic dysplasia (abnormal development of fibroblasts, specialized cells {{that make up}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue,</b> which {{plays a role in}} the formation of cellular structure and promotes healing of damaged tissues). Death caused by complications of fibrochondrogenesis occurs in infancy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues,</b> {{fibroblasts}} {{are organized}} into syncytia, cellular networks that enable matrix remodeling {{and that are}} interconnected by intercellular adherens junctions (AJs). The AJs of fibroblasts are mediated by N-cadherin, a broadly expressed classical cadherin that is critically involved in developmental processes, wound healing and several diseases of mesenchymal tissues. In contrast to E-cadherin-dependent junctions of epithelia, the formation of AJs in <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> is relatively uncharacterized. Work {{over the last several}} years has documented an expanding list of molecules which function to regulate N-cadherin mediated junctions such as: Fer, PTP 1 B, cortactin, calcium, gelsolin, PIP 5 KIÎ³, PIP 2, and the Rho family of GTPases. We present an overview on the regulation of N-cadherin-mediated junction formation that highlights recent molecular advances in the field and rationalizes the roles of N-cadherin in <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> function...|$|R

25|$|An {{atheroma}} is {{an accumulation}} of degenerative material in the inner layer of an artery wall. The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> The accumulated material forms a swelling in the artery wall, which may intrude into the channel of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. Atheroma occurs in atherosclerosis, {{which is one of}} the three subtypes of arteriosclerosis (which are atherosclerosis, Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis).|$|E
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} the {{temporomandibular}} joint is the articular disc. The disc is composed of dense <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> that is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The temporomandibular joints {{are one of the}} few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two.These two compartments are synovial cavities, which consists of an upper and a lower synovial cavity. The synovial membrane lining the joint capsule produces the synovial fluid that fills these cavities.|$|E
25|$|Fibrocartilage is {{composed}} of small, chained bundles of thick, clearly defined, typeI collagen fibers. This <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> bundles have cartilage cells between them; these cells {{to a certain extent}} resemble tendon cells. The collagenous fibers are usually placed in an orderly arrangement parallel to tension on the tissue. It has a low content of glycosaminoglycans (2% of dry weight). Glycosaminoglycans are long, unbranched polysaccharides (relatively complex carbohydrates) consisting of repeating disaccharide units. Fibrocartilage does not have a surrounding perichondrium. Perichondrium surrounds the cartilage of developing bone; it has a layer of dense, irregular connective tissue and functions in the growth and repair of cartilage.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, desmoplasia is {{the growth}} of <b>fibrous</b> or <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> It is also called desmoplastic {{reaction}} to emphasize that it is secondary to an insult. Desmoplasia may occur around a neoplasm, causing dense fibrosis around the tumor, or scar tissue (adhesions) within the abdomen after abdominal surgery.|$|R

An intraspinal extradural cystic mass was responsible for low and high signal intensities observed in lumbar lesions on T 1 and T 2 weight-ed magnetic resonance images. This cyst was a grossly spherical mass with clear serous fluid, which was connected to an adjacent intervertebral disc. Histopathology of the cystic walls revealed <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> without specific cell linings. Clinical symptoms were promptly relieved after surgical resection.

40|$|The {{regeneration}} {{and integration}} of multiple tissue types is critical for efforts to restore the function of musculoskeletal complex. In particular, the neogenesis of periodontal constructs for systematic tooth-supporting functions is a current challenge due to micron-scaled tissue compartmentalization, oblique/perpendicular orientations of <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> to the tooth root surface and the orchestration of multiple regenerated tissues. Although there have been various biological and biochemical achievements, periodontal tissue regeneration remains limited and unpredictable. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to discuss current advanced engineering approaches for periodontal complex formations; computer-designed, customized scaffolding architectures; cell sheet technology-based multi-phasic approaches; and patient-specific constructs using bioresorbable polymeric material and 3 -D printing technology for clinical application. The review covers various advanced technologies for periodontal complex regeneration and state-of-the-art therapeutic avenues in periodontal tissue engineering...|$|R
25|$|Epulis fissuratum (also termed {{inflammatory}} fibrous hyperplasia, denture-induced fibrous inflammatory hyperplasia, denture injury tumor, denture epulis, denture induced granuloma, and granuloma fissuratum) is {{a benign}} hyperplasia of <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> which develops as a reactive lesion to chronic mechanical irritation {{produced by the}} flange of a poorly fitting denture. More simply, epulis fissuratum is where excess folds of firm tissue form inside the mouth, {{as a result of}} rubbing on the edge of dentures that do not fit well. It is a harmless condition and does not represent oral cancer. Treatment is by simple surgical removal of the lesion, and also by adjustment of the denture or provision of a new denture.|$|E

50|$|Whenever {{muscles and}} joints are moved this also exerts {{mechanical}} strain on related fascial tissues. The general assumption in sports science had therefore been that muscle strength exercises {{as well as}} cardiovascular training would be sufficient for an optimal training of the associate <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues.</b> However, recent ultrasound-based research revealed that the mechanical threshold for a training effect on tendinous tissues tends to be significantly higher than for muscle fibers. This insight happened roughly {{during the same time}} in which the field of fascia research attracted major attention by showing that fascial tissues are much more than passive transmitters of muscular tension (years 2007 - 2010). Both influences together triggered an increasing attention in sports science towards the question whether/how fascial tissues can be specifically stimulated with active exercises.|$|R
25|$|Nasal muscles â The {{movements}} of the human nose are controlled by groups of facial and neck muscles that are set deep to the skin; they are in four (4) functional groups that are interconnected by the nasal superficial aponeurosisâthe superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS)âwhich is a sheet of dense, <b>fibrous,</b> collagenous <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> that covers, invests, and forms the terminations of the muscles.|$|R
30|$|Fasciae {{were defined}} as âmasses of <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> {{large enough to be}} visible to the unaided eyeâ {{according}} to the Greyâs Anatomy textbook [3]. This historical concept has evolved depending on the variable importance attributed to the gross or microscopic anatomy, to the histological composition and to the functions of the fascial system. According to a most recent definition [2], âthe fascial system consists of the three-dimensional continuum of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> that permeate the body. It incorporates elements such as adipose tissue, adventitiae and neurovascular sheaths, aponeuroses, deep and superficial fasciae, epineurium, joint capsules, ligaments, membranes, meninges, myofascial expansions, periostea, retinacula, septa, tendons, visceral fasciae, and all the intramuscular and intermuscular <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> including endo-/peri-/epimysium. The fascial system interpenetrates and surrounds all organs, muscles, bones and nerve fibers, endowing the body with a functional structure, and providing an environment that enables all body systems to operate in an integrated mannerâ. This holistic approach emphasizes the links between all membranous components of the skeleton from the skin to the periosteum and from the body to the limb extremities.|$|R
2500|$|Cellulite (also {{known as}} adiposis edematosa, dermopanniculosis deformans, status protrusus cutis, gynoid lipodystrophy, and orange peel syndrome) is the {{herniation}} of subcutaneous fat within <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> that manifests topographically as skin dimpling and nodularity, {{often on the}} pelvic region (specifically the buttocks), lower limbs, and abdomen. Cellulite occurs in most postpubescent females. A review gives a prevalence of 85 to 98% of women, indicating that it is physiologic rather than pathologic. [...] It can result from a complex combination of factors ranging from hormones to heredity.|$|E
2500|$|Fibromyalgia is {{estimated}} to affect 2â8% of the population. Women are affected about twice as often as men. Rates appear similar in {{different areas of the}} world and among different cultures. Fibromyalgia was first defined in 1990 with updated criteria in 2011. There is controversy about the classification, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia. While some feel the diagnosis of fibromyalgia may negatively affect a person, other research finds it to be beneficial. The term [...] "fibromyalgia" [...] is from New Latin, fibro-, meaning [...] "fibrous tissues", Greek Î¼ÏÏ myo-, [...] "muscle", and Greek Î¬Î»Î³Î¿Ï algos, [...] "pain"; thus the term literally means [...] "muscle and <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> pain".|$|E
2500|$|The trachea, colloquially {{called the}} windpipe, is a {{cartilaginous}} tube {{that connects the}} pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At {{the top of the}} trachea the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx. This is the only complete tracheal ring, the others being incomplete rings of reinforcing cartilage. The trachealis muscle joins the ends of the rings and these are joined vertically by bands of <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> â the annular ligaments of trachea.

40|$|Bio-hybrid {{artificial}} {{organs are}} an attractive concept to restore organ function through precise biological cooperation with surrounding tissues in vivo. However, in bio-hybrid artificial organs, an artificial organ with <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues,</b> including muscles, tendons and ligaments, {{has not been}} developed. Here, we have enveloped with embryonic dental follicle tissue around a HA-coated dental implant, and transplanted into the lower first molar region of a murine tooth-loss model. We successfully developed a novel fibrous connected tooth implant using a HA-coated dental implant and dental follicle stem cells as a bio-hybrid organ. This bio-hybrid implant restored physiological functions, including bone remodelling, regeneration of severe bone-defect and responsiveness to noxious stimuli, through regeneration with periodontal tissues, such as periodontal ligament and cementum. Thus, this study represents {{the potential for a}} next-generation bio-hybrid implant for tooth loss as a future bio-hybrid artificial organ replacement therapy...|$|R

Surrounding the granulomas, inflammatory cell infiltration consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasmacytes was observed diffusely and significantly. Immunohistochemistry revealed small numbers of macrophages around necrotic foci that were positively stained for anti-mouse feline coronavirus. Electron microscopically, the cytoplasm of the macrophages contained viral particles, which were identified as coronavirus. The histopathological features in this ferret were similar to those in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). This was the first case in ferrets in Japan...|$|R
2500|$|The {{device that}} is used is usually {{manually}} operated by twisting a rod that through a rack and pinion system or the like, separates the bone; the rate of separation is carefully determined because going too quickly can cause nonunion, in which unstable <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> is formed instead of bone, and going too slowly can allow premature union to occur. [...] Generally the rate is about a millimeter per day, achieved in two steps per day. [...] The frequency of steps and how much the device is moved at each step, is called the [...] "rhythm". [...] The devices sometimes contain a spring that provides tension to continually separate the bones, instead of being manually operated at set intervals.|$|E

The fins also contain a mechanism for regulating body temperature, as the arteries feeding the fin's muscles are surrounded by veins that dilate or contract to gain or lose heat. The tailfin is flat with two oar-like lobes, it does not have any bones, and is made up of hard, dense, <b>fibrous</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> The tailfin has a distinctive curvature along the lower edge.

40|$|AbstractBlebs are spherical plasma {{membrane}} protrusions formed when the membrane detaches from the underlying cortex {{as a result}} of actomyosin contractility-powered increase of hydrostatic pressure in the cytoplasm. Different tumour cells metastasize using blebbing as alternative mode of migration by squeezing through pre-existing pores in the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study investigated the role of the lipid signalling phospholipases D 1 and D 2 (PLD 1 /PLD 2) in bleb formation in human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cell line in the extracellular matrix, and reports that pharmacological inhibition of PLD 1 and PLD 2 with a potent universal PLD inhibitor potently inhibited bleb formation in HT 1080 cells embedded in three-dimensional (3 D) matrigel matrix. Use of smartpool small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target PLD 1 and PLD 2 isoforms at four different sequences revealed that PLD 2, but not PLD 1 is involved in blebbing of HT 1080 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLD 2 -mediated bleb formation is via the PA-LPAR-Rho-ROCK signalling pathway.
