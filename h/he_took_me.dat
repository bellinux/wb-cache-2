[...] "Monster" [...] has a basic sequence of F–G–Am–Em as its chord progression. Lyrically, [...] "Monster" [...] contains zombie-like metaphors about having one's heart eaten. The song also features references to [...] "Just Dance", Gaga's debut single, with the line [...] "I wanna ‘Just Dance’/ But <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> home instead". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH believed that the lines in the last verse [...] "get a bit gruesome at the end" [...] with the lines saying [...] "He tore my clothes right off/ He ate my heart and then he ate my brain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the album, {{producer}} RZA sampled dialogue {{from various}} {{scenes in the}} John Woo film The Killer. RZA later recollected [...] "I met John Woo that same year. He sent me a letter. He was honored that we did it. I felt confident we could settle anything that came up. You can usually settle that shit. It's part of the budget, man. But John Woo didn't want nothing, never no money for that. We actually became friends. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> and Ghost to lunch and dinner many times. He gave {{me a lot of}} mentoring in film." ...|$|E

2500|$|In summer 1827 {{the family}} visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly {{and left him}} a {{fragment}} of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: [...] "Only his magnificent features and the way <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> upon his lap," [...] according to his autobiography. The family spent {{the next ten years}} in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. [...] "Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried me off to this Paradise lost," [...] he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: [...] "Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album." [...] The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.|$|E
2500|$|In his Mishneh Torah, Maimonides {{detailed}} {{the laws of}} the fringes ( [...] , tzitzit) set forth in [...] Maimonides taught that the tassel on the fringes of a garment is called tzitzit, because it resembles the locks of hair on one's head, as [...] says, [...] "And <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> by the locks ( [...] , be-tzitzit) of my head." [...] The Torah does not set a fixed number of strands for the tassel. They take a strand of wool, called techelet, that is dyed sky-blue and wind it around the tassel. The Torah does not set a fixed number of times that this strand should be wound around the tassel. [...] which states, [...] "And you shall make tassels [...] [...] [...] and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of techelet," [...] contains two commandments: (1) to make a tassel on the fringe of a four-cornered garment, and (2) to wind a strand of techelet around the tassel. The absence of techelet, however, does not prevent one from fulfilling the commandment with white strands, as a person who does not have techelet should make tzitzit from white strands alone. Whether the tzitzit a person wears on a garment are white, techelet, or a combination of the two, it is a single commandment, as [...] states, [...] "And they shall be tzitzit for you." [...] The presence of four tzitzit is necessary for the commandment to be fulfilled. Maimonides taught that tzitzit must be made by a Jew, as [...] says: [...] "Speak to the children of Israel [...] [...] [...] and you shall make tzitzit for yourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle {{hosted a}} superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms {{limitation}} talks and détente {{efforts in the}} wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time". De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved {{in the wake of}} the U-2 incident.|$|E

60|$|LOUIS. Confound his impudence! What {{the devil}} does <b>he</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for? Now that just destroys all my {{interest}} in the beastly job. Ive a good mind to throw up the commission, and pay him back his money.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast <b>he</b> would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> aside. The formula {{was always}} the same.|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to {{the other}} side of the monument, that I might look at Doña Sodina.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> by the arm, and I {{saw that}} the lady and her admirers were looking at me.|$|E
60|$|It {{was later}} in the day that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> in his arms, manifesting great embarrassment and {{claiming}} polygamous emotions.|$|E

6000|$|The {{sound of}} the closing door {{conveyed}} a sense of utter desolation to her over-wrought mind--the house was a solitary prison; she sank on the sofa, sobbing, 'Oh, I am very, very miserable!

60|$|The {{author of}} the ensuing letter, by his name, and the {{quotations}} he makes from the ancients, seems a sort of spy from the old world, whom we moderns ought {{to be careful of}} offending; therefore I must be free, and own it a fair hit where <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me,</b> rather than disoblige him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{although}} he locked {{me in my}} room, saying the law gave him the right to teach obedience.
