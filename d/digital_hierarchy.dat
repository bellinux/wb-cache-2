Line terminating equipment (LTE) is installed at Longyearbyen and Harstad. The system is capable of handling the entire length without regeneration of the signal. It employs clear-channel transmission, which is protocol-independent, with the transmissions using the Synchronous <b>Digital</b> <b>Hierarchy</b> protocols. The LTE is fed both an STM-1 at 155 Mbit/s and an STM-64 at 10 Gbit/s, resulting in a STM-64 and OC-192 protocol for transmission. [...] The system is monitored using the Tycho Element Manager System, which are installed in Longyearbyen, Harstad and at Telenor's Network Operations Center in Fornebu. The system can be extended to 2,500 Gbit/s on each cable, by employing all pairs and adding additional wavelengths.|$|E
