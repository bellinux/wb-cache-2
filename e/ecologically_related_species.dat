5000|$|One of {{the primary}} ways niche-sharing species can coexist is the competition-colonization trade-off. In other words, species that are better {{competitors}} will be specialists, whereas species that are better colonizers {{are more likely to}} be generalists. Host-parasite models are effective ways of examining this relationship, using host transfer events. There seem to be two places where the ability to colonize differs in <b>ecologically</b> closely <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> In feather lice, Bush and Clayton provided some verification of this by showing two closely related genera of lice are nearly equal in their ability to colonize new host pigeons once transferred. Harbison [...] continued this line of thought by investigating whether the two genera differed in their ability to transfer. This research focused primarily on determining how colonization occurs and why wing lice are better colonizers than body lice. Vertical transfer is the most common occurrence, between parent and offspring, and is much-studied and well understood. Horizontal transfer is difficult to measure, but in lice seems to occur via phoresis or the [...] "hitchhiking" [...] of one species on another. Harbison found that body lice are less adept at phoresis and excel competitively, whereas wing lice excel in colonization.|$|R
40|$|Near its {{southern}} limit in the Northeastern Atlantic, the dioecious brown alga Fucus vesiculosus is {{absent from the}} exposed coast yet it is abundant in estuaries and coastal lagoons. In contrast, the phylogenetically and <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> hermaphroditic <b>species</b> F. sp iralis occurs along the open coast, though often in low abundance. We hypothesized {{that the absence of}} F. vesiculosus from exposed shores near {{its southern}} limit was due to reduced external fertilization success, as its gametes may be diluted beyond the level required for successful fertilization, in contrast with its her- maphroditic, self-compatible congener. To test this hypothesis, individuals of both species were transplanted to 3 exposed sites near their southern limit in the Northeastern Atlantic. Egg settlement and fertilization success (% of eggs fertilized) were evaluated daily during the main reproductive season. Recruitment was evaluated {{at the end of the}} reproductive season, and recruit mortality was evaluated using outplants of laboratory-cultured embryos. On the exposed shores near their southern limit, transplanted adults of both species survived and released eggs, and fertilization success was unexpectedly high. However, recruitment and recruit survivorship of F. vesiculosus was significantlylower than F. spiralis. Our results suggest that F. vesiculosus is restricted to low water-motion environments because of recruitment failure and recruit mortality on exposed bare shores near its south-ern limit, and not because of inability to fertilize eggs in turbulent environments. This study does not support our hypothesis of a role for dioecy/hermaphroditism in explaining the distribution of exter-nally fertilizing marine organisms in high water-motion environments...|$|R

The Pseudomonas putida phylogenetic branch includes at least 13 species of environmental and industrial interest, plant-associated bacteria, insect pathogens, and even some members that have been found in clinical specimens. In the context of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project, we present the permanent, high-quality draft genomes of the type strains of 3 taxonomically and <b>ecologically</b> closely <b>related</b> <b>species</b> in the Pseudomonas putida phylogenetic branch: Pseudomonas fulva DSM 17717, Pseudomonas parafulva DSM 17004 and Pseudomonas cremoricolorata DSM 17059. All three genomes are comparable in size (4. 6 - 4. 9 Mb), with 4, 119 - 4, 459 protein-coding genes. Average nucleotide identity based on BLAST comparisons and digital genome-to-genome distance calculations are in good agreement with experimental DNA-DNA hybridization results. The genome sequences presented here will be very helpful in elucidating the taxonomy, phylogeny and evolution of the Pseudomonas putida species complex.

40|$|Commission (NPAFC) {{was charged}} with {{developing}} a new five-year Science Plan (2011 - 2015). The vision of the Convention is conservation of anadromous populations in the North Pacific Ocean. To achieve this vision, the Commission needs the best available scientific information {{on the condition of}} anadromous populations, <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> and their marine ecosystems. Thus, the Commission’s mission in scientific research is to promote the acquisition, analysis, and dissemination of scientific information pertaining to anadromous populations and <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> <b>species</b> in the ocean; to coordinate efforts to conserve anadromous populations in the ocean; and to establish an effective mechanism of international cooperation to promote the conservation of anadromous populations in the ocean. Over the past several decades, there have been significant variations in the marine production of Asian and North American salmon populations that are linked to climate change.

40|$|Studies of {{migration}} have revealed multiple trade-offs with other life-history traits that may underlie observed variation in migratory properties among ages and sexes. To assess whether, {{and to what}} extent, body size and/or sex-specific differences in competition for resources (e. g. breeding territories or winter food) may shape variation in migration distance and timing of arrival in <b>ecologically</b> and phylogenetically <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> we combined over 30 000 sightings of individually marked, sexually mature males and females of Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Lesser Black-Backed Gulls Larus fuscus with biometric measurements and phenological observations at a mixed breeding colony. In L. argentatus, larger males migrated further from the breeding colony, whereas migration distance was independent of body size in adult females. In L. fuscus, no relationship between body size and migration distance was apparent in either sex. Mean arrival dates at the breeding colony did not vary with migration distances but differed {{between males and females}} of L. argentatus (but not L. fuscus). As allometry at least partly explains sexual segregation in migration behaviour in L. argentatus, but not in L. fuscus, we conclude that the effect of body size on sex-related migratory strategies may vary between closely <b>related,</b> sympatric <b>species</b> despite similar size dimorphism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two trophic {{models of}} the São Sebastião {{ecosystems}} were built to evaluate differences in their size and organization. The study area {{is located on the}} southeastern coast of Brazil. The trophic groups of the systems were based on <b>ecologically</b> or taxonomically <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> considering their relative abundance and similarity of diets and habits. The models, based on the Ecopath software, consist of six fish groups, ten invertebrate groups, Bacterioplankton, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, and Detritus. Biomass, production, and consumption were estimated for the Inner shelf and the Channel. Primary production was estimated as 2, 436 g wet weight m- 2 year- 1 on the inner shelf and 1, 441 g WW in the channel. Total benthic production was 215. 8 and 418. 1 g WW. m- 2. yr- 1 on the inner shelf and the channel, respectively. Total fish production plus Cephalopoda was 4. 9 g WW. m- 2. year- 1 in the inner shelf and 11. 5 g in the channel. Total system throughput was 8161 g WW. m- 2. year- 1 in the inner shelf and 11442 g in the channel. The Channel ecosystem was slightly larger in total biomass, development capacity, cycling, and total throughput. Nevertheless, primary production, and total net primary production showed higher values in the inner shelf ecosystem. In contrast to other shelf systems, detritus pathways are more important than flows originating from phytoplankton, mainly in the Channel ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} genetic tools using non-invasive samples such as faeces have {{an important}} role for the monitoring of wildlife and identification of elusive and rare species of semi-aquatic vertebrates. However, under aquatic environmental conditions the faeces undergo physical changes that harm the direct identification by visual inspection and leads to the confusion of the deposits from different cohabitating species. Consequently, the need of a refinement of molecular procedures is suggested. In this study this task was focused on the study of the reliability of the PCR-RFLP method to easily distinguish the faeces of the desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) from <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> including N. a. anomalus, but using an in silico-RFLP strategy. In this work, the faecal samples were collected from 2013 to 2014 from the LIC “Sierra de Gredos y Valle del Jerte” in the Mountain Central System of Spain, where the southernmost European population of the Pyrenean desman still survives. One primer pair was designed to amplify a very short portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene containing targets for the restriction enzymes Hinf I, Mbo I and Hpy CH 4 V, because the combination provides species-specific identifications. Pyrenean desman or Mediterranean water shrews were undoubtedly identified in the collected faeces. Moreover, the degree of homoplasy was studied under different scenarios of the three enzymes combination. Finally, the in silico-RFLP profiles given by the three enzymes combination have contributed with valuable information for a successful discrimination of faeces of the Pyrenean desman from those derived of Neomys fodiens, Neomys anomalus, Nectogale elegans and Cinclus cinclus.

40|$|In {{heterogeneous}} environments, differential niche selection by {{two competing}} species {{will result in}} niche partitioning so that individuals of each species can maximise their fitness under different sets of environmental variables. Thus, niche partitioning is considered essential to allow co-existence of <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> To assess whether niche partitioning was occurring between native red squirrels and alien grey squirrels living together in a 13 -ha high-quality mixed deciduous woodland in north Italy, we investigated temporal and spatial patterns in their activity and foraging behaviour between 1996 and 1998. We used live trapping and radio-tracking to study numbers, distribution and behaviour of squirrels. Daily and seasonal temporal activity patterns, and activity {{on the ground and}} in the trees, were similar in the two species. However, grey squirrels were more tree specialists and had a narrower tree-species niche width than red squirrels, in particular making greater use of oak. Other studies of red and grey squirrels in allopatry show that the two species differ in the extent they utilise oak. Overall, tree-species niche overlap was about 70 %. Grey squirrels had larger home ranges than red squirrels. Home ranges and core areas of both species were larger in males than females. Also, intraspecific home range and core-area overlap patterns were similar to those found in allopatric populations of these species. Overall, {{there was no evidence that}} the use of space of one species was affected by the other. Our results show that there was no niche partitioning of activity or foraging behaviour in time or space during the study. This suggests that, at moderate grey-squirrel densities, red squirrels are unable to avoid competition with grey squirrels, and that competition for food and/or space will occur when these resources become limiting...|$|E
40|$|Aim]: Using six {{free-living}} deer {{species in}} Great Britain {{as a case}} study, we studied biogeographical relationships of <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> <b>species</b> composed of both native and introduced species. [Location]: Great Britain. [Methods]: We modelled the environmental favourability for the deer species using variables related with spatial location, climate, topography, human disturbances and habitat structure. Favourability values of each pair of native (naturalized) -introduced species were used to estimate the fuzzy overlap index (FOvI) {{as a measure of}} overall similarity between the environmental requirements for the species in Great Britain. The absolute local overlap values (FOvI-L) were also used to measure {{the degree to which a}} given location was favourable simultaneously for each pair of species. We assessed the trends of species favourability across a range defined by the absolute local overlap values and studied the shape of the obtained curves since they informs us about the favourability balance between the studied species. [Results]:  Muntjac and Chinese water deer attained higher favourability values than native species in localities with intermediate values of FOvI-L (a reduced number in the study area), suggesting that if competitive relationships were established in these localities the introduced deer species may have some advantages over natives. Sika deer only achieved higher values than fallow deer in those localities clearly unfavourable for the naturalized species. Our analyses predicted that fallow deer will be less affected by the introduced deer species than native species. [Main conclusions]: We developed an approach based on the favourability function to describe biogeographical relationships between species, natives and introduced and to assess from a biogeographical perspective if introduced species could pose a competitive risk to natives. Although the results of present analyses do not conclusively demonstrate competitive exclusion, they provide directional hypotheses that can be tested in experimental field and laboratory studies.

40|$|Background: Closely <b>related,</b> <b>ecologically</b> similar <b>species</b> {{often have}} {{adjacent}} distributions, suggesting competitive exclusion {{may contribute to}} the structure of some natural communities. In systems such as island archipelagos, where speciation is often tightly associated with dispersal over oceanic barriers, competitive exclusion may prevent population establishment following inter-island dispersal and subsequent cladogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a combination of tools, we test the hypothesis that the distributions of shrew (Crocidura) species in the Philippines are the result of competitive exclusion preventing secondary invasion of occupied islands. We first compare ecological niche models between two widespread, allopatric species and find statistical support for their ecological similarity, implying that competition for habitat between these species is possible. We then examine dispersion patterns among sympatric species and find some signal for overdispersion of body size, but not for phylogenetic branch length. Finally, we simulate the process of inter-island colonization under a stochastic model of dispersal lacking ecological forces. Results are dependent on the geographic scope and colonization probability employed. However, some combinations suggest that the number of inter-island dispersal events necessary to populate the archipelago may be much higher than the minimum number of colonization events necessary to explain current estimates of species richness and phylogenetic relationships. If our model is appropriate, these results imply that alternative factors, such as competitiv...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To assess {{overlooked}} conservation {{problems of}} the Iberian lynx by exploring biogeographic relationships with its staple prey, the European rabbit. Location: The Iberian Peninsula. Methods: We modeled environmental favorability for the lynx based on its distribution before 1989, and for the rabbit using distribution data collected primarily after its population crash of 1989. We used the latter as a current trophic favorability model for the lynx. We validated that both models reflect abundance using independent data. We then combined these models in a lynx occurrence forecast and compared it with the recent lynx records. As Iberian rabbits evolved in two geographically separated lineages, being the recent lynx range practically restricted to the southwestern lineage, we correlated the prevalence of this lineage with environmental favorability for the rabbit. Results: The environmental lynx model correlated with past lynx abundance data, but did not reflect its recent strong range contraction. The rabbit model correlated with recent rabbit abundance, but was negatively correlated with the environmental model for the lynx. The combination of both models forecasted lynx occurrence in a few separated nuclei, which encompass all recent lynx records. The prevalence of rabbit’s southwestern lineage correlated negatively with favorability for the rabbit. Main conclusions: The region to which the lynx became confined before 1989 is currently less favorable for its staple prey, whereas more favorable areas remain outside lynx reach. This differential favorability correlates with rabbit phylogeographic structure, suggesting that the southwestern lineage is facing more unfavorable conditions or is less resilient to recent diseases. The loss of concordance between lynx distribution and rabbit phylogeographic structure has prevented lynx persistence in northeastern rabbit lineage areas, which {{should be considered in}} lynx reintroduction planning. Similar conservation problems could affect other <b>ecologically</b> and evolutionarily <b>related</b> <b>species</b> whose distributions’ overlapping has sharply diminished...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{describe}} the habitat characteristics {{and status of}} the brush-tailed rabbit-rat, Conilurus penicillatus Gould, 1842, on the Tiwi Islands, northern Australia, {{as part of a}} broader programme aimed at the conservation management of this species. In addition, comparable environmental modelling is undertaken for other co-occurring small native mammals, including the black-footed tree-rat, Mesembriomys gouldii Gray, 1843, a taxonomically and <b>ecologically</b> <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> These objectives relate to the significance for mammal conservation of islands generally in Australia, and the recent intensification of plantation forestry on these previously little-disturbed islands. Location Melville and Bathurst islands (Tiwi Islands), respectively, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s second and fifth largest islands. Methods A systematic survey was conducted for mammals across Bathurst (115 sampled quadrats) and Melville Island (236 quadrats). A broad range of environmental variables was recorded for every quadrat. All quadrats were classified by their woody plant species composition. The relative occurrence of individual mammal species across the resulting vegetation groups was examined using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA. The habitat relationships of C. penicillatus and the most commonly recorded mammal species were described by generalized linear modelling, with separate models for each island, for both islands combined, for all habitats and for only those sites dominated by eucalypts. Results Twelve small mammal species (excluding bats, macropods and feral animals) were recorded in this study. The most notable feature of this survey was the lack of records of M. gouldii from Bathurst Island. In contrast, the proportion of quadrats with C. penicillatus was not significantly different between the two islands. There was no significant tendency for these two species to co-occur in quadrats on Melville Island more or less commonly than by chance. Conilurus penicillatus was most abundant in eucalypt forest while M. gouldii showed a weak association with eucalypt forests and woodlands and shrub land. The five most commonly recorded species showed highly idiosyncratic relationships with environmental variables, with this relationship showing some variation between the two islands. None showed any significant association with floristic variation within the extensive eucalypt forests, but most showed significant associations with tree height, basal area (especially of large trees), landscape position (distance to watercourse) and fire history. Main conclusions Conilurus penicillatus was most likely to occur in tall eucalypt forest away from watercourses. This habitat is now being targeted for clearance for the development of plantations of the exotic Acacia mangium. Seven of the 12 mammal species examined in this study (C. penicillatus, M. gouldii, Rattus tunneyi Thomas, 1904, Melomys burtoni Ramsay, 1887, Sminthopsis butleri Archer, 1979, Phascogale tapoatafa Meyer, 1793 and Petaurus breviceps Gould, 1842) were not recorded at all in plantations, and these (and other) species are likely to be severely disadvantaged by plantation development. The study also demonstrated that the two medium to large arboreal rodent species (C. penicillatus and M. gouldii) vary in environmental associations and found no evidence that C. penicillatus increased in areas unoccupied by M. gouldii...|$|E
