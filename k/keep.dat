5|$|A new <b>keep</b> was built, {{probably}} in the 13th century. This {{took the form of}} a polygonal shell <b>keep,</b> with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting six foot (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and <b>keep</b> being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E

5|$|As the 16th century progressed, keeps {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began to supplant the <b>keep</b> as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a <b>keep</b> and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the <b>keep</b> as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces {{by the middle of the}} century, and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional <b>keep.</b> The <b>keep</b> at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E

5|$|<b>Keep</b> {{design in}} England {{began to change}} only {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, later than in France. Wooden keeps on mottes ceased to be built across most of England by the 1150s, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Welsh Marches. By the end of the 12th century, England and Ireland saw a handful of innovative angular or polygonal keeps built, including the <b>keep</b> at Orford Castle, with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the high, circular central tower; the cross-shaped <b>keep</b> of Trim Castle and the famous polygonal design at Conisborough. Despite these new designs, square keeps remained popular across much of England and, as late as the 1170s, square Norman great keeps were being built at Newcastle. Circular <b>keep</b> designs similar to those in France really became popular in Britain in the Welsh Marches and Scotland for only a short period during the early 13th century.|$|E
