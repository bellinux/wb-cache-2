5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E

Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the surviving half was kept in the original Norman (with Gothic features), thus demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Josef Müller {{took over}} as CEO in 1950. A {{decision}} was taken to undertake more international projects, following a period of essentially domestic work after World War II. This included a series of power infrastructure works in Turkey and bridge and smelting works construction in Egypt during the early 1950s. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that many projects from this period were undertaken outside of the First World;many were funded from development aid budgets.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E

5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson Seamount had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to {{biologists}} for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the seamount. The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E
5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that Othelake was no longer enjoying the office by 1420. By this time, John Kitley had been {{appointed}} to the post, though the exact date of his appointment is unknown. He was appointed by King Henry V of England on the insistence of the Earl of Ormonde. There {{is no evidence to}} suggest that Kitley had any connection to Ireland, or even that he visited it, but his connection to Earl of Ormonde <b>is</b> <b>interesting.</b> Kitley was succeeded by Thomas Collyer, who had previously served as Clarenceux King of Arms and Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary. Nothing is known of his career as Ireland, and he was succeeded by Thomas Ashwell.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Robertson's stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79–9 overall record {{during his}} three varsity seasons, {{including}} two Final Four appearances. However, a championship eluded Robertson, {{something that would}} become a repeated occurrence in his professional career. When Robertson left college he was the all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> to note that Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university's greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961, 1962, and just missed a third title in 1963.|$|E

5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike {{in the rest of the}} Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> because 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an ounce.|$|E
5|$|The species {{used for}} the hull planks was not {{positively}} identified but {{is thought to be}} Amoora of the Meliaceae family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
