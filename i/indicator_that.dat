5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible <b>indicator</b> <b>that</b> both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an <b>indicator</b> <b>that</b> there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an <b>indicator</b> <b>that</b> some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E

5|$|The graptolites are colonial organic walled fossils {{which also}} {{occurred}} from the Ordovician to the Devonian; {{only part of}} their life cycle is known {{and it is not}} clear how they reproduced. It has been suggested that the Chitinozoa may represent the pre-sicula stages of graptolites - the period between the colony's sexual reproduction, and the formation of a new colony. This hypothesis appears to be supported by the co-occurrence of graptolite and chitinozoan fossils, whose abundances appear to mirror one another. The similar chemical composition of the fossils has been seized by both sides of the argument. Proponents suggest that the use of the same chemical framework is an <b>indicator</b> <b>that</b> the two may be related. However, this factor means that situations favouring the preservation of one will also tend to preserve the other - and the preparation techniques used to extract the fossils will also favour or disfavour the two groups equally. Therefore, the apparent co-occurrence of the two fossils may merely be an artifact of their similar composition. The hypothesis struggles to explain the continuing abundance of chitinozoans after the middle Devonian, when graptolites became increasingly rare.|$|E

25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from {{aircraft and spacecraft}} using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a moving target <b>indicator</b> <b>that</b> subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.|$|E

25|$|In older locomotives, it was {{necessary}} for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control.

Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.|$|E
