40|$|NOTE: Due to {{a number}} of reasons we have {{abandoned}} the pursuit of handling this within the filesystem layer. Instead, we’ve decided to adapt Linux’s MD software RAID implementation to include checksums and to reuse the techniques previously developed in [2] in order to speed up recovery of the RAID to a consistent state following a crash. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. The implementation of this method is far less intrusive. In the fs layer we would have had to fight with the entire fs layout, page cache, behavior, block allocation logic, etc. 2. Our journalling protocol didn’t really make use {{of the fact that we}} had <b>journalled</b> full checksum/parity blocks upon crash recovery. Rather, all it did was use their locations to figure out where it should recalculate the checksums/parity. This is effectively the same scheme as that presented in [2]. 3. Without being aware of it from top to bottom the filesystem can’t really do anything interesting to recovery from the fact that checksums don’t match anyways. RAID on the other hand can use this data to rebuild a stripe similar to ZFS...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an autoethnographic reflection, rooted in Action Research {{based on my}} {{teaching}} experience in a multicultural high school environment in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. It is an analysis, in particular, of teaching play texts in two classes, Dramatic Arts and English Home Language, at matric level. A combination of discourse analysis and autoethnography formed the theoretical basis for the interpretation of data drawn from lesson transcripts, group interviews, learners’ reflections and my own <b>journalled</b> reflections. This analysis has formed {{the foundation for a}} deeper reflection on culture, the colonist within, and the colonialism embedded with in my teaching, and in the education system more broadly. At a practical level, I suggest embracing student-led and co-led discussions of literature, as advocated by Mayer (2012), as well as transcultural readings (Keating, 2007), and Drama activities, as ideals in the teaching of play texts. These techniques are designed to encourage learners to develop intellectual authority as well as allowing them the space to enter discussions around culturally sensitive topics, while minimising the teacher’s hierarchical, dominant position. I also argue for the importance of making culture an overt topic of conversation. White English-speaking South African culture, in particular has been prone to “invisibility” and, through this, an unspoken normative position, particularly in multicultural school environments. I challenge myself and others to engage in ongoing efforts to articulate our particular perception of our cultures, dynamic and diverse though they may be...|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} attachment mechanism adapted for interfacing with the manipulator arm (11) of a remote manipulator system and comprising {{a pair of}} permanent magnets (31, 32) of rare earth material which are arranged in a stator-rotor relationship. The rotor magnet (32), is <b>journalled</b> for rotation about its longitudinal axis between pole plates (35, 36) of the stator magnet (31), each of which includes an adhering surface (35 a, 36 a). In a first rotary position corresponding to the ON condition, each of the poles of the rotor magnet (32) is closely adjacent a stator magnet pole plate of like polarity whereby the respective magnet fields are additive for producing a strong magnetic field emanating from the adhering surfaces (35 a, 36 a) for attracting a ferrous magnetic plate 20, or the like, affixed to the payload (20 or 50). When the rotor magnet (32) is rotated to a second position corresponding to the OFF condition, each of the poles of the rotor magnet (31) is disposed closely adjacent a pole plate of unlike polarity whereby the magnetic fields of the magnets are in cancelling relationship at the adhering surfaces (35 a, 36 a) which permits {{the release of a}} payload.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to explore the extent to which somatics are being taught in a New Zealand {{mainstream}} school. Integrated awareness of self and the environment are somatic tools used in tertiary education for dance students to learn about creative processes of choreography and performance and for injury prevention and management. Somatic practices fit well with the current New Zealand arts curriculum dance strand achievement objectives. This qualitative exploratory case study explores the responses of thirty late-primary students and their teacher to the experience of somatic awareness activities. I have drawn a theoretical basis from three disciplines: somatics, arts education priorities and educational theory. Merriam and Caffarella’s (1999) postmodern approach accommodates the basis for the study’s design, which is at once subjective and propositional. To this end, the data collection phases posit research participants as interpreters or performers in the construction of a somatic experience at school (Berger & Luckmann, 1991). Multiple data collection methods were used: a student questionnaire, observation of a dance rehearsal and implementation of a somatic session that was concurrently videotaped and <b>journalled</b> by the students. A subsequent focus group of seven self-selected students and teacher interview completed the data collection process. Throughout the data collection phases my reflections were recorded in a somatic journal. By incorporating somatics and dance performance knowledge across the theoretical framework and data collection methods, similarities between awareness practices and students adapting to learning in a mainstream education setting emerge. I argue that dance education may not progress learning conditions for students through an “all children can participate” emphasis (Hong, 2000) and that dance performance as an outcome may miss the links between learning efficacy and the experiential applications of dance. The students and teacher responded positively to the somatics activities, reporting main themes that connect postural awareness as a useful learning capabilities tool. The proposed somatics applications could be incorporated within the New Zealand curriculum framework alongside dance. Further research will involve studying different schools with less dance integration, as well as repeating the study over several years at the same school...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{critical}} learning experience were <b>journalled</b> by 218 students in a bachelor of nursing program from 1993 to 1999. The learning experience in their final year of study was a simulation laced with political and personal challenges to mimic pressures found in contemporary health industry environments where nurses practice. Conceived through a framework of developmental theory and processes, this teaching and learning approach endorses attributes of courage, daring and strategic action {{as part of the}} nursing role. Students were able to experience the {{effects of a}} competitive, professional environment where principles of community development were incorporated into the content, learning and assessment methods to promote development of an image of themselves as competent, professional people. The result is a cohort of graduate nurses who have emerged from their studies aware of political, bureaucratic and personal factors that establish and preserve credible leaders in the health system. Most who experienced the simulation claim to have gained sufficient self-confidence to have input into decisions that affect their personal and professional goals. Incorporating such a large amount of data required an analytical approach consisting of multiple levels of configuring and re-configuring the narrative contained in student journals. An initial macro analysis of all data was achieved through conceptual mapping that traced the various pathways students took as they moved through individual learning challenges. Further macro analysis involved clustering journal data into major themes and, from there, particular themes elucidated the effects of the learning experience. Further analysis focused on understanding how students perceived the bureaucratic, political and personal aspects of leadership experiences leading to the formation of particular positions about learning, leadership and group work. At the micro level, certain students 2 ̆ 7 journals were more closely examined in terms of values and emotions experienced in the simulation and to ensure that a range of voices are heard, including my own reflective and reflexive contribution to the learning and research process, regarding the value of the learning experience. Analysis of the student journals reveals that leadership can be learned at the undergraduate level in a way that can have a personally transforming effect. These undergraduate students of nursing learned many political, bureaucratic and personal skills that will equip them to become competent leaders as well as proficient clinicians, within the health system...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} I question the cultural oppression {{that works to}} suppress women's creativity and play and investigate ways of assisting the rebirth of women's culture. Dominant discourse and language are masculinist and exclude women from defining our own reality. This is evident in social policies and social work practice which both adopt and perpetuate masculinist encoding of, and inscription on, women's experiences and expressions. The purpose of {{this research}} was to learn from the perspectives of women who are single mothers, if they were able to express their experiences more authentically in their own ways, outside and tangential to dominant (masculinist) language and discourse. In Australia women have resisted and challenged masculinist narratives on their lives through the arts. Creativity and play remain vital to women's health and well-being, however, they are often precluded from single mothers' lives due to the primacy of women's caring responsibilities. These women's access to opportunities for timeout, community participation and play, particularly in rural and regional Australia, has so far received a paucity of research. Two thematic research questions guided this study: Can women express ourselves more authentically through art? And can social work assist the expression of a women's community culture? The qualitative methodology I played with drew from my radical feminist perspective. I used participatory observation {{in the first part of}} the research, which involved my experiential participation in community groups and more formal classes that drew from a range of artforms. This first part of this research informed the second part of the research which involved the participation of single mothers in a series of creative Playspaces (workshops) I facilitated. This emergent Feminist Community Cultural Research strategy I designed was based on participative strategies and a grounded theory approach drawing from a range of artforms. This methodology was inspired by a search for women's dances, songs, music, play and creativity as individual and collective self-expressions. The data collected through the Playspaces was <b>journalled,</b> video- and tape-recorded and the women who participated reviewed my initial drafts. In the first part of the research I found women's (cultural) expressions were often inhibited by masculinist structures and processes and this appeared to undermine women's community at times. The politics of the groups were rarely informed by social justice values, feminist values or groupwork skills, and served to actively dissuade and suppress women's community culture, although glimpses of women's community culture persisted, affirming its existence outside dominant culture. In the second part of the research I found that community and women's centre co-ordinators often acted as gatekeepers to single mothers' opportunities for women's community culture. My analysis of my own groupwork in the Playspace revealed issues of politics and ethics, particularly accountability, recurred. Facilitation is a balancing act between support for individuals and the group, as well as support for an ideal of women's community culture with the reality of differences between women. Women's leadership surfaced as a mother theme. Two themes embedded in the core of three concentric layers of meaning emerged. The themes are co-creation and embodied expressions, and individual pursuit and collective connectedness. The layers are women's play and (p) leisure, rekin(dl) ing women's kinship and an essence of spirituality, soulspace. The Playspaces were a portal to an/other experience, a soul space for women's expressions, where new understandings of old cultural ways open possibilities within social work. My research demonstrates that there are more liberating and authentic ways through which social workers can communicate with women and assist women in communicating with each other. Implications for social work, groupwork, social policy and feminism are raised. Practice recommendations are made to address masculinist obstructions to the facilitation of women's community cultural expressions...|$|E
