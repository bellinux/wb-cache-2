5|$|Lafayette spoke {{publicly}} {{for the last}} time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies on 3 January 1834. The next month, he collapsed at a funeral from pneumonia. Although he recovered, the following May was wet and, after being caught in a thunderstorm, he became bedridden.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is {{responsible}} for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.|$|E

5|$|Kogălniceanu's {{term was}} {{confirmed}} by the 1869 election, after which {{he was able to}} persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without expressing his consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu's main supporters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber.</b> Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E

5|$|The Conservative Party {{had split}} down the middle: {{on one side}} were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the {{moderate}} conservatives who supported the Conciliation. The ultraconservatives were led by Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and Paulino Soares de Sousa, 1stViscount of Uruguai—all former ministers in the 1848–1853 cabinet. These elder statesmen had taken control of the Conservative Party after Paraná's death. In the years following 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|The Peronist party, proscribed since 1955, {{was allowed}} {{to run for the}} 1973 elections. The Peronist party won the elections, and Héctor Cámpora became president.

5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though {{an equal number of}} seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster a majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E
5|$|After {{complaining}} of headaches and suffering slurred speech beginning in early 1943, McNary {{went to the}} Bethesda, Maryland, Naval Hospital on November 8, 1943, where doctors diagnosed a malignant brain tumor.

He and his family departed for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to spend the winter. He partly recovered from the surgery, but by February 24, 1944, when he was re-elected as Republican Senate leader, he was comatose. Charles L. McNary died in Fort Lauderdale, and he was buried in Belcrest Memorial Cemetery in Salem.

Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including anything in orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E
