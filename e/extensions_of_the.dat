5|$|Black Rock, Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory {{mountain}} range are each <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oquirrh Mountain Range, which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stansbury {{mountain range}}, and Strongs Knob {{is an extension}} of the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake's western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about 35 feet (10.7 meters) deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, {{and some of the other}} islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding {{a transparent}} ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero {{to advance to the}} next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main single-player game.|$|E
5|$|<b>Extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{are generally}} also subsumed {{under the same}} name. For example, an α-β, γ-δ unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including homo-Nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous Nazarov cyclizations.|$|E

5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} {{relies on}} the law of mass action, which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; {{modifications}} include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede {{more difficult for}} predators to swallow.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} pterosaurs {{featured}} elaborate crests. The first and {{perhaps best known}} {{of these is the}} distinctive backward-pointing crest of some Pteranodon species, though a few pterosaurs, such as the tapejarids and Nyctosaurus, sported extremely large crests that often incorporated keratinous or other soft tissue <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bony crest base.|$|E
25|$|An <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Market–Frankford Line from Frankford to Roosevelt Boulevard and Bustleton Avenue {{has been}} {{proposed}} in conjunction with an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Broad Street Subway.|$|R
50|$|It can {{be tested}} by placing the child in quadruped {{position}} {{on the floor and}} passively flexing the head forward and then extend it backwards. The expected response would be forward head flexion producing flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper extremities and <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower extremities while <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head will produce <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper extremities and flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower extremities.|$|R
50|$|Other {{projects}} {{under consideration}} include an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S1 from Rödermark-Ober-Roden to Dieburg, an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S7 from Riedstadt-Goddelau to Biblis, and a branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S7 to Groß-Gerau.|$|R
5|$|Stanley also planned <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} Underground Group's lines into new, undeveloped districts {{beyond the}} central area {{to encourage the}} development of new suburbs and new commuter traffic. The first of the extensions, the Bakerloo line to Queen's Park and Watford Junction, opened between 1915 and 1917. The other expansion plans were postponed during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{family of}} topological orderings of a DAG {{is the same}} as the family of linear <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reachability}} relation for the DAG, so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C17α alkyl chain {{longer than}} an ethyl group abolishes {{androgenic}} activity and converts the drug into an antiandrogen, as in topterone (17α-propyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (17α-allyl-3-deketo-19-nortestosterone) (an extended-chain variant of ethylestrenol). Conversely, replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C17α alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces {{but does not}} abolish androgenic activity, as in ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). Similarly to <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C17α alkyl chain, <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C17α ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity, as with dimethisterone (6α,21-dimethylethisterone). Dienogest, which is antiandrogenic, features <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C17α chain in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position.|$|R
25|$|Provision {{has been}} made for <b>the</b> planned <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berlin city ring road (A100), with a section of tunnel built under <b>the</b> tracks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stadtbahn {{completed}} in <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 2012.|$|R
50|$|In 1746 St Helens, {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four townships (and their collieries) beyond Prescot, {{was referred}} to in a statement in Parliament related to <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.|$|R
5|$|The polyps are {{connected}} by horizontal sheets of tissue known as coenosarc extending over the outer {{surface of the}} skeleton and completely covering it. These sheets are continuous with the body wall of the polyps, and include <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gastrovascular cavity, so that food and water can circulate between all the different members of the colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{material in}} total, {{and in particular}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called Lex de imperio Vespasiani shows {{that the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pomerium and <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire is far from being clear. This matter seems to have been obscure even for <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> that. This invites a reconsideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pomerium by Augustus, an interpretation which has been generally discounted over the past few years...|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 10 December 1933 with <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line from Richelieu - Drouot. It was <b>the</b> eastern {{terminus}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line until <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line to Mairie de Montreuil on 14 October 1937.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} building was renovated in 2014/15 {{to cope with}} growing passenger demand and increased use by larger aircraft types. The redevelopment included an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apron along with new check-in, baggage clam facilities and <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> departure lounge.|$|R
5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority {{was given to the}} completion of the western and eastern <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E
5|$|Another feature {{introduced}} in Banjo-Tooie is the direct connections between its worlds. In Banjo-Kazooie the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in Banjo-Tooie the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Isle o' Hags hub world. In addition, the train Chuffy {{can be used}} to migrate minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in customisable competitions.|$|E
5|$|Double Negative's {{work for}} Part 1 {{included}} the corroding Warner Brothers logo and extensive environment <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burrows and its surrounds. Additional environment work was completed on Xenophilius Lovegood's home, extending it in 3D and {{culminating in the}} Death Eaters' attack. Double Negative also advanced the Death Eaters' smoke effects, {{with the introduction of}} the 'flayed man' stage in between their smokey, fluid, flying state and their live-action presence upon landing. Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts the wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic.|$|E
5000|$|Bromley {{is one of}} {{only six}} London Boroughs not to have at least one London Underground station within its boundaries. However, the borough has many railway {{stations}} served by London Overground, Thameslink, Southeastern and Southern. The borough also has several stops on the London Tramlink network. It was also reported that Boris Johnson plans to introduce either an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bakerloo Line to Hayes, in Bromley, passing through Beckenham Junction, or an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DLR to Bromley North. One last option is <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London Overground to Bromley North. The most likely is <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bakerloo Line, but would not be scheduled to begin till 2040, if accepted.|$|R
50|$|Below the baptismal altar in the church, {{there is}} a stone, dated 7 March 1901, AD, which marks <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, {{acknowledging}} <b>the</b> benevolence <b>of</b> Mr. Joseph David, this being <b>the</b> first recorded <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Germania plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazis did {{not provide}} for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stub line past Schöneweide. An {{underground}} <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> branch from Spindlersfeld to a station in Köpenick was, however, mentioned, but the proposal never progressed beyond the planning stage.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side <b>extensions,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow <b>extensions)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantle {{penetrate}} {{through the}} mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, the British built Fort Verdala and St. Clement's Retrenchment in the Cottonera area, while Lascaris Battery {{was built}} in Valletta. Later on in the 19th century, parts of the Cottonera Lines, Santa Margherita Lines and the fortifications of Senglea were {{demolished}} {{to make way for}} <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malta Dockyard. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the British built barracks {{in various parts of the}} island, such as Tigné Point and Pembroke.|$|E
50|$|This bill {{prevents}} several {{tax provisions}} from sunsetting {{in the near}} future. The two most notable pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill are <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends and <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternative minimum tax (AMT) tax reduction.|$|R
50|$|Frege {{argues that}} numbers are objects and assert {{something}} about a concept. Frege defines numbers as <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> concepts. 'The number of F's' is defined as <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept G {{is a concept that}} is equinumerous to F. The concept in question leads to an equivalence class of all concepts that have <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> F (including F). Frege defines 0 as <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept being non self-identical. So, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> this concept is <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> all concepts that have no objects falling under them.|$|R
50|$|Extension to Murrhardt: Studies have {{identified}} the potential for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-Bahn to Murrhardt. Given that most passengers are headed toward Backnang, Waiblingen, and Stuttgart, an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S3 is more favorable. At present, discussions are underway regarding financing.|$|R
