40|$|The species {{composition}} of vegetation {{associated with the}} Carpathian fens primarily depends {{on the type of}} water present and the hydrological feeding of the soils that occur there. These, in turn, shape the fertility of the fens. Those with typically formed Carici-Agrostietum caninae and Valeriano-Caricetum flavae fundamentally differ in the properties of their soils and feeding waters. These include differences in mineral content, pH, CaCO 3 levels, degree of peat decomposition, electrical conductivity and oxygenation of the waters that feed the fens. Carici-Agrostietum caninae is a homogenous plant association adapted to extreme habitat conditions. It is characterized by a very narrow range of essential soil and feeding water parameters. Valeriano-Caricetum flavae is a highly diverse association. Considerable diversity both in terms of plant species and vegetation structure reflects very wide ranges in the properties of soil and feeding water. Vegetation patches of transitory character were also identified. These contained plant species characteristic of both associations. The character of the vegetation depends mainly on fen soil pH and the degree of mineralization of the feeding waters. It is only these parameters that allow intermediate patches to be clearly distinguished. The degree of peat <b>decomposition,</b> <b>mineral</b> content and water oxygenation all differ for Carici-Agrostietum caninae and Valeriano-Caricetum flavae, whereas the values for intermediate patches display a range of parameters typical of both investigated associations. Consequently, vegetation present in these patches reflects {{to a greater or lesser}} extent one of the two analyzed plant associations. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} processes which occur during an earthquake exhibit several coupled phenomena as large variations of stress, pore pressure and temperature {{take place in}} the slip zone. Thermo-poro-mechanical couplings due to shear heating can be associated to phase transition such as vaporization of the pore fluid, melting of fault gouge and to chemical effects such as dehydration of minerals or decarbonation of calcite. Different competing effects may influence dynamic slip and affect the weakening of the shear stress.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that strain {{localization}} during seismic slip occurs {{as the result of a}} plastic instability. A key parameter in the analysis of dynamic slip and weakening of the shear stress is the actual thickness of the zone of localized deformation. In the first part of this chapter, we analyse the stability of undrained adiabatic shearing of a saturated rock layer. This corresponds to the situation when the slip event is sufficiently rapid and the shear zone broad enough to effectively preclude heat or fluid transfer as in the case of an earthquake or a landslide. The kinetics of the fault gouge inside the sheared rock layer is described by a Cosserat continuum, and we incorporate the effect of shear heating due to the dissipation of the frictional work. It is shown that shear heating has a destabilizing effect and that instability can occur in the hardening regime of the stress-strain curve if the amount of dilatant strengthening is not sufficient as compared to the effect of thermal pressurization of the pore fluid. It is shown that the linear stability analysis with macro and micro-inertia terms leads to the selection of a preferred wavelength of the instability mode corresponding to the instability mode with fastest (but finite) growth coefficient. The selected wavelength is compatible with observed shear-band thickness in fault zones.

30|$|Determination of {{the peak}} {{temperature}} during slip {{is crucial to}} identify the faulting mechanism during an earthquake, because thermal pressurization (as well as melt lubrication) is promoted by frictional heating on the fault. Comprehensive mineralogical, geochemical, and magnetic analyses of Hole B core samples have been performed, and some temperature information during the Chi-Chi earthquake has been obtained. Ikehara et al. (2007) reported that the inorganic carbon content of the fault gouge was low, and attributed the low value to thermal <b>decomposition</b> of carbonate <b>minerals.</b> A chemical kinetic evaluation based on the Arrhenius equation of the thermal decomposition reaction induced by earthquake slip estimated the temperature reached in response to frictional heating during the Chi-Chi earthquake to be 868 °C (Hirono et al. 2007 b). Marked geochemical anomalies of fluid-mobile trace-element concentrations (Sr, Cs, Rb, and Li) and of Sr isotope ratios in the fault gouge indicated that a high-temperature fluid at ≥ 350 °C was present during the earthquake (Ishikawa et al. 2008). High magnetic susceptibility was also detected in the fault gouge by a nondestructive Multi-Sensor Core Logger (Hirono et al. 2006, 2007 a), and thermomagnetic analyses showed that thermal <b>decomposition</b> of paramagnetic <b>minerals</b> caused magnetite formation at high temperature (≥ 400 °C) (Mishima et al. 2009).|$|R

A heating rate of 4 °C/min from room temperature to 900 °C was employed. Evolution of hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, nitrogen-, sulfur- and oxygen-containing compounds was monitored by MS or MS/MS detection. Evolution of volatile organic compounds occurred in two regimes: 1) low_temperature (maximum evolution at 150 to 175 °C) f corresponding to entrained organics, and 2) high temperature (maximum evolution at 440 to 460 °C), corresponding to cracking of large organic components. The pyrolysis yields were dominated by the evolution of light hydrocarbons. Alkanes and alkenes of two carbons and higher had temperatures of maximum evolution at approximately 440 °C, and methane at approximately 474 °C. Aromatic hydrocarbons had temperatures of maximum evolution slightly higher, at approximately 450 °C. Comparing the Sunnyside pyrolysis to the pyrolysis of other domestic tar sands indicated the following for hydrocarbon evolution: 1) the evolution of entrained organics relative to the total evolution was much less for Sunnyside tar sand, 2) the temperatures of maximum evolution of hydrocarbons due to cracking reactions were at slightly lower, and 3) the temperatures of maximum evolution for benzene and toluene are slightly higher than observed for other tar sands. In general, the noncondensible gases, H 2, CO, and CO 2, exhibited evolution associated with hydrocarbon cracking reactions, and high temperature evolution associated with <b>mineral</b> <b>decomposition,</b> the water-gas shift reaction, and gasification reactions.

50|$|Decomposition {{rates are}} low under very wet or very dry {{conditions}}. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils {{tend to become}} deficient in oxygen (this {{is especially true in}} wetlands), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth. When the rains return and soils become wet, the osmotic gradient between the bacterial cells and the soil water causes the cells to gain water quickly. Under these conditions, many bacterial cells burst, releasing a pulse of nutrients. Decomposition rates also tend to be slower in acidic soils. Soils which are rich in clay minerals tend to have lower decomposition rates, and thus, higher levels of organic matter. The smaller particles of clay result in a larger surface area that can hold water. The higher the water content of a soil, the lower the oxygen content and consequently, the lower the rate of <b>decomposition.</b> Clay <b>minerals</b> also bind particles of organic material to their surface, making them less accessibly to microbes. Soil disturbance like tilling increase decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes.|$|R

Thermogravimetry reveals seven mass loss steps at 52, 135, 174, 237, 265, 590 and ~ 780 degrees Celsius. MS shows that the first two mass loss steps are due to dehydration, the next two to dehydroxylation, the mass loss step at 265 degrees Celsius to combined dehydroxylation and decarbonation. The two higher mass loss steps are attributed to decarbonation. Raman spectra of the hydroxyl stretching region over the 25 to 200 degrees Celsius temperature range, enable identification of bands attributed to water stretching vibrations, MOH stretching modes and strongly hydrogen bonded CO 32 - -water bands.
