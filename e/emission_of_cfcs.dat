40|$|Actions taken {{under the}} Montreal Protocol {{have led to}} {{decreases}} in the atmospheric abundance of controlledozone-depleting substances (ODSs), and are enabling {{the return of the}} ozone layer toward 1980 levels. • The sum of the measured tropospheric abundances of substances controlled under the MontrealProtocol continues to decrease. Most of the major controlled ODSs are decreasing largely as projected, andhydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and halon- 1301 are still increasing. Unknown or unreported sources of carbontetrachloride are needed to explain its abundance. • Measured stratospheric abundances of chlorine- and bromine-containing substances originating from thedegradation of ODSs are decreasing. By 2012, combined chlorine and bromine levels (as estimated by EquivalentEffective Stratospheric Chlorine, EESC) had declined by about 10 – 15 % from the peak values of ten to fifteen years ago. Decreases in atmospheric abundances of methyl chloroform (CH 3 CCl 3), methyl bromide (CH 3 Br), and chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs) contributed approximately equally to these reductions. • Total column ozone declined over most of the globe during the 1980 s and early 1990 s (by about 2. 5 % averagedover 60 °S to 60 °N). It has remained relatively unchanged since 2000, with indications of a small increase in totalcolumn ozone in recent years, as expected. In the upper stratosphere there is a clear recent ozone increase, whichclimate models suggest can be explained by comparable contributions from declining ODS abundances and upperstratospheric cooling caused by carbon dioxide increases. • The Antarctic ozone hole continues to occur each spring, as expected for the current ODS abundances. The Arcticstratosphere in winter/spring 2011 was particularly cold, which led to large ozone depletion as expected under theseconditions. • Total column ozone will recover toward the 1980 benchmark levels over most of the globe under full compliancewith the Montreal Protocol. This recovery is expected to occur before midcentury in midlatitudes and the Arctic, andsomewhat later for the Antarctic ozone hole. The Antarctic ozone hole has caused significant changes in Southern Hemispheresurface climate in the summer. • Antarctic lower stratospheric cooling due to ozone depletion is very likely the dominant cause of observedchanges in Southern Hemisphere tropospheric summertime circulation over recent decades, with associatedimpacts on surface temperature, precipitation, and the oceans. In the Northern Hemisphere, no robust link has beenfound between stratospheric ozone depletion and tropospheric climate. Changes in CO 2, N 2 O, and CH 4 will have an increasing influence on the ozone layer as ODSs decline. • As controlled ozone-depleting substances decline, the evolution of the ozone layer {{in the second half of}} the 21 st century will largely depend on the atmospheric abundances of CO 2, N 2 O, and CH 4. Overall, increasing carbondioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) elevate global ozone, while increasing nitrous oxide (N 2 O) further depletes globalozone. The Antarctic ozone hole is less sensitive to CO 2, N 2 O, and CH 4 abundances. • In the tropics, significant decreases in column ozone are projected during the 21 st century. Tropical ozone levelsare only weakly affected by ODS decline; they are sensitive to circulation changes driven by CO 2, N 2 O, and CH 4 increases. The climate benefits of the Montreal Protocol could be significantly offset by projectedemissions of HFCs used to replace ODSs. The Montreal Protocol and its Amendments and adjustments have made large contributions toward reducing global greenhouse gasemissions. In 2010, the decrease of annual ODS emissions under the Montreal Protocol is estimated to be about 10 gigatonnes of avoidedCO 2 -equivalent emissions per year, which is about five times larger than the annual emissions reduction target for the first commitmentperiod (2008 – 2012) of the Kyoto Protocol (from the Executive Summary of the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2010). 11 GWP-weighted emissions, also known as CO 2 -equivalent emissions, are defined as the amount of gas emitted multiplied by its 100 -year Global WarmingPotential (GWP). Part of the effect of ODSs as greenhouse gases is offset by the cooling due to changes in ozone. Executive SummaryES- 2 • The sum of the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) currently used as ODS replacements makes a small contribution of about 0. 5 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent emissions per year. These emissions are currently growing at a rate of about 7 % per year andare projected to continue to grow. • If the current mix of these substances is unchanged, increasing demand could result in HFC emissions of up to 8. 8 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent per year by 2050, nearly as high as the peak <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>CFCs</b> of about 9. 5 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent per year in the late 1980 s. 2 • Replacements of the current mix of high-Global Warming Potential (GWP) HFCs with low-GWP compounds or not-inkindtechnologies would essentially avoid these CO 2 -equivalent emissions. • Some of these candidate low-GWP compounds are hydrofluoro-olefins (HFOs), one of which (HFO- 1234 yf) yields thepersistent degradation product trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) upon atmospheric oxidation. While the environmental effectsof TFA are considered to be negligible over the next few decades, potential longer-term impacts could require futureevaluations due to the environmental persistence of TFA and uncertainty in future uses of HFOs. • By 2050, HFC banks are estimated to grow to as much as 65 gigatonnes CO 2 -equivalent. The climate change impact ofthe HFC banks could be reduced by limiting future use of high-GWP HFCs to avoid the accumulation of the bank, or bydestruction of the banks. Additional important issues relevant to the Parties to the Montreal Protocol and otherdecision-makers have been assessed. • Derived emissions of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), based on its estimated lifetime and its accurately measured atmosphericabundances, have become much larger than those from reported production and usage over the last decade. • As of 2009, the controlled consumption of methyl bromide declined below the reported consumption for quarantineand pre-shipment (QPS) uses, which are not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. • Increased anthropogenic emissions of very short-lived substances (VSLS) containing chlorine and bromine, particularlyfrom tropical sources, are an emerging issue for stratospheric ozone. The relative contribution of these emissions couldbecome important as levels of ODSs controlled under the Montreal Protocol decline. • As the atmospheric abundances of ODSs continue to decrease over the coming decades, N 2 O, as the primary source ofnitrogen oxides in the stratosphere, will become more important in future ozone depletion. • Emissions of HFC- 23, a by-product of HCFC- 22 production, have continued despite mitigation efforts. • While ODS levels remain high, a large stratospheric sulfuric aerosol enhancement due to a major volcanic eruption orgeoengineering activities would result in a substantial chemical depletion of ozone over much of the globe. While past actions taken under the Montreal Protocol have substantially reduced ODS production andconsumption, additional, but limited, options are available to reduce future ozone depletion. Emissions from the current banks are projected to contribute more to future ozone depletion than those caused by future ODS production,assuming compliance with the Protocol. • Possible options to advance the return of the ozone layerto the 1980 level (analyses based on midlatitude EESC) areshown graphically. The cumulative effect of eliminationof emissions from all banks and production advances thisreturn by 11 years. Scientific Steering Committee : Ayité-Lô Nohende AjavonDavid J. KarolyMalcolm K.

40|$|Both {{the ground}} based and {{satellite}} observation data bases have been extended since the previous international ozone assessment. There are several satellite systems in operation that provide total ozone data, {{which have been}} extensively compared with ground based data. One problem with the satellite observations is that the widely used satellite date from the TOMS instrument on the NIMBUS 7 satellite have not been available {{since the beginning of}} May 1993 due to satellite failure. A new TOMS instrument was launched on a Russian spacecraft in August 1991 and have been in continuous operation since then. Although this gives continuous TOMS observations, there are still questions about how good the trend estimates after May 1993 are using the new TOMS data. We should also bear in mind that, although, we have extended data sets by including the last years of observations, the deduced trends are strongly affected by the low values of total ozone obtained during 1992 and 1993, and there are uncertainties how representative these low values are in connection with long term ozone depletion studies. Ozone research has to a large extent focused on ozone reductions at high northern latitudes during the last three to four years. Of particular interest has been the low ozone column densities observed at high and middle northern latitudes during the winters of 1992 and 1993. A natural question which has been raised is weather or not we here see a result of enhanced chlorine and bromine levels which in combination special atmospheric conditions lead to enhanced ozone depletion. The June 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo lead to high particle concentrations in the lower stratosphere the following two years, in addition the extreme low temperatures at high northern latitudes during the winter of 1993 resulted in Polar Stratospheric Cloud (PSC) formation that was substantial higher than during a "normal year". Both these conditions led to more efficient ozone loss than we have experienced in previous rears, and in 1994. Several of the source gases of importance for the ozone depletion problem have shown reduced growth rate during the beginning of the 1990 s. These changes in observed growth rate are difficult to explain for most gases. For the CFCS, however, it seems that reduced growth is a result of reduced emissions Which is {{as a result of the}} control measures that have been implemented to protect the ozone layer. A further consequence of this is that we within the next few years can expect stratosphere inorganic chlorine levels to peak, Thereafter a gradual decrease will occur over the next century. This shows that the Montreal agreement has been a success, Which has led to substantial reductions in the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>CFCS.</b> Another consequence of the Montreal agreement is a significant increase in the HCFCs over the last couple of years. However, the absolute levels of the newly introduced HCFCS, like HCFC- 141 b and HCFC- 142 b, are very low. The significant reduction in the growth rate in other source gases like CH 4, N 2 O and CO 2 during the beginning of the 1990 s is somewhat puzzling, as there are no good explanation why this has occurred. There are, however, indications that for some gases (e. g. CHJ the reduced growth rate could be partly due to the large column ozone reductions. Methyl bromide and its potential role in the ozone depleting process have drawn increased attention since the previous ozone assessment. One of the largest uncertainties in the estimates of future man made impact on the ozone layer is connected to limited understanding of the role of methyl bromide. Methyl bromide is the main contributor to reactive bromine (BrO and Br) in the stratosphere. Measurements show that its concentration in the troposphere is about 10 to 15 pptv. Important uncertainties are connected to how large the man made contribution is to its sources, and to its tropospheric lifetime. Emissions occur both from anthropogenic and biogenic sources. An important antropogenic source is from the use of pesticides which showed marked increase during the 1980 s. Other anthropogenic sources are biomass burning and automobile emissions. Large oceanic emissions have been suggested. The main sink is believed to be atmospheric oxidation by OH, but there may also be important oceanic sinks. The overall lifetime is in the range 1 to 2 years (loss through OH alone gives a lifetime of approximately 1. 7 years). There have also been made advances in modelling of ozone and ozone chances in the stratosphere. The estimates of ozone distribution and ozone changes rely heavily on 2 -D model calculations. These model studies do now include the impact of heterogeneous processes occurring on aerosol particles and to some ex-tent on PSCS. New laboratory studies have given us a better basis for estimating the impact of heterogeneous processes, and it is clear that heterogeneous chemistry in the lower stratosphere are the main cause of total ozone loss which take place as a result of enhanced ozone loss from chlorine and bromine species. Model calculations indicate that probably 2 / 3 or more of ozone depletion by chlorine and bromine compounds occur in the lower stratosphere as a consequence of heterogeneous reactions on particles. Inclusion of heterogeneous chemistry in the atmospheric models have made bromine reactions more important for the ozone depleting process. As a global average one bromine atom is estimated to be approximately 40 more efficient in destroying ozone than one chlorine atom. Approximately 20 0 f the ozone destruction in the present day stratosphere is estimated to be due to chemical reactions involving BrO. Estimates of Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPS) are in agreements with previous estimates, although more emphasis is given to the short-lived compounds (HCFCS, methyl bromide). Such compounds have transient ODPS, over limited time horizons (20 to 100 years) which can be much larger than the long term steady state ODP. A typical example is the ODP for methyl bromide which has a long term ODP value of 0. 71, while the value over a time horizon of 20 years is 2. 3. Increasing attention is given to the possible interaction between the ozone and the climate issues through chemical changes initiated by ozone changes in the atmosphere which affect climate gases (including ozone itself). This issue has been treated in the ozone assessment in close collaboration with the treatment of indirect chemical effects in the ongoing IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change) assessment of climate change (IPCC, 1994). Although this is a controversial issue, where the uncertainties are large in the estimates, it is nevertheless clear that chemical changes involving ozone will be of importance for estimates of GWPs (Global Warming Potentials) for important greenhouse gases like CH 4 and the CFCS. The indirect effect of CFC, through ozone reductions in the stratosphere, seems to give a negative effect which is as large as the direct effect but with opposite sign. New model studies of the impact of a projected future fleet of supersonic transport on ozone through the emission of NOx show that it is probably small. This is a result of strong coupling between the nitrogen and chlorine compounds where reduced efficiency of chlorine reactions compensate for enhanced ozone loss through increased nitrogen oxides. New observations of UV-B fluxes in the polar regions confirm observations that were referred to in the previous international ozone assessment that the observed ozone reductions during the last years have led to significant increases in harmful UV-B radiation during the periods of low ozone values. Model studies indicate that the increases in tropospheric UV-B radiation during the last years with low column densities significantly have affected tropospheric chemical processes involving key gases like ozone and OH...|$|E

The enhanced ozone loss which has occurred since 1991 coincides with enhanced particle formation in the stratosphere from the Mt.

Ozone has increased during the last two decades in the northern free troposphere, although there seem to have been a levelling off in the increase since the mid 80 s. Enhanced <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> NOx, CO and hydrocarbons are the main cause for the ozone growth. Tropospheric ozone is also affected by the enhanced UV fluxes caused by reductions in stratospheric ozone.

40|$|As most {{everyone}} has heard, atmospheric ozone protects life on Earth from the harmful ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun. <b>Emission</b> <b>of</b> chlorofluorocarbons (<b>CFCs)</b> leads to depletion of this protective ozone layer. CFCs {{also contribute to}} global warming. The connection between CFCs, stratospheric ozone depletion, and the increased incidence of skin cancer is scientifically accepted. Halons, used mainly in fire extinguishers, may also deplete the ozone layer. CFCs are used in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, insulators, solvents, and foams. CFC- 12 is used mostly in automobile air conditioners, window air conditioners, and refrigerators. Most residential and building air conditioning systems use less harmful HCFC- 22. Even if all CFCs were eliminated today, their effect on the ozone layer would not disappear until the year 2050 due to their long residence time. The 1987 Montreal Protocol designed to slow the depletion of atmospheric ozone initiated {{what has become a}} concerted effort to reduce widespread use <b>of</b> <b>CFCs</b> as refrigerants.

Due to enhanced greenhouse effects, the Earth's surface should warm up by several degrees. The amplitude and even the sign of future changes in the ozone column are difficult to predict as they are strongly scenario-dependent. An early detection system to prevent noticeable ozone changes as a result of increasing concentrations of source gases should thus be based on a continuous monitoring of the ozone amount in the upper stratosphere rather than on measurements of the ozone column only. Measurements of NOx, Clx, and HOx are also required for unambiguous trend detection and interpretation...|$|R

40|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} will {{continue}} to be observed in the next 35 - 50 years, although the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> chlorofluorocarbons (<b>CFCs)</b> have gradually been phased out during the last two decades. In this paper, we suggest a geo-engineering approach that will remove substantial amounts of hydrogen chloride (HCl) from the lower stratosphere in fall, and hence limit the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole in late winter and early spring. HCl will be removed by ice from the atmosphere at temperatures higher than the threshold under which polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are formed if sufficiently large amounts of ice are supplied to produce water saturation. A detailed chemical-climate numerical model is used to assess the expected efficiency of the proposed geo-engineering method, and specifically to calculate the removal of HCl by ice particles. The size of ice particles appears to be a key parameter: larger particles (with a radius between 10 and 100 mu m) appear to be most efficient for removing HCl. Sensitivity studies lead to the conclusions that the ozone recovery is effective when ice particles are supplied during May and June in the latitude band ranging from 70 degrees S to 90 degrees S and in the altitude layer ranging from 10 to 26 km. It appears, therefore, that supplying ice particles to the Antarctic lower stratosphere could be effective in reducing the depth of the ozone hole. In addition, photodegradation <b>of</b> <b>CFCs</b> might be accelerated when ice is supplied due to enhanced vertical transport of this efficient greenhouse gas...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{discussion}} about global warming. Some say anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions caused the earth to warm. Others say there is no abnormality at all, that it is just natural warming. As you will see from the data presented and analyzed, a greater than normal warming did occur in recent times but no measurements confirm an increase in CO 2 emissions, whether anthropogenic or natural, had any effect on global temperatures. There is however, strong evidence that anthropogenic <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> chlorofluorocarbons (<b>CFCs)</b> were the major cause of the near recent abnormal warming. CFCs have created both unnatural atmospheric cooling and warming based on these facts: · CFCs destroyed ozone in the lower stratosphere/upper troposphere causing these zones in the atmosphere to cool 1. 37 oC from 1966 to 1998. This time span was selected to eliminate the effect of the natural solar irradiance (cooling-warming) cycle effect on the earth's temperature. · The loss of ozone allowed more UV light to pass through the stratosphere at a sufficient rate to warm the lower troposphere plus 10 " of the earth by 0. 48 oC (1966 to 1998). · Mass and energy balances show that the energy that was absorbed in the lower stratosphere/upper troposphere hit the lower troposphere/earth at a sustainable level of 1. 71 x 101...|$|R
40|$|The 1987 Montreal Protocol {{regulating}} <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> chlorofluorocarbons (<b>CFCs)</b> {{and other}} ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) was motivated {{primarily by the}} harm to human health and ecosystems arising from increased exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation associated with depletion of the ozone layer. It is now known that the Montreal Protocol has helped reduce radiative forcing of the climate system since CFCs are greenhouse gases (GHGs), and that ozone depletion (which {{is now on the}} verge of reversing) has been the dominant driver of atmospheric circulation changes in the Southern Hemisphere in the last half century. This paper demonstrates that the Montreal Protocol also significantly protects Earth’s hydroclimate. Using the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM 3), coupled to a simple mixed layer ocean, it is shown that in the “world avoided” (i. e., with CFC emissions not regulated), the subtropical dry zones would be substantially drier, and the middle- and high-latitude regions considerably wetter in the coming decade (2020 – 29) than in a world without ozone depletion. Surprisingly, these changes are very similar, in both pattern and magnitude, to those caused by projected increases in GHG concentrations over the same period. It is further shown that, by dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms, both the stratospheric ozone depletion and increased CFCs contribute to these changes. The results herein imply that, {{as a consequence of the}} Montreal Protocol, changes in the hydrological cycle in the coming decade will be only half as strong as what they otherwise would be...|$|R

The results revealed elevated regional mixing ratios for most halocarbons, especially for HClC = CCl 2 (trichloroethylene, TCE), CH 2 Cl 2 (dichloromethane, DCM), CH 3 Br (bromomethane), HCFC- 22, CHCl 3 (trichloromethane), CCl 4 (tetrachloromethane), Cl 2 C = CCl 2 (perchloroethylene, PCE), CH 3 CCl 3 (methyl chloroform, MCF), and CFC- 12. Comparisons were done with the data from TRACE-P and ALE/GAGE/AGAGE experiments, {{we found that the}} large variability in concentrations (relative standard deviation ranged from 9. 31 % to 96. 55 %) of the halocarbons suggested substantial local emissions from the PRD region in 2004. Correlations between the mixing ratio of each species and carbon monoxide (CO) were examined, and then each <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> halocarbon was quantified based on scaling the optimized CO emission inventory with the slope of the regression line fitted to each species relative to CO. The calculated results revealed that mass of CH 2 Cl 2 (7. 0 Gg), CH 3 CCl 3 (6. 7 Gg), and Cl 2 C = CCl 2 (2. 3 Gg) accounted for about 62. 9 % <b>of</b> total <b>emissions,</b> suggesting a significant contribution to halocarbon emissions from solvent use in the PRD region. <b>Emissions</b> <b>of</b> HCFC- 22 (3. 5 Gg), an alternative refrigerant to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), were about 2. 3 times greater than those of CFC- 12 (1. 6 Gg). CFC- 12 and HCFC- 22 accounted for 21. 5 % <b>of</b> total <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> halocarbons, so that the refrigerant would be the second largest source of halocarbons. However, the ratio approach found only minor <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> other <b>CFCs,</b> such as CFC- 11, and levels of CFC- 114 and CFC- 113 were close to zero. <b>Emissions</b> <b>of</b> other anthropogenic halocarbons, such as CCl 4 , CHCl 3 , CH 3 Br, and CH 3 Cl, were also estimated. Where possible, the emissions estimated from the measured ratios were compared with results from source inventory techniques, we found that both approaches gave emissions at similar magnitude for most of the halocarbons, except CFC- 11. The comparison suggested that ratio method may be a useful tool for assessing regional halocarbon emissions, and emission uncertainty could be further reduced by incorporating both longer-term and higher-frequency observations, as well as improving the uncertainty of the CO inventory...|$|R
