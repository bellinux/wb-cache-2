For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being the most common <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and {{play a vital role}} in ammonia oxidation.|$|E

Previously, in early modernity, culture was conceived very much on a representational model. The rest of the essay explores the possibility that a new paradigm of culture, i. e. technological <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is emerging {{at the turn of the}} 21 st century. Technological <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are understood as `culture-at-a-distance'.

5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping a core of rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of Europa. If liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a {{theoretical}} discussion about individual versus collective behavior in urban society. The classical theories of Ferdinand Tönnies and Georg Simmel are starting points in a discussion which ends in modern theories of urbanism as a way <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In modern urbanism three spheres <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are distinguished; the private sphere, the neighborhood sphere and the public sphere. Especially the social structuring of the neighborhood sphere seems to be extremely important in processes of behavior change, e. g. in measures of waste management and energy saving. The {{second part of the}} paper centers on urbanism and <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in Sweden. A discussion follows on social segregation, housing management and <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> tenure which ends in identification <b>of</b> different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the swedish housing market, the rental sector, the cooperative sector and the private sector. The sectors are empirically described in social, demographical and physical variables. The three <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> give a common background for individual behavior of its members {{as well as for the}} households, but differs in creating processes of collective action. The analysis of waste management in the three <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> has in depth interviews as empirical material...|$|R

The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is {{in direct contact with}} the cytoplasm. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0µm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|One general {{characteristic}} of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail {{is the way}} in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account of what it is to follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that any course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Martian {{meteorite}} ALH84001, {{a specimen}} {{that is much}} older than the majority of Martian meteorites that have been recovered so far, received considerable attention {{when a group of}} NASA scientists led by David S. McKay reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay's team cited as evidence of life were found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.|$|E

25|$|Mars' {{polar ice}} caps were {{discovered}} in the mid-17th century. In {{the latter part of}} the 18th century, William Herschel proved they grow and shrink alternately, in the summer and winter of each hemisphere. By the mid-19th century, astronomers knew that Mars had certain other similarities to Earth, for example that the length of a day on Mars was almost the same as a day on Earth. They also knew that its axial tilt was similar to Earth's, which meant it experienced seasons just as Earth does — but of nearly double the length owing to its much longer year. These observations led to the increase in speculation that the darker albedo features were water, and brighter ones were land. It was therefore natural to suppose that Mars may be inhabited by some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

40|$|A community’s {{conception}} of God {{is the central}} point {{for much of the}} rest of its belief.

Our perceptions of who God is and who we are shape our actions in the direction of a just and sustainable society. Thus, how Akan Christians relate to non-human <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> may largely depend on their social construction of God– nature relations.
