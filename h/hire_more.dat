5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With not even his own party members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Art Institute Board met the {{day after}} the {{incident}} and agreed not to display Mirth & Girth any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers. After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E

5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E

25|$|Rae {{endorsed}} Susan Eng's successful bid {{to chair}} the Metro Toronto Police Services Board in early 1991, over {{the opposition of}} several police officers.

25|$|There {{have been}} {{occasional}} charges of some departments lowering standards {{so that they}} could <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> women. In 2005, Laura Chick (the LA City Controller) stated in a report that Fire Chief Bamattre lowered physical requirements for female recruits and ordered that women be passed even if they failed their tests.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{models of}} {{unemployment}} occurs when wages {{are too high}} for employers {{to be willing to}} <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|E

Improvements to the business environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003. Afghan rugs are becoming popular again, allowing many carpet dealers around the country to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> workers.|$|E
25|$|As {{executive}} director of the League, Young pushed major corporations to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> blacks. In doing so, he fostered close relationships with CEOs such as Henry Ford II, leading some blacks to charge that Young had sold out to the white establishment. Young denied these charges and stressed the importance of working within the system to effect change. Still, Young was not afraid to take a bold stand in favor of civil rights. For instance, in 1963, Young was one of the organizers of the March on Washington despite the opposition of many white business leaders.|$|E
25|$|The Colombian {{government}} was not concerned about SCADTA, though, and did not question the loyalty of the German pilots. However, in order {{to comply with the}} United States, Colombia passed laws requiring airlines to <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> Colombian citizens, and for 51% of the stock of these companies to be Colombian-held. Restrictions were also placed on German pilots on how they could be utilized by an airline. For example, at least one pilot on every plane had to be Colombian, and positioning devices were placed on all of SCADTA's planes so that the government could monitor their location.|$|E

25|$|The TWU {{declared}} its aim to represent all public transit {{workers in the}} City, regardless of craft, and campaigned to reverse the ten percent wage cut, increase wages to meet increases {{in the cost of}} living, limit the workweek to forty hours and <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> workers to eliminate the speedup and to establish safe and sanitary working conditions. The union proceeded clandestinely, forming small groups of trusted friends in order to keep informers at bay, meeting in isolated locations and in subway tunnels. Even so, the IRT managed to infiltrate spies into the organization, as the union discovered when it obtained some of the company's files from sympathetic sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} would later reprise {{their roles in}} The Simpsons. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Abraham Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show. In the shorts, his voice is a loose impression of Walter Matthau, whereas it is more robust and humorous on the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta as well as Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge, rather than <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> actors. Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith performed the voices of Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson respectively.|$|E
25|$|Knievel {{realized}} {{that to make}} any amount of real money {{he would need to}} <b>hire</b> <b>more</b> performers, stunt coordinators and other personnel so that he could concentrate on the jumps. With little money, he went looking for a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.|$|E
