40|$|Introduction: Adolescent girls often {{experience}} {{difficulties in}} a rational perception of own body and consider attaining an ?appropriate shape? {{as a key}} to success and happiness. Growth disorders, like e. g. very tall stature, may bring about stigmatising which, in turn, may decrease in such girls their self-esteem, especially in adolescence. Aim {{of the study was to}} assess the perceived body image of tall and medium-statured girls and to compare their self-rating with an external one. Material and methods: A group of 56 girls aged 13 - 17 years were classified into two categories of body height: medium stature, between Percentiles 40 and 60 (n= 36) and tall, above Percentile 90 (n= 20). Using a template containing 9 female body shapes, the girls indicated the shape they thought they had, the shape they wished to have, and an <b>external</b> <b>rating</b> was also made. Girls rated as shapes 1 or 2 were classified as thin, shapes 3 or 4 as medium and shape 5 or higher as robust. The data were related to the BMI values. Results: Thin girls self-rated their body shapes and the desired ones significantly higher (p &#x 003 C; 0. 05) compared with the <b>external</b> <b>rating.</b> In medium-shaped girls the same was true for self-rating, the desired shape being concordant with the <b>external</b> <b>rating.</b> In robust girls, the external and self-ratings were concordant, the desired shapes being significantly lower (p &#x 003 C; 0. 05) but higher (p &#x 003 C; 0. 05) in tall than in medium-height girls (5. 0 and 3. 9, respectively). Tall and medium girls did not differ significantly in BMI but a very high correlation (r= 0. 930; p&#x 003 C; 0. 001) was found between the externally rated body shape and BMI in both groups of girls. Conclusion: The distorted perception of own body shape by adolescent girls may result from the specific ideals of feminine beauty and excessively slim silhouette insistently promoted by mass media and fashion designers. Popularisation of the results of this and similar studies may contribute to altering the respective attitudes of adolescent girls...|$|E

40|$|Introduction In {{order to}} {{discharge}} the patients receiving treatment with large radiation doses of 131 I for thyroid cancer, {{it is necessary}} to measure and evaluate the <b>external</b> dose <b>rates</b> of these patients. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess a new method of <b>external</b> dose <b>rate</b> measurement, and to analyze the obtained results as a function of time. Materials and Methods In this study, a telescopic radiation survey meter was utilized to measure the <b>external</b> dose <b>rates</b> of a sample population of 192 patients receiving treatment with high-dose 131 I at one, 24, and 48 hours after dose administration. Results The proposed technique could reduce the occupational radiation exposure of the physicist by a factor of 1 / 16. Moreover, the <b>external</b> dose <b>rates</b> of both genders rapidly decreased with time according to bi-exponential equations, which could be attributed to the additional factors associated with iodine excretion, as well as the physiology of the body in terms of 131 I uptake. Conclusion According to the results of this study, telescopic radiation survey meter could be used to measure the <b>external</b> dose <b>rates</b> of patients receiving treatment with 131 I.

40|$|Radiation {{safety is}} an {{integral}} part of targeted radionuclide therapy. The aim of this work was to study the <b>external</b> dose <b>rate</b> and retained body activity as functions of time in differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients receiving 131 I therapy. Seventy patients were stratified into two groups: the ablation group (A) and the follow-up group (FU). The patients’ <b>external</b> dose <b>rate</b> was measured, and simultaneously, their retained body radiation activity was monitored at various time points. The equations of the <b>external</b> dose <b>rate</b> and the retained body activity, described as a function of hours post administration, were fitted. Additionally, the release time for patients was calculated. The reduction in activity in the group receiving a second or subsequent treatment was more rapid than the group receiving only the initial treatment. Most important, an expeditious method was established to indirectly evaluate the retained body activity of patients by measuring the <b>external</b> dose <b>rate</b> with a portable radiation survey meter. By this method, the calculated <b>external</b> dose <b>rate</b> limits are 19. 2, 8. 85, 5. 08 and 2. 32 μSv·h− 1 at 1, 1. 5, 2 and 3 m, respectively, according to a patient’s released threshold level of retained body activity < 400 MBq.

In this context, an assessment of the information contained in credit ratings is important.

We find no evidence of announcement effects on bond prices. We are largely able to exclude lack of liquidity as an explanation for this puzzling result and suggest some alternatives, such as 'too-big-to-fail. ' For equity prices, we find strong effects of unexpected ratings changes and confirm prior evidence that stock prices may react very differently to ratings downgrades, depending on the underlying reason.
