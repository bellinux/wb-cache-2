40|$|We present 3 {{cases of}} pseudoallergic (anaphylactoid) {{reactions}} to perioperatively administered rocuronium, which rapidly resolved after sugammadex injection. Allergological workup showed {{no evidence for}} immediate-type hypersensitivity to the drugs used for anesthesia, including rocuronium. However, rocuronium induced an <b>irritative</b> <b>reaction</b> in skin tests in all 3 patients and in 3 healthy individuals. This reaction was specifically suppressed by adding sugammadex at a 1 : 1 molecular proportion to rocuronium before the skin tests. This observation suggests that the patients suffered from a pseudoallergic reaction, and indicates that sugammadex might act via the inhibition of non-IgE mediated MRGPRX 2 (Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor member X 2) -triggered mast cell degranulation induced by rocuronium...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a {{transglutaminase}} 3 knockout (TGM 3 /KO) mouse {{was generated}} that showed impaired hair development, but no gross defects in the epidermal barrier, although increased fragility of isolated corneocytes was demonstrated. Here we investigated the functionality of skin barrier in vivo by percutaneous sensitization to FITC in TGM 3 /KO (n= 64) and C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type (WT) mice (n= 36). Cutaneous inflammation was evaluated by mouse ear swelling test (MEST), histology, serum IgE levels, and by flow cytometry from draining lymph nodes. Inflammation-induced significant MEST difference (P< 0. 0001) was detected between KO and WT mice and was supported also by histopathology. A significant increase of CD 4 + CD 25 +-activated T cells (P< 0. 01) and elevated serum IgE levels (P< 0. 05) in KO mice indicated more {{the development of}} FITC sensitization than an <b>irritative</b> <b>reaction.</b> Propionibacter acnes–induced intracutaneous inflammation showed no difference (P= 0. 2254) between the reactivity of WT and KO immune system. As in vivo tracer, FITC penetration from skin surface followed by two-photon microscopy demonstrated a more invasive percutaneous penetration in KO mice. The clinically uninvolved skin in TGM 3 /KO mice showed impaired barrier function and higher susceptibility to FITC sensitization indicating that TGM 3 has {{a significant contribution to}} the functionally intact cutaneous barrier...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to a remarkable sexual dimorphism of serum and urine proteomes, the rat is exceptional for the wide difference between the serum patterns during an acute phase reaction vs baseline conditions. This feature allows monitoring with high sensitivity onset and progression of any pathological state that involves an inflammatory component as well as assessing the outcome of any therapeutic intervention. Reference maps have been defined for the proteomes of serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. For both serum and urine most of the proteomic investigations have dealt with toxicological testing, for BALF with allergic or <b>irritative</b> <b>reactions,</b> whereas with CSF the main aim was the characterization of rat models of neurological disorders. When surveying {{more than ten years}} of literature on rat biological fluid proteomics, it is puzzling to see how seldom a consistent analytical plan has been set up for the comparative investigation on two or more types of sample, whether to fully characterize a disease model or to evaluate pharmacological/toxicological effects of a drug. It is also regrettable that in several cases only a negligible part of the results is discussed at length whereas most data are not even made known to the scientific community. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background: Linalool is {{a widely}} used {{fragrance}} terpene. Pure linalool is not allergenic or a very weak allergen, but autoxidizes on air exposure and the oxidation products can cause contact allergy. Oxidized (ox.) linalool has previously been patch tested at a concentration of 2. 0 % in petrolatum (pet.) in 1511 patients, and 1. 3 % positive patch test reactions were observed. Objective: To investigate the optimal patch test concentration for detection of contact allergy to ox. linalool. Methods: Four concentrations of ox. linalool (2. 0 %, 4. 0 %, 6. 0 %, 11. 0 % pet.) were tested in 3418 consecutive dermatitis patients. Results: Ox. linalool 2. 0 %, 4. 0 %, 6. 0 %, and 11. 0 % pet. detected positive patch test reactions in 0. 83 %, 3. 2 %, 5. 3 %, and 7. 2 % of the tested patients, respectively. The doubtful reactions increased with rising concentrations but relatively less, giving 5. 1 %, 6. 4 %, and 7. 3 % doubtful reactions, respectively, for ox. linalool 4. 0 %, 6. 0 %, and 11. 0 % pet. Few <b>irritative</b> <b>reactions</b> were seen. Conclusions: Raising the patch test concentration for ox. linalool gave a better detection of contact allergy, as many as 5 - 7 % positive patch test reactions were detected. We suggest a patch test concentration of ox. linalool 6. 0 % pet. for future patch testing, giving a dose per unit area of 2. 4 mg/cm(2) when 20 mg test substance is tested in small Finn Chambers (R) ...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of {{bioaerosol}} produces non-specific {{symptoms such as}} <b>irritative</b> <b>reactions,</b> headache, and fatigue, {{and human}} health effects such as asthma, respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, urticaria and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The dominant biological components of air are fungal spores, bacteria and bacterial spores, ubiquitous in outdoor air, but scarcely measured due to the inadequacy of measurement methods. The use of biomarkers as tool for the determination of fungal and bacterial contribute to bioaerosol has been often suggested. In this study ergosterol, arabitol and mannitol have been associated to fungal spores, muramic acid has been associated to bacteria and dipicolinic acid has been associated to bacterial spores, as tracers. In the present work, a new analytical chemical method for the determination of this biomarkers was developed and fungal and bacterial component of aerosol was studied in suburban/rural and in urban sites. Ergosterol, arabitol, mannitol, muramic acid and dipicolinic acid content in airborne particulate matter, even at different sizes, was determined. Literature conversion factors correlating muramic acid and dipicolinic acid masses to bacteria and bacterial spores masses were applied. Literature conversion factors and new conversion factors correlating ergosterol, arabitol, and mannitol masses to fungi mass were applied and compared each other. The fungal spore concentrations obtained were different depending on the marker utilized and we deduced that in tropical regions or in very humid regions arabitol and mannitol principally come from fungal spore, especially during wet seasons. On the contrary at our latitude, that is in our meteorological condition, and dominant vegetation type arabitol and mannitol major primary emission sources are biomass burning, sea spray and plants. Therefore we conclude that, depending on the sampling area, arabitol and mannitol can overestimate fungal spore concentrations in atmosphere. Ergosterol remains the only possible biomarker and the estimated fungal concentrations in particulate matter PM 10...|$|R
40|$|Botanical data, {{chemical}} composition {{and use of}} the most common medicinal plants preparations in the treatment of skin diseases are presented in this article. These plants include: Oenothera biennis, Borago officinalis, Avena sativa, Lavandula angustifolia, Cocos nucifera, Matricaria recutita, Hamamelis virginiana and Olea europaea, that are used for the treatment of various skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris, ichtyosis non-bullosa, or eczema craquelé. Even today, in the era of highly specialized medicine, medicinal plant preparations are still used in dermatology especially in the treatment of inflammatory and itchy skin conditions. Patients trust and believe in beneficial effect of natural products, such as marigold or comfrey ointment. However, caution is needed in persons with history of allergic reactions or atopy, since plants can cause allergic or <b>irritative</b> inflammatory <b>reactions</b> in such individuals. Recent literature data confirm existing interest in the medicinal plants usage in dermatology...|$|R
40|$|The {{monoterpene}} ascaridole, {{a fairly}} stable endoperoxide found in essential oils such as tea tree oil can provoke {{allergic contact dermatitis}} which has been evidenced under patch test conditions. However, concomitantly we observed <b>irritative</b> skin <b>reactions</b> that demand further data underlining the sensitization potential of ascaridole. Here, we studied the effects of ascaridole on dendritic cell (DC) activation and protein reactivity, 2 key steps of chemical-induced skin sensitization. Treatment of human monocyte-derived DC with ascaridole found support for full DC maturation, a capability of sensitizers but not irritants. It induced significant upregulation of {{the expression of the}} costimulatory molecules CD 86, CD 80, CD 40, and the adhesion molecule CD 54 in a time-dependent manner. Maturation was accompanied by release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 ß, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL- 6, and IL- 8. Similar to other chemical skin sensitizers including hydroperoxides, we observed a certain reactivity of ascaridole toward cysteine- but not lysine-containing peptides. During recent years, evidence accumulated for a radical mechanism as trigger for protein reactivity of peroxides. Treatment of the fairly stable endoperoxide ascaridole with iron as radical inducer (“activated ascaridole”) resulted in cysteine peptide reactivity exceeding by far that of ascaridole itself. Furthermore, activated ascaridole showed increased potential for induction of the Nrf 2 target gene heme oxygenase 1 and upregulation of CD 86 and CD 54 on THP- 1 cells, an established DC surrogate. These results indicate that radical formation could be involved in the steps leading t...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} {{is likely to be}} {{involved}} in some of the health effects caused by certain indoor air exposures, and immune biomarkers can help determine which exposures and health effects have important immune components. However, the lack of standardized laboratory tests for most human immune markers and the many confounding variables that can influence them makes interpretation of results for exposure and disease end points uncertain. This paper presents an overview of the immune system and the considerations involved in using tests for immune markers in clinical epidemiology studies, particularly those concerned with indoor air exposures. Careful study design, well-characterized laboratory methods, and rigorous documentation of exposure status are required to determine the predictive value of such tests. Clinical tests currently available for some immune markers could help identify and characterize both <b>irritative</b> and hypersensitivity <b>reactions</b> to indoor air pollutants. Newer tests developed in research settings might provide more incisive indicators of immune status that could help identify exposure, susceptibility, or preclinical disease states, but their methodologies must be refined and tested in multicenter studies before they can be used reliably in public health applications...|$|R
