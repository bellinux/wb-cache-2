40|$|Abstract—The {{issue of}} what discriminatory use of a network means has arisen in two recent {{decisions}} of the United States and Canadian <b>federal</b> <b>communications</b> <b>commissions,</b> the FCC and the CRTC respectively. The topic is a contemporary and hotly debated one, as when a course is fixed it will strongly influence {{the future of the}} Internet. It can be stated as the dichotomy of open and competitive or closed and oligopolistic. A study and comparison of the two different approaches is vital to clarify the debate, and hopefully guide Canadian policy in a direction that will benefit the whole community...|$|R
5|$|The PTC began {{attracting}} {{more attention}} after it filed around 65,000 complaints to the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> (FCC) about the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, {{in which one}} of performer Janet Jackson's nipple shielded breasts, was exposed for 9/16ths of a second.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} pricing rule {{embodied}} in the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commissions</b> (FCCs) forward-looking cost model with a competitive equilibrium pricing rule. The rules differ {{due to differences in}} discount factors, the time path of operating cost recoveries, and the methods used to spread capital costs over time. A calibrated comparison of the rules for end-office switching reveals that the latter is most significant, causing the FCCs rule to understate cost recoveries by 24 percent. A rough aggregation suggests this difference compounds to billions of dollars nationwide, solely for the direct costs of end-office switching. This understatement is driven by falling switch costs over time, and the FCCs rule would overstate cost recoveries by a similar magnitude for assets whose costs rise over time. The competitive equilibrium rule also clarifies the endogeneity of economic life and reveals that depreciation assumptions are not needed for calculating competitive equilibrium prices.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years {{computers}} and communications have become closely related. In many computer systems presently in operation it is quite difficult to separate the communications and data processing functions, while many communications systems use computers to either switch circuits or messages. This paper uses currently available information to examine whether there are economies to be achieved if the common carriers are allowed to offer data processing services, since many of the communications and computing functions might be integrated. This subject is particularly relevant in view of the recent decision of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commissions</b> to allow some of the carriers to operate arms-length data processing subsidiaries. The paper then focuses on the future when distributed computer networks will likely be a reality and poses certain policy questions which should be examined in anticipation of these developments. This discussion is preceded by a short description of communication and computing services, methods, and terminology. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, {{it became}} {{precedent}} in another Supreme Court case involving gambling advertisement, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, which challenged the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commissions</b> right to restrict advertisement on {{games of chance}} with the justification that such restrictions would reduce gambling, given that advertisements for such games of chance as state lotteries and Native American gambling enterprises were allowed in all states and all gambling advertisement had been permitted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in nine. At issue was whether the state of Louisiana could restrict the advertisement to its residents of legal private casinos. In its hearing of that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed that the prohibition was constitutional based on Posadas, but the Supreme Court held rather that private casinos must be permitted to advertise to residents since gambling was legal in that state. However, as of 2007, Posadas had still not been officially overturned.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{definition}} of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) signals {{set by the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commissions</b> (FCC) opened the way to both impulse and non-impulse UWB signal formats. This possibility is reflected within the IEEE 802. 15. 3 a TG, aiming at the {{definition of}} a standard for UWB-based high bit rate WPANs. The two main proposals considered in this group are in fact a Multi Band OFDM approach, based on the transmission of non-impulse OFDM signals combined with Frequency Hopping (FH), and the Direct-Sequence (DS) UWB approach, based on impulse radio transmission of UWB DS-coded pulses. In this paper, the ranging capabilities of these two proposals are analyzed by determining the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the distance estimation error. The CRLB is evaluated under the condition of both ideal and real, multipath-affected, channel models. Results show that DS-UWB is in general best suited for ranging, thanks to its larger bandwidth and its higher frequencies of operation, and also quantify the degree to which multipath may affect ranging accuracy...|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commissions</b> Fifth Report before Congress, {{released}} in June 2008, the FCC reported:Based on our analysis in this Report, {{we conclude that}} the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans is reasonable and timely. The data reflect the industry’s extensive investment in broadband deployment, including at higher speeds, as evidenced by increased subscribership for those higher-speed services.The report stated that 47% of adult Americans had access in the home, rural home broadband adoption was at 31%, and over 57.8 million U.S. households subscribed to broadband at home. The NTIA contended that universal, affordable access was being provided in the home, workplace, classroom, and library. When measuring subscription rates of low-income areas, the survey reported that [...] "92 percent of the lowest-income zip codes {{have at least one}} high-speed subscriber, compared with 99.4 percent of the highest-income zip codes." [...] However, criticism came from within the FCC itself. Then FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein disagreed with this conclusion citing the [...] "downward trend" [...] of the countrys broadband ranking, and Commission Michael Copps criticized the FCCs data collection methods.|$|R

Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> (FCC) approved {{the sale of the}} Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.|$|E

5|$|The first local {{marketing}} {{agreement in}} North American television {{was formed in}} 1991, when the Sinclair Broadcast Group purchased Fox affiliate WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

5|$|First-run Lassie was {{televised}} September 12, 1954 to March 24, 1973 {{with its}} first 17 seasons airing on CBS Sundays at 7:00p.m. EST. In 1971, {{in order to}} promote community-related programming among local affiliates, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Commission</b> moved primetime Sundays to 8:00 P.M.

CBS executives felt Lassie would not be well received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled. (Lassie was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a change in its target demographics.) Lassie then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still on board, and remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973.
