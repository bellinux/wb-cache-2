5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and {{not paying attention to}} his coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA and was able to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

25|$|On 28 January 2011, Rakitić {{signed a}} four-and-a-half-year {{contract}} with Spanish La Liga club Sevilla for a transfer fee of €2.5million. Upon his arrival, Rakitić was immediately {{included in the}} starting XI of the team, making his debut on 6 February 2011 against Málaga. In next game, against Racing de Santander, he scored an own-goal but managed to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track and scored his first goal for Sevilla in the match against Hércules in the next matchday.

25|$|The 2006–07 NHL season {{revolved}} around injuries for Niittymäki. He suffered a torn labrum injury {{to his left}} hip during training camp. Doctors decided to try giving him cortisone shots to postpone surgery, which would have sidelined him for 6–8 weeks. The first shot allowed him to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice {{for the start of}} the season, but by late December he needed another shot. Despite this, he managed to take over the starting goaltender position from Esche, after Esche fell out with the coaching staff and management. However, Philadelphia acquired Martin Biron and he was given the starting position for the rest of the year. Niittymäki finally had hip surgery in summer 2008. He continued to play backup goaltender for the Flyers for the next two seasons (07–08 and 08–09), setting a franchise record for most saves in a game in January 2008.|$|E

The following week at Kansas, he finished 8th. Making his 500th Cup start at Charlotte, Earnhardt led 19 laps early, but finished 15th while battling a tight race car. The following week at Talladega, Earnhardt led 38 laps and was about to receive a push from Austin Dillon to overtake Jamie McMurray on the last lap when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. tapped Dillon, causing that driver to spin out and then get hit by Casey Mears, leaving Earnhardt with a 2nd-place finish.
