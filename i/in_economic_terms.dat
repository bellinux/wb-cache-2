Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became an {{important}} source of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> and living conditions. There were massive {{disruptions}} of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> as well, the {{government}} was faced with mounting instability. The government formulated a five-year economic development plan, although it was unable to act on it prior to being overthrown.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> {{pollution}} from fossil fuels {{is regarded as}} a negative externality. Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} cyanobacterial blooms has been {{assessed}} <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms.</b> In December 1991, the world’s largest algal bloom occurred in Australia, where 1000nbsp&km of the Darling-Barwon River was affected. One million people-days {{of drinking water}} were lost, and the direct costs incurred totalled more than A$1.3 million. Moreover, 2000 site-days of recreation were also lost, and the economic cost was estimated at A$10 milliobn, after taking into account indirectly affected industries such as tourism, accommodation and transport.|$|E

25|$|The steel frames become {{inefficient and}} uneconomic for supertall {{buildings}} as usable floor space is reduced for progressively larger supporting columns. Since about 1960, tubular designs {{have been used}} for high rises. This reduces the usage of material (more efficient <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> – Willis Tower uses a third less steel than the Empire State Building) yet allows greater height. It allows fewer interior columns, and so creates more usable floor space. It further enables buildings to take on various shapes.|$|E
25|$|Pay-to-play {{was cited}} {{as a cause of}} major damage {{to the quality of the}} New York comedy scene. <b>In</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> a pay-to-play {{strategy}} elevates those people who can afford to perform for nothing, or can afford to pay for their stage-time, which has nothing to do with their quality as an act. The pay-to-play promoter is able to profit from the goodwill and desire to perform of the acts, while discouraging appearances by those who cannot afford to perform without payment.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{responses}} to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making. This strategy recognizes that decisions on global warming need to be made with incomplete information, and that decisions in the near term will have potentially long-term impacts. Governments might choose to use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming. For instance, a risk-based approach can be applied to climate impacts which are difficult to quantify <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> e.g., the impacts of global warming on indigenous peoples.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, {{this is a}} {{reflection}} of the fact that adaptation measures are not recognized by many entities as an urban planning process (e.g. water and sanitation companies).

25|$|Common {{examples}} of public goods include: defence, public fireworks, lighthouses, {{clean air and}} other environmental goods, and information goods, such as official statistics, software development, authorship, and invention. Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but can't be classified as public goods since they don't fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> as quasi-public goods because excludability is possible, but they do still fit some {{of the characteristics of}} public goods.|$|E
25|$|Cattle ranches, or estancias, for {{beef and}} hides were {{typically}} quite large (over 10km²) and were {{concentrated in the}} north and east. Dairying was concentrated in the department of Colonia. Because ranching required little labor, merely a few gauchos, the interior lacked a peasantry and large towns. Despite being sparsely populated, however, the interior was relatively urbanized in that the capital of each department usually contained about half the inhabitants. Social and economic development indicators were lowest for the departments along the Brazilian border to the northeast. Government attempts to encourage agricultural colonization by means of land reform in the interior had largely failed <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> as had the promotion of wheat production. One exception, rice, most of which was produced in the east, had become a major nontraditional export in recent years.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms</b> the {{division}} of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern Song dynasty, 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and Sichuan). These geographical divisions are underscored {{by the fact that the}} main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the Grand Canal linking north and south, the hauling-way through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River linking southern China with Sichuan and the gallery roads joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of Zhuge Liang (see Longzhong Plan).|$|E

50|$|The paradox {{arises when}} a firm sells a product with few substitutes, {{which in turn}} allows the firm to {{increase}} the price of that product. The original reason was that as the price increases, the product will {{reach a point where}} it begins to attract more and more substitutes. <b>In</b> technical <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> such a product has very low cross-price elasticity of demand. The situation is linked to a United States Supreme Court case and a subsequent response <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> literature.|$|R
25|$|Since then, {{tourism in}} Nepal has thrived; {{it is the}} country's most {{important}} industry. Tourism is {{a major source of}} income for {{most of the people in}} the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as Pashupatinath, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath and Budhanilkantha. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number increased to 491,504 in 1999/2000. Following the end of the Maoist insurgency, there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into the Democratic Republic. <b>In</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country.|$|E
25|$|The Centro histórico {{is between}} Carreras 35 and 46 and Calles 30 and 46, and {{includes}} parts of San Roque and Downtown districts. It {{is part of}} the town historical centre and North-Central District. In the Centro histórico are the headquarters of the administrative powers {{of the city and the}} department. Socio-economically, this was the most important area until the 80's, when the centre's deterioration led to the displacement of formal trade and banking to the north of the city. Despite the decline, the Centre remains at the heart of the city and is the most representative and important sector <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms.</b> There is an intense commercial activity at the public market. In addition, the centre hosts a number of buildings of the Republican period and structures of immense historical and architectural value. The Centro histórico of Barranquilla is a nationally protected site by the Ministry of Culture through resolution 1614 of 1999. Since the 90's, the historic center of Barranquilla is in the process of recovery, which was consolidated in 2008 with the Ministry of Culture's announcement for a public competition of urban design. At local government level, the development of Barranquilla centre is sponsored by the Promotora del Desarrollo del Distrito Central de Barranquilla S.A. (Promocentro), a decentralized body attached to the District Municipality.|$|E
500|$|Keynes's {{followers}} {{assert that}} his predictions of disaster were borne {{out when the}} German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923, and again {{by the collapse of}} the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of the Second World War. However the historian Ruth Henig claims that [...] "most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, <b>in</b> <b>economic</b> <b>terms,</b> the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out".|$|E

[...] An astute observer of the trade ties binding the various parts of the British Empire, he wrote in 1763 that extant high duties on molasses (payment of which was widely flouted by New England merchants) would have significantly harmed the economies of Britain, North America, and the West Indies, in part by diverting significant quantities of scarce hard currency to those duties.
