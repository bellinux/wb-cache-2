50|$|The {{collapse}} {{was followed}} by its restructuring, under a plan known as the “Kidder Peabody Plan,” which was engineered by Tamraz (who served for years as its {{chairman and chief executive}} officer), under which the <b>deposit</b> <b>obligations</b> of the old Intra Bank were replaced with shares in a new company named Intra Investment Company (IIC), one of the major sovereign wealth investment companies in the Middle East. The major shareholders of IIC were the Lebanese government, along with the governments of Kuwait, Qatar and the United States, all of which had been major depositors in the former bank. IIC remained a major shareholder in key institutions such as Middle East Airlines (Tamraz was the Vice Chairman of the airline for a number of years, with special responsibility for its finances, banking relationships and aircraft purchases), Casino du Liban and Bank Al Mashrek, which carried out the remaining banking operations. Kidder Peabody continued to advise the board of IIC until 1973 under an advisory contract, at which time the relationship was discontinued.|$|R

40|$|In the United States {{the risk}} that a {{financial}} breakdown {{could lead to a}} taxpayer bailout of the deposit insurance fund has been cited to justify current regulatory controls on what activities may be affiliated with banks. Despite some regulatory changes in the 1990 s to protect taxpayers from future debacles, however, widespread failures could still expose taxpayers to losses.; This article proposes a new way to monitor the deposit insurance fund by having the FDIC issue capital notes. Because the interest paid on the notes would be suspended if the fund required a loan from the Treasury or eliminated if taxpayer funds were contributed to offset deposit insurance losses, noteholders would have more incentive to clearly signal the condition of the insurance fund. This signal would help regulators, taxpayers, and their congressional representatives monitor the health of the fund and would change the incentive structure facing FDIC directors. The cost of the notes would be minimal in part because the proceeds would be used to reduce banks' existing <b>deposit</b> insurance <b>obligations.</b> <b>Deposit</b> insurance; Capital market; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation...|$|R

40|$|Examining {{the legal}} {{history of the}} order to pay money {{initiating}} a funds transfer, the author tracks basic principles of modern law to those that governed the payment order of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Exploring the legal nature of the payment order and its underpinning in light of contemporary institutions and payment mechanisms, the book traces the evolution of money, payment mechanisms and the law that governs them, from developments in Ancient Mesopotamia, Ancient Greece, Rome, and Greco-Roman Egypt, through medieval Europe and post-medieval England. Doctrine is examined in Jewish, Islamic, Roman, common and civil laws. Investigating such diverse legal systems and doctrines {{at the intersection of}} laws governing bank <b>deposits,</b> <b>obligations,</b> the assignment of debts, and negotiable instruments, the author identifies the common denominator for the evolving legal principles and speculates on possible reciprocity. At the same time he challenges the idea of 2 ̆ 7 law merchant 2 ̆ 7 as a mercantile creation. The book provides an account of the evolution of payment law as a distinct cohesive body of legal doctrine applicable to funds transfers. It shows how principles of law developed in tandem with the evolution of banking and in response to changing circumstances and proposes a redefinition of 2 ̆ 7 law merchant 2 ̆ 7. The author points to deposit banking and emerging technologies as embodying a great potential for future non-cash payment system growth. However, he recommends caution in predicting both the future of deposit banking and the overall impact of technology. At the same time he expresses confidence in the durability of legal doctrine to continue to evolve and accommodate future payment system developments. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This Master’s thesis {{examines}} the {{discussions about the}} new Swedish legal deposit legislation for electronicdocuments, related to Jürgen Habermas’ theories around the public sphere. In 2009, {{a draft of the}} law proposal was sent out to various authorities and organizations who were asked tocontribute their views on this matter. This study looks at who has responded of those asked, and what commonviews are apparent within these responses. The responses from two different categories are focused on –universities and other authorities, examining if any similarities or differences can be noticed in the arguments inthe different categories’ responses to the proposed law change. This information has been first analyzed through content analysis, providing an overview to the respondentsof the draft, and the different views which have arisen. Argumentation analysis has then been used to examinehow specific respondents have argued their views, focusing on the National Library of Sweden and the NationalArchives of Sweden. The most common views and arguments revolve around the definitions suggested in the proposal, regardingwhich documents are to be collected and who is responsible for their delivery. Many respondents also mentionedtheir desire to be able to fulfill their legal <b>deposit</b> <b>obligations</b> by delivering documents through networks. Habermas’ theories on the public sphere, which he claims to exist in today’s society, are very similar to thetheories of the public sphere addressed within this study. The authorities and organizations which have beenasked to contribute opinions towards this proposal are the same one who will be directly involved with the legaldeposit itself; while the future users of these collected electronic documents, namely scholars and the public,have been excluded from this discussion. Some respondents remarked upon the importance of the documentsbeing available to those to which they will be of use.

40|$|The recent {{bilateral}} state {{practice on}} joint development of straddling petroleum deposits across their common borders has attracted avid commentaries across the globe. This growing interest is further {{reinforced by the}} fact that more and more discoveries of straddling offshore petroleum resources across states boundaries are being made regularly. These deposits either lie across delimited continental shelf boundaries or are found in areas of overlapping continental shelf claims. However, the international legal regime governing such deposits only requires states to cooperate in developing such common hydrocarbon <b>deposits.</b> Such <b>obligation</b> within the context of customary international law has been described as no more than mere “rules of engagement ” rather than rules of cooperation. Consequently, the tendency for states to fail to cooperate is ever-present. The question then is: What options are there for the states in the event of failure to reach an agreement on trans-boundary unitisation? The main thrust of this paper therefore is to analyse the options opened to states where no cooperative agreement on joint development of common deposits is reached...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} of legal deposit material forms a national record of Australia’s intellectual and creative endeavours and this discussion paper considers {{the potential benefits}} of extending the types of material collected. Legal deposit has a long history in common law countries and {{has been a part of}} Australia’s copyright law since its colonial origins. Its genealogy may be traced back to the genesis of statutory copyright, the Statute of Anne in 1709, and even further to deposit licensing arrangements established in 1610 by the University of Oxford and the Stationer’s Company, a London-based guild of printers, booksellers and publishers. It is generally recognised that legal deposit provides benefits to the Australian public by providing a reliable mechanism for the preservation of Australia’s documented heritage. The {{collection of}} legal deposit material forms a national record of Australia’s intellectual and creative endeavours, our cultural heritage, our history and way of life. Further public benefits are derived from deposit material, particularly as other copies cease to be commercially available over time. The Attorney-General’s Department, working with the Office for the Arts in the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport, is seeking comments from interested stakeholders on a proposed model to extend the legal <b>deposit</b> <b>obligation</b> in section 201 of the Copyright Act 1968 in relation to material deposited with the National Library of Australia (the National Library). Existing <b>obligations</b> to <b>deposit</b> print-based library materials under section 201 are not under consideration. In 2007, the Attorney-General’s Department and the then Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts released the 2007 Discussion Paper on the Extension of Legal Deposit. That paper sought views on extending legal deposit to electronic material, broadcasts and audiovisual material and on the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA) also being made a repository institution for legal deposit. This current paper is focused solely on a proposal for an extended scheme in the Copyright Act for the National Library and is without prejudice to further consultation to be conducted by the Office for the Arts on legal deposit of audiovisual material to the NFSA. The proposed scheme outlined in the consultation paper does not represent the government’s final position on this matter and does not necessarily represent the views of the agencies concerned. Interested stakeholders are encouraged to contribute their views and any other relevant information that may assist the government in adopting the most appropriate scheme.

On this background, it was decided by the Icelandic politicians instead {{to start a new}} round of negotiations to attempt fixing the issue and reach a new better compromise in the Icesave dispute.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis, major reforms of the U. S. housing finance system are likely. One of the key issues facing policy makers in this area is whether and to what extent the federal government should maintain its current role in the residential mortgage markets. Since the New Deal, the federal government has guaranteed the primary sources of housing finance in the United States — bank and thrift <b>deposits,</b> and the <b>obligations</b> of the mortgage securitization conduits Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. The prevailing view of government guarantees is that they increase financial instability because they encourage excessive risk-taking and reduce market discipline. But this perspective fails to explain why such guarantees have been closely correlated with stability in the housing finance system through our nation’s history. Incorporating historical and economic analyses, this Article challenges the conventional wisdom around government guarantees in U. S. housing finance, and argues that these guarantees actually help to promote stability in several important ways: they prevent banking panics, they limit the formation of credit bubbles, and they promote the origination of consumer-friendly loans that are less likely to default. The Article concludes with the new and counterintuitive proposition that the positive stabilizing effects of U. S. mortgage guarantees far outweigh their destabilizing effects, which is why guarantees have been so closely tied to financial stability...|$|R
