5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts like Dr. William M. Gray, {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The July 23, 1983 forecast predicted that after the slow start to the season, that a total of eight storms would form, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel.

25|$|On an {{absolute}} scale, the lowest incomes saw the greatest gains in percentage terms {{and the highest}} incomes actually declined. Half {{of those in the}} bottom 20% in 1996 saw their income at least double during these years, and the median income of the top 1996 top 1% declined by 25.8%. The reason that the results are so inconsistent with household income statistics is that household statistics do not track the same people over time; it is important to specify <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> households in the top 1% in a given year were still there when looking at that category years later and gauging income gains.|$|E
25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one to wonder <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of}} the First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
