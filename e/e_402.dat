40|$|The MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) MMP- 9 and - 2 each {{possess a}} unique CBD (collagen-binding domain) {{containing}} three fibronectin type II-like modules.

The interactions of recombinant CBD- 9 {{with a series of}} collagen types and extracellular matrix molecules were characterized by protein–protein binding assays. CBD- 9 bound native and denatured type I, II, III, IV and V collagen, as well as Matrigel and laminin, with apparent Kd values of (0. 1 – 6. 8) × 10 − 7 M, which were similar to the Kd values for CBD- 2 [(0. 2 – 3. 7) × 10 − 7 M]. However, CBD- 9 bound neither native nor denatured type VI collagen. We also generated two modified MMPs, MMP- 9 <b>E</b> <b>402</b> A and MMP- 2 E 404 A, by site-specific mutations in the active sites to obtain enzymes with intact ligand binding, but abrogated catalytic properties. In subsequent competitive binding assays, CBD- 9 and MMP- 9 <b>E</b> <b>402</b> A inhibited the interactions of MMP- 2 E 404 A and, conversely, CBD- 2 and MMP- 2 E 404 A competed with MMP- 9 <b>E</b> <b>402</b> A binding to native and denatured type I collagens, pointing to shared binding sites. Importantly, the capacity of CBD- 9 to disrupt the MMP- 9 and MMP- 2 binding of collagen translated to inhibition of the gelatinolytic activity of the enzymes. Collectively, these results emphasize the essential contribution of CBD- 9 to MMP- 9 substrate binding and gelatinolysis, and demonstrate that the CBDs of MMP- 9 and MMP- 2 bind the same or closely positioned sites on type I collagen...|$|E

40|$|Dyskerin is a {{nucleolar}} protein {{present in}} small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles that modify specific uridine residues of rRNA by converting them to pseudouridine. Dyskerin {{is also a}} component of the telomerase complex. Point mutations in the human gene encoding dyskerin cause the skin and bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita (DC). To test the extent to which disruption of pseudouridylation or telomerase activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of DC, we introduced two dyskerin mutations into murine embryonic stem cells. The A 353 V mutation is the most frequent mutation in patients with X-linked DC, whereas the G <b>402</b> <b>E</b> mutation was identified in a single family. The A 353 V, but not the G <b>402</b> <b>E,</b> mutation led to severe destabilization of telomerase RNA, a reduction in telomerase activity, and a significant continuous loss of telomere length with increasing numbers of cell divisions during in vitro culture. Both mutations caused a defect in overall pseudouridylation and a small but detectable decrease in the rate of pre-rRNA processing. In addition, both mutant embryonic stem cell lines showed a decrease in the accumulation of a subset of H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs, correlating with a significant decrease in site-specific pseudouridylation efficiency. Interestingly, the H/ACA snoRNAs decreased in the G <b>402</b> <b>E</b> mutant cell line differed from those affected in A 353 V mutant cells. Hence, our findings show that point mutations in dyskerin may affect both the telomerase and pseudouridylation pathways {{and the extent to which}} these functions are altered can vary for different mutations...|$|R
40|$|Monilethrix is an {{autosomal}} dominant hair disorder {{characterized by a}} beaded appearance of the hair due to periodic thinning of the shaft. The phenotype shows variable penetrance and results in hair fragility and patchy dystrophic alopecia. Mutations of the helix-encoding region in two hair-specific keratins (hHb 1 and hHb 6) have been identified. We have now investigated two unrelated monilethrix patients and identified two different novel heterozygous point mutations of the same codon in exon 7 of the hHb 6 gene. Dystrophic hair samples obtained from both patients showed the typical beaded appearance by scanning electron microscopy. Both mutations affected the first base of codon 402 (glutamic acid). In patient A, a G to C transition occurred causing a glutamine substitution (GAG to CAG: <b>E</b> <b>402</b> Q) whereas in patient B, the transition was G to A yielding a lysine substitution (GAG to AAG: <b>E</b> <b>402</b> K). The sequence of the 1 A helical regions of hHb 1 and hHb 6 {{as well as the}} 2 B helical region of hHb 1, were normal. Unaffected relatives did not have the hHb 6 mutation and this codon was found to be highly conserved showing no alteration in the normal population (100 alleles examined).

Products, corresponding to cleavages identified in E. coli, were also detected in infected Sesbania leaves. Interestingly, though the sites are exactly the same in polyprotein 2 ab, it got cleaved between Protease-VPg but not between VPg-RdRp. This indicates to a differential cleavage preference, governed probably by the conformation of 2 ab.

40|$|AbstractSesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) polyprotein {{was shown}} to undergo {{proteolytic}} processing when expressed in E. coli. Mutational analysis of the proposed catalytic triad residues (H 181, D 216, and S 284) present in the N-terminal serine protease domain of the polyprotein showed that the protease was indeed responsible for this processing. Analysis of the cleavage site mutants confirmed the cleavage between protease-viral protein genome linked (VPg) and VPg-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) at E 325 –T 326 and <b>E</b> <b>402</b> –T 403 sites, respectively. An additional suboptimal cleavage at E 498 –S 499 site was also identified {{which resulted in the}} further processing of RdRP to 10 - and 52 -kDa proteins. Thus, the protease has both E-T and E-S specificities. The polyprotein has a domain arrangement of protease-VPg-p 10 -RdRP, which is cleaved by the protease. The purified serine protease was also active in trans and cleaved the polyprotein at the same specific sites.

40|$|According to the {{analysis}} of variance, a genotype, year and a genotype x year interaction significantly affect variability of the trait number of kernel rows per ear. This number was the highest in the silage maize inbred lines ZPLB 402, ZPLB 403 and ZPLB 405 in both years of investigation, resulting in low both positive and negative values of heterosis. The correct estimation of combining abilities is necessary in order to develop superior hybrids. This estimation was done on the basis of diallel hybrids after the method of Griffing (1956; method II, model I). The analysis of variance for combining abilities for the number of kernel rows per ear points to the significance of general and special combining abilities. The GCA to SCA ratio indicates that additive genes and the additive variance have a significant role in inheritance of this trait. Highly significant values of GCA for the number of kernel rows per ear for both years were found in the silage maize inbred lines ZPLB 402 and ZPLB 403, whereas inbreds ZPLB 401, ZPLB 404 and ZPLB 406 had negative values.

40|$|Decision-making {{requires}} the coordinated activity of diverse brain structures. For example, in maze-based tasks, the prefrontal cortex must integrate spatial information encoded in the hippocampus with mnemonic information concerning route and task rules {{in order to}} direct behavior appropriately. Using simultaneous tetrode recordings from CA 1 of the rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, we show that correlated firing in the two structures is selectively enhanced during behavior that recruits spatial working memory, allowing the integration of hippocampal spatial information into a broader, decision-making network. The increased correlations are paralleled by enhanced coupling of the two structures in the 4 - to 12 -Hz theta-frequency range. Thus the coordination of theta rhythms may constitute a general mechanism through which the relative timing of disparate neural activities can be controlled, allowing specialized brain structures to both encode information independently and to interact selectively according to current behavioral demands.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{advanced}} satellite positioning based systems for agricultural machines {{have been developed}} and are commercial available for aiding and supporting navigation efforts up to full auto-steering. Furthermore, {{in terms of the}} route planning for agricultural field operations, advanced methods based on combinatorial optimisation of fieldwork patterns have recently been introduced. In order to apply and implement these methods in the high-level control system of agricultural machines, an appropriate representation of the field as a geometrical entity made up of discrete geometric primitives, such as points, lines, and polygons is needed. Preferably, such a representation must be generated in real-time providing the input to the whole accuracy range of navigation systems as well as the range of operation types, equipment characteristics, and machinery kinematics. Here, a method for real-time generation of field geometrical representation for operational planning is presented. The representation regards simple or complex fields for both convex and non-convex field boundaries, where generated tracks can be straight or curved. As demonstration cases for the method, 15 different field types were evaluated.

The isolated strains lack the typical C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) but secrete a new enterotoxin consisting of two components: C. perfringens iota-like enterotoxin-a (CPILE-a), which acts as an enzymatic ADP-ribosyltransferase, and CPILE-b, a membrane binding component. Here we present the crystal structures of apo-CPILE-a, NAD+-CPILE-a and NADH-CPILE-a. Though CPILE-a structure has high similarity with known iota toxin-a (Ia) with NAD+, it possesses two extra-long protruding loops from G 262 -S 269 and <b>E</b> <b>402</b> -K 408 that are distinct from Ia. Based on the Ia-actin complex structure, we focused on actin-binding interface regions (I-V) including two protruding loops (PT) and examined how mutations in these regions affect the ADP-ribosylation activity of CPILE-a. Though some site-directed mutagenesis studies have already been conducted on the actin binding site of Ia, in the present study, mutagenesis studies were conducted against both α- and β/γ-actin in CPILE-a and Ia. Interestingly, CPILE-a ADP-ribosylates both α- and β/γ-actin, but its sensitivity towards β/γ-actin is 36 % compared with α-actin. Our results contrast to that only C 2 -I ADP-ribosylates β/γ-actin.

During the last few decades, E. coli have evolved toward antimicrobial resistance (N ys et al., 2004; Peralta et al., 2007) Background: Antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic Escherichia coli is an increasing problem especially in developing countries. Aims: To compare between resistance patterns of E. coli collected from two unre lated geographical areas. Methods: A descriptive comparative study was conducted between May 2010 and August 2011. <b>E.</b> coli (n= <b>402)</b> collected from hospitals in Khartoum state, Sudan and in Aseer region, Saud i Arabia were studied. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates we re performed following standard methods. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-susceptibility to ≥ three antimicrobials. Results: Of the <b>402</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates studied, MDR patterns were significantly higher among isolates from Sudan than Saudi Arabia [92. 2 % (214 / 232) vs. 70. 6 % (120 / 170) ] (p = 0. 000). The resistance rates of E. coli isolates were recorded as follows (Sudan and Saudi Arabia) : High to moderate resistance to amoxicillin (97. 7 % and 94. 2 %), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88. 3 % and 82. 5 %), tetracycline (77. 1 % and 74. 2 %), amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (51. 4 % and 70 %), ceftriaxone (64 % and 52. 4 %) and ciprofloxacin (58. 4 % and 40 %). Low resistance was to ceftazidime (35 % and 20 %), gentamicin (35 % and 17. 5 %) and nitrofurantoin (22. 4 % and 11. 7 %). Resistance to amikacin was un common (1. 9 % and 5 %).

The strains, in populations of 106 – 107 CFU/mL, were introduced into the skim milk and broth. The survival of test strains at high temperatures and high pressure depended to a high degree (p< 0. 05) on the type of medium in which the cells were suspended. At 55 °C the inactivation of E. coli cells was recorded after 60 to 120 min in the broth, and after 180 min in the milk. At 60 °C the time required for their thermal death was 15 to 30 min in broth. In milk only E. coli 1 cells died after 30 -minute heating; the other strains survived in populations of about 40 CFU/mL.

We have prepared the inactive <b>E</b> <b>402</b> Q mutant of the truncated catalytic domain of human MMP- 9 and co-crystallized it with active site-directed synthetic inhibitors of different binding types. Here, we present the X-ray structures of five MMP- 9 complexes with gelatinase-specific, tight binding inhibitors: a phosphinic acid (AM- 409), a pyrimidine- 2, 4, 6 -trione (RO- 206 - 0222), two carboxylate (An- 1 and MJ- 24), and a trifluoromethyl hydroxamic acid inhibitor (MS- 560). These compounds bind by making a compromise between optimal coordination of the catalytic zinc, favourable hydrogen bond formation in the active-site cleft, and accommodation of their large hydrophobic P 1 ′ groups in the slightly flexible S 1 ′ cavity, which exhibits distinct rotational conformations of the Pro 421 carbonyl group in each complex. In all these structures, the side-chain of Arg 424 located {{at the bottom of}} the S 1 ′ cavity is not defined in the electron density beyond Cγ, indicating its mobility. However, we suggest that the mobile Arg 424 side-chain partially blocks the S 1 ′ cavity, which might explain the weaker binding of most inhibitors with a long P 1 ′ side-chain for MMP- 9 compared with the closely related MMP- 2 (gelatinase A), which exhibits a short threonine side-chain at the equivalent position. These novel structural details should facilitate the design of more selective MMP- 9 inhibitors...|$|E

It has been suggested that mutation in hHb 1 produces a less severe phenotype. We have studied hair keratin genes and clinical features in 18 unrelated pedigrees of monilethrix from Germany, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Portugal, in 13 of which mutations have not previously been identified. By examining the rod domains of hHb 1, hHb 3 and hHb 6, we have identified mutations in nine of the new pedigrees. We again found the glutamine-lysine substitution (E 413 K) in the helix termination motif of hHb 6 in two families, and in another, the corresponding E 413 K substitution in the hHb 1 gene. In four families a similar substitution <b>E</b> <b>402</b> K was present in a nearby residue. In addition two novel mutations within the helix initiation motif of hHb 6 were found in Scottish and Portuguese cases, in whom the same highly conserved asparagine residue N 114 was mutated to histidine (N 114 H) or aspartic acid (N 114 D) residues, respectively. In four other monilethrix pedigrees mutations in these domains of hHb 1, hHb 3, and hHb 6 were not found. The mutations identified predict a variety of possible structural consequences for the keratin molecule. A comparison of clinical features and severity between cases with hHb 1 and hHb 6 mutations does not suggest distinct effects on phenotype, {{with the possible exception of}} nail dystrophy, commoner with hHb 1 defects.

A sample of low molar mass commercial poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was labeled by radioactivity with tritium and by coupling the 6 -aminofluorescein fluorescent dye. Labeled PAA-containing sludges were allowed to ferment. To monitor the fate of the polymers, aliquots of the fermented mixtures were withdrawn at selected times and centrifuged. Liquid and solid phases were analyzed by scintigraphy or UV spectrometry, depending of the labeling techniques. Both techniques led to similar distributions, c. a. 75 % in the supernatant and 25 % in the solid phase. Distributions remained constant during the biological tests. There was no degradation of the commercial PAA after aqueous size exclusion chromatography (SEC), in agreement with literature.

We report the development of a consistent sampling framework and the results of the first structured survey on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in European hospitals. Methods: National expert laboratories recruited hospitals with diagnostic capacities, who collected the first ten carbapenem non-susceptible clinical isolates of K pneumoniae or E coli and ten susceptible same-species comparator isolates and pertinent patient and hospital information. Isolates and data were relayed back to national expert laboratories, which made laboratory-substantiated information available for central analysis. Findings: Between Nov 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, 455 sentinel hospitals in 36 countries submitted 2703 clinical isolates (2301 [85 %] K pneumoniae and <b>402</b> (15 %) <b>E</b> coli). 850 (37 %) of 2301 K pneumoniae samples and 77 (19 %) of <b>402</b> <b>E</b> coli samples were carbapenemase (KPC, NDM, OXA- 48 -like, or VIM) producers.

To understand the biochemical consequences of the disease-causing mutations, 11 missense mutations and two in-frame deletions were introduced into human LAMAN cDNA by in vitro mutagenesis and the resulting proteins were expressed in COS cells. Some selected mutants were also expressed in Chinese-hamster ovary cells. T 355 P (Thr 355 →Pro), P 356 R, W 714 R, R 750 W and L 809 P LAMANs as well as both deletion mutants were misfolded and arrested in the ER as inactive single-chain forms. Six of the mutants were transported to the lysosomes, either with less than 5 % of normal specific activity (H 72 L, D 196 E/N and R 220 H LAMANs) or with more than 30 % of normal specific activity (<b>E</b> <b>402</b> K LAMAN). F 320 L LAMAN resulted in much lower activity in Chinese-hamster ovary cells when compared with COS cells. Modelling into the three-dimensional structure revealed that the mutants with highly reduced specific activities contained substitutions of amino acids involved in the catalysis, either co-ordinating Zn 2 + (His 72 and Asp 196), stabilizing the active-site nucleophile (Arg 220) or positioning the active-site residue Asp 319 (Phe 320) ...|$|E

Samples of pumpkin seeds were extracted and analyzed for vitamin E (high-performance liquid chromatography assay), vitamin C (titration method of 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol), β-carotene and lutein (Shimadzu HPLC 10 A system analysis), zinc and selenium (by mass spectrometry). Specimens of pumpkin flesh were analysed for total carotenoids (UV-VIS spectrophotometer assay) and vitamin C. The seeds of ‘Miranda ’ accumulated the highest amount of vitamin <b>E</b> (<b>402.</b> 93 µg g- 1 d. m.). The content of vitamin C in oil pumpkin flesh ranged from 3. 06 to 3. 87 mg g- 1 fresh mass, in seeds 7. 04 – 8. 43 mg g- 1 fresh mass. Total carotenoid quantity in flesh of all pumpkin cultivars was significantly different and ranged from 0. 01 to 1. 74 mg g- 1 fresh mass. The content of lutein in oil pumpkin seeds varied from 25. 26 to 162. 70 µg g- 1 d. m. as well the content of β-carotene from 4. 16 to 5. 15 µg g- 1 d. m.

40|$|The {{members of}} the European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae, (EuSCAPE) Working Group are: Portugal—Manuela Caniça and Vera ManageiroBACKGROUND: Gaps in the {{diagnostic}} capacity and heterogeneity of national surveillance and reporting standards in Europe {{make it difficult to}} contain carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We report the development of a consistent sampling framework and the results of the first structured survey on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in European hospitals. METHODS: National expert laboratories recruited hospitals with diagnostic capacities, who collected the first ten carbapenem non-susceptible clinical isolates of K pneumoniae or E coli and ten susceptible same-species comparator isolates and pertinent patient and hospital information. Isolates and data were relayed back to national expert laboratories, which made laboratory-substantiated information available for central analysis. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, 455 sentinel hospitals in 36 countries submitted 2703 clinical isolates (2301 [85 %] K pneumoniae and <b>402</b> (15 %) <b>E</b> coli). 850 (37 %) of 2301 K pneumoniae samples and 77 (19 %) of <b>402</b> <b>E</b> coli samples were carbapenemase (KPC, NDM, OXA- 48 -like, or VIM) producers. The ratio of K pneumoniae to E coli was 11 : 1. 1 · 3 patients per 10   000 hospital admissions had positive clinical specimens. Prevalence differed greatly, with the highest rates in Mediterranean and Balkan countries. Carbapenemase-producing K pneumoniae isolates showed high resistance to last-line antibiotics. INTERPRETATION: This initiative shows an encouraging commitment by all participants, and suggests that challenges in the establishment of a continent-wide enhanced sentinel surveillance for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaeceae can be overcome. Strengthening infection control efforts in hospitals is crucial for controlling spread through local and national health care networks.

Foram utilizados 28 animais (28 meses de idade) de cada raça, sendo quatro foram abatidos no início do período experimental, para estimativa da composição {{corporal}} inicial, e os demais, alimentados sem restrição por 145 dias com dietas contendo 20, 40, 60 ou 80 % de concentrado na matéria seca. Os pesos médios iniciais e finais foram de 238 <b>e</b> <b>402</b> kg para os Brangus e 230, 7 e 361, 9 kg para os Nelore, respectivamente. Os ganhos diários de peso vivo em jejum, peso de corpo vazio e peso de carcaça quente foram diferentes entre as raças e os níveis de concentrado, com maiores médias para os animais Brangus e para o nível de 60 % de concentrado na dieta. Os animais Brangus apresentaram maiores valores de extrato etéreo e energia e os Nelore, maiores teores de água, proteína e cinzas no corpo vazio. As exigências líquidas de proteína e de energia para o ganho de peso vazio foram diferentes entre raças, com valores de 0, 161 e 0, 188 kg de proteína e 3, 02 e 2, 46 Mcal por kg de ganho de peso vazio para os animais Brangus e Nelore, respectivamente. Os animais da raça Brangus tiveram maior exigência de energia e os Nelore, maior exigência de proteína, mas não houve efeito do nível de concentrado na dieta, provavelmente em razão da pouca idade dos animais, que não haviam alcançado a fase de maior deposição de gordura. The {{energy and}} protein requirements for gain of Brangus and Nellore bulls were estimated using the comparative slaughter technique, {{in which the}} empty body {{as well as the}} gain composition were estimated through the 9 th - 10 th - 11 th rib cut. Twenty-eight animals from each breed were used in this research. At the beginning of the trial four animals from each breed were slaughtered to determine the initial body composition while the remaining bulls had free access to diets containing 20, 40, 60 or 80 % of concentrate (dry matter basis) during 145 days. The average initial and final shrunk body weights were 238 and 402 kg for Brangus and 230. 7 and 361. 9 kg for Nellore, respectively. Animals averaged eight months of age {{in the beginning of the}} trial. The final average shrunk body gain, empty body gain, and hot carcass gain differed between breeds and concentrate levels with greater values found for Brangus and 60 % of dietary concentrate, respectively. Fat and energy contents in the empty body were greater for Brangus while water, protein, and ash were higher for Nellore bulls. Protein and energy requirements for empty weight gain differed between breeds averaging 0. 161 and 0. 188 kg of protein and 3. 02 and 2. 46 Mcal of energy per kg of empty weight gain for Brangus and Nellore, respectively. Although it was observed greater energy requirement for Brangus and greater protein requirement for Nellore, no effect of concentrate level was found probably because the age of the bulls prevented animals to reach a stage of greater fat deposition...|$|E
40|$|Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative {{agent of}} dengue fever (DF), the most {{prevalent}} arthropod-borne viral disease {{in the world and}} therefore is considered an emerging global health threat. The four DENV serotypes (DENV- 1, DENV- 2, DENV- 3 and DENV- 4) that infect humans are distinguished from one another by unique antigenic determinants (epitopes) on the DENV envelope (E) protein. The E protein is the primary antigenic site of the DENV and is responsible for inducing neutralising antibody (Ab) and cell mediated immune response in DENV infected hosts. The DENV E protein also mediates attachment of virions to host cell receptors and entry of virions into host cells by membrane fusion. The study of epitopes on DENV E protein is necessary for understanding viral function and for the design of unique polyvalent vaccines capable of inducing a neutralising antibody response against each DENV serotype. Reverse genetics using infectious cDNA clones has enabled the construction of functional intertypic DENV, where the E protein of one DENV serotype is put in the genetic background of a different DENV serotype. In addition, observations from our laboratory indicate that chimeric E proteins, consisting of E protein structural domains from different DENV serotypes can fold into functional proteins. This suggests that there is potential to engineer viruses with intertypic DENV E proteins as potential DENV vaccine candidates, which is the long term goal of studies within our research group. However, if a chimeric E protein was to be constructed containing epitopes involved in antibody mediated neutralisation of each DENV serotype, then knowledge of the location of these epitopes on the E protein of each DENV serotype would be essential. Prior to this study, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) had been used to identify epitopes involved in antibody mediated neutralisation on the E protein of all DENV serotypes, except DENV- 4. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} identify epitopes on the DENV- 4 E protein involved in neutralisation by antibodies. In order to achieve this objective, a panel of 14 MAbs was generated against DENV- 4 in BALB/c mice and characterised using various serological and functional assays. The identification of DENV- 4 specific neutralising MAbs in the panel was essential for subsequent experiments aimed at determining antigenic domains, structural domains or specific epitopes (peptides or amino acids) involved in the neutralisation of DENV- 4. The majority of MAbs (11 / 14) generated against DENV- 4 recognised the E protein. The remaining three MAbs reacted with the non-structural (NS) 1 protein. The majority of MAbs against the E protein were DENV or Flavivirus group reactive, but four MAbs were DENV- 4 specific. All MAbs against the E protein recognised conformationally dependent epitopes and were able to capture DENV- 4 in an enzyme linked immuno-adsorbent assay (ELISA). Eighty percent (9 / 11) of the anti-E MAbs produced for this study neutralised infection of cells by DENV- 4 in vitro. Three of the neutralising MAbs (F 1 G 2, 18 F 5 and 13 H 8) were DENV- 4 specific and also demonstrated the strongest neutralisation activity of the panel, reducing DENV- 4 infectivity by 100 - 1000 fold. The amount of virus neutralised by the MAbs was not related to the avidity of the MAbs. The DENV- 4 specific MAbs F 1 G 2, 18 F 5 and 13 H 8 were used to identify epitopes involved in neutralisation of DENV- 4. The MAbs that effectively captured DENV- 4 were used in competitive binding assays (CBAs) to determine spatial relationships between epitopes and therefore define antigenic domains on the DENV- 4 E protein. The CBAs indicated that the epitopes recognised by the panel of MAbs segregated into two distinct domains (D 4 E 1 and D 4 E 2) and both contained epitopes involved in neutralisation. CBAs incorporating human serum from DENV- 4 infected patients suggested that the MAbs recognised the same, or spatially related, epitopes in domain D 4 E 2 as antibodies from humans who had experienced natural dengue infections, indicating the clinical relevance of such epitopes for the development of DENV vaccines. The reactivity of the capture MAbs with low pH treated DENV- 4 was also evaluated in an attempt to identify epitopes that might be more accessible during low pH-mediated virus fusion. Only one of the MAbs (13 H 8) recognised an acid resistant epitope. Initial attempts to identify epitopes on the DENV- 4 E protein involved in neutralisation followed the traditional epitope mapping approach of selecting subpopulations of DENV- 4 which escaped neutralisation by MAbs. These attempts were unsuccessful so a variety of strategies for mapping epitopes were used including DENV- 4 variant analysis and site directed mutagenesis of the DENV- 4 E protein, MAb screening of chimeric DENV- 3 / 4 E proteins and MAb screening of a bacterial peptide display library. DENV- 4 variants including DENV- 4 isolates from different geographical locations or chemically mutagenised DENV- 4 were screened with neutralising MAbs to identify neutralisation escape mutant (n. e. m.) viruses. Site directed mutagenesis of the DENV- 4 E protein confirmed whether amino acid changes identified in DENV- 4 n. e. m. s were essential for the binding of neutralising MAbs to an epitope. The MAb screening of DENV- 4 variants identified n. e. m. s with amino acid changes at residues E 95, E 96, E 156, E 157, E 203, E 329 and <b>E</b> <b>402</b> of the DENV- 4 E protein. Site directed mutagenesis of the DENV- 4 E protein identified two epitopes recognised by the DENV- 4 specific neutralising MAbs F 1 G 2 and 18 F 5 at specific amino acid residues within domains II and III of the DENV- 4 E protein. No specific epitopes were identified for the MAb 13 H 8; however this MAb did recognise domain I and II of the DENV- 4 E protein, when screened against DENV- 3 / 4 chimeric DENV E proteins. The first epitope, which was recognised by the MAb F 1 G 2, contained residue E 95 which was located in domain II of the DENV- 4 E protein. The aspartate (Asp) to alanine (Ala) change at E 95 prevented the binding of F 1 G 2 to the DENV- 4 E protein. The binding of F 1 G 2 to the E 95 residue was confirmed using the pFlitrX bacterial peptide display library, which demonstrated binding of F 1 G 2 to a peptide homologous with residues E 99 -E 104. No peptides recognised by 13 H 8 and 18 F 5 were identified by this method. The MAb F 1 G 2 also bound to the domain III region (E 300 -E 495) of the DENV- 4 E protein when screened against DENV- 3 / 4 chimeric DENV E proteins. This implied that F 1 G 2 may be recognising a discontinuous epitope consisting of domains II and III. The second epitope, which was recognised by MAb 18 F 5, contained residue E 329 which was located in domain III of the DENV- 4 E protein. The alanine (Ala) to threonine (Thr) change at E 329 prevented the binding of 18 F 5 to the DENV- 4 E protein. MAb 18 F 5 also bound to the domain III region (E 300 -E 495) of the DENV- 4 E protein when screened against DENV- 3 / 4 chimeric E proteins, thus confirming the E 329 epitope. The potential mechanisms by which the DENV- 4 specific MAbs neutralise virus infection were evaluated by the virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA). The binding of MAb 18 F 5 to a domain III (E 329) epitope of the DENV- 4 E protein and the binding of MAb F 1 G 2 to domain II (E 95, E 99 -E 104) and domain III epitopes (chimeric E protein) of the DENV- 4 E protein, prevented the attachment of DENV- 4 to a 40 kDa C 6 / 36 cell protein. In contrast the binding of MAb 13 H 8 to domains I and II of the DENV- 4 E protein did not prevent attachment of DENV- 4 to the same protein. This was preliminary evidence that the binding of domain III epitopes by the MAbs F 1 G 2 and 18 F 5 may be important in preventing virus attachment. The binding of MAb 13 H 8 to domains I and II, and the ability of this MAb to recognise DENV- 4 treated at low pH, suggested that MAb 13 H 8 may block epitopes exposed at low pH that are required for low pH mediated virus fusion to host cell membranes. Overall, the different methods used in this study identified epitopes involved in the neutralisation of DENV- 4. The distribution of epitopes involved in neutralisation throughout the DENV- 4 E protein were similar to the distribution of epitopes involved in neutralisation on the DENV- 1, 2 and 3 E proteins. This suggested that it might be possible to elicit neutralising antibodies against multiple DENV serotypes using chimeric E-proteins derived from two or more DENV serotypes and therefore, facilitate the design of novel tetravalent DENV vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Poly-protein {{processing}} is {{a common}} strategy used by many viruses to generate different functional products from a single protein. Viral proteases {{play a crucial role}} in this maturation process. Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) polyprotein was shown to undergo proteolytic processing when expressed in E. coli. Mutational analysis of the proposed catalytic triad residues (H 181, D 216 and S 284) present in the N-terminal serine protease domain of the polyprotein showed that the protease was indeed responsible for this processing. Analysis of the cleavage site mutants confirmed the cleavage between Protease-VPg, VPg-P 10 and P 10 -P 8 at E{ 325 }T{ 326 }, <b>E</b> { <b>402</b> }T{ 403 }and E{ 498 }S{ 499 }sites, respectively. Thus, the protease has both E-T and E-S specificities. The polyprotein has a domain arrangement of Protease-VPg-P 10 -P 8, which is cleaved by the protease. The purified serine protease was not active in trans. Interestingly, the protease domain exhibited trans-catalytic activity when VPg (viral protein genome-linked) was present at its C-terminus. Bioinformatic analysis of VPg primary structure suggested that it could be a disordered protein. Biophysical studies validated this observation and VPg resembled “natively unfolded” proteins. CD spectral analysis of DN 70 Pro-VPg fusion protein showed a positive CD peak at 230 nm, suggestive of some aromatic interaction between protease and VPg. Mutation of W 43 in the VPg domain to phenylalanine/alanine abrogated the positive peak with concomitant loss in cis and trans proteolytic activities of the DN 70 Pro domain. Further, deletion of VPg domain from the polyprotein completely abolished proteolytic processing. The results suggest a novel mechanism of activation of the protease, wherein the interaction between the natively unfolded VPg and the protease domains via aromatic amino acid residues alters the conformation of the individual domains and the active site of the protease. Thus, VPg is an activator of protease in SeMV and probably by this mechanism the polyprotein processing could be regulated in planta. The three dimensional structure of the SeMV protease has revealed the residues involved in substrate binding (H 298, T 279, N 308, R 309), catalysis (H 181, D 216 and S 284) and interaction with VPg (F 269, W 271, Y 315, Y 319). Mutational analysis of the residues forming the substrate binding pocket suggest that residues H 298, T 279 and R 308 are absolutely required for the protease activity whereas N 308 may not be so crucial. Further to delineate the interacting partners of W 43, mutants of the above mentioned aromatic residues were generated. Results suggest that F 269 and W 271 residues of protease domain are involved in aromatic stacking interaction with VPg...|$|R

Animals were sacrificed six (6 N, 6 D) or nineteen (19 N, 19 D) weeks after diabetes induction. A segment of the terminal portion of the ileum of each rat was obtained and stained with Giemsa's solution, for whole-mount preparation studies. Forty fields were analyzed in each animal, and the number and basophily intensity of cell bodies were recorded. After counting, the following mean numbers of neurons/mm² were obtained: 6 N= 593. 1 ± 95. 75, 6 D= 639. 1 ± 130. 8, 19 N= 580. 1 ± 175. 6 and 19 D= 402. 0 ± 144. 8.

A suplementação alimentar interfere no desempenho reprodutivo, com efeitos positivos sobre peso corporal, circunferência escrotal, características físicas do sêmen e CAP de touros jovens Tabapuã. Body weight (BW), scrotal circumference (SC), semen {{characteristics and}} Breeding Soundness Evaluation-Zebu (BSE-Z) of 516 young Tabapuã breed bulls, raised under different feeding regimen, were evaluated {{for one year}} old bulls (12 - 17 months of age) and two year old bulls (21 - 27 month of age). The feed regimens were the following: feeding regimen 1 - animals raised under pasture condition plus mineral supplementation, feeding regimen 2 - animals raised under pasture condition and supplemented {{during the dry season}} with sugar cane and urea (0. 5 %) plus 2 kg/animal/day of a commercial concentrate (84 %NDT and 18 % crude protein) fed twice a day, and feeding regimen 3 - feed lot animals fed balanced diets with the following composition: sugar cane, elephantgrass, urea (0. 5 %) and commercial concentrate (88 %NDT and 19 %crude protein) varying from 2 kg/animal/day for young animals to 6 kg/animal/day at adult age (27 months), fed three times a day. One year old animals on feeding regimen 3 were heavier (BW= 416 kg), and had higher (P< 0, 05) scrotal circumference (29. 6 cm), semen volume (5. 7 ml) and spermatic motility (42 %) than animals on feed regimens 1 and 2. No difference between animals on feeding regimens 1 and 2 were observed for BW (232. 44 and 279. 34 kg), scrotal circumference (20. 02 cm and 22. 16 cm), semen volume (2 and 2. 12 ml), and spermatic motility (14. 17 % and 20. 27 %), respectively. Two years old animals on feeding regimen 3 were heavier (BW= 490. 82 kg), and had higher scrotal circumference (SC= 33. 56 cm) and andrologic classification (ACP= 71. 71) than animals on feeding regimens 1 and 2, which showed, BW (378. 91 and 409. 2 kg), SC (30. 66 and 30. 31 cm) and ACP (63. 55 and 66. 05), respectively. Difference between animals on feeding regimen 3 and animals on regimens 1 and 2 were observed for BW, SC and SV. Mature animals showed BW= 497. 5 kg, SC= 33. 81 cm and SV= 4, 83 ml. Animals on feeding regimen 1 (BW= 388. 53 kg, SC= 30. 81 cm and SV= 2. 92 ml), were not statistically different from animals on feeding regimen 2 (BW= 412. 32 kg, SC= 31. 56 cm and SV= 3. 93 ml). Immature animals were heavier (BW= 479. 22 kg) and had higher SC (SC= 32. 96 cm) on feeding regimen 3, than animals on feeding regimen 1 (BW= 367. 36 and SC= 29, 56 cm), and animals on feeding regimen 2 (BW= 402. 69 kg and SC= 29. 55 cm).

40|$|In einer retrospektiven Analyse wurden Patienten mit akuter myeloischer Leukämie, die in der Abteilung Hämatologie in der Universitätsklinik in Frankfurt am Main zwischen 1996 bis 1999 behandelt wurden und im Rahmen dieser Behandlung fieberhafte Infektionen entwickelt hatten, ausgewertet. <b>Es</b> wurden insgesamt <b>402</b> Episoden von 135 Patienten (76 Frauen und 59 Männer) mit AML auf geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede im Infektionsverlauf untersucht. Hierbei wurde neben den Patientencharakteristika die Inzidenz der verschiedenen Infektionsklassifikationen, das Erregerspektrum (gram-positiv, gram-negativ, Pilzinfektion), die Therapie und das Therapieergebnis analysiert. Als Erfolgskriterien wurden die Entfieberung, sowie die Rückbildung von Infektionslokalisationen definiert. Die Therapieerfolge wurden eingeteilt in komplettes, partielles und fehlendes Ansprechen. In der vorliegenden Analyse wurden für den Infektionsverlauf wichtige Faktoren wie der Remissionsstand der Grunderkrankung, antibiotische Prophylaxe, G-CSF und die Neutropeniedauer untersucht, wobei sich hierbei keine signifikanten Unterschiede ergaben. Bei den Infektionsklassifikationen fiel auf, dass Männer signifikant mehr Pneumonien hatten und dass bei Frauen häufiger primäre Bakteriämien nachweisbar waren. Gram-positive Erreger traten insgesamt signifikant mehr bei Männern, gram-negative Erreger signifikant mehr bei Frauen auf. Nachgewiesene {{invasive}} Pilzinfektionen waren bei beiden Geschlechtern in ähnlichen Anteilen zu finden. Wegen der höheren Rate an Pneumonien bei männlichen Patienten (32, 6 % versus. 18, 1 %) haben diese mehr Amphotericin B und 5 -Flucytosin erhalten, da bei Pneumonien ein hohes Risiko für Fadenpilzinfektionen besteht und dieses entsprechend in der empirischen Therapie berücksichtigt wurde. Eine endgültige Entfieberung trat bei insgesamt 95, 5 % aller Episoden auf, wobei es keinen Unterschied zwischen männlichen und weiblichen Patienten gab. Der Anteil bei den weiblichen Patienten, die einen Rückgang der Infektlokalisation hatten, war signifikant höher verglichen mit den männlichen (90, 9 % versus 52, 5 %, p < 0, 0001). Auch ein kompletter Rückgang der Infektlokalisation war in höherem Anteil bei Frauen als bei Männern zu verzeichnen (41 % vs 20, 3 %). Insgesamt 12, 7 % aller Infektepisoden führte zu einer Verlegung auf die Intensivstation, ein geschlechtsspezifischer Unterschied wurde nicht gefunden. In der Gesamtbeurteilung des Verlaufs der Infektionsepisoden war das komplette Ansprechen (82, 3 % vs 67, 4 %; p < 0, 001) sowie die Ansprechrate insgesamt (komplett und partiell; 93 % vs 79 %; p < 0, 0005) bei den weiblichen Patienten signifikant höher. Purpose: Infections are {{an important}} cause for mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. More intensive chemotherapies result in longer neutropenic periods. The duration of severe neutropenia is a main risk factor for severe infections. In febrile neutropenia an empirical antibiotic treatment which has to be started immediately after onset of fever and before provement of microorganisms or infectious foci is mandatory. In the past infectious complications in neutropenic patients had been predominantly caused by gram-negative organisms, so empirical treatment as well as prophylaxis particularly aim at gram-negative spectrum. Therefore and due to increasing use of indwelling central venous catheters grampositive infections have meanwhile increased. Invasive fungal infections are a main cause for morbidity and mortality in leukemia patients. They are especially associated with higher intensity of chemotherapy regimens resulting in long-term. There are only very limited data {{about the influence of}} gender on infections in neutropenic patients. This retrospective study analyzed possible gender-specific differences on incidence and course of infections in neutropenic patients with AML after curative chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Between 1996 and 1999 59 male and 76 female neutropenic patients with AML developed 402 febrile episodes (175 male, 227 female). The antibiotic treatment regimen included initial therapy with imipenem followed by addition of gentamicin and ceftazidime/vancomycin as a third step in non-responders. In patients with 6 days of unresponsive fever or with pulmonary infiltrates an empirical antimycotic treatment with conventional or liposomal amphotericin B had been started. The following parameters have been considerated in this analysis: gender, age, remission status of underlying disease, duration of neutropenia < 500 /micro l before and after onset of fever, use of G-CSF, infection classifications, spectrum of microorganisms, need of intensive care, antibiotic therapy, duration of fever and outcome of infections. Results: No significant difference in age, remission status of AML, antibacterial or antifungal prophylaxis, duration of neutropenia and use of G-CSF could be found. The infection classifications showed a significant difference in primary bacteremia, which occurred more frequently in female patients (11, 4 % vs 22, 9 %;p< 0, 01). The occurrence of pulmonary infiltrations however was significantly higher in males (32, 6 % vs 18, 1 %;p< 0, 001). This result is compatible with the significantly higher use of antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and 5 -flucytosin due to suspected aspergillus infections in neutropenic patients with pneumonias. Women had significantly more gram-negative, men had more gram-positive infections (p< 0, 05 each). The higher use of gentamicin in female patients may be caused by need of antibiotic completion due to gram-negative infections and/or the more frequent treatment of male patients with amphotericin B which should not be combined with other nephrotoxic agents. There was no significant gender-specific difference in defervescence and the need for treatment at intensive care unit. Interestingly a higher cure of infectious foci (mainly pneumonias) developed in female patients (90, 9 % vs 52, 5 %, p< 0, 0001) possibly suggesting a higher but unproven rate of fungal infections in males. The final assessment of infection outcome resulting in a superior outcome of infections in women have been influenced by this fact. Conclusion: In this analysis gender-specific differences in distribution of microorganisms and the cure rate of infectious foci in neutropenic patients with AML could be found. These differences influenced final outcome. The rate of responders among women was significantly higher (79 % vs 93 %;p< 0, 0005) ...|$|R
