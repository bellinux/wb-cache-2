5000|$|In 2013 the <b>EdgeRunner</b> is {{a second}} {{generation}} cargo bicycle with a 20" [...] rear wheel. The <b>EdgeRunner</b> has been billed as the [...] "Best longtail ever. No contest." ...|$|E
5000|$|Xtracycle {{now offers}} a {{complete}} bike, the Xtracycle <b>EdgeRunner,</b> {{which allows for}} safer loading and unloading of children and is easier to handle and accelerate than other longtails because of its small 20" [...] rear wheel.|$|E
5000|$|A second <b>Edgerunner</b> {{release was}} planned, but the label folded {{before it could}} be issued. The {{recording}} was self produced and the band printed and distributed 200 copies in an attempt to attract another label. Black Lotus, a Greek label heard the recording and signed the band in 2005. Released as [...] "WomaniZer", the recording was distributed worldwide and the label plans on remastering The Fair Bitch Project and releasing that as well.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Edgerunners</b> - the {{descendants}} of the anti-corporation Cyberpunk movement. Integral cyberlimbs are replaced by Neo-Cyber technology, in which detachable articulated frames called [...] "bracers" [...] worn over the body can be modified to perform all the functions of dedicated cybertechnology.|$|R
50|$|Multiple groups oppose, fear, {{and hunt}} the Changed, but one group {{stands out as}} protectors: the <b>Edgerunners</b> of old. The sourcebook {{describes}} them as wiser, more experienced and, ultimately rebels-with-a-cause (CyberGeneration offers the rules to convert old Cyberpunk 2020 characters into adults for the CyberGeneration setting).|$|R
5000|$|Absolute Steel is a Norwegian {{heavy metal}} band from Larvik. Formed in 1999, the band’s {{founding}} members were Andy Boss (lead guitar), Dave Bomb (lead guitar) and K2 (vocals). Throughout the late 1990s they played live performances {{and developed a}} heavy metal party band style that {{caught the attention of}} <b>Edgerunner</b> Records, a local heavy metal label. In 2002, the label released [...] "The Fair Bitch Project", the band's debut recording. Performances after the release further defined their style by featuring female strippers and pyrotechnics.|$|E
50|$|When walking about town, {{one finds}} little oases {{untouched}} by hectic daily life. In big, parklike gardens, behind old trees and tall rhododendron hedges, stately manor houses may be discovered. These villas built on Dutch models were textile manufacturers’ homes {{a hundred years}} ago. A walk through Nordhorn will in many places also still bring to light signs of the recent and more distant past, be it the town hall completed in 1952 with its little belltower or the old well at the park at the Völlinkhoff. Memories {{of a time when}} the heavy blocks of sandstone used in the oil mill's <b>edgerunner</b> still fulfilled their original function are brought forth at the town park.|$|E
