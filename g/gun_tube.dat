The new split-trail carriage featured an eight-wheel integral two-axle bogie and a two-wheel limber that supported the trails for transport. The carriage was a two-piece design.

In the latter case, an important thermal effect is superimposed to the frictional one, bringing to the coating flake off. This paper presents {{a part of a}} more extended study of the damages induced in <b>gun</b> <b>tubes.</b> It deals with thermal shock resistance analysis of uncoated and chromium coated steel samples. Its aim is to reproduce and study the main damage types observed at the inner surface of <b>gun</b> <b>tubes</b> by using the DCE solar furnace in Odeillo (France). In a real weapon shooting, the thermal pulse can reach flux levels as high as 50 kW/cm 2 in an extremely brief time (about 10 ms). These thermal conditions cannot be simulated at the focus of a solar furnace, so we have to determine the couple of parameters (flux level and duration) creating the same damage on the samples...|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 1943, the {{formations}} and {{units in}} the Reserve ranged from battalions to whole armies (eg the Reserve Armies), {{with an emphasis on}} artillery and mechanised formations, and were capable of large-scale, independent operations. For example, as of April 1943, an artillery penetration corps contained as many as 1,500 <b>gun</b> <b>tubes</b> and rocket launchers each. Tank armies, which also emerged in 1943, included one or two tank corps and one mechanised corps, plus supporting units. These mechanised formations were capable of conducting operational exploitations of up to 500 kilometers.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the later}} (1991) {{successful}} gun fuels was a saturated solution of ammonium perchlorate in ammonia. This has a vapor pressure of one atmosphere at 20C, and generally forms a convenient liquid that is stable and possible to handle. The mixture is notable for its low burning temperature per impetus, with resulting lowered damage to expensive <b>gun</b> <b>tubes</b> and liners, or alternatively, increased firing rates. A typical impetus is 388,000 ft-lb/lb. The ammonia vapors are toxic, but the toxicity is readily apparent to ordinary people and can be handled with normal industrial precautions.|$|R

Up to this point, the French besiegers suffered 1,200 killed and wounded, plus 898 captured. The defenders lost 492 killed or died of disease, 395 wounded, and 87 captured or deserted. There were also 3,275 soldiers on the sick list.|$|R

It has a total weight of 41.1 lb and utilizes a 627 mm DU penetrator with a 27 mm rod diameter, which will reach a muzzle velocity of 1,670 m/s using of 8.1 kg of JA-2 propellant. Maximum effective range is 3000 m. According to Jane's, the M829 is capable of penetrating 540 mm of RHA steel armor at up to a 2000 m range.

5000|$|While {{working on}} a new tank, Kartsev was looking for a more {{powerful}} tank gun. The 100 mm D-10T and D-54 tank guns had a fierce opponent {{in the form of the}} British L7A1 tank gun. The Soviets decided to [...] "recaliber" [...] the already existing 100 mm D-54TS tank gun. The modifications done to the gun included removing the rifling of the gun, reducing the profile of the bullet chamber, removing the muzzle brake, lengthening the <b>gun</b> <b>tube,</b> adding an automatic cartridge-case ejector, and adding a bore evacuator in the middle of the <b>gun</b> <b>tube</b> (as opposed to the D-45TS tank gun, which had a bore evacuator in the base of the <b>gun</b> <b>tube).</b> The new 115 mm tank gun was designated U-5TS [...] "Molot" [...] Rapira; it was the first Soviet 115 mm smoothbore tank gun. When it went into serial production, it received the designation 2A20. It was put in trials against the D-10TS tank gun, which armed the T-54B as well as some T-55 and T-55A main battle tanks. These trials showed that the under-caliber projectiles fired from the U-5TS had a nearly 200 m/sec higher muzzle velocity. It became apparent that the maximum range of the new tank gun was almost double that of the D-10TS. The only serious drawback of the U-5TS tank gun was the fact that it was not as accurate as the D-10TS, because of the lack of rifling. However, the greater range of the gun and its extremely high muzzle velocity made the poor accuracy less of an issue.|$|E
50|$|Major Bock of Festung Pioneer-Stab 27 (the {{fortification}} regiment of LVII Corps, Fifteenth Army, at {{the time}} based in the Dieppe area) was given the task of finding a suitable site for the HDP batteries following Hitler's decision that HDP guns should be sited in northern France to bombard London. A study in early 1943 concluded that a hill with a rock core would be most suitable, as the <b>gun</b> <b>tubes</b> could be placed in drifts (inclined tunnels) and support equipment and supplies located in adjacent tunnels. The guns would not be movable and would be permanently aimed at London.|$|R
50|$|There {{were other}} {{proposals}} to deploy batteries to bombard London, Paris, Antwerp {{and other cities}} but these were not implemented due to the poor state of the German railway network {{and a lack of}} ammunition. All four HDP guns were eventually abandoned at the Röchling works in Wetzlar and Artillerie Abteilung 705 was re-equipped with conventional artillery. The disassembled <b>gun</b> <b>tubes,</b> spare parts, and remaining ammunition were later captured by the US Army and shipped to the United States where they were tested and evaluated at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and finally scrapped there in 1948.|$|R
25|$|Where a vehicle, {{such as the}} M50 Ontos, used {{multiple}} barrels, spotting rifles {{were usually}} provided for each barrel so that each could be accurately boresighted to its own barrel. The Ontos used six barrels with four spotting rifles; two without, to avoid making an already tall vehicle even higher. This provision may have been over-generous, although it did also increase the magazine capacity available for repeated ranging shots. Many photographs of the Ontos in service in Vietnam show it with {{only two of the}} spotting rifles installed in their mounts. The Ontos also often only carried four or even two main <b>gun</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
