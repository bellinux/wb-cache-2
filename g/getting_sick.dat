5|$|In New York City, {{men like}} Larry Kramer and Paul Popham, who had {{previously}} shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the Gay Men's Health Crisis {{to raise money for}} medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> with opportunistic infections. Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor Ed Koch and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and preventive education about AIDS and unsafe sex.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid <b>getting</b> <b>sick,</b> a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E

Plants, arthropods and birds have also been considered possible viral reservoirs.|$|E

25|$|Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups {{of water}} in order to wash off the balls. However, {{research}} has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as E. coli. To avoid any illness, many players put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from. In doing so, it removes the possibility of <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> or drinking any dirt that may transfer from the ball into the cup.|$|E

The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact did incur {{a great deal of}} public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the Apollo 1 fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees. There was in fact no video broadcast during either the landing or takeoff because of technological limitations.|$|E

25|$|Crematoria in Europe {{were built}} in 1878 {{in the town of}} Gotha in Germany and later in Heidelberg in 1891. The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by Francis Julius LeMoyne after hearing about its use in Europe. During that time it was thought that people were <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> by {{attending}} funerals of those recently deceased and that decomposing bodies were leaking into the water systems. LeMoyne built the crematory to cremate bodies in a controlled environment primarily for sanitary reasons. Cremation was used to destroy any organic matter that could cause illness and give families a better way to preserve ashes. Before LeMoyne’s crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations.|$|E
25|$|Present {{vaccination}} {{strategies for}} SIV {{control and prevention}} in swine farms typically {{include the use of}} one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from <b>getting</b> <b>sick,</b> it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} becomes sick with swine flu, {{antiviral}} drugs {{can make the}} illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care {{at home or in}} a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.|$|E

Spotnitz was inspired by the Spencer Tracy movie Bad Day at Black Rock, which is about a town holding a terrible secret. He was also inspired by an article he read at UCLA about salamanders <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> from eating other salamanders; Spotnitz's brother later suggested him to include the theme in the episode.|$|E

500|$|After Six Figures <b>Getting</b> <b>Sick</b> was completed, one of Lynch's classmates, H. Barton Wasserman, {{offered to}} pay $1000 for a similar motion picture {{to be made for}} an art {{installation}} in his home. Lynch purchased a clockwork Bolex movie camera, and began to teach himself cinematography. Lynch worked on the commissioned motion picture over the next two months, crafting a mix of live action and animation in a split-screen format. However, when the film was developed, [...] an error along the way had rendered it indistinguishable and unusable. Wasserman allowed Lynch to keep the remainder of the budget, which he used to fund the production of a new motion picture project, The Alphabet.|$|E
500|$|Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson {{were busy}} adding the {{finishing}} touches to their own episodes—"Hollywood A.D." [...] and [...] "All Things", respectively—the writers struggled {{with a way to}} create a convincing story, but not force Mulder and Scully to be in every scene. The two eventually decided that causing Mulder to get sick in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode. Walker noted, [...] "Mulder <b>getting</b> <b>sick</b> in Act Two and being in a hospital bed for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time. It was easier to shoot a bunch of stuff of him in bed than having him have to be {{in a lot of different}} locations." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch's [...] {{includes}} {{short and}} feature-length films, music videos, documentaries and television episodes; while {{his involvement in}} these ranges from direction, production, screenwriting, acting and sound design. Lynch's first project was the 1967 short Six Men <b>Getting</b> <b>Sick</b> (Six Times), an animated film which blended elements of sculpture and painting into its animation. His first feature-length project, 1977's Eraserhead, became a cult film and launched his commercial career. It also marked his first collaboration with Jack Nance, an actor who would appear in many more of Lynch's productions {{until his death in}} 1996. Lynch's other feature films include the critically successful The Elephant Man (1980), Blue Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive (2001), all of which went on to earn Academy Award nominations; and the commercial flop Dune.|$|E
