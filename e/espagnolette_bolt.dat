25|$|A garden door {{resembles a}} French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the {{operating}} door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch {{is located at the}} wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an <b>espagnolette</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E
25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An <b>espagnolette</b> <b>bolt</b> may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
