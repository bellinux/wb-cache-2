500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to pull the trigger. You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Following singer Taylor Swift's win for {{the music}} video [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and {{declared}} that singer Beyoncé deserved the award for her [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] video. He declared, [...] "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm {{going to let you}} finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." [...] West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident. Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from an US urban radio station commented: [...] "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate." [...] Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I can hear him talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E

6000|$|... 'However,' said Mr. Pickwick, endeavouring {{to reassure}} himself, 'I must {{do the best}} <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> must <b>see</b> <b>him</b> to-night, for I {{faithfully}} promised to do so. If they persist in accompanying me, I must make the interview as brief as possible, and be content that, for their own sakes, they will not expose themselves.' ...|$|R

60|$|I {{must look}} after my father. I shall go and live near the--prison, so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{whenever}} it's possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, sir. He can go {{on doing}} it, and come up to his work {{just as well as}} not. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> to <b>him</b> then, and he won't be a care to any one," [...] said Mrs. Moss, heartily.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{no concern}} of mine. Of course, being nearer heaven than I am, he sees clearer {{what he should}} say and do than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> for <b>him.</b> Oh, Mr. Will, that's not a man, he's an angel of God; but he's dying, Mr. Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laddy, I--I'm afraid Thorne's done for," [...] whispered Gale. [...] "He's lying {{over there}} in that crack. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> part of <b>him.</b> He doesn't move." ...|$|R

6000|$|MABEL, You {{always make}} me feel so Irish. Is it because you're so English, d'you think? Ah! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> moving his ears. Now he's pawing the ground--He's started! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Lord! Fast? Miss Majesty, there hain't {{ever been}} anythin' except {{a streak of}} lightnin' run so fast in this country.

60|$|MARCHBANKS (passionately). No, answer me. I want to know: I MUST know. I can't {{understand}} it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{nothing in}} <b>him</b> but words, pious resolutions, what people call goodness. You can't love that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never {{think at}} all, Cora. Oh! what has brought him here? I don't know how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> dare to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again; {{and yet he}} is not gone, is he?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A monster. He has an {{electric}} {{light on the}} end of his tail, so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> very plainly. And the other people are all riding upon his back." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [going {{past the}} nurse to Mangan's side, and {{inspecting}} him less credulously than Mazzini]. Nonsense! {{he is not}} dead: he is only asleep. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> breathing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was lunching here to-day and {{attended}} {{one of the}} waiters who was taken ill afterwards. I should be very glad to know if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> for a few moments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do what I can," [...] he promised. [...] "Mr. Ware isn't {{the first}} {{man in the world}} who has funked the limelight, and from what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> of <b>him</b> it {{probably}} wasn't his fault if things did go a little crooked in the past. I'll do my best, Miss Dalstan, I promise you that. I'll look in at the club to-night and drop a few hints around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Bounderby,' said Harthouse, {{perfectly}} {{hearing this}} under- strain {{as it went}} on; 'your brother's face is quite familiar to me. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> abroad? Or at some public school, perhaps?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, I cannot help my looks. I am a {{merchant}} of London, Castell by name. It is one {{well known in}} Seville and throughout this land, where I have large dealings, as, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> your king himself will acknowledge. Be not deceived by our dress, which {{we had to put}} on in order to escape from Granada, but, I beseech you, let us go on to Seville." ...|$|R
6000|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If I {{glance over}} my {{shoulder}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> And if I catch his eye--and usually I catch his eye--it meets me with an expression---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{wanted to}} see you. Looks as if Bob was a fool, in one way, but I guess <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> through what he's up against on the prairie better than you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall teach school. I believe I {{can get a}} position, in a {{place where}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> often. I can break his heart, Miss Lucretia, I--I can bring sadness to myself, but I will not desert him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hurry to}} {{the bow of}} the boat, and find not George, but the irrepressible Wise, sitting on a coil of rope, a little dirtier and rather more {{dilapidated}} than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember having <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{has this}} evil spirit gone to?" [...] thought Otter; [...] "he must be near, and yet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> nothing of <b>him.</b> Perhaps he lives further up the cave"; and he crept a pace or two forward and again {{peered into the}} gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, else how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> Don't {{let that}} kid tag on behind, for it's mighty {{dangerous}} {{to be on}} the street with her. That advertisement about you had in it that you was last seen with a little girl." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> now, as the {{twilight}} settled {{down over the}} wilderness, his honest face red and freckled, but aglow with the tenderness it had hidden during the day, one big hand enfolding hers, {{and the other on}} my shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh," [...] was Billy's comment, as he {{went over}} the mite's {{wardrobe}} {{and came back to}} center on the little knit shirts, [...] "they look more like a real kid than the whole kit an' caboodle. Why, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in them regular manshirts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is too," [...] contradicted Peter. [...] "I saw {{him with}} my own eyes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> now. He's sitting in that tree over yonder this very minute. He's all black, so of course {{he must be a}} member of the Blackbird family." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The climax to Australia's Grand Slam {{success in}} the United Kingdom in 1984 took place at Murrayfield and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>see</b> <b>him</b> joining a {{counter-attack}} from his own '22', igniting Steve Tuynman, gathering in Tuynman's inside pass then taking off at such a rate of knots that John Beattie, a British Lion in New Zealand in 1983, just never looked like preventing him from scoring. The great man was accorded a massive ovation from the Murrayfield crowd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That ring," [...] {{said the}} Queen, [...] "was a small token I gave {{him to make}} amends for his spoiled mantle. Come, Paget, let us see what use he has made of it, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> through <b>him</b> already. He is a marvellously sharp-witted spirit." [...] They went to the spot, within sight of which, but at some distance, the young {{cavalier}} still lingered, as the fowler watches the net which he has set. The Queen approached the window, on which Raleigh had used her gift to inscribe the following line:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the same}} {{narrative}} chain, Al-Baqir narrated the following on {{the authority of}} Jabir: Almighty has a treasure in Taloqan; it is of neither gold nor silver but consists of twelve thousand (men) in Khurasan, having “Ahmad Ahmad” for emblem. They will be led by a Hashemite young man riding a gray mule and wearing a red headband. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>see</b> <b>him</b> crossing the Euphrates; should you hear of his coming, rush to him {{even if you have}} to crawl over the snow..|$|R
