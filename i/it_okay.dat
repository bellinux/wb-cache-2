500|$|Vogue {{stated in}} 2014 that [...] "Cobain pulled liberally from {{both ends of}} a woman’s and a man’s wardrobe, and his Seattle thrift-store look ran the gamut of {{masculine}} lumberjack workwear and 40s-by-way-of-70s feminine dresses. It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny." [...] Cobain's way of dressing [...] "was {{the antithesis of the}} macho American man", because he [...] "...made it cooler to look slouchy and loose, no matter if you were a boy or a girl." [...] Music and culture writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that with Cobain's style of dress “Not only did he make <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to be a freak, he made it desirable." ...|$|E

USA Todays Jerry Shriver gave it 2 out of 4 stars and viewed The-Dream and Tricky Stewart's production as [...] "sometimes incompatible with their client's soft, breathy (and pleasant) pop voice". New York Daily News writer Jim Farber criticized the album's producers, writing that the production resulted in Ciara's soft [...] "R vocals turned to mush on badly produced album". Ken Copabianco of The Boston Globe {{described it as a}} [...] "safe, rote effort" [...] and stated [...] "Some songs are tart and have attitude but many are nondescript. The emotionally demanding cuts lack conviction". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "she hasn't the gravity to carry off lesser songs" [...] and called the album [...] "a personalized mea culpa that's meant to make <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to like Ciara again, a feat that remains beyond her limited powers of persuasion". MTV UK's Joseph Patterson criticized some of its sexual themes, but described the album [...] "as a credible comeback from a classy lady who it seems is having a bit of an identity crisis", concluding that [...] "With it, Ciara has shown just enough that she knows how to stay current without forgetting her roots, only it comes a little late".|$|E

5000|$|Since 2005 Dicko and his {{business}} partner and manager, David Wilson, had been developing a new TV series talk show. The series placed three celebrities before a live studio audience where they were asked tricky moral questions such as, [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to monitor your children online?" [...] or [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to dress up a Hitler at a fancy dress party?". The celebrities had to answer yes or no to the questions with no in-between. The idea for the show was pitched to TV networks several times throughout 2005-2009, and each time the show was rejected. In 2010 Dicko and David partnered with TV producer and presenter Andrew Denton to co-produce the show. It was then re-pitched to Network Ten, where Dicko acted as a host in the meeting and the executives played the celebrity contestants. The show was bought within that pitch meeting and would then be called Can of Worms.|$|E

Lin declared this in response to press reports that Chen accused Lee Teng-hui of embezzling NT$ 1.6 billion from the national coffers when interrogated by prosecutors of his corruption scandals, but then immediately asked his lawmaker to deny the accusation after prosecutors confirmed that Chen did file the accusation against Lee. Lin said that Lee should face legal prosecution if he was really involved in the corruption scandal as accused by Chen, also adding that if Chen ratted on Lee's embezzlement scandal based on a sense of justice, [...] "why is <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> for him to embezzle {{a tremendous amount of}} money, and why is <b>it</b> <b>okay</b> to accuse Lee and then deny the accusation?" [...] "Such a ratting practice by Chen is designed mainly to divert public attention away from his corruption cases," [...] Lin said.|$|E
