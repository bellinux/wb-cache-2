25|$|<b>Keep</b> <b>It</b> <b>Together</b> is {{an album}} by the band Guster, {{released}} in June 2003. The album was recorded from 2001 to 2003 in Bearsville, New York, New York City, Burbank, California, and Shokan, New York. This {{is the first}} album by Guster with Brian Rosenworcel on kit drums instead of hand percussion. <b>Keep</b> <b>It</b> <b>Together</b> went through several working titles, including Bitch Magic, Olympia Dukakis and Come Downstairs & Say Hello.|$|E
500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is {{influenced}} by the Sly and the Family Stone track [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971). It starts as the sound of slap bass plays along with sequenced synth bass, as Madonna sings the opening lines, [...] "Keep, <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> keep people together forever and ever". As the first verse starts, a guitar comes into play with Madonna's voice being backed by percussion and banjo. After the second chorus comes near the end, Madonna utters the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They hold the key, To your heart and your soul, Don't forget that your family is gold", the percussion sound is thinned out and a mixture of the sound from a live drummer and conga comes into the picture. The song ends with the main groove sound gradually fading out.|$|E
500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. [...] In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E

500|$|Soon after this, two sticks from 7 Independent Company were {{despatched}} to Marymount, led by {{a deputy}} intelligence officer who began sending them out on more regular night patrols. The following months were {{a disaster for the}} locally based Rhodesian forces; first one stick fired on another, causing an injury, then a BSAP Land Rover hit a mine, killing two members of the French company. A further Frenchman died in an ambush by insurgents before another friendly fire incident on 19 April 1978 resulted in a fatality. On several occasions during this bush trip the area was [...] "frozen"; regular army units were confined to their camps while the Selous Scouts operated against the guerrillas. With morale amongst the Frenchmen plummeting, bringing their unit close to collapse, its officers at Rusambo frantically worked to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> The company did not last much longer once back in Salisbury for R Soon after three of its troopers were placed in detention at Llewellin Barracks, the unit was formally dissolved in May 1978. The only personnel retained by the Army were the interpreters, who were returned to their former units.|$|E
500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Every guest {{musician}} on <b>Keep</b> <b>It</b> <b>Together</b> {{was forced}} to record a take on the song [...] "Backyard". The rule was they could only record one take, and they must {{have no knowledge of}} the song before they began recording.|$|E

5000|$|They {{are unique}} on the Mexican music scene with their music being called world beat, cumbia grupero and rap [...] but, their musical style crosses various genres and can combine any number {{including}} hip-hop, reggae, norteño, cumbia, rock-and-roll, polka, huapango and vallenato. Much of what <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> are Latin folk rhythms {{and the use}} of accordion licks. The band has called their work“freestyle norteño popular;” however, founder Tony Hernandez strongly links the music to rock as he says that rock showed that mixing genres is possible and they maintain rock’s rebellious nature.|$|R
2500|$|After Theodore's {{marriage}} to Edith Kermit Carow, Alice {{was raised by}} her father and stepmother. Theodore and Edith's five children were Theodore III (Ted), Kermit, Ethel, Archibald (Archie), and Quentin. They remained married {{until his death in}} January 1919. During much of Alice's childhood, Bamie was a remote figure who eventually married and moved to London for a time. But later, as Alice became more independent and came into conflict with her father and stepmother, Aunt [...] "Bye" [...] provided needed structure and stability.

60|$|There {{were many}} things in Battle's hut {{gathered}} together for traffic and pleasure in his journey: a great necklace of Gunga's or Pongo's teeth; a bagful of Cassary beads, which change colour with the hour, a bolt-eyed Joojoo head, a bird-billed throwing-knife, also beads of Estridges' eggs, {{as large as a}} small melon. There was also, what Battle cherished very carefully, a little fat book of 566 pages and nine woodcuts that his mother had given him before setting out on his hapless voyagings, with a tongue or clasp of brass to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> Moreover, Battle gave Nod a piece of looking-glass, the like of which he had never seen before. And the little Mulgar would often sit sorrowfully talking to his image in the glass, and bid the face that there answered his own be off and find his brothers. And Nod, in return, gave Battle for a keepsake the little Portingal's left-thumb knuckle-bone and half the faded Coccadrillo saffron which old Mishcha had given to him.|$|E

60|$|But Mrs. Woodward, {{though she}} had {{consulted}} her daughters, had arguments of her own in favour of Captain Cuttwater's proposition, which she had not yet made known to them. Good-humoured and happy as she always was, she had her cares in the world. Her income was only £400 a year, and that, now that the Income Tax had settled down on it, was barely sufficient for her modest wants. A moiety of this died with her, and the remainder would be but a poor support for her three daughters, if {{at the time of}} her death it should so chance that she should leave them in want of support. She had always regarded Captain Cuttwater as a probable source of future aid. He was childless and unmarried, and had not, as far as she was aware, another relative in the world. It would, therefore, under any circumstances, be bad policy to offend him. But the letter in which he had made his offer had been of a very peculiar kind. He had begun by saying that he was to be turned out of his present berth by a d---- Whig Government on account of his age, he being as young a man as ever he had been; that it behoved him to look out for a place of residence, in which he might live, and, if it should so please God, die also. He then said that he expected to pay £200 a year for his board and lodging, which he thought might as well go to his niece as to some shark, who would probably starve him. He also said that, poor as he was and always had been, he had contrived to scrape together a few hundred pounds; that he was well aware that if he lived among strangers he should be done out of every shilling of it; but that if his niece would receive him, he hoped to be able to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> for the benefit of his grand-nieces, &c.|$|E
