40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel phase-shift arctangent (PSA) interpolation method {{to improve the}} measurement accuracy of a planar capacitive incremental displacement sensor. Signals of planar capacitive micro-sensors acquire waveform errors, including sensitivity differences and phase-shift errors, because of static errors and dynamic disturbances. In the proposed PSA scheme, such errors are removed completely by loading a particular arctangent function. Moreover, measuring efficiency of the proposed planar capacitive sensors is improved by combining coarse measurement and fine estimation. Experiments show unanimous results to model-based <b>fitting.</b> When electrode <b>length</b> is four times the gap distance, applying the PSA interpolation method decreases waveform errors from more than 4 % to 1. 72 %...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} and characterizes an algorithm for the nonambiguous {{reduction of}} multiexponentially decaying luminescence signals to scalar values of corresponding calibration temperatures. Previous evaluation schemes in phosphor thermometry {{make use of}} an intermediate step, where data reduction is achieved by fitting a model equation to phosphorescence decays in order to translate one or more ﬁtting parameters into temperature. However, every slight mismatch between model equation and experimental data may lead to substantial errors in connection to noise-related inaccuracies during the retrieval of adequate ﬁtting windows. Additionally, {{there is a need}} for ﬁtting windows, capable of automatically adapting to largely varying signal time scales. In this context, the authors propose to set the <b>ﬁtting</b> window <b>length</b> according to the time where the signal falls below a given percentage of the initial intensity. In comparison to fitting windows, deﬁned by multiple decay times, modeling results suggest substantial precision beneﬁts for as long as signal-to-noise ratios stay above 4. Nevertheless, by comparing signal shapes of measured curves directly with a library of temperature-calibrated decay signals, all necessary assumptions on the mathematical description of measured signals become redundant and evaluation errors connected to uncertain ﬁtting windows are largely circumvented. Resulting capabilities of the proposed signal shape recognition method (SSR) in terms of temperature precision and accuracy were compared to a conventional least-squares fitting approach, using a set of temperaturecalibrated phosphorescence decay signals from CdWO 4. Accordingly, the SSR algorithm was found to reduce statistical temperature errors by at least 9 %...|$|R
