50|$|<b>Humins</b> are a {{class of}} organic {{compounds}} that are insoluble in water at all pH's. The term is used in two related contexts, in soil chemistry and saccharide chemistry. These dark brown solids are inhomogenous and their structures are often vaguely described.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of polymers {{in this way}} accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen. The smallest units are the fulvic acids, the medium units are the humic, and the largest units are the <b>humins.</b> When organic matter is contemporaneously deposited with geologic material, subsequent sedimentation and progressive burial or overburden provide significant pressure and a temperature gradient. When these humic precursors are subjected to sufficient geothermal pressures for sufficient geologic time, they begin to undergo certain specific changes to become kerogen. Such changes are indicative of the maturity stage of a particular kerogen. These changes include loss of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, which leads to loss of other functional groups that further promote isomerization and aromatization which are associated with increasing depth or burial. Aromatization then allows for neat molecular stacking in sheets, which in turn increases molecular density and vitrinite reflectance properties, as well as changes in spore coloration, characteristically from yellow to orange to brown to black with increasing depth.|$|E
40|$|During the acid-catalyzed {{dehydration}} {{of carbohydrates}} {{for the production}} of renewable bulk chemicals, such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and levulinic acid, large amounts of carbonaceous, insoluble by-products are typically formed by cross-polymerization reactions of HMF and several sugar-dehydration intermediates. The formation of these so-called <b>humins</b> leads to great efficiency losses in biorefinery operations. Although produced in abundance, the molecular structure of <b>humins</b> and their mechanism of formation are not yet unequivocally established. Detailed knowledge of both is required, however, to either prevent their formation or to find routes for the valorization of <b>humins,</b> which would both increase the economic feasibility of future biorefineries. The work described in this PhD thesis aims for {{a better understanding of the}} mechanism of formation and molecular structure of humin by-products and explores possible routes for the catalytic valorization of <b>humins.</b> The formation of both <b>humins</b> and platform chemicals from different sugars and a raw feed was studied by a multi-parameter and multi-technique approach. The <b>humins</b> formed were extensively characterized using SEM, elemental analysis, solid-state NMR, IR and pyrolysis-GC-MS. This showed that the <b>humins</b> have a furan-rich, HMF- derived structure, which is formed via a dehydration pathway. The yield and molecular structure of the <b>humins</b> strongly depends on feed stock and processing conditions. The use of thick juice, a sucrose-rich intermediate form sugar beet refinery, as a feed led to high HMF selectivity and low <b>humins</b> yields compared to purified sucrose. The catalytic valorization of <b>humins</b> is furthermore hampered by the general insolubility of <b>humins,</b> as it limits catalyst-substrate interaction. The solubility of <b>humins</b> was therefore improved by an alkaline pretreatment method and the effect of reaction conditions on average molecular weight of glucose-derived <b>humins</b> was monitored by GPC. Xylose- and fructose-derived <b>humins</b> were shown to be more recalcitrant to the alkaline pretreatment. Extensive characterization of the alkali-treated <b>humins</b> showed that an arene-rich structure is formed at the expense of furan content during alkaline pretreatment. The molecular structure of 13 C-labeled <b>humins</b> is studied in further detail by complementary 1 D and 2 D solid-state NMR studies. A combination of 1 D 13 C NMR, 2 D 1 H- 13 C and 2 D 13 C- 13 C NMR was applied using direct excitation and cross polarization techniques.

We also demonstrate the difference in humin structure observed when <b>humins</b> are formed from HMF, fructose, or glucose. This difference is mainly observed in a new peak that appears at 1650 cm- 1 that is ascribed to HMF incorporated in the <b>humins.</b> This peak is consumed {{over the course of}} the reaction, and at 100 % conversion of HMF the peak disappears entirely. Lastly, we fit humin structures proposed in the literature to the FTIR data we collected, and find that the structures proposed by Lund et al. and by Weckhuysen et al. appear to be the most consistent with our data. A novel experimental technique measuring humin formation was developed by using in situ DLS. We have been able to measure the activation energy of humin formation directly with this technique, and found activation energies between 18 ??? 55 kJ/mol. We attribute the differences between our measured values and previously reported values mostly to transport limitations in the DLS cell. The results from these two studies need to be synthesized further via increased physical and chemical mechanistic understanding. Chemical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} adsorption of micronutrients in <b>humin</b> and to verify the ability to release these elements in water. The first step was to determine the adsorption capacity of <b>humin</b> for several essential plant micronutrients and check the kinetic parameters. The order of adsorption was Zn < Ni < Co < Mn < Mo < Cu < Fe, whereas Zn showed maximum values of ca. 2. 5 mg g- 1 and Fe values of ca. 0. 5 mg g- 1 for systems containing 1 g of <b>humin.</b> Iron presented higher percentages of release (ca. 100 %) and Co the lowest percentages (0. 14 %). The findings suggested that the use of <b>humin</b> enriched with micronutrients can be a promising alternative for the fertilization of agricultural soils, with the additional benefit of incorporating organic matter present in the form of humic substances into the soil and improving the agricultural productivity. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Química...|$|R
40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) {{are major}} components of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM). Advances on characterization of HS and their interaction with minerals can provide a more fundamental understanding of HS functions in soils. The objectives of this research were to investigate potential fractionation of humic acid (HA) upon adsorption on minerals and to determine any variation on structure and sorption properties of <b>humin</b> extracted by different methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, for the first time, provided direct evidence that HA was fractionated during adsorption on mineral surfaces. Aliphatic fractions of HA were preferentially adsorbed while aromatic fractions {{were more likely to}} be left in solution. The bound HA fractions had higher sorption linearity (N) and affinity (KOC) for phenanthrene than the source HA. For montmorillonite and kaolinite, the KOC values of adsorbed HA were up to several times higher than that of the source HA as a result of fractionation. Extraction procedures had substantial influences in structure and sorption characteristics of <b>humin.</b> <b>Humin</b> from 0. 1 M NaOH exhaustive extraction and 6 M HF/HCl extraction at 60 °C had relatively more aliphatic components as compared with 1 M HF extracted <b>humin.</b> The treatment of 6 M HF/HCl at 60 °C reduced more than 50 % carbohydrate components (50 - 108 ppm) and enriched amorphous poly(methylene) domains. The NaOH exhaustively extracted <b>humin</b> had the most nonlinear sorption isotherms and the HF extracted <b>humin</b> had the lowest KOC. We concluded that both NaOH and NaOH-HF procedures were appropriate approaches for <b>humin</b> extraction but the extraction with 6 M HF/HCl at 60 °C would be discouraged for use due to structural modifications of <b>humin</b> both chemically and physically. Segmental mobility of HA in solution was also explored by NMR relaxation. Proton spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) of HAs ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 8 s in d 6 -DMSO, and from 0. 26 to 2. 3 s in 0. 5 M NaOD at 300 MHz. Proton correlation time of HA in solvents was in an order of 10 - 10 s. Carbohydrate was identified as the largest and the most immobile components while aliphatic and aromatic fragments were relatively smaller and more mobile in aqueous solution. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree <b>humin</b> samples, {{one from}} a calcic soil (Marais de Rochefort, MAT) and two from two horizons of a calcic peat (Marais Poitevin, MP 35 and MP 79), both from the Western part of France, were transalkylated using CF 3 SO 3 H as {{catalyst}} and benzene as acceptor and solvent. The reaction, used previously to study the kerogen of ancient sediments, was applied {{for the first time}} to <b>humin.</b> The main series of products were alkyl benzenes, phenyl-substituted fatty acids, 1, 1 -diphenylalkanes, diphenyl-substituted fatty acids, alkyl naphthalenes and aliphatic compounds. The alkyl benzenes indicate the presence of alkyl chain substituents on the aromatic part of the <b>humin</b> matrix. Acidic chains were also identified as substituents, unlike previous results for kerogen. The filiation between phenyl- and diphenyl-substituted compounds, demonstrated in the case of kerogen, could not be observed for the <b>humin</b> samples. However, as a result of the high amount of mineral matter in the MAT sample, alkyl naphthalenes undoubtedly originated from alkyl benzenes via alkyl tetralins, as observed in the case of kerogen...|$|R
