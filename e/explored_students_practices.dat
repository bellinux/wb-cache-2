40|$|Even though {{recurring}} {{criticism has}} been directed against the academic part of teacher education, little {{research has focused on}} student teachers as they engage in their academic studies. Reporting on a study of 53 Norwegian student teachers, this article <b>explores</b> <b>student</b> teachers’ reading <b>practices</b> in university courses in education. The study draws on the notion of approaches to learning as a particularly influential perspective in research on higher education. The findings reveal that the student teachers predominantly apply a deep approach to learning (with the aim to understand) and that writing academic texts in particular acts as an enabler of this approach. However, the participants also reported considerable difficulties with reading pedagogical literature. The article suggests that, {{in order to understand the}} persistent criticism against teacher education, there is a need to pay explicit attention to supporting student teachers in dealing with different text genres and texts from different academic disciplines. It also suggests that the important factor in students’ engagement with theory is not necessarily that it can be used immediately in the classroom, but that they recognise themselves as persons. Finally, the article raises a question about the balance between breadth and depth in the university courses...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Curriculum and InstructionFrederick BurrackThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to discover influences that guide practice habits of collegiate instrumental music <b>students,</b> <b>explore</b> <b>student</b> self-discovery of <b>practice</b> needs, and create strategies {{that can be used to}} improve the quality of students’ individual music practice. To best address these intentions, three unique yet sequential studies were implemented. The Discovery study focused on the uncovering prior experiences that shaped students’ practice habits before entering college to get an idea of how current practice habits were formed. The Video Self-Confrontation study had participants watch a video recording of a practice sessions to address possible gaps between their perception and the reality of their practice habits. The video self-confrontation prompted discussion about possibilities for enhanced practice skills. The Intervention study expanded upon information from previous studies to develop and administer personalized interventions designed to address weaknesses and identify effect on participants’ practice habits. Independent practice, the time after instruction when a student works toward mastery of skills or concepts, is widely recognized as a critical component of improvement in the performance music. These studies aim to help bridge the gap between practice theories and optimal experiences. These studies explored elements related to practice behavior. Because each person had unique experiences and diverse ways to describe their experiences, a methodology for each study was required that allowed for structured data collection and organization. As such, the constructivist paradigm supported these studies...|$|R

40|$|This curricular project <b>explores</b> how <b>students</b> used Google online environments {{to sustain}} the aspects of sociocultural {{learning}} through student collaboration and dialogue instrumental in the math classroom. The students in this project were from two tenth-grade Algebra 1 classes in a culturally diverse San Diego public high school. Using knowledge-building principles, online dialogue and collaborative activities were created to increase <b>student</b> <b>practice</b> of algebra at home and to increase both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Theories of motivation regarding student choice, flexible environments, and receiving feedback were integral factors in this project design. The research found the online Google environments equitably accessed by all students - particularly {{students with learning disabilities}} and students from minority populations. Additionally, more <b>students</b> <b>practiced</b> algebra at home during implementation. The data showed that students used Google activities for knowledge sharing and problem solving in math. The results from pre and post- implementation assessments found the greatest overall improvement from students who participated online as well as evidence of narrowing achievement gaps in mathematical performances between student populations. While Google was not a substitute for classroom instruction, it did promote student peripheral participation (Lave and Wenger, 1991) in a learning community for algebra. The activities described in this project are not specific to algebra but can be applied to other math class as well as to different subject area...|$|R
