5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> District Board in 1894, began a {{programme}} {{of urban}} improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased {{for the building}} of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the Basin {{community}} formed {{water and}} sewer districts and, using federal grants to cover about 60percent of the costs, built a water delivery, sewage, and waste-handling system. By 1990, Interstate 15 <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> entire length of U.S. Route 91 in the state. The centerline of the Interstate followed the track of the former Great Northern Railway through town.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} British politics, the {{declaration}} {{resulted from the}} coming into power of Lloyd George and his Cabinet, which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> H. H. Asquith led-Cabinet in December 1916. Whilst both Prime Ministers were Liberals and both governments were wartime coalitions, Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, had favoured its reform.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} trip to a bowl {{sponsored}} by the newly formed Bowl Championship Series—which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Bowl Alliance—the No. 2 Hokies returned to New Orleans to face Bobby Bowden's No. 1 1999 Florida State Seminoles football team for the national championship. The Seminoles had narrowly lost the 1999 BCS National Championship Game to the Tennessee Volunteers and were looking to polish off an undefeated season by beating Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|On January 6, 1986, the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission (which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Highway Commission) {{approved}} rerouting US-60/SH-11 on {{the east}} side of Pawhuska. While the two highways still passed through Pawhuska from west to east, after turning north, the new route bypassed much of the city. The application for this alteration was submitted to AASHTO on September 22, received the same day, and approved on November 8.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|A mid-table {{finish in}} 1970–71 meant {{that for the}} first time in four years Manchester City did not qualify for Europe. The {{following}} year, a fourth-placed league finish gave the club a berth in the UEFA Cup for the first time. The UEFA Cup <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Fairs Cup in 1971, when control of the competition transferred to UEFA. City's debut in the competition was a short one. Drawn against a Valencia side managed by Alfredo Di Stéfano, City were bounced out in the 2nd leg at the Mestalla 3-2,despite producing a pulsating 2–2 draw at Maine Road in the 1st leg.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|Following his triumph, Germanicus {{was sent}} to Asia to reorganize the provinces and kingdoms of Asia, which were in such disarray that the {{attention}} of a domus Augusta was deemed necessary to settle matters. Germanicus was given imperium maius (extraordinary command) over the other governors and commanders of the area he was to operate; however, Tiberius <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> governor of Syria with Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was meant to be his helper (adiutor), but turned out to be hostile. According to Tacitus, this was an attempt to separate Germanicus from his familiar troops and weaken his influence, but the historian Richard Alston says Tiberius had little reason to undermine his heir.|$|E
5|$|Historically the {{constituency}} covered {{only the}} city of Bath, however it was enlarged into some outlying areas between 1997 and 2010. The constituency since 2010 once again covers exactly {{the city of}} Bath (it is co-extensive with the unparished area), and is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse who beat Conservative Ben Howlett at the 2017 general election. Howlett <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> retiring Liberal Democrat Don Foster at the 2015 general election. Foster's election was a notable result of the 1992 general election, as Chris Patten, the previous Member (and Cabinet Minister) played a major part, as Chairman of the Conservative Party, in re-electing the government of John Major, but failed to defend his marginal seat.|$|E

5|$|Independence grew {{quickly when}} more gold {{was found in}} the nearby mountains. Within two years of its {{settlement}} permanent buildings <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> original tents, and a mining concern from Leadville had bought up all the claims. In two years they produced gold worth $190,000 ($ in modern dollars), funding the construction of a stamping mill and sawmill. In Aspen, further down the valley, silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence's gold. B. Clark Wheeler, an early investor in those mines, funded the construction of a stage road to Leadville, the first road to cross the pass. It opened in November 1881, with winter already in full swing at the pass.|$|E
5|$|Railroads {{reached their}} {{maturity}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the industrialized countries of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.|$|E
5|$|The first clear {{reference}} {{to the use of}} the Highland bagpipes is from a French history, which mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. George Buchanan claimed that they <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone.|$|E

5|$|With Soishiro Satake, Maeda {{formed the}} head of the second {{generation}} of Kodokan judoka, which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> first {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. Satake, at 175cm and 80kg, was unmatched in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself was not able to match Maeda in judo. Satake would later travel to South America with Maeda and settle in Manaus, Amazonas State, while Maeda continued traveling. Satake would become the founder, in 1914, of the first historically registered judo academy in Brazil. He and Maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's brother, John II Casimir, {{commanded}} {{one of the}} regiments in {{the relief}} army. Another notable commander was the Field Crown Hetman, Marcin Kazanowski. King Władysław IV, a great supporter of the modernization of the Commonwealth army, {{proved to be a}} good tactician, and his innovations in the use of artillery and fortifications based on Western ideas greatly contributed to the eventual Polish-Lithuanian success. He <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> old arquebusiers with musketeers, and standardized the Commonwealth artillery (introducing 3- to 6-pounder regimental guns), both to great effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
