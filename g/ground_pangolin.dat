50|$|The {{lifespan}} of the pangolin is unknown, but {{the observed}} lifespan in captivity is 20 years. They are sexually dimorphic, with the males being 10-50% heavier than females. No defined mating season is known, but pangolins tend to mate {{during the summer}} and autumn. The gestation period ranges up to 139 days for <b>ground</b> <b>pangolins</b> and other African species. African species females usually birth only one offspring, but litters of three have been observed in Asian species. When born, a pangolin has soft, pale scales, which begin to harden by the second day. The young are usually about 6 in long and about 12 oz at birth. They are nursed by their mothers for 3 to 4 months, but begin eating termites after only one month. Pangolins reach sexual maturity at 2 years old, when they leave their mothers and begin living alone.|$|R

40|$|All {{previous}} behavioural {{studies of}} Temminck’s <b>ground</b> <b>pangolins</b> (Smutsia temminckii) {{have focused on}} populations in mesic regions. We examined home range size, activity periods, habitat selectivity and refuge site selection of 13 individuals over {{three years in the}} Kalahari Desert of South Africa, near {{the western edge of the}} species’ range. Kernel home ranges of adults averaged 6. 5 ± 5. 9 km², while juveniles had average home ranges of 6. 1 ± 4. 0 km². Reliable prediction of 95 % of the Kernel home range required 88 ± 67. 7 tracking days. No significant habitat selectivity was observed. Earthen burrows were the most frequently used refuge type. The time at which activity commenced varied seasonally as well as among individuals, with an increase in diurnal activity during winter. Young pangolins also displayed more diurnal activity compared to adults. Individuals spent 5. 7 ± 2. 0 hours per 24 -hour cycle outside of refuges, with no significant seasonal variation. Juvenile dispersal peaked during mid-summer, with individuals travelling up to 49 km from their natal areas. We estimate a breeding density of 0. 16 individuals/km 2 and a total density of 0. 31 individuals/km 2 for our study area. Our data suggest that activity patterns, movements and refuge selection is similar across the species’ southern African range, but that densities may be higher in the Kalahari compared to populations in more mesic eastern areas.

50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>{{pangolin}}</b> (Smutsia temminckii), {{also known}} as Temminck's pangolin or the Cape pangolin, {{is one of four}} species of pangolins which can be found in Africa, and the only one in southern and eastern Africa.

50|$|Little {{is known}} about the pangolin, as it is {{difficult}} to study in the wild. Pangolins are solitary animals and only interact for mating. They dig and live in deep burrows made of semispherical chambers. These burrows are large enough for humans to crawl into and stand up. Although it is capable of digging its own burrow, the <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> prefers to occupy those abandoned by warthogs or aardvarks or to lie in dense vegetation, making it even more difficult to observe. African pangolins such as the <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> prefer burrows, while Asian pangolins sleep in hollows and forks of trees and logs. They are nocturnal animals. They mark their territory with urine, secretions, and by scattering their feces. When threatened, their defense mechanism is to curl into a ball with their scales outward, hiss and puff, and lash out with their sharp-edged tails. The scales on the tails are capable of a cutting action to inflict serious wounds. Pangolins are also capable of emitting noxious acid from glands near the anus, similar to a skunk, to ward off predators. The ground pangolin's main predators are leopards, hyenas, and humans. Young pangolins ride on the base of their mothers' tails and slip under the mother when she curls up for protection.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} groups of extant mammals have {{independently}} evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans, giant pangolins, the extinct giant ground sloths, numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied, are documented in the next section. Macropods {{are believed to have}} evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago.Bipedal movement is less common among mammals, most of which are quadrupedal.

50|$|The {{most diverse}} class of prey {{in the diet}} as known are mammals, with over 90 {{mammalian}} prey species reported. In the Cape Province, the 2.1 kg cape hare (Lepus capensis) reportedly dominates the prey selection, comprising about 53% of the foods selected. Other lagomorphs, namely the slightly smaller Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupestris), mildly larger African savanna hare (Lepus microtis) and the much larger 3.6 kg scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), are not infrequently taken both in {{and outside of the}} Cape area, but lagomorphs are not typically the main prey elsewhere. For the most part rodents are ignored as prey as they are probably too small despite martial eagles taking at times appreciable numbers of Cape (Xerus inauris) and unstriped ground squirrels (Xerus rutilus). However, rodents selected as prey have ranged in size from the 0.14 kg Southern African vlei rat (Otomys irroratus) to the 3.04 kg South African springhare (Pedetes capensis) and the 4 kg greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). There are records of predation on 0.28 kg (the second largest African bat) straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and galagos of various sizes (usually weighing a kilo or less) but otherwise mammalian prey they pursue tends to be relatively larger.Locally, large numbers are taken of any species of hyrax. The attractiveness of hyraxes as a prey resource may encourage martial eagles to vary their hunting techniques to potentially more time-consuming perch hunting so that they may capture rock hyraxes from rock formations and tree hyraxes from trees, contrary to their usual preference for capturing prey {{on the ground in the}} open after soaring high. Ranging in average mass from 2.2 to 3.14 kg, hyraxes can comprise a healthy meal for a family of martial eagle and are probably among the larger items that male eagles will regularly deliver to nests. Another miscellaneous mammal known to fall prey to martial eagles is the <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> (Smutsia temminckii), although it is not clear the age pangolins that are preyed on and how they are dispatched, considering that adults weigh some 11.6 kg and have a hard keratin shell that is capable of withstanding lion (Panthera leo) jaws when in its rolled-up defensive posture. Although far less accomplished and prolific as a predator of monkeys than the crowned eagle, the martial eagle has been known to prey on at least 14 species of monkey. The monkeys to turn up most often as martial eagle prey are grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and malbroucks (Chlorocebus cynosuros), with mean body masses of 2.8 kg, 4.12 kg and 4.53 kg, respectively, because of their savanna-woods dwelling habits, tendencies to forage on the ground and their primarily diurnal activity. Similarly, the larger Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), at 8.13 kg, also dwells in similar habitats and so may be subject to occasional predaceous attacks. There’s evidence that these monkey species have specific alarm calls, distinct from those uttered in response to the presence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) for example, specifically for martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to prey on mangabeys, Cercopithecus sp., colobus monkeys and guerezas, presumably around forest clearings, but these are probably quantitatively rare as prey given their forest-dwelling habits. Predatory attacks by martial eagles have been reported as well for every species of baboon, although either mostly or entirely on young ones, and even on young chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). It has been claimed that juvenile monkeys are the most often selected as prey by martial eagles, even for species as small as vervet monkeys but little comprehensive analysis is known on this (the most accomplished primate predator, the crowned eagle, in Uganda, selects adult monkeys 52% of the time, juveniles 48% of the time). On the hand, at times, martial eagles may at times be able to dispatch adult male monkeys weighing 9 kg or more, such as patas monkeys and Tana River mangabeys (Cercocebus galeritus), in seldom cases.|$|E
40|$|Throughout its range, Temminck’s <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin,</b> Smutsia temminckii, is {{becoming}} increasingly threatened, predominantly {{as a result of}} anthropogenic pressures. This species is currently listed as Vulnerable in South Africa and Least Concern globally, although many assessment criteria are data deficient and thus hamper an accurate assessment of its actual status. Current knowledge of the threats faced by Temminck’s <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> largely stem from a handful of ecological studies and ad hoc observations. Here we synthesize data on the known threats faced by this species in southern Africa and highlight a number of new threats not previously recognized. The main threats faced by this species include electrocution on electrified fences, the traditional medicine (muthi) trade, habitat loss, road mortalities, capture in gin traps, and potentially poisoning. Electrocutions arguably pose the greatest threat and mortality rates may be as high as one individual per 11 km of electrified fence per year. However, the magnitude of the threat posed by the muthi trade has not yet been quantified. Most southern African countries have adequate legislation protecting this species, although implementation is often lacking and in some instances the imposed penalties are unlikely to be a deterrent. We propose mitigating actions for many of the identified threats, although further research into the efficacy of these actions, and the development of additional mitigating procedures, is required.

40|$|Ground {{pangolins}} Smutsia temminckii are inconspicuous, mainly nocturnal mammals {{that occur}} at low population densities. As a result, there is scant information {{available on the}} ecology and physiology of this species. To date the handful of studies focussing on this species were centred in the mesic eastern regions of its range, with no attention being given to ecological and biological traits in arid environments. To address these data shortfalls, a study was undertaken in the Kalahari Desert in northwestern South Africa. Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters or Global Positioning System (GPS) loggers were fitted to 16 ground pangolins and their ecology and physiology studied {{over a period of}} three years. Throughout its range the <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> is increasingly endangered, predominantly due to anthropogenic threats. Previous studies have identified threats facing this species, but very few of these studies included quantitative data as to the extent of these threats. The present study suggests that the main threats to ground pangolins in southern Africa are electrocution on electrified fences, the traditional medicine trade, habitat loss, road mortalities and capture in gin traps. Although accidental poisoning has previously been viewed as a threat, a review of the available literature suggests {{that this is not the}} case and that these views stemmed from two isolated incidents of captive animals. Electrocutions probably pose the greatest threat to ground pangolins, with mortality rates of one pangolin per 11 km of electrified fence per year recorded during this study. Home range sizes of this arid-zone population are comparable to the home range sizes recorded in mesic populations. Study animals in the Kalahari had Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) home range values of 10. 0 ± 8. 9 km² SD for adults and 7. 1 ± 1. 1 km² SD for juveniles, in comparison to the 0. 17 – 23. 38 km² MCP in Zimbabwe and 1. 3 – 7. 9 km 2 MCP in mesic north-eastern South Africa. These results are surprising as arid-zone animals usually have larger home ranges than do their mesic counterparts. It is hypothesised that this discrepancy is due to the fact that ground pangolins in the Kalahari are on average 25 – 30 % smaller than their mesic counterparts. This smaller body size means that individuals require a smaller home range to meet their dietary requirements, which could be counteracting the trend of arid-zone individuals requiring larger home ranges. This research also found ground pangolins to be more active during the day in winter and nearly entirely nocturnal during summer. These changes in photoperiodicity are likely driven by adaptations to the extreme climatic conditions present at the study site rather than predation pressure or changes in food resources, although the latter may be playing a role as well. By being diurnal in winter, individuals avoid the extremely cold night-time temperatures, thus saving energy that would otherwise be spent on maintaining their body temperature. By contrast, becoming nocturnal in summer allows them to avoid the extreme daytime temperatures, thus conserving water. The results of this study reiterate previous findings that ground pangolins are entirely myrmecophagous and highly selective of the species that they eat. Study animals were recorded feeding on only four ant and two termite species, representing 7. 5 % and 50 % of the total species richness of each of these families. This is similar to previous research in mesic savannahs where five ant one termite species constituted 97 % of the ground pangolin’s diet. No seasonal differences in prey selection were observed, although the species consumed did depend on the habitats that were available to individual ground pangolins. This study is the first to investigate the core body temperature (Tb) of a free-ranging pangolin. These data indicated that Tb fluctuated cyclically between 32 – 35 °C and reflected the activity periods of the animal, peaking when the animal was active. When the individual was inactive, Tb steadily decreased, suggesting that it used daily heterothermy to cope with the low food availability in this unpredictable environment. In summary, ecological parameters between arid and mesic <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> populations are similar in some respects, but divergent in others. Arid-zone populations are smaller overall and show a higher degree of diurnal activity. Despite this smaller body size, home range values appear to be similar between arid and mesic populations. Although the prey species eaten by ground pangolins in the Kalahari differ from prey species in eastern South Africa and Zimbabwe, they belonged to the same genera and were of similar morphology and ecology. The core body temperature results confirm findings from previous captive studies that pangolin body temperatures are lower than those of other eutherian mammals of a similar size. Furthermore, these data indicate that core body temperature is a lot more variable than previously believed, and thus warrants further study. Overall <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> densities in the Kalahari appear to be double those in eastern South Africa and Zimbabwe, although it is unclear whether this is genuine or whether it is an artefact of individuals being easier to locate in the Kalahari. This study also confirmed that electrocutions are probably the greatest threat to this species, and new threats such as accidental capture in gin traps and road mortalities have also come to light.

40|$|The diet of Temminck’s <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> Smutsia temminckii (hereafter, pangolin) {{has thus}} far been studied only in mesic savannahs. We provide arid-zone dietary data for this species based on direct observations, and compare these to {{available}} prey species assemblages. We also report stable carbon and nitrogen isotope enrichment values for liver and scales compared to the diet. Pangolins were recorded consuming four ant (Anoplolepis steingroeveri, Camponotus fulvopilosus, two Crematogaster spp.) and one termite (Trinervitermes trinervoides) species, which represent 7. 5 and 25 % of the available ant and termite species, respectively. 2 The stable isotope data corroborate the direct observations and confirm that pangolins display {{a high degree of}} prey selectivity, however stable isotopes alone were not able to infer the diet of pangolins as a number of non-prey species had similar isotopic values to prey species. Direct observations suggest that these latter species are not preyed on, possibly because they have chemical or mechanical defences or gallery structures that make them unsuitable as prey. Liver was enriched by 3. 8 ± 1. 2 ‰ (mean ± SD) and 2. 5 ± 1. 4 ‰ for δ 15 N and δ 13 C, respectively, relative to the mean δ 15 N and δ 13 C values of the prey species, and scales were enriched by 2. 9 ± 1. 0 ‰ and 5. 3 ± 1. 8 ‰, respectively. We observed no seasonal variation or age or sex-related differences in diet, either from direct observations or isotope data. These results support previous findings that pangolins have further specialised within an already unusual mammalian dietary niche.

40|$|Keratinous {{materials}} are omnipresent, encompassing terrestrial, aerial and aquatic territories; they form diverse epidermal appendages and serve various interesting functions, triggering the curiosity {{of humans and}} inspiring the inventions of novel structures. Among these, pangolin scales and the feather shaft are systematically and analytically studied, answering the questions how the scales function as an armor and the shaft fulfills flight, which contribute to advancing the current knowledge of natural keratinous materials and providing valuable insights in developing new bioinspired designs. The pangolin is the only known mammal that has keratinous scales covering the main body. Arboreal and <b>ground</b> <b>pangolin</b> scales show an overlapping pattern in a hexagonal arrangement to provide multi-layered coverage. Scales show three regions in the solid interior that features flattened cells forming crossed lamellae, rarely seen in most keratinous materials. Two dimensional x-ray diffraction reveals the presence of α-helices and possible β-sheet, and the microfibrils are crossed {{in a range of}} directions. Scales show an interlocking interface between lamellae, which results from the suture-like cell membrane complex. Scales are transverse isotropic and show a strain-rate dependence, which favor the function in resisting external forces from multi-directions. The feather shaft, a naturally refined lightweight and stiff flight material, is distinguished in having a changing shape factor: circular at the calamus but square towards the distal rachis; this produces a tailored flexural stiffness along the shaft length fulfilling the local stress requirements. The cortex has a complex fibrous hierarchical structure, both making the shaft longitudinally strong, dorsal-ventrally stiff and torsionally rigid, yet capable of desirable deflection and twisting. Filling the cortex with foamy medulla introduces a synergistic strengthening and toughening mechanisms. Flexure of the shaft reveals decreasing flexural properties towards the distal end; nevertheless, the density-normalized flexural stiffness almost remains the same, and the specific flexural strength increases by 48 % at the distal shaft. Knowledge from the structure design of the feather shaft have potentials in developing aircraft materials and biomedical scaffolds...|$|E
