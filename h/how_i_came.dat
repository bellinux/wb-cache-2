2500|$|Jess Oppenheimer {{stated in}} his memoir, Laughs, Luck...and Lucy: <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Came</b> to Create the Most Popular Sitcom of All Time, {{that the initial}} plan was to match {{the sex of the}} Ricardo baby with Lucille Ball's real baby, {{inserting}} one of two alternate endings into the broadcast print at the very last minute. When logistical difficulties convinced Oppenheimer to abandon this plan, he advised Desi that as head writer, he would have Lucy Ricardo give birth to a boy. Desi agreed, telling Oppenheimer that Lucy had given him one girl, and might give him another—this might be his only chance to get a son. When the baby was born, Desi immediately called Oppenheimer and told him, [...] "Lucy followed your script. Ain't she something?", to which Oppenheimer replied [...] "Terrific! That makes me the greatest writer in the world!" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|His Bar Mitzvah {{speech was}} {{on the subject of}} the plight of the European Jews and the impact that World War II events would have on Jewish people around the world. He said, upon {{becoming}} a man under Jewish law: [...] "As I ... find happiness in joining the ranks of Israel, the knowledge of the tragic suffering of my fellow Jews ... makes this ... an occasion to reflect upon the heritage of my people—which now becomes mine. ... I shall try to understand my people and do my best to share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us." [...] He later wrote to a friend from childhood: [...] "I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I'll never quite understand." [...] Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{situation}} where a {{presumed resulting trust}} is created is if the court can rebut the presumption of an outright gift. The general philosophy here was set out by James LJ in Fowkes v Pascoe, and is that the judge should base his decision on [...] " [...] story as to <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to have , and judge that story {{with reference to the}} surrounding facts and circumstances". Where the property is money held in a joint bank account, the presumption {{is that it is a}} joint tenancy of that account. As such, when one dies the property is passed absolutely to the other, as in Marshall v Crutwell. This presumption can be rebutted in several situations. It will be rebutted when the account, while in the name of both the husband and wife, is used exclusively for the husband's personal use, as in Young v Sealey, or where the joint account exists solely so the husband can guarantee the wife's account, as in Anson v Anson. Tax avoidance (which is legal, as opposed to tax evasion) frequently involves transferring property to a family member to avoid tax. Where the family member refuses to transfer it back, the taxpayer can come to court and argue it was a resulting trust.|$|E
