5|$|On 28 September 2011, Rockstar {{announced}} the PC {{version of the}} game, subtitled The Complete Edition, which was released on 8 November 2011 in North America and 11 November 2011 in Australia and Europe. It contained all downloadable content from the original versions. Enhancements include <b>keyboard</b> <b>remapping</b> and gamepad functionality, increased fidelity, graphical enhancements, and stereoscopic 3D support. The Complete Edition was made available for consoles shortly afterwards.|$|E

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} ANSI.SYS {{is the ability}} to remap any key on the keyboard in order to perform shortcuts or macros for complex instructions. Using special escape sequences, the user can define any keystroke that has a character-code mapping to simulate an arbitrary sequence of such keystrokes. This feature was also used by evildoers to create simple trojans out of text files laced with nefarious <b>keyboard</b> <b>remaps,</b> known as [...] "ANSI bombs". A number of products were released to protect users against this: ...|$|R
50|$|A unique {{feature of}} the AnyKey is its {{hardware}} programmability. The keyboard contains an internal controller {{as well as an}} EEPROM chip that can store user-defined macros. Any key on the keyboard can be programmed to contain a macro of arbitrary length or can be programmed to act like any other key on the <b>keyboard</b> (<b>remapped).</b> This is done on the hardware level inside the keyboard's controller itself. No driver software is required to use the AnyKey's programming functionality, as the keyboard's own controller dictates which keypress codes are sent to the attached computer. A utility for MS-DOS exists to quickly <b>remap</b> the entire <b>keyboard</b> to a predefined configuration or save its current configuration to a file, but it is not required to use or program the keyboard. The AnyKey's EEPROM memory will retain its data even if the keyboard is unplugged indefinitely, so settings and programming aren't lost if the computer is powered down, unplugged, or if the keyboard is unplugged or moved to a different computer. The keyboard can be programmed to call up and execute software programs in the computer, but must compensate for the time it takes the computer to execute the program via inserting a delay of 1-5 seconds before entering a subsequent series of commands.|$|R
5000|$|PKWARE {{produced}} a TSR program, PKSFANSI (PK Safe ANSI), which filters out <b>keyboard</b> <b>remapping</b> escape codes {{as they are}} written to the standard output. [...] This has the advantage that the user can load some useful remappings from a text file and then run PKSFANSI to prevent further, possibly malicious remappings.|$|E

50|$|ZOC is {{a popular}} {{computer-based}} terminal emulator and Telnet software client for the Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh macOS operating systems that supports telnet, modem, SSH 1 and 2, ISDN, serial, TAPI, Rlogin and other means of communication. Its terminal emulator supports Xterm emulation with full colors, meta-keys and local printing, VT102, VT220 and several types of ANSI as well as Wyse, TVI, TN3270, and Sun's CDE. It supports full <b>keyboard</b> <b>remapping,</b> scripting in REXX and other languages, and support for named pipes.|$|E
50|$|The pointing-head is on {{the right}} side of the unit below the {{directional}} pad. The mouse buttons are on the left side of the unit, no matter what orientation it is used in. When rotated into portrait mode, the options key, brightness, and onscreen <b>keyboard</b> button are <b>remapped</b> to the mouse buttons, and the previous mouse buttons become the new modifier buttons.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Gruenbaum {{planned to}} trigger the samchillian via a {{traditional}} piano style <b>keyboard,</b> but with <b>remapped</b> functions, but later decided for functional and aesthetic reasons, to switch to an ergonomic keyboard made by Kinesis. Some touch sensitivity was sacrificed, but spatial access to intervals was greatly reduced. Via MIDI, the samchillian {{has been able to}} control any number of digital sound sources, but also analog sources such as acoustic player pianos.|$|R
40|$|Privacy-breaching malware is an ever-growing {{class of}} {{malicious}} applications {{that attempt to}} steal confidential data and leak them to third parties. One {{of the most prominent}} activities to acquire private user information is to eavesdrop and harvest user-issued keystrokes. Despite the serious threat involved, keylogging activities are challenging to detect in the general case. From an operating system perspective, their general behavior is no different than that of legitimate applications used to implement common end-user features like custom shortcut handling and <b>keyboard</b> <b>remapping.</b> As a result, existing detection techniques that attempt to model malware behavior based on system or library calls are largely ineffective. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel detection technique based on fine-grained profiling of memory write patterns. The intuition behind our model lies in data harvesting being a good predictor for sensitive information leakage. To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we have designed and implemented KLIMAX: a Kernel-Level Infrastructure for Memory and eXecution profiling. Our system supports proactive and reactive detection and can be transparently deployed online on a running Windows platform. Experimental results with real-world malware confirm the effectiveness of our approach...|$|E
