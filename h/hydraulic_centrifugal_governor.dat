50|$|According to the Science Museum, it was {{the first}} steam engine to be fitted with a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many {{steam engines}} use a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> which {{centrifugally}} close a throttle to restrict steam flow as engine speed increases.|$|R
50|$|James Watt {{designed}} {{his first}} governor in 1788 following a suggestion from {{his business partner}} Matthew Boulton. It was a conical pendulum governor {{and one of the}} final series of innovations Watt had employed for steam engines. James Watt never claimed the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> to be an invention of his own. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> were invented by Christian Huygens and used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills in the 17th century.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> (1788), {{negative}} feedback {{is used to}} maintain a near-constant speed of an engine, irrespective of the load or fuel-supply conditions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> {{are also}} used in many modern repeating watches to limit {{the speed of the}} {{striking}} train, so the repeater doesn't run too quickly.|$|R
25|$|Because factory {{machinery}} {{needed to}} operate at a constant speed, Watt linked a steam regulator valve to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> which he adapted from those used to automatically control the speed of windmills.|$|R
50|$|The term 'cataract' {{became a}} synonym for dashpot, at least where this was {{associated}} with steam engines and their governors. They were used as a damping device to avoid over-sensitivity with <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{four large}} {{turbines}} were connected {{directly to the}} alternating current generators and their speed controlled by adjusting the water flow, with a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor,</b> to obtain 300 shaft rpm—needed to generate a steady 60 cycle current.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> {{regulates the}} speed of an engine by using {{spinning}} masses that move radially, adjusting the throttle, as the engine changes speed. In the reference frame of the spinning masses, centrifugal force causes the radial movement.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> of a steam engine, as {{designed}} by James Watt in 1788, reduces the throttle valve {{in response to}} increases in the engine speed, or opens the valve if the speed falls below the pre-set rate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> {{were used}} to {{regulate}} the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water - an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical {{systems such}} as valves as used in fluid control systems. Purely {{mechanical}} pre-automotive systems included such designs as the Watt <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> whereas modern systems may have electronic fluid speed sensing components directing solenoids to set the valve to the desired rate.|$|R
50|$|By using {{a simple}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>{{governor}},</b> {{the speed of}} the motor may be controlled. When the governor detects an over-speed it interrupts the cam linkage so that the switches are activated for less time and so the motor slows. As there is already a cam and switch mechanism required, the addition of a governor link is a relatively simple addition. The use of a geared-up camshaft, as was common on the large power-producing motors, is also beneficial to permitting a smaller and more sensitive <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor.</b> The ability to govern the power of the motor by switching the contact times gradually meant that this motor, unlike most other designs where the regulator shut off power altogether, meant that it could be governed very precisely.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> {{was already}} known from its use for water- and windmills, {{it was not}} until 1788 when Watt was the first to apply it to a steam engine. This was the Lap Engine, an early {{rotative}} engine now preserved in the Science Museum, London.|$|R
50|$|A {{classic example}} is the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>{{governor}},</b> {{also known as the}} Watt or fly-ball governor on a reciprocating steam engine, which uses the effect of centrifugal force on rotating weights driven by the machine output shaft to regulate its speed by altering the input flow of steam.|$|R
50|$|The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor,</b> {{which had}} first {{been used by}} Watt to {{maintain}} constant speed, worked by throttling the inlet steam, which lowered the pressure, resulting {{in a loss of}} efficiency on the high (above atmospheric) pressure engines. Later control methods reduced or eliminated this pressure loss.|$|R
500|$|Maxwell {{published}} a paper [...] "On governors" [...] in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. 16 (1867–1868).

Here [...] "governors" [...] refers to the <b>governor</b> or the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> used to regulate steam engines.|$|R
50|$|Another kind of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} masses on a spindle inside a cylinder, the masses or the cylinder being coated with pads, somewhat like a drum brake. This is used in a spring-loaded record player and a spring-loaded telephone dial to limit the speed.|$|R
5000|$|Cars with a Saxomat clutch did {{not have}} a clutch pedal. The Saxomat {{consisted}} of two independent systems: the centrifugal clutch, and the servo clutch. The centrifugal clutch was engaged above certain engine speed by centrifugal force acting on spinning weights inside the clutch, similar to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> is a {{specific}} type of governor with a feedback system that controls the speed of an engine by regulating the amount of fuel (or working fluid) admitted, so as to maintain a near-constant speed, irrespective of the load or fuel-supply conditions. It uses the principle of proportional control.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Automatic' engines, {{and in turn}} {{high-speed}} engines, operated {{at increasing}} speeds and required more precise control of their speed under varying load. This required the coupling of their governor to the expansion valve gear. Earlier engines with Watt's <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> and throttle valve become inefficient when operating at low power.|$|R
50|$|The first {{mechanical}} tachometers {{were based}} on measuring the centrifugal force, similar to the operation of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor.</b> The inventor {{is assumed to be}} the German engineer Dietrich Uhlhorn; he used it for measuring the speed of machines in 1817. Since 1840, it has been used to measure the speed of locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Continuous control before PID {{controllers}} {{were fully}} understood and implemented {{has one of}} its origins in the <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>governor.</b> This had been invented by Christian Huygens in the 17th century to regulate the gap between millstones in windmills depending on the speed of rotation, and thereby compensate for the speed of grain feed.|$|R
5000|$|The same {{phenomenon}} is sometimes labelled as [...] "maintained", [...] "sustained", [...] "self-exciting", [...] "self-induced", [...] "spontaneous", or [...] "autonomous" [...] oscillation. Unwanted self-oscillations are {{known in the}} mechanical engineering literature as hunting, and in electronics as parasitic oscillations. Important early studied examples of self-oscillation include the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> and railroad wheels.|$|R
25|$|The {{use of the}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> by James Watt in 1788 to {{regulate}} the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A mathematical analysis of Watt's governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868.|$|R
50|$|Early {{approaches}} to variable cutoff coupled variations in admission cutoff with variations in exhaust cutoff. Admission and exhaust cutoff were decoupled {{with the development}} of the Corliss valve. These were widely used in constant speed variable load stationary engines, with admission cutoff, and therefore torque, mechanically controlled by a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> and trip valves.|$|R
50|$|Cornish engines {{were not}} {{amenable}} to control by a throttle valve, as their operating cycle {{depended on the}} condensation time more than a throttled steam supply. Non-rotative beam engines also had no easy means to drive a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor.</b> For these reasons the cataract remained in service {{for as long as}} the Cornish engine did.|$|R

50|$|The oldest engine {{technological}} predecessor for the variable-displacement {{engine is}} the {{hit and miss}} engine, developed in the late 19th century.
