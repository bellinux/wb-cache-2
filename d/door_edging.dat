50|$|It is {{probable}} that cars pre chassis number 120 (approx), about April 1958, had similar bodies to the early Berkeley “Sports” cars. Cars from about April 1958 {{to the end of}} production had vertical front <b>door</b> <b>edges</b> and internal <b>door</b> hinges, as well as body moulding and a few mechanical changes. Early cars were fitted with the four speed TR gearbox whilst later cars had the larger and stronger VR gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Main {{landing gear}} bays were {{located at the}} bottom of each nacelle, {{directly}} behind the engine. The two main gear legs were each offset significantly outboard in their nacelles, and retracted towards the tail; oleo scissors faced forwards. Each main wheel was inboard of its gear leg and oleo. Main gear doors were two pieces, split evenly, longitudinally, hinged at inner <b>door's</b> inboard <b>edge</b> and the outer <b>door's</b> outboard <b>edge.</b>|$|R

25|$|A door is {{a moving}} {{mechanism}} used to block off, and allow access to, an entrance to or within an enclosed space, {{such as a}} building, room or vehicle. Doors normally consist {{of one or two}} solid panels, with or without windows, that swing on hinges horizontally. These hinges are attached to the <b>door's</b> <b>edge</b> but there are also doors that slide, fold or spin. The main purpose of a door is to control physical access.|$|R

5000|$|For 1955 the Four Hundred {{name was}} re-employed by Packard and {{assigned}} to the automaker's senior model range two-door hardtop. Visual cues that helped to easily identify the 400 included a full color band along the lower portion of the car topped by a partial color band that truncated along the rear edge of the front doors. [...] "The Four Hundred" [...] in gold anodized script adorned the band between the front wheel well and <b>door</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leaving {{employment}} with Western Electric Company in 1920, Schlage {{opened a}} shop in San Francisco in the present-day financial district. The Schlage Lock Company was incorporated with a starting capital of $30. In the same year, {{he applied for}} a patent for a lock that could be drilled into a door with only two holes. This new cylindrical lock had a single plate, serving as both escutcheon and striker plate, wrapping around the <b>door's</b> <b>edge.</b> It was mostly used on interior doors, where it replaced the older Mortise lock.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{holes are}} bored, {{perpendicular}} to one another, {{into the door}}. The [...] "face bore" [...] is the larger hole which is bored into the door face and a smaller [...] "edge bore" [...] hole is bored into the <b>door</b> <b>edge.</b> The edge may require additional preparation to receive the latch assembly, typically by routing or chiseling a shallow mortise. Some commercially-sold doors may come prepared to receive one or more bored cylindrical locks, such as entry doors, which typically require both a door knob and dead bolt.|$|R

Five days later, on 26 July 2010, another morning rush-hour train broke down at , causing all Victoria line services to be temporarily suspended.

40|$|In {{retinitis}} pigmentosa (RP), loss of peripheral visual field accounts for most difficulties encountered in visuo-motor coordination during locomotion. The {{purpose of this}} study was to accurately assess the impact of peripheral visual field loss on gaze strategies during locomotion, and identify compensatory mechanisms. Nine RP subjects presenting a central visual field limited to 10 – 25 ° in diameter, and nine healthy subjects were asked to walk in one of three directions—straight ahead to a visual target, leftward and rightward through a door frame, with or without obstacle on the way. Whole body kinematics were recorded by motion capture, and gaze direction in space was reconstructed using an eye-tracker. Changes in gaze strategies were identified in RP subjects, including extensive exploration prior to walking, frequent fixations of the ground (even knowing no obstacle was present), of <b>door</b> <b>edges,</b> essentially of the proximal one, of obstacle edge/corner, and alternating <b>door</b> <b>edges</b> fixations when approaching the door. This was associated with more frequent, sometimes larger rapid-eye-movements, larger movements, and forward tilting of the head. Despite the visual handicap, the trajectory geometry was identical between groups, with a small decrease in walking speed in RPs. These findings identify the adaptive changes in sensory-motor coordination, in order to ensure visual awareness of the surrounding, detect changes in spatial configuration, collect information for self-motion, update the postural reference frame, and update egocentric distances to environmental objects. They are of crucial importance for the design of optimized rehabilitation procedures...|$|R
