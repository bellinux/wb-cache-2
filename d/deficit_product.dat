These two mechanisms account for 60 percent of the decline in the relative price of tradable goods and explain a large fraction of the reallocation of labor across sectors.

The robust growth in real manufacturing GDP, however, is driven by one industry segment: computers and electronic products. In most of manufacturing, real GDP growth has been weak or negative and productivity growth modest. The extraordinary real GDP growth in computer-related industries reflects prices for computers and semiconductors that, when adjusted for product quality improvements, are falling rapidly. Productivity growth in these industries, in turn, largely reflects product and process improvements from research and development, not automation.

40|$|PhD. (Energy Studies) A {{review of}} {{health effects of}} {{emissions}} from solid fuel combustion shows clear links between morbidity and mortality, and residential combustion smoke exposure. On the interior plateau of the South African Highveld, use of coal fuel in informal domestic braziers – imbaulas – constitutes {{a major source of}} local ambient and household air pollution. This thesis aimed to develop an improved understanding of the complex processes of packed-bed combustion in small domestic devices studying smoke emissions from informal domestic stoves. A robust dilution sampling system for testing emissions from residential coal-burning appliances was developed and used in the emission studies. Systematic experiments were carried out to evaluate thermal performance and emissions of coal braziers, varying fire ignition method, ventilation rate, fuel moisture and fuel quality. Three field-collected and three laboratory constructed braziers were tested, with a range of ventilation hole-densities. The variables measured are particle mass (PM 2. 5 and PM 10), gases (CO, CO 2, NOx), and particle composition and morphology. Emission factors, referenced to zero excess oxygen are reported. Two fire-ignition methods are evaluated namely: the conventional bottom-lit updraft (BLUD) method, and the top-lit updraft (TLUD) –the so-called Basa njengo Magogo method. PM 2. 5 and PM 10 emissions reduced by 80 % on average when using the TLUD in contrast to the business-as-usual BLUD method. High smoke emissions from the BLUD method during pyrolysis are found to be associated with an oxygen <b>deficit,</b> allowing <b>products</b> of incomplete combustion to be emitted. Influences of ventilation rates on the stove emissions are reported – products of incomplete combustion (PM 2. 5 and CO) are higher for low ventilation rates. For a given device, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 emission factors reduce by ~ 50 % from low to high ventilation rates (an advantage offset by firepower too high for convenient cooking) ...|$|R

40|$|The fate of {{photosynthetic}} products {{within the}} plant-soil continuum determines {{how long the}} reduced carbon resides within the ecosystem and when it returns back to {{the atmosphere in the}} form of respiratory CO 2. We have tested the possibility of measuring natural variation in δ 13 C and δ 18 O to disentangle the potential times needed to transfer carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis down to trunk, roots and, in general, to belowground up to its further release in the form of soil respiration into the atmosphere in a beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest. We have measured the variation in stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions in plant material and in soil respired CO 2 every three hours for three consecutive days. Possible steps and different signs of post-photosynthetic fractionation during carbon translocation were also identified. A 12 h-periodicity was observed for variation in δ 13 C in soluble sugars in the top crown leaves and it can be explained by starch day/night dynamics in synthesis and breakdown and by stomatal limitations under elevated vapour pressure <b>deficits.</b> Photosynthetic <b>products</b> were transported down the trunk and mixed with older carbon pools, therefore causing the dampening of the δ 13 C signal variation. The strongest periodicity of 24 h was found in δ 13 C in soil respiration indicating changes in root contribution to the total CO 2 efflux. Other non-biological causes like diffusion fractionation and advection induced by gas withdrawn from the measurement chamber complicate data interpretation on this step of C transfer path. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify the speed of carbohydrates' translocation from the point of assimilation to the trunk breast height because leaf-imprinted enrichment of δ 18 O in soluble sugars was less modified along the downward transport and was well related to environmental parameters potentially linked to stomatal conductance. The speed of carbohydrates translocation from the site of assimilation to the trunk at breast height was estimated to be in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 4 m h − 1...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the relationship}} between the reaction kinetics of the disproportionation of ethylbenzene and the pore structure of the zeolite catalyst is discussed. Earlier studies of the kinetics revealed that over large-pore zeolites at low temperatures the reaction rate is significantly but reversibly retarded by the product diethylbenzene. In contrast, with medium-pore zeolites no product inhibition was observed. As a possible explanation it was suggested that the difference between the adsorption constant of the inhibiting product and that of the feed is more strongly pronounced in large- than in medium-pore zeolites. This proposal is supported by some further dissimilarities in the catalytic behavior of these zeolites. Thus, both the evaluation of the <b>deficit</b> of the <b>product</b> diethylbenzene compared with the product benzene during the induction period of the reaction, and transient experiments, in which the feed flow rate was suddenly changed, indicate a stronger accumulation of the diethylbenzene in faujasite than in H-ZSM- 5. In agreement with these results different reaction networks for the dealkylation of ethylbenzene and diethylbenzene over large- and medium-pore zeolites were observed at higher temperatures. Sorption measurements with pure ethylbenzene and diethylbenzene on H-ZSM- 5 and Y-zeolites confirmed the assumption that with decreasing pore-size the product is no longer sorbed more strongly in the zeolite than the feed...|$|R

The recounting of autobiographical events is inextricably linked to linguistic knowledge, yet no study to date has investigated whether tense use during autobiographical narration is disrupted in dementia syndromes. This study investigated the incidence of correct past tense use during ABM narration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 10) and semantic dementia (SD, n = 10) in comparison with healthy older Controls (n = 10). Autobiographical narratives were analysed for episodic content (internal/external) and classified according to tense use (past/present). Across both patient groups, use of the past tense was significantly compromised relative to Controls, with increased levels of off-target present tense verbs observed. Voxel-based morphometry analyses based on structural MRI revealed differential associations between past tense use and regions of grey matter intensity in the brain. Bilateral temporal cortices were implicated in the SD group, whereas frontal, lateral, and medial temporal regions including the right hippocampus emerged in AD. This preliminary study provides the first demonstration of the disruption of specific linguistic constructs during autobiographical narration in AD and SD. Future studies are warranted to clarify at what point in the disease trajectory such deficits in tense use emerge, and whether these <b>deficits</b> are a <b>product</b> or contributing factor in memory disruption in these syndromes. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the economy of Hungary. The paper highlights that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976 – 80), actual growth rates for almost all major plan aggregates remained below the targets. The lower targets set for the increase in both consumption and investment in the 1976 – 80 plan relative to the rates achieved during 1971 – 75, reflected the government’s policy of moderating the growth of domestic demand. The actual average annual growth rate for investment closely approximated, whereas that of private consumption fell far short of the plan targets.

40|$|Nocturnal fluxes {{may be a}} {{significant}} factor in the annual water budget of forested ecosystems. Here, we assessed sap flow in two co-occurring evergreen species (Eucalyptus parramattensis and Angophora bakeri) in a temperate woodland for 2 years in order to quantify the magnitude of seasonal nocturnal sap flow (En) under different environmental conditions. The two species showed different diurnal water relations, demonstrated by different diurnal curves of stomatal conductance, sap flow and leaf water potential. The relative influence of several microclimatic variables, including wind speed (U), vapour pressure <b>deficit</b> (D), the <b>product</b> of U and D (UD) and soil moisture content, were quantified. D exerted the strongest influence on En (r² = 0. 59 – 0. 86), soil moisture content influenced En when D was constant, but U and UD did not generally influence En. In both species, cuticular conductance (Gc) was a small proportion of total leaf conductance (Gs) and was not a major pathway for En. We found that En was primarily a function of transpiration from the canopy rather than refilling of stem storage, with canopy transpiration accounting for 50 – 70 % of nocturnal flows. Mean En was 6 – 8 % of the 24 -h flux across seasons (spring, summer and winter), but was up to 19 % of the 24 -h flux on some days in both species. Despite different daytime strategies in water use of the two species, both species demonstrated low night-time water loss, suggesting similar controls on water loss at night. In order to account for the impact of En on pre-dawn leaf water potential arising from the influence of disequilibria between root zone and leaf water potential, we also developed a simple model to more accurately predict soil water potential (ψs). 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} thirty years, the {{international}} market for vegetable oils has developed substantially {{especially in terms of}} production and international trade. Three tropical oils: coconut, palm kernel and mainly palm oil and three countries: Indonesia, Malaysia {{and to a lesser extent}} the Philippines and play a major role in the supply of lipids to the rest of the world. Palm oil prices are generally lower than other vegetable oils such as soybean, rapeseed and sunflower, but since the beginning of 2006, they have risen steeply, as prices for most of agricultural products traded in the world, before showing a huge drop by the middle of the 2008 crop year. As palm has the most important oil yield among oilseed crops, future development of tropical oils is a major issue for the world market over the next years. There will be a growing food demand coming from areas in <b>deficit</b> of oilseed <b>products</b> (China, South Asia, Africa, etc.) these countries experience rapid demographic growth and increase in per capita consumption of oils and fats due to income growth during the last decade. Tropical oils could also play a major role in non-food sectors like lipid chemistry and biodiesel, either to be directly used in this production or to substitute other vegetable oils previously used for human food more and more used for bioenergy. Dans cet article, après avoir traité dans une première partie la situation actuelle et les évolutions récentes sur les marchés internationaux des principales huiles végétales, on abordera dans une deuxième partie un certain nombre d’éléments sur les évolutions récentes et historiques des prix de ces produits en relation avec ceux du complexe « matières grasses » et plus généralement de l’ensemble des grands produits agricoles mondiaux. Dans une dernière partie, on s’intéressera plus spécifiquement à certaines perspectives à moyen terme concernant à la fois les possibilités de productions mondiales et les hypothèses de demande sur les principaux débouchés de l’alimentation humaine et du non alimentaire...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{recent survey}} {{has shown that}} data {{management}} in clinical trials performed by academic trial units still faces many difficulties (e. g. heterogeneity of software <b>products,</b> <b>deficits</b> in quality management, limited human and financial resources and the complexity of running a local computer centre). Unfortunately, no specific, practical and open standard for both GCP-compliant data management and the underlying IT-infrastructure is available to improve the situation. For that reason the "Working Group on Data Centres" of the European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) has developed a standard specifying the requirements for high quality GCP-compliant data management in multinational clinical trials. Methods International, European and national regulations and guidelines relevant to GCP, data security and IT infrastructures, as well as ECRIN documents produced previously, were evaluated to provide {{a starting point for}} the development of standard requirements. The requirements were produced by expert consensus of the ECRIN Working group on Data Centres, using a structured and standardised process. The requirements were divided into two main parts: an IT part covering standards for the underlying IT infrastructure and computer systems in general, and a Data Management (DM) part covering requirements for data management applications in clinical trials. Results The standard developed includes 115 IT requirements, split into 15 separate sections, 107 DM requirements (in 12 sections) and 13 other requirements (2 sections). Sections IT 01 to IT 05 deal with the basic IT infrastructure while IT 06 and IT 07 cover validation and local software development. IT 08 to IT 015 concern the aspects of IT systems that directly support clinical trial management. Sections DM 01 to DM 03 cover the implementation of a specific clinical data management application, i. e. for a specific trial, whilst DM 04 to DM 12 address the data management of trials across the unit. Section IN 01 is dedicated to international aspects and ST 01 to the competence of a trials unit's staff. Conclusions The standard is intended to provide an open and widely used set of requirements for GCP-compliant data management, particularly in academic trial units. It is the intention that ECRIN will use these requirements {{as the basis for the}} certification of ECRIN data centres. </p...|$|R
