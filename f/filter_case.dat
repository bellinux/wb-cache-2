40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{results on the}} nonlinear dynamical response of a semiconductor laser subjected to time-delayed (> 5 ns), frequency selective, optical feedback from a Fabry-Pérot interferometer type of filter. Three regimes of interest, based on the relative value of the filter bandwidth {{with respect to the}} relevant laser parameters (relaxation oscillation frequency and external cavity mode spacing), are identified, viz. a wide <b>filter</b> <b>case,</b> an intermediate filter width case, and a narrow <b>filter</b> <b>case.</b> The dynamical response of the laser is shown to be quite different in each of these regimes. The principal results are 1) the laser's linewidth enhancement factor, coupled with the nonlinear response of the filter, can be exploited to induce nonlinear dynamics in the instantaneous optical frequency of the laser light on a time scale related to the time-delay of the feedback, 2) a mode mismatch effect which arises from a detuning between the filter center frequency and the nearest external cavity mode and manifests itself in a reduction of the maximum light available for feedback, and 3) a reduction in, or even disappearance of, relaxation oscillations in the laser dynamics when a filter of appropriate width is chosen. More generally, it is observed that certain dynamics that occur due to unfiltered optical feedback may be suppressed when the feedback light is spectrally filtered...|$|E

This paper discusses in more detail problems associated with complex flattop filter design based on the polyphase IIR structure and suggests the possible design procedures. The complex flattop filters, similarly to their real versions, achieve extremely flat weighted passbands down to microdBs and step-like magnitude responses with transition bands completely free of crossover oscillations. The complex frequency transformations employed to control the passband edges are much simpler than for the real designs allowing much simpler implementation of the overall filter structure. ...|$|E

Higher sample rates produced Bode responses approaching the continuous response and the Bilinear Transformation model produced the best responses over the frequency spectrum and sample rates. Pole location analysis of each model in the z-plane showed the Bilinear Transformation and Zero-Order Hold models gave stable poles regardless of time step size, whereas the other models did not display stable poles.
