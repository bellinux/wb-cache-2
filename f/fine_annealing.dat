30|$|A {{possible}} {{phase transition}} from monoclinic to another phase of magnetite around 50  K seems {{more likely to}} be a temperature at which the anisotropy and/or magnetostriction constants begin to increase. The evidence against a transition is that only the <b>finest</b> <b>annealed</b> grains (<[*] 9  µm) have a convincing inflection in their 10 -K remanence warming curves at this temperature, that unannealed grains of all sizes have no indication of such a transition, and that cooling and warming curves of 300 -K remanences for all samples also lack the transition. Coercive forces of the finer grained magnetites increase around 50  K (Dunlop et al. 2018, Figs.  5, 6), although they do not continue to increase at lower temperatures. However, IRM acquisition curves show that the entire spectrum of coercivities is multiplied almost two-fold between 50 and 10  K (Fig.  1).|$|R
5000|$|The glass {{exhibits}} {{a change in}} refractive index, called index drop, during the annealing process. This drop is caused by fast cooling of the mould insert, inducing {{a small amount of}} residual stress in the glass. As a result, the glass {{exhibits a}} small index change when compared to its <b>fine</b> <b>anneal</b> state. The index drop is small (usually [...]002-.006), but the optical design needs to be optimized to compensate for this change. As an example, the index drop for different glass types is displayed in the picture on the right for different annealing rates. Note that the annealing rate is not necessarily constant during the cooling process. Typical “average” annealing rates for precision molding are between 1000 K/h and 10,000 K/h (or higher). Not only the refractive index, but also the Abbe-number of the glass is changed due to fast annealing. The shown points in the picture on the right indicate an annealing rate of 3500k/h.|$|R

30|$|To further {{upgrade the}} {{combined}} performance of CFs and GFs, especially the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, much work {{is waiting to}} be explored and more sophisticated understandings {{about the relationship between}} the structure and performance is of significant important from the viewpoints of both fundamental research and real application. On the one hand, we should establish a real-time system to monitor the structural evolution of the basic CNTs/graphene units during the fiber-forming process, which will contribute to the structure controlling of the fibers. On the other hand, the processing techniques (e.g., stretching, <b>fining,</b> densifying, <b>annealing)</b> used to enhance the performance of polymeric fibers and carbon fibers should be borrowed to optimize the fabrication process throughout.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{characterisation}} {{and failure}} mechanisms of adhesively bonded glass butt joints were studied. Materials of {{relevance to the}} adhesive bonding of fibre optic components were employed: a <b>fine</b> <b>annealed</b> Grade A glass (Schott(TM) BK - 7), and a fast curing epoxy based optical adhesive. The joint behaviour and their durability under adverse environmental conditions were investigated, and the subsequent, failed joint fracture surfaces were examined using XPS, ToF-SIMS and SEM. Surface analysis techniques have been employed to characterise components of the adhesive systems and to interrogate the surface of failed joints {{with a view to}} establishing the locus of failure. Joints were immersed in pure water for period of 0 - 270 days at 35 °C. Substantial reduction in the bond strength within a few days of water immersion was observed. Also for the joints left in for a prolonged exposure periods (> 100 days) the strength values reached a minimum value. The surface analysis of the joints has indicated a cochoidal brittle fracture through the adhesive in dry conditions, and an interfacial failure for wet joint fractures. Calculations of the polymer thickness on the interfacial surfaces indicated a decrease in overlayer thickness. This reduction reached a constant value for joints left in water for more than 100 days. During this investigation surfaces segregation of minor components of the adhesive such as amine and diluent was also identified by ToF-SIMS and XPS. In order to study this phenomenon further, reformulation of the adhesive has been carried out. Six adhesives were formulated, of which three resins were based on the change in diluent content of the system, three were based on the change in amine concentrations. This work has clearly identified amine segregation only at the interfacially failed joints. It is expected that when the joints cures very fast, even if the formulation contains very high proportion of amine, the segregation is minimal. Also, some evidence of diluent migration at the interfaces was observed during the reformulation studies...|$|R
40|$|The GTL- 1 {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess corrosion {{the performance of the}} proposed Boosted Fast Flux Loop booster fuel at heat flux levels {approx} 30 % above the design operating condition. Sixteen miniplates fabricated from 25 % enriched, high-density U 3 Si 2 /Al dispersion fuel with 6061 aluminum cladding were subjected to peak beginning of cycle (BOC) heat fluxes ranging from 411 W/cm 2 to 593 W/cm 2. Miniplates fabricated with three different fuel variations (without <b>fines,</b> <b>annealed,</b> and with standard powder) performed equally well, with negligible irradiation-induced swelling and a normal fission density gradient. Both the standard and the modified prefilm procedures produced hydroxide films that adequately protected the miniplates from failure. A detailed finite element model was constructed to calculate temperatures and heat flux for an as-run cycle average effective south lobe power of 25. 4 MW(t). Results of the thermal analysis are given at four times during the cycle: BOC at 0 effective full power days (EFPD), middle of cycle (MOC) at 18 EFPD, MOC at 36 EFPD, and end of cycle at 48. 9 EFPD. The highest temperatures and heat fluxes occur at the BOC and decrease in a linear manner throughout the cycle. Miniplate heat flux levels and fuel, cladding, hydroxide, and coolant-hydroxide interface temperatures were calculated using the average measured hydroxide thickness on each miniplate. The hydroxide layers are the largest on miniplates nearest to the core midplane, where heat flux and temperature are highest. The hydroxide layer thickness averages 20. 4 {mu}m on the six hottest miniplates (B 3, B 4, C 1, C 2, C 3, and C 4). This tends to exacerbate the heating of these miniplates, since a thicker hydroxide layer reduces the heat transfer from the fuel to the coolant. These six hottest miniplates have the following thermal characteristics at BOC: (1) Peak fuel centerline temperature > 300 C; (2) Peak cladding temperature > 200 C; (3) Peak hydroxide temperature > 190 C; (4) Peak hydroxide-water interface temperature > 140 C; and (5) Peak heat flux > 565 W/cm 2...|$|R

The orientations of the nuclei from these sites were found to be mainly random, but also partly located in α-(//ND) and γ-fibers (//ND). After <b>annealing,</b> <b>fine</b> recrystallized grains formed with abundant annealing twins which had a strong impact on the texture development.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} great {{emphasis}} on the use of computer-aided tools in process design. The key to the success of any computer modeling is the accurate knowledge of the mechanical and thermal properties of the various components of a manufacturing system. In order to develop a data base of forging properties of IN- 718, isothermal constant strain rate compression tests were conducted on the <b>annealed</b> <b>fine</b> grain material over the temperature range 871 °C to 1149 °C (16000 °F to 21000 °F) and strain rate range 0. 001 sec- 1 to 10 sec- 1. Constitutive equations developed from the results of these tests, along with experimentally measured heat transfer and friction coefficients were used in the program ALPID to simulate non-isothermal forging of double wedge specimens. The simulation results were compared with actual forging in an industrial forge press. The good agreement between simulation and forging results indicates that when an accurate and complete data base of materials properties is available, computer modeling can be used effectively to study forging...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} properties and the deformation mechanisms active in Ti- 25 Nb- 3 Mo- 3 Zr- 2 Sn fine tubes. Ti- 25 Nb- 3 Mo- 3 Zr- 2 Sn alloy is a recently developed metastable β titanium alloy intended for biomedical applications. Tensile tests {{were carried out}} on the fine tubes. The modulus of the Ti- 25 Nb- 3 Mo- 3 Zr- 2 Sn fine tubes increased with reductions in the diameter for tubes in the cold rolled and annealed conditions. In comparison with cold rolled tubes, the annealed tubes exhibit increased strain hardening behaviour and superior ductility. Mechanical twins, stress-induced martensitic transformation and the textures of the β and α″ phases were investigated. The {{results show that the}} fine tubes exhibit different moduli which are related to the evolution of β and α″ phase textures during processing. Cold rolling facilitates the transformation from β to the α″ phase and mechanical { 332 }〈 113 〉 twinning. For the annealed tubes, mechanical twinning as well as primary and secondary martensitic transformations were activated at specific levels of tensile strain. Twins developed with increasing levels of strain, and secondary martensitic transformations occurred within the twinned β regions. <b>Annealed</b> <b>fine</b> tubes exhibit multistage strain hardening behaviour and superior ductility due to the synergetic effects of twinning induced plasticity and transformation induced plasticity during tensile deformation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was {{the study of the}} influence of crystal fine structure on conductivity and cation self diffusion in single crystals of sodium chloride. Crystals were grown by the Kyropoulos technique and subjected to thermal treatment likely to alter the crystal <b>fine</b> structure. Both <b>annealing</b> and chilling of single crystals produced changes in the crystals conductivity and in sodium- 22 self-diffusion rate at temperatures below 520 ºC. In {{the investigation}} of conductivity a study was made of electrode materials and for the diffusion measurements a sensitive absorption method was used. The changes in diffusion rates and conductivity might have been the result of changes in internal surfaces and grain boundaries. The possibility of ion movement in grain boundaries was investigated by autoradiography of sections of crystal into which sodium- 22 had penetrated. The rte of movement of sodium- 22 on the surface of sodium chloride was also investigate and a limit set for the surface diffusion coefficient. It was concluded that cation movement in sodium chloride single crystals does not take place more rapidly in the grain boundaries or on internal surfaces than it does through the bulk of the crystal. An explanation of the changes in diffusion rates and conductivity on thermal treatment of the crystal is offered in terms of vacancies, rain boundaries and impurity ions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{calibrate}} the material properties including strength and strain values for different material zones of ultra-high strength steel (UHSS) welded joints under monotonic static loading. The UHSS is heat sensitive and softens by heat due to welding, the affected zone is heat affected zone (HAZ). In this regard, cylindrical specimens were cut out from welded joints of Strenx® 960 MC and Strenx® Tube 960 MH, were examined by tensile test. The hardness values of specimens’ cross section were measured. Using correlations between hardness and strength, initial material properties were obtained. The same size specimen with different zones of material same as real specimen were created and defined in finite element method (FEM) software with commercial brand Abaqus 6. 14 - 1. The loading and boundary conditions were defined considering tensile test values. Using initial material properties made of hardness-strength correlations (true stress-strain values) as Abaqus main input, FEM is utilized to simulate the tensile test process. By comparing FEM Abaqus results with measured results of tensile test, initial material properties will be revised and reused as software input to be fully calibrated {{in such a way}} that FEM results and tensile test results deviate minimum. Two type of different S 960 were used including 960 MC plates, and structural hollow section 960 MH X-joint. The joint is welded by BöhlerTM X 96 filler material. In welded joints, typically the following zones appear: Weld (WEL), Heat affected zone (HAZ) coarse grained (HCG) and <b>fine</b> grained (HFG), <b>annealed</b> zone, and base material (BaM). Results showed that: The HAZ zone is softened due to heat input while welding. For all the specimens, the softened zone’s strength is decreased and makes it a weakest zone where fracture happens while loading. Stress concentration of a notched specimen can represent the properties of notched zone. The load-displacement diagram from FEM modeling matches with the experiments by the calibrated material properties by compromising two correlations of hardness and strength...|$|R
