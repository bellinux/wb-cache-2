500|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, NASCAR held several test sessions on January20–22,2011 for teams to test the newer pavement at Daytona. Also in the sessions, {{the opening of the}} restrictor plate was reduced from the 30/32inch plate used in tire testing to 29/32inch. NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated, [...] "We'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> and talk to the teams and look at the speeds from the last two days of testing. I think we have some high-water marks at 197-and-a-half [...] which, depending on where they pulled up in the draft, it may be a little quick, but it's hard to say." ...|$|E

I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer.

2500|$|By 1959, Rollins {{had become}} {{frustrated}} {{with what he}} perceived as his own musical limitations and took the first – and most famous – of his musical sabbaticals. While living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he ventured to the pedestrian walkway of the Williamsburg Bridge to practice, {{in order to avoid}} disturbing a neighboring expectant mother. [...] Almost every day from the summer of 1959 through the end of 1961, Rollins practiced on the bridge, next to the subway tracks. [...] In the summer of 1961, the journalist Ralph Berton happened to pass by the saxophonist on the bridge one day and published an article in Metronome magazine about the occurrence. [...] During this period, Rollins became a dedicated practitioner of yoga. [...] Rollins ended his sabbatical in 1962. [...] He later said [...] "I could have probably spent {{the rest of my life}} just going up on the bridge. I realized, no, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the real world." [...] In 2016, a campaign was initiated that seeks to have the bridge renamed in Rollins's honor.|$|E
