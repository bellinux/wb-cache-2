40|$|Ribosome {{assembly}} in eukaryotes requires hundreds of conserved essential proteins {{not present in}} the mature particle. Because deletion of <b>individual</b> <b>assembly</b> factors typically disrupts multiple assembly steps and changes {{the composition of the}} entire pre-ribosomal particle, determining the essential function of <b>individual</b> <b>assembly</b> factors has become a main focus of ribosomal research. Furthermore, many proteins appear to be present in assembling ribosomes for extended times making it difficult to pinpoint their role to a distinct step. Using combined classical yeast genetics and recombinant protein and RNA biochemistry, this research details the roles of Dim 2, and RNA-binding assembly factor, and its interaction with Nob 1, the nuclease that generates the 3 ’-end of 18 S rRNA. Analysis of Dim 2 mutants, in which the interaction with Nob 1 is disrupted in vitro, demonstrates that the interaction between Dim 2 and Nob 1 is essential. In vivo analysis of Nob 1 localization on pre-ribosomal particles containing these Dim 2 mutants show that Dim 2 is involved in recruiting Nob 1 to pre-ribosomes. Additionally, RNA binding experiments show that Dim 2 increases Nob 1 ’s RNA affinity. Furthermore, data indicate that Dim 2 helps position Nob 1 for correct cleavage at the 3 ’-end of 18 S rRNA, as a point mutation that abolishes this interaction in vitro leads to accumulation of pre-ribosomes containing Nob 1 and 20 S rRNA. Interestingly, the site of interaction with Nob 1 is mapped to a KH-like domain in Dim 2, suggesting that this domain typically used for RNA binding can additionally interact with proteins. Additionally, mapping of the Dim 2 rRNA binding site reveals close proximity to D-site cleavage as well as the Nob 1 rRNA binding site...|$|E

Additional curves show the amplitudes of fluctuation of the magnetic drum angular velocity compared to the quantity of damping at specific frequencies...|$|R

Many different <b>individual</b> <b>assembly</b> technologies would be needed in different combinations to serve many mission concepts.

This broad applicability without a single, well-articulated mission makes it difficult to advance the technology all the way to flight readiness.

40|$|International audienceAnatase TiO 2, a wide bandgap semiconductor, {{likely the}} most {{worldwide}} studied inorganic material for many practical applications, offers unequal characteristics for applications in photocatalysis and sun energy conversion. However, {{the lack of}} controllable, cost-effective methods for scalable fabrication of homogeneous thin films of anatase TiO 2 at low temperatures (ie.

The <b>individual</b> <b>assembly</b> of the mesoscopic particles forming ever-demonstrated high optical quality beads of TiO 2 affords, with this simple methodology, efficient light capture and confinement into the photo-anode, which in flexible dye-sensitized solar cell technology translates into a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 7. 2 % under A.

In this work, we developed a facile hierarchical self-assembly method to separately control {{the magnetic}} shape and magnetocrystalline anistropy of <b>individual</b> nanoparticle <b>assemblies</b> in arrays. Since magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in the array have the same size, shape and alignment, {{we are able to}} study the magnetic properties of <b>individual</b> nanoparticle <b>assembly</b> by measuring the whole arrays. The interplay between the two magnetic anisotropies was systematically studied for disk- and bar-shaped nanoparticle assemblies. Maximum magnetic anisotropy was obtained when the easy axis of magnetic nanoparticles was aligned along the long axes of the bar-shaped nanoparticles assemblies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|TItis thesis {{describes}} {{an exploration of}} the various processes involved in the assembly design and planning and a development of their mechanisms. The task objective is to generate an assembly sequence from a physical specification of the assembly structure. An assembly design is carried out by specifying mating conditions between geometric feawres of two components belonging to an assembly structure. The set of mating conditions and components specify the assembly structure to be constructed: a goal statement for the planner. The assembly planning is to order the <b>individual</b> <b>assembly</b> operations to avoid subassemblies that may block a collision-free path for future assembly operations. Two complimentary approaches to the assembly planning is presented. One is based on projecting spatial interferences between sibling subassemblies. TIle goal statement is hierarchically structured into subassemblies, forming an assembly hierarchy. Using the assembly hierar· chy as an abstraction hierarchy. the planner avoids a combinatorial explosion. Unfonunately, there is no theory that would generale an assembly hierarchy without the spatial interference checkings...|$|E
40|$|The Parallel Program Debugger (PPD) {{allows a}} {{programmer}} to find bugs by following dynamic dependences in a program's execution; {{this technique is}} called flowback analysis. Flowback analysis requires the tracing of all variable references and modifications. PPD avoids the overhead of this tracing by recording only {{a subset of the}} program's state during execution, and incrementally filling in the missing details when the programmer makes queries about execution dependences. There is a trade-off between overhead of the tracing during program execution and the speed of generating the missing details during user queries. Our compiler is divided into four phases. This separation of phases allows us to first compile separate files, and to generate code for these files. Second, we perform interprocedural analysis using the data structures generated by the first phase. Third, we modify the <b>individual</b> <b>assembly</b> files to account for optimizations to the tracing, and to generate tracing for shared [...] ...|$|E
