5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to <b>gallstone</b> disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk of recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Mandela {{was briefly}} hospitalised with a {{respiratory}} infection, attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung infection and <b>gallstone</b> removal in December 2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, his lung infection recurred {{and he was}} briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition.

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>gallstones</b> include birth control pills, pregnancy, {{a family history}} of <b>gallstones,</b> obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. <b>Gallstones</b> are formed in the gallbladder, {{typically}} from either cholesterol or bilirubin. <b>Gallstones</b> may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected on blood tests.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fetal <b>gallstones</b> are a rare sonographic finding. We {{came across}} two cases of fetal <b>gallstones</b> {{detected}} in routine third trimester scan {{over a period}} of one year. Both cases were confirmed to have <b>gallstones</b> in postnatal scan and showed complete resolution of the <b>gallstones</b> at 35 and 45 days after birth. The presence of <b>gallstones</b> in the fetus does not alter the fetal prognosis or obstetrical management since complete resolution is seen in most of the cases in late third trimester or neonatal period which may be due to either spontaneous passage of <b>gallstones</b> during early neonatal period or dilution of cholesterol crystals with postnatal hydration...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{investigation}} {{suggests that}} the incidence of <b>gallstones,</b> particularly cholesterol <b>gallstones,</b> is high among patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD and <b>gallstones</b> are closely related to the diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, so both NAFLD and <b>gallstones</b> are considered the manifestations of metabolic syndrome (MS). Many studies {{both at home and abroad}} are reviewed to investigate the pathogenesis and risk factors of cholesterol <b>gallstones</b> in patients with NAFLD. It is thought that the pathogenesis may be related to insulin resistance, leptin resistance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, etc., and age, sex, obesity, dyslipidemia, and pathoglycemia are risk factors. Understanding the pathogenesis and risk factors of cholesterol <b>gallstones</b> in patients with NAFLD is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD, <b>gallstones,</b> and MS...|$|R
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of <b>gallstone</b> disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted <b>gallstone</b> in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} <b>gallstone</b> disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-five gallbladders {{were studied}} in vitro.

5|$|On February 12, 2006, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a <b>gallstone</b> in his common bile duct and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and gallbladder disease. After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital. Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not {{have a negative impact on}} his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state's prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an all-terrain vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.|$|E

40|$|Background & Aims: Although {{cholesterol}} is {{the most}} abundant sterol in animal tissues, oxidized products of cholesterol (oxysterols) also occur in mammalian organs and blood and are cytotoxic, atherogenic, and carcinogenic. However, the presence of oxysterols in bile or <b>gallstones</b> has never been reported. Methods: Fresh human bile and <b>gallstones</b> were collected, Sterol content and structure were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Bacterial DNA was extracted from human <b>gallstones.</b> Results: GC/MS identified cholesta- 4, 6 -diene- 3 -one and cholest- 4 -ene- 3 -one, with several as yet unidentified oxysterols in bile and stone samples. Several plant and fungal sterols were also present in <b>gallstones.</b> When 102 human <b>gallstones</b> were analyzed for oxysterols, they were markedly higher (as percent of total sterols) in pigment <b>gallstones,</b> where bacterial DNA is most abundant. Conclusions: These observations suggest biliary oxysterols {{are associated with the}} presence of bacteria and {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>gallstones</b> and biliary tract cancers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{a survey}} of 666 sheep at a slaughterhouse, <b>gallstones</b> (concretions with a {{diameter}} {{greater than or equal}} to 1 mm) were found in the gallbladder of 50 sheep (7. 5 %), sludge (concretions with a diameter less than 1 mm) was found in 9 sheep (1. 4 %), and sludge plus <b>gallstones</b> were found in 7 sheep (1. 1 %). <b>Gallstones</b> and sludge were associated, and were more frequent in lambs and females, compared with adults and males. Qualitative analysis of the stones revealed all to be pigment (bilirubin) stones. There was a statistically significant increase of biliary bilirubin (total and indirect quota) only in sheep with <b>gallstones</b> plus sludge, compared with control sheep without sludge or <b>gallstones.</b> Concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, phospholipids, total and single bile aids, and total and ionized calcium were similar in the bile of sheep with <b>gallstones,</b> sludge, or both and control sheep. Bacteriologic analysis of the bile in 10 sheep with <b>gallstones</b> and 10 controls revealed bacteria in 50 % of the first group and in 75 % of the second group (Escherichia coli in all sheep and Salmonella spp also in 1 sheep with <b>gallstones).</b> These findings confirm our earlier findings of a high prevalence of black pigment <b>gallstones</b> in sheep. On that basis, we suggest that <b>gallstones</b> are associated with high total bilirubin concentration in the bile, and deconjugating bacteria are common in the biliary tract of these animals...|$|R
40|$|Symptomatic <b>gallstones</b> {{are easy}} to treat, {{unfortunately}} however asymptomatic <b>gallstones</b> are as easy to treat.

In this review we attempt to clarify the fact that asymptomatic <b>gallstones</b> need no intervention in most cases, thereby saving the patient unnecessary surgery and the health care establishment costs, both in the financial form and in manpower...|$|R
25|$|Osler's {{syndrome}} is a syndrome of recurrent episodes of colic pain, with typical radiation to back, cold shiverings and fever; {{due to the}} presence in Vater’s diverticulum of a free-moving <b>gallstone</b> which {{is larger than the}} orifice.|$|E

25|$|Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile {{contains}} {{too much}} cholesterol {{and not enough}} bile salts. Besides {{a high concentration of}} cholesterol, two other factors are important in causing gallstones. The first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to <b>gallstone</b> formation. This can be caused by high resistance to the flow of bile out of the gallbladder due to the complicated internal geometry of the cystic duct. The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. In addition, increased levels of the hormone estrogen, as a result of pregnancy or hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement, resulting in <b>gallstone</b> formation.|$|E
2500|$|Cholesterol <b>gallstones</b> can {{sometimes}} be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid taken by mouth, {{but it may be}} necessary for the person to take this medication for years. <b>Gallstones</b> may recur, however, once the drug is stopped. Obstruction of the common bile duct with <b>gallstones</b> {{can sometimes}} be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). <b>Gallstones</b> can be broken up using a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (often simply called [...] "lithotripsy"), which is a method of concentrating ultrasonic shock waves onto the stones to break them into tiny pieces. They are then passed safely in the feces. However, this form of treatment is suitable only when there is a small number of <b>gallstones.</b>|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and <b>gallstones.</b> High fat diets (unsaturated fats) rich in cholesterol have been demonstrated to produce not only <b>gallstones</b> but also NAFLD and insulin resistance. Interestingly, {{a high incidence of}} <b>gallstones</b> is being reported in association with insulin resistance and NAFLD. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the best definitive therapy for symptomatic gallbladder disease. Ezetimibe is a drug that inhibits the absorption of both dietary and biliary cholesterol in the small intestine. Importantly, ezetimibe showed potential benefit not only in treating and preventing <b>gallstones</b> but also in insulin resistance and NAFLD. Further studies are required before the use of ezetimibe for the treatment of <b>gallstones</b> can be advocated...|$|R

Additionally, prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors has been shown to decrease gallbladder function, potentially leading to <b>gallstone</b> formation.|$|E
25|$|Cholecystitis is {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute cholecystitis. The pain lasts longer in cholecystitis than in a typical gallbladder attack.

Complications of acute cholecystitis include <b>gallstone</b> pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or {{inflammation of}} the common bile duct.|$|E
25|$|More than 90% of {{the time}} acute {{cholecystitis}} is from blockage of the cystic duct by a <b>gallstone.</b> Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, {{a family history of}} gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. Occasionally acute cholecystitis occur as a result of vasculitis, chemotherapy, or during recovery from major trauma or burns. Cholecystitis is suspected based on symptoms and laboratory testing.

25|$|The first {{descriptions}} of <b>gallstones</b> {{appear to have}} been in the Renaissance, perhaps because of the low incidence of <b>gallstones</b> in earlier times owing to a diet with more cereals and vegetables, and less meat. Anthonius Benevinius in 1506 was the first to draw a connection between symptoms and the presence of <b>gallstones.</b> Courvoisier after examining a number of cases in 1890 that gave rise to the eponymous Courvoisier's law stating that in an enlarged, nontender gallbladder, the cause of jaundice is unlikely to be <b>gallstones.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first {{surgical}} {{removal of}} a <b>gallstone</b> (cholecystolithotomy) was in 1676 by physician Joenisius, who removed the stones from a spontaneously occurring biliary fistula. Stough Hobbs in 1867 performed the first recorded cholecystotomy, although such an operation was in fact described earlier by French surgeon Jean-Louis Petit in the mid eighteenth century. German surgeon Carl Langenbuch performed the first cholecystectomy in 1882 for a sufferer of cholelithiasis. Before this, surgery had focused on creating a fistula for drainage of gallstones. Langenbuch reasoned that given several other species of mammal has no gallbladder, humans could survive without one.|$|E
25|$|A <b>gallstone</b> is a stone formed {{within the}} {{gallbladder}} out of bile components. The term cholelithiasis may {{refer to the}} presence of stones in the gallbladder or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. In 1–4% of those with gallstones, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as biliary colic, occurs each year. Complications of gallstones include inflammation of the gallbladder, inflammation of the pancreas, and liver inflammation. Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, or tea-color urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gallstone</b> risk {{increases}} for females (especially before menopause) {{and for people}} near or above 40 years; the condition is more prevalent among both North and South Americans and among those of European descent than among other ethnicities. A lack of melatonin could significantly contribute to gallbladder stones, as melatonin inhibits cholesterol secretion from the gallbladder, enhances the conversion of cholesterol to bile, and is an antioxidant, which is able to reduce oxidative stress to the gallbladder. Researchers believe that gallstones {{may be caused by}} a combination of factors, including inherited body chemistry, body weight, gallbladder motility (movement), and low calorie diet. The absence of such risk factors does not, however, preclude the formation of gallstones.|$|E
50|$|In the {{developed}} world 10-15% of adults have <b>gallstones.</b> Of those with <b>gallstones,</b> biliary colic occurs in 1-4% each year.
