40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates three topics {{related to}} movement and events associated with geospatial barriers. This research makes a unique contribution to geographic information science (GIScience), by examining how boundaries influence {{the interactions of}} other geographic features and to location-based services by bringing a GIScience perspective to <b>geofence</b> services. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 can be considered independently as journal articles. Each of these chapters builds on the previous. Chapter 2 serves as the base by examining geospatial barriers and impedance events associated with these barriers. The relationships between barriers, the features they protect and the features that they hinder are formalized in an ontology design pattern (ODP) that also includes events associated with these features. Algorithms are written to demonstrate the ODP {{can be used to}} answer queries about {{the presence or absence of}} barrier events. Chapter 3 transitions from physical boundaries to digital boundaries by examining geofences, a location-based notification service. Interaction between users and multiple geofences are investigated when the configuration of geofences differs (i. e. disconnected, partially overlapping, and completely overlapping) and when geofences are independent or dependent (a rule states that the activation of <b>geofence</b> Y depends on users having visited <b>geofence</b> X). A <b>geofence</b> system is prototyped in an iOS environment and used to further evaluate user-geofence interactions. Chapter 4 expands on the topic of location- based notification regions by investigating what is required for a <b>geofence</b> system to handle events. How changes in conditions (e. g. the spreading of a flood or movement of a fire) interact with geofences and users and what new categories of interactions are required to handle these changes are discussed. The proposed system is applied to a scenario of flooding on multiple rivers interrupting the transportation network...|$|E

40|$|Pollution {{in urban}} centres is {{becoming}} a major societal problem. While pollution is a concern for all urban dwellers, cyclists {{are one of the}} most exposed groups due to their proximity to vehicle tailpipes. Consequently, new solutions are required to help protect citizens, especially cyclists, from the harmful effects of exhaust-gas emissions. In this context, hybrid vehicles (HVs) offer new actuation possibilities that can be exploited in this direction. More specifically, such vehicles when working together as a group, have the ability to dynamically lower the emissions in a given area, thus benefiting citizens, whilst still giving the vehicle owner the flexibility of using an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). This paper aims to develop an algorithm, that can be deployed in such vehicles, whereby geofences (virtual geographic boundaries) are used to specify areas of low pollution around cyclists. The emissions level inside the <b>geofence</b> is controlled via a coin tossing algorithm to switch the HV motor into, and out of, electric mode, in a manner that is in some sense optimal. The optimality criterion is based on how polluting vehicles inside the <b>geofence</b> are, and the expected density of cyclists near each vehicle. The algorithm is triggered once a vehicle detects a cyclist. Implementations are presented, both in simulation, and in a real vehicle, and the system is tested using a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform (video provided).

40|$|Abstract: The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} LBSs will be significantly determined by geofencing applications and background tracking. A <b>geofence</b> {{is a small}} geographic area that is defined to generate a location event {{as soon as a}} user enters or leaves this <b>geofence</b> and to process this event {{in the context of an}} LBS. Background tracking continuously monitors the whereabouts of a user and is thus the major prerequisite for detecting location events. Both functions can be regarded as important enablers for an improvement and broad establishment of information relevance in mobile environments. After an overview of the emergence of LBSs in the recent years, this article provides an introduction into geofencing and background tracking and demonstrates their working for location-based recommender systems. 1 A Brief History of Location-based Services The success of the Mobile Internet in the recent years has created a huge market for new applications in the area of information relevance. The most innovative of these applications belong to the category of Location-based Services (LBSs), which generate, compile, select, or filter information or perform other actions by taking into consideration the current location of the user [Kü 05]. Prominent examples are so-called finder or pointsof-interest (PoI) services, which deliver lists of nearby points-of-interest to the user, for example, restaurants, filling stations, or ATMs. Recently, the idea of LBSs has also been adopted by social community platforms, which now enable location sharing, that is, the mutual exchange of current whereabouts among their members. erschienen im Tagungsband der INFORMATIK 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receiver}} {{installed in}} motor vehicles {{have been used}} to track vehicles. The position of vehicle is transmitted via a wireless nework using cellular telephone network known as GSM (Global System for Mobile communication). A vehicle that has GPS receiver installed onboard connected with GPRS modem and connected to a computer system in the Internet can be monitored and then provide alert when it travels outside the predefined area. This area is very important for many situations such as city car rental, trucking company to send goods from one city to another and logistic company with many fleets. The system designed here is a module with a GPS and a GPRS already integrated in one module. The output of the GPS receiver is connected to a microcontroller. The microcontroller dictates which data is collected via the GPS receiver and then sends the information to a computer system via GPRS modem. The microcontroller also receives command from the computer system via the GPRS connection and then can acct accordingly, such as change the frequency of geo-coordinate or turn the vehicle engine off if necessary. This device will help the user to track its vehicle via GoogleMap with the GPS coordinate data sent to the database server every 10. This device will enable the operator to turn off the vehicle engine and one other device onboard the vehicle if necessary. With the feature of <b>Geofence</b> on the Web server using HTML 5, a virtual fence has been built around the GoogleMap and when the vehicle moving outside the fence the user can be alerted either via email or color change on the web page. The device has been tested and shown to be working with all the conditioned mentioned above. The computer system that displays the web page together with the <b>geofence</b> has been developed and shown to be working properly as indicated...|$|E

40|$|Boarder {{security}} is usually based on observing and analyzing {{the movement of}} MovingPoint Objects (MPOs) : vehicle, boats, pedestrian or aircraft for example. This movementanalysis can directly be made by an operator observing the MPOs in real-time, but theprocess is time-consuming and approximate. This is why the states of each MPO (ID, location,speed, direction) are sensed in real-time using Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and radar sensing, thus creating a streamof MPO states. This research work proposes and carries out (1) a method for detectingfour different moving point patterns based on this input stream (2) a comparison betweenthree possible implementations of the moving point pattern detectors based on three differentData Stream Management Systems (DSMS). Moving point patterns can be dividedin two groups: (1) individual location patterns {{are based on the}} analysis of the successivestates of one MPO, (2) set-based relative motion patterns are based on the analysis ofthe relative motion of groups of MPOs within a set. This research focuses on detectingfour moving point patterns: (1) the <b>geofence</b> pattern consists of one MPO enteringor exiting one of the predefined areas called geofences, (2) the track pattern consists ofone MPO following the same direction for a given number of time steps and satisfying agiven spatial constraint, (3) the flock pattern consists of a group of geographically closeMPOs following the same direction, (4) the leadership pattern consists of a track patternwith the corresponding MPO anticipating the direction of geographically close MPOs atthe last time step. The two first patterns are individual location patterns, while the othersare set-based relative motion patterns. This research work proposes a method for detectinggeofence patterns based on the update of a table storing the last sensed state of eachMPO. The approach used for detecting track, flock and leadership patterns is based on theupdate of a REMO matrix (RElative MOtion matrix) where rows correspond to MPOs,columns to time steps and cells record the direction of movement. For the detection offlock patterns a simple but effective probabilistic grid-based approach is proposed in orderto detect clusters of MPOs within the MPOs following the same direction: (1) the Filteringphase partitions the study area into square-shaped cells -according to the dimensionof the spatial constraint- and selects spatially contiguous grid cells called candidate areasthat potentially contain flock patterns (2) for each candidate area, the Refinement phasegenerates disks {{of the size of the}} spatial constraint within the selected area until one diskcontains enough MPOs, so that the corresponding MPOs are considered to build a flockpattern. The pattern detectors are implemented on three DSMSs presenting differentcharacteristics: Esri ArcGIS GeoEvent Extension for Server (GeoEvent Ext.), a workflow-based technology that ingests each MPO state separately, Apache Spark Streaming(Spark), a MapReduce-based technology that processes the input stream in batches in ahighly-parallel processing framework and Apache Flink (Flink), a hybrid technology thatingests the states separately but offers several MapReduce semantics. GeoEvent Ext. onlylends itself for a nature implementation of the <b>geofence</b> detector, while the other DSMSsaccommodate the implementation of all detectors. Therefore, the <b>geofence,</b> track, flockand leadership pattern detectors are implemented on Spark and Flink, and empiricallyevaluated in terms of scalability in time/space based on the variation of parameters characterizingthe patterns and/or the input stream. The results of the empirical evaluationshows that the implementation on Flink uses globally less computer resources than theone on Spark. Moreover, the program based on Flink is less sensitive to the variability ofparameters describing either the input stream or the patterns to be detected...|$|E
