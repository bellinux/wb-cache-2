40|$|Thirty seven deep-sea {{sediment}} cores {{from the}} Arabian Sea were studied geochemically (49 major and trace elements) for four time slices during the Holocene {{and the last}} glacial, and in one high sedimentation rate core (century scale resolution) to detect tracers of past variations in {{the intensity of the}} atmospheric monsoon circulation and its hydrographic expression in the ocean surface. This geochemical multi-tracer approach, coupled with additional information on the grain size composition of the clastic fraction, the bulk carbonate and biogenic opal contents makes it possible to characterize the sedimentological regime in detail. Sediments characterized by a specific elemental composition (enrichment) originated from the following sources: river suspensions from the Tapti and Narbada, draining the Indian Deccan traps (Ti, Sr); Indus sediments and dust from Rajasthan and Pakistan (Rb, Cs); dust from Iran and the Persian Gulf (Al, Cr); dust from central Arabia (Mg); dust from East Africa and the Red Sea (Zr/Hf, Ti/Al). Corg, Cd, Zn, Ba, Pb, U, and the HREE are associated with the intensity of upwelling in the western Arabian Sea, but only those patterns that are consistently reproduced by all of these elements can be directly linked with the intensity of the southwest monsoon. Relying on information from a single element can be misleading, as each element is affected by various other processes than upwelling intensity and nutrient content of surface water alone. The application of the geochemical multi-tracer approach indicates that the intensity of the southwest monsoon was low during the LGM, declined to a minimum from 15, 000 - 13, 000 14 C year BP, intensified slightly {{at the end of this}} interval, was almost stable during the Bölling, Alleröd and the Younger Dryas, but then intensified in two abrupt successions at the end of the Younger Dryas (9900 14 C year BP) and especially in a second event during the early Holocene (8800 14 C year BP). <b>Dust</b> <b>discharge</b> by northwesterly winds from Arabia exhibited a similar evolution, but followed an opposite course: high during the LGM with two primary sources [...] the central Arabian desert and the dry Persian Gulf region. <b>Dust</b> <b>discharge</b> from both regions reached a pronounced maximum at 15, 000 - 13, 000 14 C year. At the end of this interval, however, the dust plumes from the Persian Gulf area ceased dramatically, whereas <b>dust</b> <b>discharge</b> from central Arabia decreased only slightly. <b>Dust</b> <b>discharge</b> from East Africa and the Red Sea increased synchronously with the two major events of southwest monsoon intensification as recorded in the nutrient content of surface waters. In addition to the tracers of past dust flux and surface water nutrient content, the geochemical multi-tracer approach provides information on the history of deep sea ventilation (Mo, S), which was much lower during the last glacial maximum than during the Holocene. The multi-tracer approach [...] i. e. a few sedimentological parameters plus a set of geochemical tracers widely available from various multi-element analysis techniques [...] is a highly applicable technique for studying the complex sedimentation patterns of an ocean basin, and, specifically in the case of the Arabian Sea, can even reveal the seasonal structure of climate change...|$|E

The Advanced Reynolds Stress Model (ARSM) {{was used in}} gas phase turbulence modeling. Stochastic Particle Tracking Model (SPTM) and the Particle-Source-In-Cell (PSIC) method were adopted for particles computing. The interaction between particles and the gas phase was also taken into account. The numerical simulation results were {{in agreement with the}} experimental data. The simulation revealed that an unsteady spiral dust strand appeared near the cyclone wall and a non-axi-symmetrical dust ring appeared in the annular space and under the cover plate of the cyclone. There were two regions in the radial {{particle concentration}} distribution, in which particle concentration was low in the inner region (r/R⩽ 0.75) and increased greatly in the outer region (r/R> 0.75). Large particles generally had higher concentration in the near-wall region and small particles had higher concentration in the inner swirling flow region. The axial distribution of particle concentration in the inner swirling flow (r/R⩽ 0.3) region showed that there existed serious fine particle entrainment within the height of 0.5 D above the <b>dust</b> <b>discharge</b> port and a short-cut flow at a distance of about 0.25 D below the entrance of the vortex finder.

40|$|Five Ocean Drilling Program sites (657 - 661), {{which form}} a north-south {{transect}} off the western {{periphery of the}} Sahara, were selected to measure the long-term history of Saharan/Sahelian dust flux and fluvial sediment discharge and the fluxes of marine CaCO 3 and opal over the last 8 m. y. Sites 658 and 659 served for high-resolution studies, and Sites 657, 660, and 661 for insights into the spatial patterns of dust flux. The nearshore mean flux of opal off Cap Blanc (21 °N) showed an abrupt increase about 3 Ma that appears to reflect the main onset of coastal upwelling fertility and enhanced trade winds. At the same time, the input of river-borne clay strongly decreased, suggesting a dry up of the central Saharan rivers. Later, marked short-lived spikes of clay and opal may indicate ongoing ephemeral pulses of fluvial runoff linked to peak interglacial stages. Given the zonal <b>dust</b> <b>discharge</b> centered near 18 °N at Site 659, the aridification of the south Sahara and Sahel increased in several steps: at 4. 6, 4. 3, and especially at 4. 0, 3. 6, and 2. 1 Ma, and again, at 0. 8 Ma.

40|$|Researchers {{studying}} dust generation from blasthole drills {{developed a}} simple, quick fix that reduced respirable dust concentrations {{by more than}} 63 % at the dump point. This device, which requires almost no maintenance, is small and inexpensive, and it will help operators maintain compliance to the dust standard. The thought process was that a reduction of respirable dust {{at any of the}} multiple sources on the drill, in this case the dust collector dump point, should reduce the total respirable dust generated by the drill. The U. S. Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) has a coal respirable dust standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for an 8 -hour shift. MSHA and mine operators periodically collect personal dust samples to determine compliance with this dust standard. Drill operators have one of the highest exposure levels to respirable dust. This has been proven through many reviews of the MSHA dust sampling database. Prior to 1987, the highwall driller at surface coal mines had the most severe exposure to respirable silica dust, a trend that continues today based on MSHA's respirable dust sampling database. A review of the MSHA database for the years 1985 through 1992 shows that 81 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the permissible exposure limit for the highwall drill operator at surface coal mines. A more recent review of the MSHA database, for the years 1996 through 2000, shows that only 31 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the respirable silica dust limit for the highwall driller at surface coal mines. This suggests a substantial improvement in preventing the exposure of silica dust to the highwall drill operator. The drill operator, however, still tops the list of job occupations that have the highest exposure to respirable silica dust Respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} harmful to human health, especially when silica is present in the dust. It causes a disease known as silicosis, which can occur in three levels: chronic silicosis, which occurs after 10 years of exposure; accelerated silicosis, which occurs between 5 and 10 years of exposure; and acute silicosis, which can occur within a few weeks to five years of very high exposure to silica dust. Respirable dust consists of the dust particle size fraction whose median diameter is 4 micrometers (m). The drilling machine generates high concentrations of respirable dust from several sources: drill table shroud leakage, dust leakage through the table bushing, <b>dust</b> <b>discharge</b> from the dust collector exhaust due to impaired filters, and dust entrained from the dust collector fines dumped onto the bench.

The boiler cavity is especially prone to dust accretions, fouling, and corrosion caused by accumulation of molten particles and precipitation of sulphuric acid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied within a qualitative study to model the flow and heat transfer distribution throughout the waste-heat boiler. The commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 2. 16, was applied to a modified waste-heat boiler (23 m × 11 m × 5. 4 m) within the Outokumpu flash smelting process. This investigation focuses on the geometric modifications to the typical boiler design, which includes elevation of the ceiling, placement of flow-obstructing baffles and radiation plates parallel within the flow path. Also investigated were various boiler operating conditions such as the circulation of process off-gas, air leakage from the <b>dust</b> <b>discharging</b> hoppers and variation in inlet gas composition. The geometric modifications had the desired effect of increasing the volumetric utilization and therefore enhancing heat transfer between the boiler surface and the gas stream and dust segregation.

Micron-size dust usually dominates the samples collected from tokamaks. During a plasma <b>discharge</b> micron-size <b>dust</b> particles can become highly mobile and travel over distances of a few meters. Once inside the plasma, dust particles heat up to over 3000 K and emit thermal radiation that can be detected by visible imaging techniques. Observations of naturally occurring and artificially introduced dusts have been performed in DIII-D divertor and scrape-off layer (SOL) using standard frame rate CMOS cameras, a gated-intensified CID camera, and a fast-framing CMOS camera. In the first 2 - 3 plasma discharges after a vent with personnel entry inside the vacuum vessel ('dirty vent') dust levels were quite high with thousands of particles observed in each discharge. Individual particles moving at velocities of up to a few hundred m/s and breakup of larger particles into pieces were observed.

A {{large amount of}} C 2 H 2, considered as promoter of dust nucleation in hydrocarbon plasmas, was found as a by-product of HMDSO fragmentation. Although no negative ions were detected the presence of C 2 H 2 in the HMDSO-Ar discharge supports the hypothesis of a dust growth mechanism based on negative ions being trapped in the plasma. It was found that {{at the beginning of}} each cycle of dust formation during α–γ′ transition, the discharge sustaining process is accompanied by a strong consumption of the HMDSO main by-products: HMDSO- 15, CH 4 and C 2 H 2. At the end of the cycle, corresponding to the progressive disappearance of <b>dust,</b> the <b>discharge</b> switches back to its initial conditions. The beginning of the inverse transition, i. e. γ′–α, is most likely correlated to the growing void in the dust cloud and dust disappearance. In presence of dust nanoparticles, Ar+ and ArH+ dominate the ion population and consequently the discharge maintenance. When the dust particles gradually disappear, the discharge is rather controlled by Si 2 O(CH 3) 5 + ions. Moreover, the increased amount of such heavy ions reveals clearly their important income in the dust repelling process due to the drag force on the large sized dust even at short time scale during the injection time of HMDSO. Atomic-H production increases during the transition from dusty plasma to HMDSO-rich plasma with no dust and its role is associated to a delay in the dust nucleation stage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Studies of {{naturally}} occurring and artificially introduced carbon dust are conducted in DIII-D and TEXTOR. In DIII-D, dust does not present operational concerns except immediately after entry vents. Energetic plasma disruptions produce {{significant amounts of}} dust.

Submicron sized dust is routinely observed using Mie scattering from a Nd:Yag laser. The source is strongly correlated with the presence of Type I edge localized modes (ELMs). Larger size (0. 005 - 1 mm diameter) dust is observed by optical imaging, showing elevated dust levels after entry vents. Inverse dependence of the dust velocity on the inferred dust size is found from the imaging data.

After a brief exposure (~ 0. 1 s) at the outer strike point, part of the dust is injected into the plasma, raising the core carbon density by a factor of 2 – 3 and resulting in a twofold increase o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} of plasma particle kinetics {{in the presence}} of ions owing around two stationary dust grains aligned {{in the direction of the}} ow are studied using a three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulation code. The dynamics of plasma electrons and ions as well as the charging process of the dust grain are simulated self-consistently. Distributions of electron and ion number densities, and the electrostatic plasma potential are obtained for various intergrain distances, including those much less, of the order of, and more than the plasma electron Debye length. The fundamental question of importance for the understanding of processes involving the formation and evolution of various self-organized structures such as colloidal crystals [1] in a complex dusty " plasma, is the interaction of dust grains with themselves and the surrounding plasma. Since in a typical laboratory <b>discharge</b> <b>dust</b> particles are negatively charged and levitate in the sheath or pre-sheath region under the balance of gravitational, electrostatic (due to the sheath electric eld) and plasma (such as the ion drag) forces, these interactions involve collective processes associated with the owing plasma. The ion ow, providing a direct dragging inuence, is also responsible for the generation of associated collective plasma processes such as the formation of th...|$|R
40|$|The {{discharging}} electrode for an electrostatic precipitator is vibrated by various forces. They are the external {{force and the}} internal forces. The former {{is due to the}} shock with hammer-blowing to remove the adhering <b>dust</b> on the <b>discharging</b> electrode, and the latter the action of gas flow or the electrical forces. The spark over which causes by the large vibration of the {{discharging electrode}} decreases the collection efficiency of the electrical precipitator, and so it is desirable to prevent the vibratian of the discharging electrode. The vibration of the discharging electrode for the cylindertype electrostatic precipitator (dia. 10. 5 cm, length 200 cm) was tested in atmospheric air. The vibrational characteristics and the brief analysis of the electrical forces which act on the discharging electrode were considered. The experimental results are summarized as follows. 1) The vibrational amplitude increases with rising applied voltage and diminishing tention of the discharging electrode. 2) The vibrational frequency of the discharging electrode corresponds to the calculated natural frequency of it. 3) The vibrational mode varies according to change of the discharging condition. 4) In the analysis of the electrical forces, six kinds of them are considered, but each force is not treated of its quantity...|$|R
40|$|Tom Peterson of NCDC in {{the next}} version of the Bulletin of the AMS will be co-authoring a paper Study: Global cooling a 1970 s myth. In it he tries to downplay the cooling and the {{coverage}} and hype it received. The book from 1977 “The Weather Conspiracy ” has a special CIA report that states "The western world's leading climatologists have confirmed reports of a detrimental global climatic change. Leaders in Climatology and economics are in agreement that a climate change is taking place and it has already caused major economic problems throughout the world. " James Hansen himself {{was part of a}} NASA research effort that predicted cooling. On July 9, 1971, the Washington Post published a story headlined “U. S. Scientist Sees New Ice Age Coming. ” It told of a prediction by NASA and Columbia University scientist S. I. Rasool. The culprit: man’s use of fossil fuels. The Post reported that Rasool, writing in Science, argued that in “the next 50 years ” fine <b>dust</b> that humans <b>discharge</b> into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel will screen out so much of the sun’s rays that the Earth’s average temperature could fall by six degrees. Sustained emissions over five to 10 years, Rasool claimed, “could be sufficient to trigger an ice age. ” Aiding Rasool’...|$|R
40|$|Base on {{reduction}} experimental data, {{considering the}} reduction process factors like carbon content, reductive removal of ZnO, changing size of pellet, and partial pressure of reducing gas, also coupled heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions, a direct reduction mathematical model on carbon-bearing pellet containing zinc has been established. The {{reliability of the}} model was testified by programming and experiments. Experiments showed that, under the reduction conditions that carbon and oxygen mole ratio at 1. 0 and reduction temperature 1603 K, metallization rate 87 % and dezincification rate 99 % were observed after 15 minutes of heating. The output of dust and sludge which produced from steel production was approximately 10 % of the steel amount. According to the current steel productivity in China, at least 50 million tons of dust has been yielded each year. The dust contains many valuable elements such as Fe, C, Zn, Pb, K, Na. Due to containing of Zn, Pb, K, Na elements and the fine particle size of the dust, iron making process would be deteriorated when using the dust directly. So, these dusts were called difficult utilizing dust, which counts amount to 30 % of the total <b>discharge</b> <b>dust.</b> Handling such kind of dust with direct reduction technology in RHF can not only produce metallized pellets for iron production, the elements such as Zn could also be utilized as secondary resources [1, 2]...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{submicron}} dust using Mie scattering from Nd:YAG lasers {{and video}} data of micron to sub-millimeter sized dust on DIII-D tokamak {{have provided the}} first data of dust sources and transport during tokamak discharges. During normal operation on DIII-D dust observation rates are low, a few events per discharge or less. The net carbon content of the dust corresponds to a carbon atom density a few orders of magnitude below the core impurity density. Statistical analysis of Mie data collected over months of operation reveal correlation of increased dust rate with increased heating power and impulsive wall loading due to edge localized modes (ELMs) and disruptions. Generation of significant amounts of dust by disruptions is confirmed by the camera data. However, dust production by disruptions alone is insufficient to account for estimated in-vessel dust inventory in DIII-D. After an extended entry vent, thousands of dust particles are observed by cameras in the first 2 - 3 plasma discharges. Individual particles moving at velocities up to {approx} 300 m/s, breakup of larger particles into pieces, and collisions of particles with walls are observed. After {approx} 70 <b>discharges,</b> <b>dust</b> levels are reduced to a few events per discharge. In order to calibrate diagnostics and benchmark modeling, milligram amounts of micron-sized carbon dust have been injected into DIII-D discharges, leading to the core carbon density increase {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. Following injection, dust trajectories in the divertor are mostly in the toroidal direction, consistent with the ion drag force. Dust from the injection is observed in the outboard midplane by a fast framing camera. The observed trajectories and velocities of the dust particles are in qualitative agreement with modeling by the 3 D DustT code...|$|R
