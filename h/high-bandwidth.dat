5|$|SPLIT is used {{to perform}} split transactions. Rather than tie up the <b>high-bandwidth</b> USB bus sending data to a slower USB device, the nearest <b>high-bandwidth</b> capable hub {{receives}} a SPLIT token followed by one or two USB packets at <b>high-bandwidth,</b> performs the data transfer at full- or low-bandwidth, and provides the response at <b>high-bandwidth</b> when prompted by a second SPLIT token. It contains a seven-bit hub number, 12bits of control flags, and a five-bit CRC.|$|E
5|$|The DDC {{channel is}} {{actively}} used for <b>High-bandwidth</b> Digital Content Protection (HDCP).|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 <b>high-bandwidth</b> in real-use, especially in <b>high-bandwidth</b> use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 <b>high-bandwidth</b> both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>High-bandwidth</b> Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a newer form {{of digital}} rights management. Intel created the {{original}} technology {{to make sure}} that digital content followed the guidelines set by the Digital Content Protection group.|$|E
5|$|Synchronization Pattern: A USB packet {{begins with}} an 8-bit {{synchronization}} sequence, 00000001₂. That is, after the initial idle state J, the data lines toggle KJKJKJKK. The final 1bit (repeated Kstate) {{marks the end of}} the sync pattern {{and the beginning of the}} USB frame. For <b>high-bandwidth</b> USB, the packet begins with a 32-bit synchronization sequence.|$|E
5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} <b>high-bandwidth</b> serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E
5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with <b>High-bandwidth</b> Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
25|$|Intel also {{developed}} <b>High-Bandwidth</b> Digital Content Protection (HDCP) to prevent access of digital {{audio and video}} content as it travels across connections.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{the concept}} of {{utilizing}} high-power, <b>high-bandwidth</b> underwater cabled observatories emerged as a long-term, cost-effective solution for conducting real-time monitoring of ocean systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{a simple}} analysis, the Cell {{processor}} can be split into four components: external {{input and output}} structures, the main processor called the Power Processing Element (PPE) (a two-way simultaneous multithreaded Power ISA v.2.03 compliant core), eight fully functional co-processors called the Synergistic Processing Elements, or SPEs, and a specialized <b>high-bandwidth</b> circular data bus connecting the PPE, input/output elements and the SPEs, called the Element Interconnect Bus or EIB.|$|E
25|$|Electronic analog PID {{control loops}} were often found within more complex {{electronic}} systems, for example, the head positioning of a disk drive, the power conditioning {{of a power}} supply, or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern seismometer. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs, to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring <b>high-bandwidth</b> and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{criticism}} {{concerns the}} integration of {{a new form of}} digital rights management (DRM) into the operating system, specifically the Protected Video Path (PVP), which involves technologies such as <b>High-bandwidth</b> Digital Content Protection (HDCP) and the Image Constraint Token (ICT). These features were added to Vista due to licensing restrictions from the HD-DVD consortium and Blu-ray association. This will concern only the resolution of playback of protected content on HD DVD and Blu-ray discs, but it has not been enabled as of 2012. A lack of a protected channel does not stop playback. Audio plays back as normal but high-definition video downsamples on Blu-ray and HD DVD to slightly-better-than-DVD quality video.|$|E
25|$|Network Projection is used {{to detect}} and use network-connected projectors. It {{can be used to}} display a {{presentation}}, or share a presentation with the machine which hosts the projector. Users can do this over a network so multiple sources can be connected at different times without having to keep moving the sources or projectors around. The network projector can be connected to the network via wireless or cable (LAN) technology to make it even more flexible. Users can not only connect to the network projector remotely but can also remotely configure it. Network projectors are designed to transmit and display still images, such as photographs and slides —not <b>high-bandwidth</b> transmissions, such as video streams. The projector can transmit video, but the playback quality is often poor. Binary %windir%\system32\NetProj.exe implement Network Projection feature.|$|E
25|$|Whenever {{the laptop}} is powered on it can {{participate}} in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer in the cloud {{has access to the}} Internet—either directly or indirectly—then all computers in the cloud are able to share that access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the store and forward Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or <b>high-bandwidth</b> applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, Dr. Cheryl K. Crawley, Great Falls Public Schools Superintendent, {{established}} {{a task force}} to study the physical plant at GFHS. The task force's charge is to recommend improvements and changes to the buildings, grounds, and physical plant of the high school so that the school can continue to provide a high-quality education while remaining at near-capacity in terms of enrollment. Dr. Crawley's report noted that GFHS currently has dining facilities too small for the size of the student body; requires students, faculty, staff, and the public to walk outdoors during winter weather to move between buildings (a safety hazard); does not integrate the South Campus with the Upper Campus; lacks an adequate HVAC system (particularly in moving fresh air into the interior, as well as moving air around inside the building); cannot accommodate <b>high-bandwidth</b> computer or phone lines; and has poor cell phone, television, and radio reception. The building also lacks zoned heat regulation, which makes some areas of the building too hot and others too cold and reduces energy efficiency. School officials also say the Old Gym HVAC system is not functioning well, there are aging light fixtures throughout the building, and the hallways on the second and third floors are dark. Additionally, student traffic flows throughout the building are poor (especially in the skywalk leading to the industrial arts annex), and the industrial arts annex suffers from safety problems.|$|E

500|$|On 3 March 2008, it was {{reported}} that Britain's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), faced with an £80 million shortfall in its budget, was considering withdrawing its planned £2.7 million annual funding of Jodrell Bank's e-MERLIN project. The project, which aims to replace the microwave links between Jodrell Bank {{and a number of other}} radio telescopes with <b>high-bandwidth</b> fibre-optic cables, greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations, is seen as critical to the survival of the establishment in its present form. Sir Bernard Lovell was quoted as saying [...] "It will be a disaster … The fate of the Jodrell Bank telescope is bound up with the fate of e-MERLIN. I don't think the establishment can survive if the e-MERLIN funding is cut".|$|E

2500|$|During read {{streaming}} {{into the}} CPU, a custom prefetch instruction, extended data cache block touch (xDCBT) prefetches data {{directly to the}} L1 data cache of the intended core, which skips putting the data in the L2 cache to avoid thrashing the L2 cache.
