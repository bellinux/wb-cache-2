40|$|The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> {{tends to}} occur in the {{transition}} region of the guiding magnetic field in a magnetically insulated coaxial diode (MICD). Influence of the guiding magnetic field on characteristics of the MICD especially on the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is studied by the particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation in this paper. The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is confirmed to be irrelevant with the guiding magnetic field strength. However, the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is clarified quantitatively to depend on the electric and magnetic field distribution in the upstream of the cathode tip. As the MICD has been widely employed in microwave tubes, a simple approach to suppress the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> on the premise of little change of the original diode is valuable and thus proposed.

40|$|An {{idealized}} {{steady state}} {{model of a}} stream of energetic electrons neutralized by a <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> in the pre-flare solar plasma was developed. These calculations indicate that, in some cases, a significant fraction of the beam energy may be dissipated by the <b>reverse</b> <b>current.</b> Joule heating by the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is a more effective mechanism for heating the plasma than collisional losses from the energetic electrons because the Ohmic losses are caused by thermal electrons in the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> which have much shorter mean free paths than the energetic electrons. The heating due to <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> is calculated for two injected energetic electron fluxes. For the smaller injected flux, {{the temperature of the}} coronal plasma is raised by about a factor of two. The larger flux causes the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> drift velocity to exceed the critical velocity for the onset of ion cyclotron turbulence, producing anomalous resistivity and an order of magnitude increase in the temperature.

To {{determine}} the energy levels of intrinsic defects in high-purity semi-insulating 4 H-SiC, we apply discharge current transient spectroscopy (DCTS), a graphical peak analysis method {{based on the}} transient <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> of a Schottky barrier diode, because transient capacitance methods such as deep level transient spectroscopy and isothermal capacitance transient spectroscopy are feasible only in low-resistivity semiconductors.

In this model, the undoped PCD is treated as a slightly doped p-type semiconductor due to the existence of the deep level defects of acceptor-states.
