It then reviews the benefits and constraints of these evaluation campaigns. Borrowing concepts from the field of economics, it also provides an analysis of the economic incentives to organize evaluation campaigns. It entails from this analysis that fitting evaluation campaigns to the needs of scientific research requires a strong implication in term of research policy and public funding. 1...|$|R
