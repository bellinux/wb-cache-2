500|$|After announcing {{he would}} not run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Gore {{endorsed}} Vermont governor Howard Dean in December 2003, weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. He was criticized for this endorsement by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate Joe Lieberman (Gore preferred Dean over Lieberman because Lieberman supported the Iraq War and Gore did not). Dean's campaign soon became a target of attacks and eventually failed, with Gore's early endorsement being credited as a factor. In The New York Times, Dean stated: [...] "I actually <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> endorsement of Al Gore began the decline." [...] The Times further noted that [...] "Dean instantly amplified his statement {{to indicate that the}} endorsement from Mr. Gore, a powerhouse of the establishment, so threatened the other Democratic candidates that they began the attacks on his candidacy that helped derail it." [...] Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, also stated that after Gore's endorsement of Dean, [...] "alarm bells went off in every newsroom in the country, in every other campaign in the country", indicating that if something did not change, Dean would be the nominee. Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6 million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid. Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

2500|$|..... I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Internet’s under {{much greater}} attack {{than it has}} been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of {{commercial}} interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms. But they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2013, an {{interview}} was published quoting Ewen confirming {{that the group}} had split. Ewen was quoted saying [...] "This is a tricky one because I don't feel comfortable lying, saying we're in the studio recording and we're going to bring music out next year, {{which seems to be}} the favoured line," [...] she said. [...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end. There was so much drama surrounding the group, I think the music just got lost. I don't like all the drama and the negativity. We kind of fizzled out about two years ago. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> lineup changes have obviously got to be a factor, you can't get away from it," [...] she said. [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't think the same when I was approached. I was like, 'Is this going to work? Are people going to accept it?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunt was {{speaking}} to the LSE about socially responsible broadcasting, and stated [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> BBC is a socially responsible broadcaster, I just {{think we need to}} hear that." [...] He argued that broadcasters were not being ambitious enough, and outlined his party's plans, should it be elected to government at the next general election, to relax regulation for those broadcasters who agreed to provide only socially responsible output. In addition to citing the Ross/Brand/Sachs affair as a [...] "perfect example" [...] of where such a [...] "responsibility deal" [...] could have operated, he also pointed to Channel 4 as an example, stating that it was [...] "not good enough" [...] for it to produce [...] "worthy" [...] programmes such as Dispatches documenting alcohol abuse in the US, whilst {{at the same time it}} was broadcasting programmes such as Hollyoaks where such abuse took up, according to his estimates, 18% of screen time. The culture spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, Don Foster, criticised this idea, stating that it threatened the very foundational principles of freedom and independence of British media, arguing that such government interference in television programming would be [...] "a very sad day for British broadcasting", and pointing out that regulatory mechanisms already exist to deal with issues such as this.|$|E
2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to the people who <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
