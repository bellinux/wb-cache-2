This has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in private industry. Professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics.|$|E

40|$|Dependable and {{efficient}} utilization of a multigrasp prosthetic hand requires an effective control interface. This interface should be intuitive and <b>direct,</b> <b>offering</b> continuous and proportional control of motion with negligible latency. Realization {{of such a}} controller is a challenging problem in upper extremity prosthetics research although several significant strides have been made. Prevalent approaches to multigrasp control thus far include pattern recognition and hierarchical control. This paper presents the design and preliminary experimental validation of a myoelectric controller that is intended to control the continuous motion of a multigrasp prosthetic hand between nine characteristic postures (reposition, point, hook, lateral pinch, opposition, tip, cylindrical, spherical and tripod). The controller, referred to as multigrasp myoelectric control (MMC) {{is based on an}} EMG supervised event-driven finite state machine. The EMG component provides user intent, and consists of a single bipolar signal acquired through two EMG electrodes, similar to EMG interfaces commonly found in commercial myoelectric prostheses. The state machine acts in conjunction with a low-level coordination controller to activate different actuator subsets (connected to digits via tendons in the prosthesis) based on the present state. The controller incorporates object detection and force estimation algorithms to allow force based state transitions and the estimation of digit forces. To test the functionality of the controller, experiments were conducted on a healthy subject using an able bodied adapter with a multigrasp prosthetic hand. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the ability of the MMC to provide effective movement and grasp control of the multigrasp prosthesis...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study was written {{with the intent}} to inform educators of the impact that divorce may have on children, of possible factors contributing to the resiliency in children of divorce, and of possible intervention efforts on the part of educators. An extensive literature review presented various perspectives from researchers, authors, and theorists. Developmental theorists such as Erickson were paralleled with empirical evidence collected by researchers such as Wallerstein. Studies including a meta-analysis by Amato (2001) were presented in discussions of the possible outcomes for children of divorce. Long-term outcomes were considered {{from the perspective of a}} sociologist and a journalist. Positive parenting skills were offered by experts such as Brooks (2005). A qualitative study of the reflective experiences of adult children of divorced parents was also initiated to determine the accuracy of the literature review and to encourage further research in this area. This thesis involved a self-administered survey of eleven adult children of divorce, while analysis of the survey data utilized a modified form of Grounded Theory. Findings from the survey and the literature review demonstrated the need for relevant educational programs and professional development of educators. It also revealed that programming for parents should include significant elements of motivational and transfer-of-learning techniques, and that programs promoting positive reflective thought are needed for adults emerging from childhood divorce experiences. The descriptions of emotions and behaviours disclosed by the participants of the survey were compelling and <b>direct,</b> <b>offering</b> convincing insight into the impact of parental divorce. Participants indicated that parents, and other significant individuals, did not understand what they were feeling. Most participants could recall individuals or groups that did intervene positively in their lives; one mention was made of teacher concern about possible depression. The participants offered insight into positive and negative parental behaviours, and their reflective discussions suggested that one significant outcome of parental divorce was the impact it had on the parent/child relationship, as well as the suggestion that a difficult transition into adult relationships was often a result of this experience. Although significant research has been accomplished on the short-term impact on child development, investigation into the long-term outcomes of parental divorce has received minimal attention, possibly making it difficult for educators to have concrete data to draw upon. The research strongly suggested that there may be a population of individuals that could benefit from educational programs that focus upon their experience as children of divorce. It is my conclusion that an appropriate educational context of constructive reflection and support can contribute positively to the well-being and quality of life for children of divorce...|$|E
