40|$|Introduction: The present {{research}} aimed to compare anxiety and hope between mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from autism syndrome and Down syndrome. Methods: This research used a descriptive-comparative method and {{the sample of}} the study included 60 mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from autism and down syndromes. The sample was selected among all mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> {{in the age of}} 6 - 12 who were suffering from autism and Down syndrome in Kerman in 2014. In order to measure the variables of the research we used 2 questionnaires, the Pennsylvania anxiety questionnaire and the scale of aptitude toward hope among adults. Results: The results showed that the amount of anxiety and hope among mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from autism was different from mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from Down syndrome. Conclusion: The anxiety between mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> with autism syndrome was more than mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> with Down syndrome. The level of hope between mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> with Down syndrome was higher than mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> with autism syndrome.

40|$|Personality {{has been}} implicated in romantic and sexual relationships, but its {{association}} with childbearing is poorly understood. The authors assessed whether 3 personality traits—sociability, emotionality, and activity—predicted the probability of <b>having</b> <b>children</b> and whether <b>having</b> <b>children</b> predicted personality change. The participants were women and men from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study (N 1, 839) who were followed for 9 years. High emotionality decreased the probability of <b>having</b> <b>children,</b> whereas high sociability and, in men, high activity increased this probability. <b>Having</b> <b>children</b> predicted increasing emotionality, particularly in participants with high baseline emotionality and two or more <b>children.</b> In men, <b>having</b> <b>children</b> increased sociability in those with high baseline sociability and decreased sociability in those with low baseline sociability. These findings suggest a two-way relation-ship between personality and <b>having</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R
