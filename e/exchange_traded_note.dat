40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the modelling and trading of three daily market implied volatility indices issued on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) using evolving combinations of prominent autoregressive and emerging heuristics models, with the aims of introducing an algorithm that provides a better approximation {{of the most popular}} U. S. volatility indices than those that have already been presented in the literature and determining whether there is the ability to produce profitable trading strategies. A heterogeneous autoregressive process (HAR) is combined with a genetic algorithm–support vector regression (GASVR) model in two hybrid algorithms. The algorithms’ statistical performances are benchmarked against the best forecasters on the VIX, VXN and VXD volatility indices. The trading performances of the forecasts are evaluated through a trading simulation based on VIX and VXN futures contracts, {{as well as on the}} VXZ <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>note</b> based on the S&# 38;P 500 VIX mid-term futures index. Our findings indicate the existence of strong nonlinearities in all indices examined, while the GASVR algorithm improves the statistical significance of the HAR processes.

40|$|Exchange traded {{products}} (“ETPs”) {{have been}} experiencing tremendous growth {{as a class}} of financial products for the past twenty years. One of the more recent innovations in the ETP market is the <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>note</b> (“ETN”), which first came into existence in 2006. An ETN is an unsecured debt liability of the issuing financial institution that provides an investor economic exposure {{to a variety of}} asset classes, trading strategies, and markets with the convenience that comes with trading on an exchange. As the ETN market has grown, a number of phenomena have developed that pose interesting asset pricing questions. The chapters in this dissertation will describe ETNs and the ETN market, highlight a variety of stylized facts about ETNs, and provide an explanation {{for one of the most}} prominent ETN puzzles. The first chapter provides a detailed description of ETNs as a financial product, including an outline of their defining institutional features. The growth of the ETN market from the inception of the first product in June 2006 to a $ 23 billion market by the end of 2013 is documented throughout the chapter. Since financial industry references and discussions of ETNs often comingle ETNs with exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), the chapter offers a comparison of ETNs and ETFs, highlighting key similarities between the two classes of ETP and, more importantly, the key differences. A main contribution of this chapter is a documentation of the “ETN premium puzzle. ” As derivatively-priced products, the market price of an ETN should align with its fundamental value. This chapter shows that on average the market prices of ETNs exceed their fundamental values by 31 basis points with certain individual ETNs trading at premiums well above 100 basis points. ETNs trading at a discount are far less likely and the absolute magnitude of discounts are far lower than those of premiums. Collectively, these stylized facts constitute the “ETN premium puzzle. ”The second chapter presents a number of selected ETN case studies that motivate a preliminary explanation for the ETN premium puzzle. The first case study focuses on the ETNs that were issued by Lehman Brothers. As unsecured debt obligations of Lehman Brothers, those ETNs suffered substantial losses as a result of Lehman’s failure. The case study highlights that two of the three Lehman ETNs continued to trade at premiums up until the day of bankruptcy despite the generally increasing market concern about Lehman’s solvency. The chapter also uses the Lehman failure to study the ETN market’s general consideration of counterparty credit risk in ETN pricing, finding that the market became more attentive to the credit risk of ETNs after the failure, but that such attention did not last beyond a couple months. The chapter also uses case studies to demonstrate the effects of the two most significant factors that explain the ETN premium puzzle: (i) the suspension of new share creation by the issuer and (ii) the degree of competition that an ETN faces in providing exposure to its targeted asset class or market. The first factor serves as a limit to arbitrage, while the second factor contributes to the overall demand for the ETN. The third chapter presents a full explanation of the ETN premium puzzle. The chapter motivates the story of the explanation through the noise trader / arbitrager framework of De Long, et al. (1990) and Shleifer and Summers (1990). As applied to the ETN market, it is more appropriate to label noise traders as demand traders, since the noise trader definition presumes irrationality, while in the ETN context, there are rational non-arbitrageur market participants. The results of this chapter show that many of the institutional features of ETNs lead to substantial limits to arbitrage, which alone explain much of the ETN premium puzzle. The chapter conducts a cross sectional regression of ETN arbitrage speeds (i. e. the daily error correction rate for ETNs with stationary premiums) on various factors that limit arbitrage, showing which factors weaken the arbitrage mechanisms the most. The chapter then adds a number of factors that account for the demand of ETNs. In a panel regression that combines the limits to arbitrage with the demand factors, the chapter provides a fuller explanation of the ETN premium puzzle...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{overarching}} {{belief that the}} carry trade is a simple investment strategy based on the popular mantra of buying low and selling high. However, in reality, there are several factors {{that need to be}} taken into consideration when devising a carry trade strategy. These hardships are further complicated by the number of options available in such a strategy. The main objective of my thesis is to implement this popular hedge fund strategy through the structure of an <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund. The interest rate spread between two different currencies should be an expectation of future exchange rates, however, empirically, this belief does not hold true. The carry trade takes advantage of this violation of uncovered interest rate parity and I will show that a specific implementation of the carry trade yielded positive returns on a historical basis. I believe it is essential to understand the basics of the carry trade. I will discuss the mechanics and highlight the inherent advantages and risk factors in making such an investment. I will then discuss the current landscape and what financial products are available to investors who {{want to take advantage of}} the carry trade - from hedge funds to <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>notes</b> and <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds. Next, I will discuss how one goes about launching an <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund and the various considerations that need to be made by someone undertaking such an endeavor. Finally, I will try and establish demand for a carry <b>trade</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund in the retirement market and investigate the hurdles for such a product. by Jonathan Shan.

40|$|This {{research}} {{tests the}} performance of volatility <b>Exchange</b> <b>Traded</b> <b>Notes</b> (ETN) and Funds and compares the results to three benchmarks {{to determine whether the}} risk-adjusted returns are sufficient to compensate for the high risk and high expenses. Two tests are composed along three dimensions to establish the magnitude and frequency with which the volatility funds outperform the benchmarks. The first dimension tests the robustness of the fund performance to the construction of the portfolio. The results provide evidence that the strong negative correlation between the S&P 500 and ETN returns is not sufficient to consistently produce risk-adjusted returns greater than the benchmarks. The second dimension tests the sensitivity of the results to one-day, one-week and one-month holding periods. The findings indicate that changes in the holding period alter the identity of the successful portfolios but the number of successful funds remains low regardless of the holding period. Finally, the third dimension employs two different weighting methods to the construction of the portfolios. Once again, the findings show that the number of successful portfolios produced by either weighting method is low and unimpressive relative to the benchmarks. Overall, the evidence suggests that the poor performance is unique to volatility ETNs rather than to volatility in general. </p...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Facilities are {{available}} to individual investors {{to enable them to}} invest directly in a multitude of investments without making use of investment brokers or financial advisors. Although this facility offers the benefit of reduced administration and management fees, it also puts the investor in a position where he is responsible for making his own investment decisions. Since Markowitz’s publication fifty years ago, it has been known that diversification is necessary {{in order to reduce the}} investor’s exposure to any unsystematic investment risk while still obtaining an acceptable return. Studies have shown that human behaviour has an impact on investment decisions and that human nature skews the individual’s perception of diversification and risk and the reality thereof. For this reason, the individual investor is better off making use of quantitative methods in order to ensure a properly diversified portfolio. <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> products are passive, index tracking investments that <b>trade</b> on stock <b>exchanges</b> and pose benefits to individual investors owing to their low administrative costs and inherent levels of diversification. Individual investors are able to purchase <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> products such as <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds (ETFs), <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>notes</b> (ETNs) and index tracking unit trusts through various means, including brokerage firms and online trading platforms. These platforms offer little advice to the individual investor on how to select the most suitable investment products and how each product will affect the risk profile of an investor’s portfolio. The purpose of this research assignment was to develop a portfolio optimisation tool that would help the investor obtain the optimal return for his desired level of risk, thereby ensuring efficient diversification. An optimisation model was developed by using performance data from 2009 to 2013 and the resultant optimised portfolio’s performance was evaluated for 2014. It was found that optimisation rendered acceptable results, provided that the covariances between the various ETFs showed equivalence year on year. This requirement limited the number of ETFs that could be included in the model. Improvements to the model were recommended, based on the results of similar research in the field of portfolio optimisation. Further research is proposed that would utilise other optimisation methods, other sources of data and comparisons that are more detailed...|$|R
40|$|For {{many decades}} {{the only way}} to invest in {{volatility}} has been through trading options, futures, or variance swaps. But in recent years a number of volatility-related <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> Funds (ETFs) and <b>Exchange</b> <b>Traded</b> <b>Notes</b> (ETNs) have been launched which make volatility trading accessible to the retail investor and fund managers without the need to access futures markets. Our objective is to devise a trading strategy using them. We document where volatility returns come from, clearing up some misconception in the process. Then we illustrate five different strategies that will appeal to different investors. Four of the strategies are simple to describe and implement. All of the strategies have had extraordinary returns with high Sharpe Ratios and low correlation to the S&P 500, in some cases negative correlation. The returns seems to be {{too good to be true}} – like picking up $ 100 bills in front of a steamroller – so we have a detailed discussion on the risks and the nature of the steamroller. We illustrate how these strategies can be incorporated into existing portfolios to reduce portfolio risk especially in times of crisis. They have positive exposure to the markets during good times and negative exposure during bad times. Unfortunately they do not always provide absolute returns and while reducing net portfolio drawdowns they can themselves have significant drawdowns. Still, we suggest that a traditional 60 % equities, 40 % bonds portfolio should be adjusted to 55 % equities, 35 % bonds, and 10 % volatility. This is primarily an expository paper which explains concepts that are quite simple. So we omit formal technicalities such as bootstrap, robustness, statistical, and stress tests and leave out mathematics apart from some interesting notes that we confine to an optional technical appendix. The investing strategies are very easy to apply and the (optional reading) discussions of the mechanics of the futures markets belies their simplicity...|$|R
40|$|Academic {{research}} studies financial innovations {{and the impact}} that new financial products have on both investors and the overall market. This dissertation expands on the financial innovations literature by analyzing a relatively recent innovation, <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>notes</b> (ETNs). Chapter 1 examines the market frictions that the introduction of ETNs may have resolved. The results suggest that ETNs provide investment characteristics not easily replicated with existing ETFs; however, the uniqueness of ETN returns are concentrated within certain ETN objectives. I also document the presence of inverse-pair ETNs and find that inverse-pair ETNs have more efficient prices than other non-pair ETNs. Chapter 2 examines whether institutional preferences for equities are applicable to the ETN market and institutional investors 2 ̆ 7 involvement in the ETN lending market. The results suggest that institutional investors apply liquidity and risk preferences {{when it comes to}} selecting ETNs. Focusing on an institutionally determined segment of trading, the short sales market, I find support for institutions 2 ̆ 7 role as suppliers to the securities lending market. Chapter 3 looks at the types of ETNs that mutual funds are attracted to, the characteristics of the mutual funds that are investing in ETNs, and the ETN shares held short by mutual funds. Mutual funds prefer derivative-like ETNs. Thus, ETNs may serve as a means to get around investment constraints. However, counter to what is hypothesized, results of tests on the types of mutual funds holding ETNs suggest that it is the low-constraint mutual funds that hold ETNs. Last, despite the constraints related to short selling, mutual funds hold short positions of ETNs. Mutual fund managers seem to possess skill in these investments...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on the issue of <b>trade</b> <b>exchange</b> between European Union member states. The <b>trade</b> <b>exchange</b> volume <b>noted</b> an {{increase}} after the new members had joined the European Union. That may be observed while analysing statistical data on the <b>trade</b> <b>exchange</b> volume in speci fi c states {{as well as in the}} whole of the European Union. A simple index analysis of the trade volume enables researchers to observe changes over time; however, it neglects the causes of these changes. With a view to identifying theses causes, an econometric tool – the panel gravity model – was used for the purposes of the present paper. The research objective of the paper is to evaluate the impact of selected factors on the development of bilateral trade in the European Union in the years 1999 – 2010. The group of potential factors describing the size of <b>trade</b> <b>exchange</b> includes the following: the Gross Domestic Product per capita, foreign direct investment per capita and the geographical distance between trading partners. The research outcome enabled us to draw a conclusion on a positive dependence between a member state’s GDP and its export and import volume.

50|$|With {{a change}} in the general climate and the {{beginning}} of the economic reforms, after adoption of the Law on the capital market in 1989, the Founding Assembly of the Yugoslav Capital Market, established by 32 biggest banks from the territory of former Yugoslavia, was held. In 1992, the Yugoslav Capital Market changed its name to the Belgrade Stock Exchange. In the 1990s, the trading material mostly consisted of debt instruments of companies, government bonds and the like. Although the first share trade was carried out in 1991 (companies Sintelon and Auto kuća Kikinda), it was only in 2000 that a significant step forward was made, when shares from the previous privatization processes were included in secondary trading. In 1996, the Belgrade Stock <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> in commodity-commercial <b>notes</b> of the Commodity Reserves with the underlying in corn, maize, sugar and oil, while the first municipal bonds were <b>traded</b> on the <b>Exchange</b> in 2000, as well as the first treasury notes of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.

Summary <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds and mutual funds are similar investment vehicles. Due to the existence of passively managed funds of both types, the question arises, whether they provide similar returns with similar risk. The literature explains the differences of both fund types and finally the empirical analysis aims to discover whether there are significant differences in what they provide. Additionally, due to the proliferation of <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds all over the developed capital markets, one would think that due to their similarity with mutual funds, they would eventually replace them. Conclusions No statistical evidence of any differences in <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> fund and mutual fund returns, risk, risk-adjusted returns or index tracking. Mutual funds have not incurred lower cash flows on a cumulative basis. <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds and mutual funds can possibly coexist because both have their own users depending on the investment horizon, tax structure or the monetary situation of the investor among other factors...|$|R
