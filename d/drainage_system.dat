5|$|June 14, 2006– The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Alberto cross the state, producing heavy rainfall peaking at 7.16inches (182mm) in Raleigh; the rain causes one indirect death when a boy runs into a flooded <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> and drowns.|$|E
5|$|Some {{other studies}} have {{proposed}} that issues with the spinal venous <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the epidural space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein.|$|E

5|$|The {{electricity}} supplied {{to the town}} is regulated and distributed by the Nagapattinam circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). The water supply {{is provided by the}} Nagapattinam Municipality, through borewells from Vettar river — the distribution is done through pumping stations located at Kurukathi, Andipalayam and Solomon Park. About 55 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day. Nagapattinam municipality does not have an underground <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> and the current sewerage system for disposal of sullage is through septic tanks and public conveniences. The storm water <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> is made up of the natural river drainage and man-made storm water drains.|$|E

5000|$|Subsurface (groundwater) {{drainage}} {{for water}} table and soil salinity in agricultural land {{can be done}} by horizontal and vertical <b>drainage</b> systems.Horizontal <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> are <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> using open ditches (trenches) or buried pipe drains.Vertical <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> are <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> using pumped wells, either open dug wells or tube wells.Both systems serve the same purposes, namely water table control and soil salinity control [...] Both systems can facilitate the reuse of drainage water (e.g. for irrigation), but wells offer more flexibility.Reuse is only feasible if the quality of the groundwater is acceptable and the salinity is low.|$|R

5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E

Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E

5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the {{retaining}} wall. This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree {{at the center of}} the courtyard fell down on top of the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a field trial {{for developing a}} gas mixture enhanced coalbed methane (GECBM) technology that can be integrated with underground coal mine methane (CMM) <b>drainage</b> <b>systems.</b> The field trial {{was carried out in}} a deep underground coalmine roadway in two stages, initially degassing using a conventional method for 30 days in three boreholes installed in the underground coal seam and then injecting the gas mixture from one of the boreholes for about 2 months. The field trial focuses on the investigation of the technical and economic feasibilities of G-ECBM technology applied to underground CMM <b>drainage</b> <b>systems.</b> The results revealed that the G-ECBM technology integrated with underground methane <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> can provide an effective method to enhance the coalbed methane (CBM) recovery from coal mines and the efficiency of underground gas <b>drainage</b> <b>systems,</b> and hence improve the mining safety. The field measurements showed that the single-borehole flow rate and concentration of CH for the production boreholes with G-ECBM have increased by a factor of 4. 73 and 1. 68 on average, respectively, compared with the conventional production boreholes without G-ECBM. The results also showed the economic prospect of applying G-ECBM technology to underground CMM <b>drainage</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
