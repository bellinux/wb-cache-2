5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, <b>dressmaking</b> and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, the Technical Instruction Acts (1889 & 1891) {{provided}} {{financial assistance}} for evening classes in various science and arts subjects. Earlier voluntary classes were now coordinated, and this became {{the beginning of}} a national system of technical education. Subjects included Shorthand, Animal Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Carpentry and <b>Dressmaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rankin {{graduated}} from high school in 1898, and from the University of Montana in 1902 with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. With no clear career ambitions, she first tried <b>dressmaking</b> in Missoula, and then furniture design in Boston, where she lived while her brother attended Harvard. She also turned down several marriage proposals.|$|E
25|$|Also {{established}} in 1919 was the Negro Factories Corporation, with a capitalization of one million dollars. It generated income and provided around 700 jobs by its numerous enterprises: three grocery stores, two restaurants, a laundry, a tailor shop, a <b>dressmaking</b> shop, a millinery store, a printing company and doll factory. However, most {{went out of}} business by 1922.|$|E
25|$|He married, on 7 December 1929 (civil), in Aix-les-Bains, France, and 13 December 1929 (religious), in Bombay, India, Andrée Joséphine Carron (1898–1976). A {{co-owner}} of a <b>dressmaking</b> shop in Paris, she {{became known as}} Princess Andrée Aga Khan. By this marriage, he had one son, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan (1933–2003). The couple were divorced in 1943.|$|E
25|$|In Old Havana and {{throughout}} Vedado {{there are several}} small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or <b>dressmaking</b> facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Nenagh was {{primarily}} a market town providing services to the agricultural hinterland. Industries included brewing, corn processing, coach building and iron works {{with the addition of}} cottage industries such as tailoring, <b>dressmaking,</b> millinery, shoemaking, carpentry, wood-turning, wheelwrighting, harnessmaking, printing, and monumental sculpting. The Nenagh Co-operative Creamery was established in 1914 providing employment in milk processing and butter-making.|$|E
25|$|Wapishana men craft wooden stools and baskets, sieves, and squeezers {{for use in}} the {{preparation}} of cassava and other foods. They also make arrows, fencing wire into points, but these arrows and bows they buy or get hold of from other Indians have been almost entirely replaced by shotguns. Women make clay cooking pots and spin cotton and weave the thread into baby slings and hammocks. Introduced crafts include needlework, <b>dressmaking,</b> and rustic furniture making.|$|E
25|$|Having left Chapman, Cradock {{began the}} next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling {{cleaning}} products door to door. She then worked in a <b>dressmaking</b> shop. Things finally picked up for her when she began to work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of Auguste Escoffier, which proved influential. She later wrote passionately about the change from service à la française to service à la russe and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.|$|E
25|$|Today's folk {{dancing in}} Denmark {{dates back to}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, when there was renewed interest in the national heritage. A number of groups began to revive the music, dances and costumes of past generations. In 1901, the Society for the Promotion of Danish Folk Dancing (Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme) was founded in Copenhagen, leading to local dancing societies throughout the country. Today there are more than 12,000 folk dancers in 219 local clubs, providing courses in music, dancing and <b>dressmaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1870 US Census was {{the first}} United States Census to count “Females engaged in each occupation” and {{provides}} an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in sweatshops. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but teaching and the occupations of <b>dressmaking,</b> millinery, and tailoring played a larger role. Two-thirds of teachers were women. Women could {{also be found in}} such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), hunter and trapper (2).|$|E
25|$|Bells were vitally {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The daily routine began with sunrise Mass and morning prayers, followed by instruction of the natives in {{the teachings of the}} Roman Catholic faith. After a generous (by era standards) breakfast of atole, the able-bodied men and women were assigned their tasks for the day. The women were committed to <b>dressmaking,</b> knitting, weaving, embroidering, laundering, and cooking, while some of the stronger girls ground flour or carried adobe bricks (weighing 55 lb, or 25kg each) to the men engaged in building. The men worked a variety of jobs, having learned from the missionaries how to plow, sow, irrigate, cultivate, reap, thresh, and glean. In addition, they were taught to build adobe houses, tan leather hides, shear sheep, weave rugs and clothing from wool, make ropes, soap, paint, and other useful duties.|$|E
500|$|Her granddaughter {{described}} Secord {{as being}} [...] with {{brown eyes and}} a fair complexion. [...] James FitzGibbon wrote she was [...] "of slight frame and delicate appearance". [...] She was skilled at needlework, <b>dressmaking</b> and cooking. [...] According to biographer Peggy Dymond Leavey, her many grandchildren enjoyed hearing their grandmother tell stories of her early life, and her Anglican faith increased with age.|$|E
500|$|The {{rigorous}} curriculum had {{the girls}} rise at 5:30a.m. for Bible study. The classes in home economics and industrial {{skills such as}} <b>dressmaking,</b> millinery, cooking, and other crafts emphasized a life of self-sufficiency for them as women. Students' days ended at 9 pm. Soon Bethune added science and business courses, then high school-level courses of math, English, and foreign languages. [...] Bethune was always seeking donations to keep her school operating; as she traveled, she was fundraising. A donation of $62,000 by John D. Rockefeller helped, as did her friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife, beginning in the 1930s, who gave her entree to a progressive network.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin's {{childhood}} was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory [...] "the most dramatic {{of all the}} rags to riches stories ever told" [...] according to his authorised biographer David Robinson. Chaplin's early years were spent {{with his mother and}} brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and <b>dressmaking,</b> and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old. The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin remembered as [...] "a forlorn existence". He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.|$|E
500|$|Wilfrid Eggleston {{was born}} on 25 March 1901 in Lincoln to English parents who had moved from Spalding two years earlier, where his older sister Margaret had been born. His father was a former tax collector, his mother, a shop {{assistant}} and <b>dressmaking</b> apprentice; they had married in Grantham come 1897 after meeting as choristers in the town's Methodist chapel. Eggleston's father, one of nine children from a Nottinghamshire farm, relocated the family regularly through his successful work at an insurance firm. His mother, similarly privileged, {{is said to have}} received an education from a [...] "Victorian private school for young ladies". The family purchased a grocer's shop in Netherfield, Nottinghamshire, briefly resettling there until 1909. During this short period, Wilfrid was educated at the newly established Chandos Street Secondary School, which amalgamated in 1973 to form Carlton le Willows School.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 10, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with Will Allen, a country lad, who is unhappy at home, owing {{to the fact that}} he is a studious little chap and prefers his books to farm work, which incurs the displeasure and enmity of his stepfather, a rough and surly farmer, to whom book learning does not appeal. Will runs away from home, and although his mother keeps a light in the window, hoping to guide her boy home, he never returns. Twenty years later, when the boy has made a place for himself in the world as a successful lawyer, he goes back to the farm, only to find that his little mother, who has been left a widow, has gone away, whither, no one knows. The mother, in the meantime, being left alone in the world, goes to the city and there supports herself by <b>dressmaking.</b> While shopping in a department store she is unjustly accused of shoplifting. The only person who believes in her innocence is a salesgirl, who is discharged for her presumption and daring to correct her superiors. The girl, in her efforts to help the friendless old lady, enlists the aid of Will, whom she knows to be a lawyer of great ability. Will is about to refuse the case, as the dry goods company is a client of his, when the girl describes the lonely old lady, and begs him for the sake of his mother to befriend her. Will consents. Will's clear statement of the case to the judge, together with May's testimony, frees the mother. When her counsel approaches to offer his congratulations, mutual recognition results." ...|$|E
2500|$|Worth {{raised the}} status of <b>dressmaking</b> so that the designer-maker also became arbiter of what women should be wearing. Writing {{on the history of}} fashion and, in particular, dandyism, in 2002, George Walden said: [...] "Charles Frederick Worth {{dictated}} fashion in France {{a century and a half}} before Galliano".|$|E
2500|$|Yoshiko I. Wada is the {{granddaughter of}} a family of kimono makers in Tokyo. Her {{grandmother}} on the paternal side learned European <b>dressmaking</b> in Europe and nurtured her love and knowledge of European art. As a child she lived with her two sisters in Kobe and Tokyo, Japan.|$|E
2500|$|For housewives, sewing {{machines}} enabled {{the production of}} ready made clothing and {{made it easier for}} women to sew their own clothes; more generally, argues Barbara Burman, [...] "home <b>dressmaking</b> was sustained as an important aid for women negotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives." [...] An increased literacy in the middle class gave women wider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to her tastes and help define femininity.|$|E
2500|$|Dyer did {{not travel}} to Reading, {{as she had}} told Marmon. She went instead to 76 Mayo Road, Willesden, London where her 23-year-old {{daughter}} Polly was staying. There, Dyer quickly found some white edging tape used in <b>dressmaking,</b> wound it twice around the baby's neck and tied a knot. Death {{would not have been}} immediate. [...] (Dyer later said [...] "I used to like to watch them with the tape around their neck, but it was soon all over with them.") ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the later}} period of Joseon, a three-tiered system developed. The highest tier was {{occupied}} by haengsu (...) who sang and danced at upper-class feasts. Haengsu kisaeng were not permitted to entertain after they turned thirty. However, they could continue working in other duties, such as <b>dressmaking</b> and medicine, {{until the age of}} fifty. They received guests only by choice. Most of the kisaeng of the court were of the haengsu tier, also called seonsang (...) [...] The haengsu kisaeng of each district also took charge of discipline and training new kisaeng.|$|E

2500|$|Inman {{was born}} in 1935 in Preston, Lancashire, and was often {{said to be a}} cousin of actress Josephine Tewson, though she has denied the relationship. At the age of 12, Inman moved with his parents to Blackpool where his mother ran a {{boarding}} house, while his father owned a hairdressing business. [...] As a child, he enjoyed <b>dressmaking.</b> [...] He was educated at Claridge House in Preston, and then a secondary modern. Inman always wanted to be an actor, and his parents paid for him to have elocution lessons at the local church hall. At the age of 13 he made his stage debut in the Pavilion on Blackpool's South Pier, in a melodrama entitled Freda. [...] Aged 15, he took a job at the pier, making tea, clearing up and playing parts in plays.|$|E
2500|$|Worth began sewing dresses to {{complement}} the shawls at Gagelin. Initially, these were simple designs, but his expert tailoring {{caught the eye of}} the store's clients. Eventually, Gagelin granted Worth permission to open a dress department, his first official entrance into the <b>dressmaking</b> world. A 1958 article in The Times published shortly before a centenary exhibition in London to mark the opening of his Paris fashion house noted that the ambitious Englishman's ideas were almost too much for his employers: [...] "The young Worth, full of ideas, was having such a success at Gagelin's that it was felt necessary to restrain his rashness". His obituary, written by a Paris correspondent for The Times explained this comment in somewhat more detail, saying that he was refused a share in the Gagelin business, even though he had extended its activities into making up, rather than just selling, garments. He had also helped build the company's international reputation by exhibiting prize-winning designs to both The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and the Exposition Universelle in Paris four years later. At the Paris exposition he had displayed a white silk court train embroidered in gold.|$|E
2500|$|Reichelt {{was born}} in Wegstädtl, Austrian Empire (today, Štětí, Czech Republic) in 1879 and moved to Paris in 1898. He {{obtained}} French nationality in 1909, adopting the first name François (the French equivalent of the Germanic [...] "Franz"). One of his sisters may have also come to France and been married to a jeweller there, but newspaper reports differed {{on the details of}} his family life, with most reporting that his sisters stayed in Vienna. Reichelt himself was unmarried. He took an apartment on the third floor at 8 rue Gaillon near the Avenue de l'Opera from 1907 (which he rented for 1500 francs a year) and opened what was to become a successful <b>dressmaking</b> business, catering mostly to Austrians on trips to Paris. From July 1910, he began to develop a [...] "parachute-suit": a suit that was not much more bulky than one normally worn by an aviator, but {{with the addition of a}} few rods, a silk canopy and a small amount of rubber that allowed it to fold out to become what Reichelt hoped would be a practical and efficient parachute.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} turning points in her life. The first, and most tragic one, was {{the loss of}} her husband George and their four children, three girls and a boy (all under the age of five) in 1867, during a yellow fever {{epidemic}} in Memphis. After that tragedy, she returned to Chicago to begin another <b>dressmaking</b> business. Then, four years later, she lost her home, shop, and possessions in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. This huge fire destroyed many homes and shops. Jones, like many others, helped rebuild the city. According to her autobiography, this led to her joining the Knights of Labor. She started organizing strikes. At first the strikes and protests were a horrific failure and usually ended with the police shooting at and killing numerous protesters. The Haymarket Riot of 1886 and the fear of anarchism and upheaval incited by union organizations resulted in the demise of the Knights of Labor. Once the Knights ceased to exist, Mary Jones became involved mainly with the United Mine Workers. She frequently led UMW strikers in picketing and encouraged striking workers to stay on strike when management brought in strike-breakers and militias. She strongly believed that [...] "working men deserved a wage that would allow women to stay home to care for their kids." [...] Around this time, strikes were getting better organized and started to produce greater results, such as better pay for the workers.|$|E

60|$|First, {{they opened}} a {{registration}} office, where all young persons desiring {{employment in the}} <b>dressmaking</b> trade might enroll their names free of expense, and thus come in a manner {{under the care of}} the association. From the young people thus enrolled, they engaged to supply to the principals of <b>dressmaking</b> establishments extra assistants in periods of uncommon pressure, so that they should not be under the necessity of overtaxing their workwomen. This assistance is extended only to those houses which will observe the moderate hours recommended by the association.|$|E
60|$|They say of the document, on the whole, that, {{though not}} realizing all {{the views of}} the association, it must be {{regarded}} as creditable to those who have signed it, since it indicates the most important advance yet made towards the improvement of the <b>dressmaking</b> and millinery business. The committees then go on to express a most decided opinion, first, that the hours of work in the <b>dressmaking</b> trade ought not to exceed ten per diem; second, that during the fashionable season ladies should employ sufficient time for the execution of their orders.|$|E
