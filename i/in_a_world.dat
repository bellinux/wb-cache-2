50|$|Some {{studies also}} show that beliefs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> are {{correlated}} with internal locus of control. Strong belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> is associated with greater acceptance of and less dissatisfaction with negative events in one's life. This may be {{one way in which}} belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> affects mental health. Others have suggested that this relationship holds only for beliefs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> for oneself. Beliefs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> for others are related instead to the negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation observed in other studies.|$|R

Australia won and he was named the man of the match. Subsequently there has been some controversy over Gilchrist's use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings.|$|E
40|$|Can we be {{free and}} morally {{responsible}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> determined <b>world?</b> One of the main debates about this question is between the compatibilists and the incompatibilists.

50|$|Though much of {{the initial}} work on belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> focused on its {{negative}} social effects, other research suggests that belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> is good, and even necessary, for mental health. Belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> is associated with greater life satisfaction and well-being and less depressive affect. Researchers are actively exploring {{the reasons why the}} belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> might have this relationship to mental health; {{it has been suggested that}} such beliefs could be a personal resource or coping strategy that buffers stress associated with daily life and with traumatic events. This hypothesis suggests that belief <b>in</b> <b>a</b> just <b>world</b> can be understood as a positive illusion.|$|R
