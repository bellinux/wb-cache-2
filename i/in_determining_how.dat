5|$|The factors used <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> an {{individual}} aerodrome is categorised by the GASAR study are based broadly on size and facilities. The six types of aerodrome are described, in size order, as: regional airports (e.g. East Midlands); major GA airports (e.g. Oxford); developed GA airfields (e.g. Andrewsfield); basic GA airfields (e.g. Rufforth); developed airstrips (e.g. Tilstock); and basic airstrips (e.g. Chilbolton in Hampshire). The actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex, using 28 different parameters, backed {{up with a}} peer review by experienced GA pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|Verne went to d'Ennery {{with the}} idea in February 1880, and they collaborated in Antibes for several weeks on two {{projects}} simultaneously: the dramatization of Michael Strogoff and the new play. Of their collaborations, Journey Through the Impossible was the first, and {{would be the only}} one, not based directly on a pre-existing Verne novel. Modern scholarship has not been successful <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> much of the play each of the collaborators wrote, but the Verne scholar Robert Pourvoyeur has suggested that the play is clearly founded on Verne's ideas and therefore can be treated as being mostly the work of Verne.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E
5|$|IWGC war cemeteries {{featured}} {{grass and}} flowers within a walled area, intended to resemble an English garden; almost all were constructed around a War Stone and a Cross of Sacrifice, described {{in more detail}} below. The style varied slightly by architect and location, but typically the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments, sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion. The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs. The graves proved controversial: initially they were marked by wooden crosses but, after some argument, it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier's next of kin. Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name, regiment, date of death, a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the next of kin. Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s. British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials, the limited options for families to individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> the soldiers were buried.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E

25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> depressed the individuals were.|$|E

25|$|Wd1 {{has been}} too remote for direct {{measurement}} of the distance via parallax measurements, but the Gaia space mission is expected to provide such a measurement in 2018. In the mean time, the distance to Wd1 must be estimated from the expected absolute magnitude of the stars and estimates of the extinction towards the cluster. This has been done for both the yellow hypergiant and Wolf–Rayet populations, yielding estimates around 5kpc in both cases, while a determination from the main-sequence population suggests 3.6kpc. These estimates all place Wd1 near {{the outer edge of}} the Galactic bar, which may be significant <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> such a massive cluster formed.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} an {{underground}} nuclear test may vary according to factors including the depth and yield of the explosion, {{as well as the}} nature of the surrounding rock. If the test is conducted at sufficient depth, the test is said to be contained, with no venting of gases or other contaminants to the environment. In contrast, if the device is buried at insufficient depth ("underburied"), then rock may be expelled by the explosion, forming a crater surrounded by ejecta, and releasing high-pressure gases to the atmosphere (the resulting crater is usually conical in profile, circular, and may range between tens to hundreds of metres in diameter and depth). One figure used <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> deeply the device should be buried is the scaled depth of burial, or -burst. This figure is calculated as the burial depth in metres divided by the cube root of the yield in kilotons. It is estimated that, in order to ensure containment, this figure should be greater than 100.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E
30|$|The {{amount of}} water produced, along {{with the type of}} {{technology}} employed, determines the amount of energy needed to desalinate the water.

5000|$|All Denjū have a {{range of}} {{statistics}} (colloquially called [...] "stats"): Hit Points (HP), Speed, Attack, Defense, Denma Attack and Denma Defense. These statistics <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> powerful, fast or robust any given Denjū is. The type of habitat a Denjū lives <b>in</b> <b>determines</b> <b>how</b> weak it is to attacks from Denjū from other habitats; there is a vulnerability chain that goes from Mountain to Sky, from Sky to Forest, from Forest to Aquatic, from Aquatic to Desert, from Desert to Grassland and, finally, from Grassland to Mountain. This also applies in reverse in the sense that a Denjū of certain types inflicts less damage upon one it is weak to. However, this was slightly changed in Keitai Denjū Telefang 2, where Denjūs habitat types are defensive, and attacks are of separate offensive types: Normal, Flame, Thunder, Water, Wind, Rock and Machine. This arrangement makes Denjū a bit more versatile, as they may carry moves that would be effective against opponents they would normally have trouble against.|$|R
500|$|While Section 2 and Section 5 {{prohibit}} jurisdictions from drawing electoral {{districts that}} dilute {{the votes of}} protected minorities, the Supreme Court has held that in some instances, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities. The Court first recognized the justiciability of affirmative [...] "racial gerrymandering" [...] claims in Shaw v. Reno (1993). In Miller v. Johnson (1995), the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the [...] "predominant factor" [...] <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> to draw district lines. For race to [...] "predominate", the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles, which include [...] "compactness, contiguity, [...] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests." [...] If a court concludes that racial considerations predominated, then the redistricting plan is considered [...] "racially gerrymandered" [...] and must be subjected to strict scrutiny, meaning that the redistricting plan will be upheld as constitutional {{only if it is}} narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. In Bush v. Vera (1996), a plurality of the Supreme Court assumed that complying with Section 2 or Section 5 constituted compelling interests, and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering.|$|E
500|$|The phase {{velocity}} is important <b>in</b> <b>determining</b> <b>how</b> a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented {{in terms of}} a refractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the {{phase velocity}}vp in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light. In exotic materials like Bose–Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light [...] "slowing" [...] in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a [...] "complete standstill" [...] by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being [...] "stopped" [...] in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had [...] "stopped," [...] it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which [...] "slow" [...] the speed of light.|$|E
