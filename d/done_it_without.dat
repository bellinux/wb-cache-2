500|$|After its {{announcement}} at 2009's Electronic Entertainment Expo, Armada of the Damned was {{met with}} positive reactions from most video game journalists. Daemon Hatfield from IGN named it [...] "a promising action RPG," [...] elaborating that [...] "even though Armada of the Damned uses the Pirates of the Caribbean license... is its own game, an adventure that lets players create their own pirate and wander the seas of the Caribbean seeking fame and fortune." [...] Chris Antista from GamesRadar praised its gameplay, comparing it with Assassin’s Creed. He stated that [...] "the game has spectacularly preserved {{the spirit of the}} films, and they’ve <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> parasitically clinging to moments you’ve already seen on the big screen." ...|$|E

Emilee Linder from MTV News observed that the video was completely different from the one released by Swift, but described it as [...] "action-packed" [...] in a different way, that of portraying a party. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone declared that with the release of [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna, [...] "The age of blockbuster all-star music videos are upon us". Both Nolan Feeney from Time and August Brown from the Los Angeles Times noted that Madonna was able to successfully bring together her music industry peers in one video.|$|E

500|$|Arts, which Playford {{showed no}} {{personal}} interest in, and regarded as [...] "frills not fundamentals" [...] and [...] "non-productive", became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle-class. For his attitude, Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his [...] "philistinism". The Nation derisorily quipped that [...] "It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard spray {{gun at the}} mention of the word 'culture'". Sir Arthur Rymill, an LCL member of the upper house, criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal, lobbied Playford for increased funding without success, pointing out that world-class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government. Hurtle Morphett, a former State President of the LCL, quipped that if Playford [...] "had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he would have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> hesitation". In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival started, while the Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia was founded in the capital, with minimal assistance from Playford's government. The festival was well-received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism. With the success of the festival, public interest in arts increased, and with increasing calls for government funding, particularly from Dunstan, Playford finally agreed to fund the [...] "non-productive area" [...] in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the Festival Centre.|$|E
500|$|In what {{proved to}} be one of the {{tightest}} ever pitching duels in a perfect game, Joss took the mound for the Naps, while the White Sox pitcher was future Hall of Famer Ed Walsh. Neither pitcher would give up an earned run in the 1–0 game. Walsh, blistering through his own 39 win season, struck out 15 batters, gave up only one base on balls and allowed only four scattered hits by the Naps. The Naps' Joe Birmingham scored the team's only run, which came in the third inningthe lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The tension in the ballpark was described by one writer as [...] "a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded like a shovel scraping over concrete." [...] Joss, having faced the minimum 24 batters in the first eight inning, retired the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth. [...] Joss then faced White Sox pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit a line drive that could have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley, which Bradley bobbled before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out of the dirt to achieve the final out. With the win, Joss recorded the second ever perfect game in MLB's modern era. He accomplished the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved in a perfect game. Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, [...] "I never could have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Larry Lajoie's and Stovall's fielding and without Birmingham's base running. Walsh was marvelous with his splitter, and we needed two lucky strikes to win." ...|$|E

We had <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> him weeping several times and then we had one last try. I said, 'You can do it, I know you can do it and you will be wonderful...'

But since then, razz has pretty much permeated the culture. We couldn't have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Hollywood's help." [...] Wilson {{is referred to as}} [...] "Ye Olde Head Razzberry".

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the trial on 27 March 2008, Brendan Harris was found guilty of murder, and the judge allowed the names of both Harris and Herbert, which had been concealed during the trial, to be made public. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Police said {{it was one of the}} most violent murders he had come across in his career: [...] "I do not think Herbert and Harris have recognised how violent the attack was. They have just <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> thinking, but they seemed to have enjoyed it, and carried on remorselessly kicking at two very defenceless people who were unable to protect themselves because of the level of violence inflicted upon them... I am very critical of some of the parents involved. I really don't think they have taken completely seriously how repulsive this incident was...". He said that when Harris was initially interviewed about the assaults he was [...] "laughing and joking" [...] with his mother.|$|E

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir blamed Syria for the attack, saying [...] "It is clear that they could not have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the patronage and the help of the Syrians", and stated that Israel held Syria responsible. Deputy Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) Ehud Barak vowed that the PFLP-GC [...] "will in due time pay the price". Speaking before the Knesset on 30 November, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin sent his condolences {{to the families of the}} casualties. He assured the residents of the Galilee that the IDF will do the best they can to prevent similar raids. However, he admitted that [...] "all the steps required by orders and procedures were not taken in this camp, which led to the grave consequences." ...|$|E
