This article examines a critical case – Greece – and a problematic sector – reform of the central state administration – to assess the applicability of three hypotheses advanced by Schimmelfennig and Sedelmeier. New data on the trends in reform activity before and during Greece's debt crisis are assessed, as well as their content and paradigmatic frames, to assess the extent of a break with the inherited domestic model. They highlight the contrast between aggregate activity and the substance of reform in sensitive areas. They attribute reform failures to the crafting of the conditionality strategy and to conflicting interests, administrative traditions and cultural norms.

40|$|Following the {{successful}} membership to NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007, Romania witnessed a serious democratic setback. As {{in other countries}} in the region, the backsliding is due to the lifting of the <b>external</b> <b>conditionality</b> and monitoring. This is the moment when political elites in power got rid of previous constraints and refused to respect the minimum consensus set up previously in order to reach the external membership targets, namely to obey to the rule of law, respect the constitutional stability and work for the good governance. The new context, labeled by some scholars as post-accession hooliganism, is thus marked by the extended use of the executive power, the revival of political arbitrary, partisanship, pervasive corruption and abuse. In Romania, post-accession hooliganism developed under the populist banner of state reinvigoration, modernization and constitutional reform, with brutal attacks against politically neutral institutions and all intermediate liberal democratic institutions that mediate representation, and more specially against parliament. This is a recent feature in Romanian politics that raises much concern about the full consolidation of democracy in the context of persistent economic crisis. With the democratic institutions severely weakened, the ground might be prepared for much more radical political action, which {{can be seen as a}} serious threat for an unconsolidated democracy...|$|E
40|$|In the {{continuing}} {{search for answers}} to the elusive African development this paper stakes out the increasingly important territory of enquiry exploring the linkages between aid, macroeconomic policy, politics, and the micro concerns of governance and project design in the African context [...] emphasizing the {{need to understand the}} behavior of governments as aid intermediaries. One of the main reasons for elusive growth and development in Africa is the absence or weakness of "citizen voice" to engender restraint against predatory behavior and for incentivising accountability. While markets create managerial discipline and induce efficacy through the exercise of private "choice", governments, are principally disciplined through the exercise of "voice" to enforce representative public choice. In the absence of effective domestic mechanisms for restraint, weak autocratic regimes in Africa, sacrifice overall growth for the sake of transfers to itself and the narrow elite it serves. When unconditional aid is given in this context, it tends to increase transfers where they are already active and policy distortions will appear, ex post, to be robust to inflows. <b>External</b> <b>conditionality</b> has not succeeded to enforce restraint against predatory behavior. More worrisome {{is the fact that it}} also tends to crowd out domestic institutional and political development that is ultimately nee ded to discipline policy choices in the recipient countries in a sustained way.

40|$|Analysis of {{the design}} of {{institutions}} to counteract failures of monetary commitment has largely proceeded in a vacuum. It has ignored similar commitment problems in fiscal policy and in structural adjustment; and it has ignored coordination problems between monetary and fiscal policy. Optimal second-best monetary design will of course depend {{on the extent to}} which these other failures can also be solved. The Paper develops a model in which the extent of structural adjustment thus far accomplished influences the ability to raise non-distortionary tax revenue. A poor structural inheritance implies both a low current output, reduced by severe tax distortions, and the need to resort to high levels of the inflation tax. Low output and high inflation both reflect a poor structural inheritance, which can be improved by investing scarce current resources in structural improvements for the future. The chosen rate of adjustment is derived in various regimes. This framework leads naturally to a discussion of the appropriate form of delegated monetary independence, its relation to the ability to make fiscal and adjustment commitments, and the possible role that EMU may play. Clearly, monetary commitment alone cannot accomplish the first best, and might actually make things worse. The analysis offers insights about other forms of <b>external</b> <b>conditionality</b> that might be welfare-improving for transition economies hoping to accede to EMU. The analysis also highlights the danger of believing that a slimline IMF could confine itself to monetary and fiscal policy without worrying about structural adjustment.

40|$|Europeanisation from a Neo-Institutionalist Perspective: Experiencing Territorial Politics in Spain and Romania The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{study is}} to investigate and explain {{the emergence of the}} phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation in two different national and historical contexts, namely Spain and Romania during their respective democratic transitions and EC/EU pre-accession periods. For Spain, we concentrate on the period from 1976 to 1986, which corresponds to end of the Franco regime, the transition to democracy and the EC pre-accession process. For Romania, we analyse the period from 1990 to 2007, which refers the end of the communist regime, the democratic transition and the EU pre-accession process. The key research questions to be investigated are: What factors or variables determine the internal institutional change (or lack of change) towards the institutionalisation of regions during the EU enlargement process? Under which conditions can we expect change towards the regions’ institutionalisation? Is this phenomenon caused either by external EC/EU pressures and requirements for institutional reform, or by domestic institutions and actors’ interests and norms? Or is it generated by the interplay between these external and internal variables for change? In order to answer these questions, we have constructed a theoretical and methodological framework that would be useful for the empirical data analysis and which is based on the combination between different strands of literature, namely Europeanisation, comparative regionalism and new institutionalism (rational-choice, historical, and sociological). The purpose was to identify in this literature a number of hypothesised variables or conditions for domestic change that may explain the regions’ institutionalisation in the two selected EC/EU candidate countries. In the process of identifying these conditions, which cause change or uphold stability in the state institutional and territorial structure during the EU enlargement process, we focussed on the EC/EU <b>external</b> <b>conditionality</b> in the regional and territorial policy field and on domestic national and subnational elements of explanation. First, we hypothesised that domestic institutional change is supposed to happen either in response to the EU pressures, be it material or normative pressures, or as a usage of the EU, without necessarily the presence of an important frame of <b>external</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Secondly, from a rational-choice new institutionalist perspective, it was hypothesised that institutional change depends on the presence of “formal institutions” and of “veto players” opposed to territorial reforms. Thirdly, from a sociological new institutionalist perspective, it was expected that the regions’ institutionalisation is likely to take place in the presence of “norm agents”, a “cooperative-type of political culture” and/or a “legitimating discourse” in favour of regionalisation. Fourthly, from a historical new institutionalist perspective, it was hypothesised that the phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation is likely to occur {{in the presence of the}} “historical regionalism state tradition” and of a “path-setting sequence” favourable to territorial and regional reforms. In methodological terms, this doctoral study subscribes to a case-oriented methodology, also known as the comparative method. It follows the method of “comparing few countries”, focussing therefore on a small number of cases chosen “purposefully rather than at random” and which generally supposes the use of qualitative analysis. In operationalising the qualitative comparative method, we mainly used a number of sources of evidence namely: archival records, documents, interviews and direct observation during our field work. We have constantly cross-checked these different types of data. In terms of results, we have tested, confirmed and disconfirmed the hypothesised explanatory power of the selected new institutionalist variables and we have come to the following conclusions. In Spain, we assert, in light of the test of the work hypotheses against the empirical data, that the phenomenon of regions’ institutionalisation is explained by (1) the ethnic-nationalist state tradition, (2) the initial path-setting sequence towards the institutionalisation of regions (the pre-autonomy and the constitutional autonomy system), (3) the reform supportive internal institutions, (4) the important action capacity and access to decision-making of norm agents, promoters of regionalisation and autonomy, (5) the cooperative, consensus-building political culture between the representatives of Spanish nationalism from the central establishment and the representatives of ethnic-nationalist regionalism, (6) the domestic discourse favouring territorial and regional reforms, associated with democracy and peaceful transition, and (7) the weak action capacity and restrained access to decision-making of veto players. This internal domestic conjuncture favourable to the regions’ institutionalisation was as well externally strengthened by the presence of supportive external EC institutions. The Romanian case of regions’ institutionalisation is explained by a combination of causal variables such as: (1) the material and normative EU conditionality, (2) the blocked access of veto players to the national decision-making system, (3) the emergence of a prevailing consensual type of domestic political culture and relations between the centre and the periphery, (4) the incipient existence of formal institutions providing the basis for regional development and assuring the possibility for cooperation between the different state territorial levels, and (5) the emergence of a dominant legitimating discourse which associated the regions’ institutionalisation to economic development and successful EU accession Accordingly, in light of the comparative analysis approach, we have come to the conclusion that not all the causal variables selected from the literature have an explanatory power in both cases. The comparative analysis confirms and thus allows us to make modest theoretical generalisations about the causal links between the dependent variable under investigation and the following explanatory variables. First is the presence of a consensual political culture between centre and periphery. Second is the existence of formal institutions which can provide interested actors with the necessary means for regional and territorial reforms and for regional development. Third is the prevailing presence of a discourse favouring the regions’ institutionalisation and legitimising the minorities’ autonomy claims. Fourth is the existence of a feeble or blocked access to decision-making of veto players. Both cases agree on these four variables, by which we understand that these variables are the causes of the phenomenon under investigation. From the angle of this generalisation, we can assume that whenever these causes or conditions occur, then, their combined effects produce change towards the regions’ institutionalisation. Finally, this doctoral research has thus contributed to both the refinement and development of theoretical propositions derived from new institutionalism, but also to the refinement of the literature on Europeanisation and comparative regionalism. It has also contributed to empirical knowledge related to the comparative analysis of domestic territorial and regional reforms in two candidate countries, Spain and Romania in the double context of democratisation and adaptation for EC/EU membership.

40|$|With its new European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the European Union {{has begun}} to develop a further ring in a {{widening}} set of economic policy regimes that gravitate around it. There are now no less than six rings to this system. We observe that the EU economic regime has extended its outreach to all categories of countries but the degree of acceptance of EU economic norms and the speed of adoption of EU economic rules is diminishing in the areas further away from the EU core. In the immediate vicinity, the EFTA ring, {{a high level of}} economic standards existed prior to the countries’ full inclusion in the single market and the mechanisms of acquis enforcement have been modelled on the EU’s internal rules and procedures. In the outer rings of lower economic standards, the EU has been more successful in encouraging convergence on its economic norms in countries to which it has extended the membership perspective. The promise of full integration in the EU has legitimised the EU’s <b>external</b> governance through <b>conditionality</b> to steer the course of economic transition in the candidates and potential candidates. In the ENP ring, the EU has excluded the mega-incentive of accession as member state and this has decreased the possibilities for exerting strong leverage over the ENP partners. The evolving EU economic relationship with the Southern and Eastern neighbours is less hierarchical in nature and more based on mutual agreement and cooperation. In the outmost ring occupied by Russia, we see the EU reaching the geographical limits of its economic influence. Generally, the EU gravitational pull is getting weaker in the more distant periphery and the EU instruments are shifting from more traditional methods of hierarchical governance to softer modes of horizontal cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Madagascar showed {{satisfactory}} performance {{under the}} Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program. Executive Directors {{agreed that the}} crisis has undermined the timely achievement of the program, requiring the government to redouble its efforts. They welcomed the 2003 budget and {{stressed the need for}} strengthening fiscal and monetary policies and accelerating structural reforms. They urged the need to address the problems of inefficiency and corruption in the public administration. They emphasized the need to decisively implement the strategy, and successfully complete the third review under the PRGF arrangement.
