Some tropical or subtropical regions such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough. In the mid-latitude westerlies, troughs and ridges often alternate, especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern. For a trough in the westerlies, the region just west <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> axis is an area of fast, divergent winds and low pressure.

40|$|Objective. To {{undertake}} population pharmacokinetic {{modeling and}} to determine the safety and efficacy of once daily (OD) gentamicin dosing in children with severe urinary tract infections (UTI). Methods. An open, randomized, controlled trial comparing OD with three times daily (TD) gentamicin dosing in hospitalized children ages 1 month to 12 years with UTI. Daily doses (milligrams per kg per day) of gentamicin in both groups were 7. 5 ( 10 years old). Results. There were 179 children enrolled (90 OD, 89 TD). Baseline clinical characteristics and pathogens were similar, except that circulatory compromise and renal cortical scintigraphic defects were {{more common in the}} OD group. Median gentamicin treatment durations were 3. 0 (OD) and 2. 7 (TD) days. Mean peak gentamicin concentrations were 17. 3 (OD) vs. 6. 4 (TD) mg/l; 99 % of peak concentrations were > 7 mg/l in the OD group whereas 16 % of peak concentrations were < 5 mg/l in the TD group. Mean trough concentrations were 0. 35 (OD) vs. 0. 55 (TD) mg/l. In the OD <b>group</b> 4 % <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations were ≥ 2 mg/l, whereas in the TD group only 0. 7 % were ≥ 2 mg/l. Age or prior elevated peak concentrations did not predict high trough concentrations. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of the data fitted a one-compartment model with first order elimination. There were no clinical or bacteriologic failures. The two disease-related complications were confined to the OD group. No nephro- or ototoxicity was identified. Conclusions. With age-appropriate dosing and measurement <b>of</b> serum <b>trough</b> concentrations before the second dose, OD gentamicin is safe and effective for the treatment of UTI requiring parenteral treatment in children aged 1 month to 12 years...|$|R

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of ofloxacin in 48 healthy male volunteers were studied in a two-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Ofloxacin (200 or 400 mg) or placebo was administered as 1 -h infusions every 12 h for 7 days. Plasma ofloxacin concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Mean harmonic half-lives ranged from 4. 28 to 4. 98 h in the 200 -mg dosing group and from 5. 06 to 6. 67 h in the 400 -mg dosing <b>group.</b> Intragroup comparisons <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> plasma concentration-versus-time data from study days 2 through 7 revealed that steady state {{was achieved by}} day 2 of both multiple-dose regimens. Intergroup comparisons of mean harmonic half-lives, the areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 and 0 to 60 h, clearance, and apparent volume of distribution (area method) revealed that the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin are dose independent. Both ofloxacin dosage regimens appeared to be reasonably well tolerated. The two dosage regimens of ofloxacin, 200 or 400 mg every 12 h, appear {{to be safe and}} provide serum drug concentrations in excess of the MICs for most susceptible pathogens over the entire dosing interval. Ofloxacin is a synthetic carboxyquinolone antimicrobial agent which exhibits broad-spectrum in vitro bactericidal activities against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes (5).

40|$|We present {{here the}} results of a {{statistical}} study <b>of</b> the ionospheric <b>trough</b> observed in 2003 by means of satellite tomography. We focus on the seasonal morphology <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> occurrence and investigate the trough latitude, width and the horizontal gradients at the edges, at different magnetic local times, as well as their relations to geomagnetic activity and the interplanetary magnetic field. A seasonal effect is noticed in the diurnal variation <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> latitude, indicating that summer clearly differs from the other seasons. In winter the troughs seem to follow the solar terminator. The width <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> has a diurnal variation and it depends on the season, as well. The broadest troughs are observed in winter and the narrowest ones in summer. A discontinuity in the diurnal variation <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> latitude is observed before noon. It is suggested that this is an indication of a difference between the generation mechanisms of morningside and eveningside troughs. The density gradients at the edges have a complex dependence on the latitude <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> and on geomagnetic activity. The photoionization and the auroral precipitation are competing in the formation <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> walls at different magnetic local times. An important finding is that the interplanetary magnetic field plays a role in the occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>trough</b> at different levels of geomagnetic activity.

40|$|An {{assemblage}} <b>of</b> huge parallel <b>troughs,</b> individually up to 200 km {{wide and}} hundreds of kilometers long, forms a belt 500 km wide extending for 2700 km E 15 °S through the Tithonius Lacus-Coprates region of equatorial Mars. Some troughs are closed depressions more than 3 km deep, and the maximum trough depth may approach 6 km. These troughs, heading just southeast of the huge Tharsis volcanic ridge, are transitional westward into a festoon of U-shaped hollows and eastward into chaotic and fretted terrain. Parallel linear chains of rimless pits and shallow graben on the adjacent cratered upland suggest structural control <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> development by fractures in the Martian crust. Trough walls show scarring by slides, slumps, and U-shaped avalanche chutes. Some are dissected into narrow sharp anastomosing ridges reminiscent of badland topography. Dendritic tributaries extend 150 km into the bordering upland. These tributaries and the mass movements causing recession <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> walls are attributed to a sapping process possibly involving the evaporation or melting of exposed ground ice. Trough floors range from chaotically rough to rolling and subdued. They are not smoothly graded. In one instance layered materials, possibly 2 km thick, compose a dissected trough floor tableland. Most troughs may be partly filled by such deposits. The major problem <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> genesis involves disposal of about 2 × 10 ^ 6 km^ 3 of material. Running water, solution, deflation, and ground ice deterioration all appear to have significant limitations as the sole or principal agent <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> formation. Subsidence caused by magma withdrawal to supply the extensive nearby volcanic fields or the spreading of crustal plates are both quantitatively adequate. Crustal spreading would have significant implications concerning the conditions and {{the behavior of the}} Martian interior, and the lack of any obvious subduction zones would imply planetary expansion. In our ignorance concerning Mars both magma withdrawal and crustal spreading merit continued consideration in respect to trough formation, with some favor to the former because of the obvious large-scale Martian volcanism. Ground ice may have played a significant subsidiary role through sapping to produce extensive recession <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> walls...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several nomograms include {{recommendations}} to give intravenous (IV) vancomycin at 8 -hour dosing intervals (Q 8 H). However, {{there is a}} lack of detailed data regarding this dosing recommendation. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 100 patients who received 107 treatment courses of vancomycin Q 8 H for at least 5 days was performed. Distribution <b>of</b> vancomycin <b>trough</b> levels and rate of nephrotoxicity were evaluated. Results:Median patient age was 38 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27 - 50 years), median weight was 67 kg (IQR 55 - 79 kg), and median creatinine clearance was 124 mL/min (IQR 101 - 147 mL/min). Median duration of Q 8 H dosing was 9 days (IQR 7 - 12 days). Within the initial 96 hours, only 7 % (7 of 104) <b>of</b> maximum <b>trough</b> concen-trations were> 20 mg/L (median dose 15 mg/kg [IQR 15 - 18 mg/kg]).

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate seasonal and interannual statistics <b>of</b> <b>troughs</b> associated with the Pacific storm track and quantify the influence <b>of</b> deformation on <b>trough</b> development upstream <b>of</b> the western Pacific. The goal is to provide at least a partial explanation of midwinter suppression of the Pacific storm track. From 19 years of analysis, a strong stretching deformation zone (DZ) is defined over East Asia. We examine the number, average intensity and intensity change <b>of</b> upper-level mobile <b>troughs</b> as they enter and exit the DZ as well as over the western Pacific, using Lefevre and Nielsen-Gammon's trough tracking data (1995). The relationship between deformation and <b>trough</b> intensification upstream <b>of</b> the Pacific storm track is discussed on a seasonal and interannual basis. Midwinter reduction of the Pacific storm track is accompanied by midwinter reduction <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> intensity. Intensification <b>of</b> winter and spring troughs is suppressed compared to fall troughs in DZ. Over the first domain of the Pacific, all troughs continue developing and fall and winter troughs tend to decay in the second domain. However, spring troughs continue intensifying over the second domain. Enhanced development <b>of</b> <b>troughs</b> seems to contribute to the double peak over DZ in fall and over the Pacific in spring, respectively. Although winter troughs intensify over the Pacific despite short residence time and strong shearing deformation, they do not become as intense as fall and spring troughs due to the suppression <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> intensification over DZ. Midwinter suppression of the Pacific storm track is found to be reproduced by seasonal variation <b>of</b> <b>trough</b> intensification in this study. Seasonal analysis shows a strong correlation between deformation extending from Kazakhstan to DZ and weaker mobile trough development over DZ, suggesting that excessive stretching deformation upstream of the Pacific storm track might be responsible for midwinter suppression of the Pacific storm track. Confirming the result of seasonal analysis, an interannual comparison shows that enhanced stretching deformation is present over the Kazakhstan region in weak trough intensification years compared to strong trough intensification years...|$|R
