5|$|Although more {{abundant}} in montane and northern coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe,</b> less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fungus}} {{is one of}} the most common <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Europe,</b> the species was not validly {{described}} until 1968 by German mycologist Frieder Gröger. Before this, L.deterrimus was regarded as a variety of L.deliciosus (L.deliciosus var. piceus, described by Miroslav Smotlacha in 1946). After Roger Heim and A.Leclair described L.semisanguifluus in 1950, this fungus was referred to as the latter. L.fennoscandicus was separated from L.deterrimus in 1998 by Annemieke T. Verbeken and Jan Vesterholt and was classified as a separate species.|$|E

Research questions touch upon that what kind of spatial dimensions differentiate territorial aspects of social exclusion <b>in</b> East <b>Central</b> <b>Europe,</b> and what relationships can be discovered between them and other social characteristics. Furthermore, the paper summarize the changes in territorial patterns of social exclusion {{took place during the}} 2000 s <b>in</b> East <b>Central</b> <b>Europe...</b>|$|R

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>central</b> <b>Europe,</b> it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E

5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. <b>In</b> <b>central</b> <b>Europe,</b> its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
