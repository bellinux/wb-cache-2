5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the setting sun and the {{crescent}} moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|In Facundo, Sarmiento is {{both the}} narrator and a main character. The book {{contains}} autobiographical elements from Sarmiento’s life, and he comments on the entire Argentine circumstance. He also expresses and analyzes his own opinion and chronicles some historic events. Within the book's <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> civilization and barbarism, Sarmiento's character represents civilization, steeped as he is in European and North American ideas; he stands for education and development, as opposed to Rosas and Facundo, who symbolize barbarism.|$|E
50|$|The novel has {{confused}} {{some readers}} and critics because it straddles the <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> serious fiction and comic fiction, and between popular genre storytelling and metaphysical philosophy.|$|R
5000|$|According to Linda Zerilli and Donna Haraway, [...] "'taxonomies' of {{feminism}} ... can create artificial <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> feminist discourses that seriously impede constructive political debates about subjectivity for women." ...|$|R
50|$|Seseman {{liked to}} call his {{philosophy}} “gnoseological idealism”, trying to revive metaphysics through a re-evaluation of the metaphysical tradition of ontology. His other philosophical aim was to overcome the <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> the subjective-psychological and the objective-realistic {{in the theory of}} knowledge and metaphysics in general.|$|R
5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up. Many Chinese Malayan youths {{drafted into the}} army to stave off communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu, heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.|$|E
5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
30|$|The <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> {{information}} and entertainment, between motives and emotions and between criticism and critical attitude are not presented {{for the defense}} of one option against the other, but to emphasize the need for the integration of complementary poles and, therefore, {{to draw attention to the}} need to cover the gaps to optimize the teaching-learning processes.|$|R
40|$|In {{this segment}} of the Notes on Moral Theology, the author argues that {{overcoming}} one’s suspicion of eros in Christian ethics {{would lead to a}} more integrated vision of the human person, moving beyond the <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> rational knowledge and emotional cognition, spirituality and sexuality, agape and self-love. At the same time, positive recognition of eros would help oust the eroticization of power...|$|R
40|$|Clothing is {{our second}} skin and {{suggests}} both intimacy and protection simultaneously. As our second skin, clothing {{is often seen}} as a projection {{of who we are}} or want to be. Within my creative research I am interested in the relationships between two larger ideas such as these <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> clothing and identity. An additional connection that is examined in this piece is the desire to share, confess or expose oneself, yet anonymously...|$|R
25|$|The {{libretto}} of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde contains strong {{allusions to}} Novalis' symbolic language, especially the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the Night and the Day that animates his Hymns to the Night.|$|E
25|$|Adherence {{to strict}} <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> men and women: Some eco-feminist critiques {{are that the}} <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> women and men and nature and culture creates a dualism that is too {{stringent}} and focused in the difference of women and men. That eco-feminism too strongly correlates the social status of women with the social status of nature, rather than the non-essentialist view that women along with nature both have masculine and feminine qualities, and that just like feminine qualities have often been seen as less worthy, nature is also seen as having lesser value than culture, or the qualities involved in these concepts.|$|E
25|$|The Baroque Austrian Monarchy was established. Despite the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> outward {{reality and}} inner conviction, {{the rest of}} the world saw Austria as the epitome of forcible conformity, and {{conflation}} of church and state.|$|E
40|$|Intraspeciation Within the Ontological Biosphere {{investigates the}} {{intuitive}} connection between human and animal. Ideas of human animality are explored through biophilia, the innate affinity between living organisms. By examining {{the relationships between}} human and nonhuman animals and vegetal/botanical life, this thesis argues for a removal of barriers from <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> species to enable species interconnectivity. This artistic exploration aims to establish intimacy and animalism between the human, animal and surrounding biosphere {{by the use of}} organic and synthetic material in sculpture and drawing...|$|R
40|$|This paper links Hofstede’s {{work with}} more recent {{research}} comparing the Australian business culture {{with that of}} the United States to see if Australia is another Anglo-American culture or does it have its own unique cultural stereotype. Findings include support for Hofstede’s dimensions, except Power Distance and Individualism. There are also some <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> Hofstede’s dimension connotations for the Australian business culture too. There is a need to scientifically measure the Australian Business Culture against other cultures to develop a more complete Australian stereotype...|$|R
40|$|In {{this essay}} I {{will look at}} Peter Kubelka’s classic film Arnulf Rainer (6 1 / 2 minutes, black and white, optical sound, 35 mm, 1960) {{in terms of the}} way it can be seen to operate around a number of <b>dichotomies,</b> <b>between</b> dark and light and black and white, sound and image, balance and asymmetry, {{film-strip}} and projection, onscreen and in-brain, work and context. I will also consider some of the wider issues that arise about lightness and darkness generally, and about the scope and purpose of formal analysis...|$|R
25|$|The Theosophical Society {{held that}} the Aryans were {{indigenous}} to India, but that they were also the progenitors of the European civilisation. The Society saw a <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the spiritualism of India and the materialism of Europe.|$|E
25|$|In the Platform Sutra, the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> {{sudden and}} gradual is reconciled. Guifeng Zongmi, {{fifth-generation}} successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but {{is to be}} followed by a gradual cultivation to attain Buddhahood.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Mahāyāna texts {{often use}} the term Mahāyāna as a synonym for Bodhisattvayāna, but the term Hīnayāna is comparatively rare in the earliest sources. The presumed <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna can be deceptive, as the two terms were not actually formed in relation {{to one another in}} the same era.|$|E
40|$|Privacy {{decision}} making can be surprising or even appear contradictory: we feel entitled to protection {{of information about}} ourselves {{that we do not}} control, yet willingly trade away the same information for small rewards; we worry about privacy invasions of little significance, yet overlook those that may cause significant damages. <b>Dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> attitudes and behaviors, inconsistencies in discounting future costs or rewards, and other systematic behavioral biases have long been studied in the psychology and behavioral economics literatures. In this paper we draw from those literatures to discuss the role of uncertainty, ambiguity, and behavioral biases in privacy {{decision making}}...|$|R
40|$|After {{submitting}} {{that most}} scholarly and practical {{debates about the}} law of international organizations can be construed as a battle between arguments {{based on the idea}} of a contract and those based on the idea of a constitution, this article discusses international legal scholars' ability to turn the foundational <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> contractualism and constitutionalism into a dynamic and dialectic framework. It makes the argument that international legal scholars, and especially legal academics, while unanimously acknowledging the existence of such paradigmatic tensions, are regularly tempted to iron them out through the promotion of a series of dialectical concepts or moves...|$|R
40|$|Historically, two paths have {{developed}} {{in an individual}} and communal search for understanding and meaning: The study of science {{and the search for}} a higher spirituality. Although they should not necessarily be mutually exclusive, the history of science is littered with the collision of these two pathways, for rarely have they met without acrimonious debate. Discussion of the <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> intelligent design and natural process evolution is both timely and critical in the light of: 1. Declining student competencies in scientific literacy in the United States, and 2. A burgeoning global population facing environmental, energy and natural resource crises...|$|R
25|$|Critics {{have argued}} that {{evolutionary}} psychologists created a false <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> their own view and the caricature of the SSSM. Other critics regard the SSSM as a rhetorical device or a straw man and suggest that the scientists whom evolutionary psychologists associate with the SSSM {{did not believe that}} the mind was a blank state devoid of any natural predispositions.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{examines the}} reliability of Wikipedia, and the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the contributions of experts and amateur editors. The documentary includes commentary from Wikipedia co-founders Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, The Cult of the Amateur author Andrew Keen, O'Reilly Media chief executive officer Tim O'Reilly, and former editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica Robert McHenry. Keen says that experts should serve as guardians of information during the Web 2.0 phenomenon; {{this point of view}} is supported by analysis from Sanger.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other dialects, Basel German {{features}} a rather strong <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the traditional form - Baseldytsch, used {{especially for the}} Carnival of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) - and normal spoken language. Some speakers prefer to use the more traditional variety in written form. The traditional variety is normally associated with the upper classes and with Fasnacht. Like other Swiss German dialects, Basel German has (at least in Basel) more prestige than Standard German, {{and it is now}} even used in churches.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} the OSU Community at author's request. Body Fires {{is a collection of}} poems that addresses body, faith, empathy, and intimacy in the context of chronic illness. The speaker explores and blurs the <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> know and no, knowledge and uncertainty, life and death, and the personal and universal. She enters the poetic tradition of the lyric, drawing connections between the biblical and the mythic, as she attempts not to find closure in her own illness narrative, but rather to create an opening for her violent body's integration into a history, a present, and a future...|$|R
40|$|Tracing {{flows of}} past food surplus {{challenges}} archaeologists to integrate {{a wide range}} of evidential strands for food acquisition, production and consumption, and to resist false <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> ‘economic’ and ‘political’ accounts. Current approaches to the topic – variously illustrated by the papers brought together in this special issue – not only question traditional approaches to food surplus as a simple causal vector in social change (e. g. towards ‘complexity’); they also make the case that understanding how societies addressed common problems of shortage and abundance, climatic uncertainty and power relations in the past should inform discussion of future food security...|$|R
40|$|Through an {{empirical}} study of supervision on student assignments {{at the university}} across face-to-face and online settings, we show firstly the limiting implications of traditional <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> face-to-face and online supervision. Secondly we show that more attention {{must be given to}} the way different digital tools influence the supervisory dialogue. These findings illustrate a form of ‘torn pedagogy’; that online tools and platforms destabilize and tear traditional understandings of supervision pedagogy apart. Also we forge a new concept of “format supervision” that enables supervisors to understand and reflect their supervision practice as a deliberate choice between face-to-face and online formats...|$|R
25|$|There was resistance, {{much of it}} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. But {{there was}} also a pattern of denial, {{cover-up}} and cozy bureaucratic collusion between industry and government, the last especially notorious in Japan but by no means limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, an illusory distinction made not only in Japan but throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{the public}} service model include BBC in Britain, and the ABC and SBS in Australia. The {{political}} function and effect of modes of public communication has traditionally continued with the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> Hegelian State and civil society. The dominant theory of this mode includes the liberal theory of the free press. However, the public service, state-regulated model, whether publicly or privately funded, has always been seen not as a positive good but as an unfortunate necessity imposed by the technical limitations of frequency scarcity.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{previous}} tragedy Titus Andronicus, the play avoids graphic demonstrations of physical violence; only Richard and Clarence are shown being stabbed on-stage, {{while the rest}} (the two princes, Hastings, Brackenbury, Grey, Vaughan, Rivers, Anne, Buckingham, and King Edward) all meet their ends off-stage. Despite the villainous nature of the title character and the grim storyline, Shakespeare infuses the action with comic material, as he does with most of his tragedies. Much of the humour rises from the <b>dichotomy</b> <b>between</b> how Richard's character is known and how Richard tries to appear.|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between subjective and objective domains {{is central to}} traditional psychology, including {{the various forms of}} mediational stimulus—organism—response neobehaviorism that treat the elements of a subjective domain as hypothetical constructs. Radical behaviorism has its own unique perspective on the subjective—objective distinction. For radical behaviorism, <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> subjective and objective, knower and known, or observer and agent imply at most unique access to a part of the world, rather than dichotomous ontologies. This perspective leads to unique treatments of such important philosophical matters as (a) dispositions and (b) the difference between first- and third-person psychological sentences...|$|R
40|$|Rubem Fonseca is {{considered}} a key author in the introduction of crime fiction in Brazil. This article reviews his contribution to the genre and analyzes the specifics of his narrative {{in the context of}} Brazilian literature, in which Fonseca breaks from and exceeds the traditional <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> high and popular literature. Fonseca becomes part of the distinct tradition of crime fiction, which he reinterprets differently in his short stories by giving voice to the marginalized, and in his novels by incorporating elements of hardboiled, noir fiction, and even whodunit. The character of Mandrake is situated in a context that increasingly includes paraliterary concerns...|$|R
30|$|Whether what we {{are facing}} is complexity, hypercomplexity, or (hyper)complexity – at times drawing a {{distinction}} is an all but impossible feat -- a systemic approach or method requires creating educational processes that aim towards healing the fracture that has fabricated false <b>dichotomies</b> <b>between</b> the human and the technological, towards fostering critical and independent thinking by incorporating doubt and uncertainty into our teachings, towards giving us the tools, from {{the first years of}} school on, for studying interconnections and interactions, which will enable us to perceive objects as systems, towards providing equal starting conditions for genuine knowledge sharing and for an inclusive and participative innovation.|$|R
