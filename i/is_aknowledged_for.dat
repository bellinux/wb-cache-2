The publication of this open letter led to the formulation of the Manifeste des intellectuals (1897) that demands a non-party space for the expression of an ethically guided politics. ‘J’accuse’ has become a generic symbol for the voicing of resistance against governmental forms of oppression. On the basis of a re-reading of Foucault’s understanding of the ‘specific intellectual’ (Foucault, 1977 and 1980), this article suggests that we need a non-party space for the public expression of ethically governed politics.

To get an answer for this study two methods were used. The first method was a survey with questions that were sent out to working high school teachers in the North of Sweden. The second method was a document analysis of articales from three Swedish dailynewspapers. To analyse the results from this study a theory about professions is used troughout the whole paper. This studies resluts shows that profession as an definition is hard to undestand.

Altogether there were 89 articles {{that were used in}} content analysis and nine articles that were used in qualitative analysis. I also analyzed comments about articles I used in qualitative analyzis. Mainly I focused on these questions and tried to find answers through analysis: 1. How are sexual minorities portrayted in Estonian media? 2. Which are main images of sexual minorities? 3. If there are any role expectations then which are they? Are there certain behaviour that are expected of sexual minorities? 4. Is being homo- or bisexualist fashionable? Or does being exponent of sexual minority mean that one is „castaway“? 5. Are there any conflicts in this subject? If there is, then who are in conflict and how many conflicts occur in media? 6. Which sources are most used in articles? What is the purpose of analyzed articles? Hypothesis of this thesis were: there are more intolerance than acceptance in Estonian media about sexual minorities. It occured that my hypothesis is wrong. Yes, there is some intolerance but mainly Estonian media is impartial or compliant in a matter of sexual minorities. In analyzed comments there were some very homofobic opinions but it is not prevalent.

40|$|Galilean {{invariance}} {{is one of}} the {{key requirements}} of many physical models adopted in theoretical and computational mechanics. Spurred by recent research developments in shock hydrodynamics computations [13], a detailed analysis on the principle of Galilean invariance in the context of SUPG operators is presented. It was observed in [13] that lack of Galilean invariance can yield catastrophic instabilities in Lagrangian computations. Here, the analysis develops at a more general level, and an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is used to explain how to consistently derive Galilean invariant SUPG operators. Stabilization operators for Lagrangian and Eulerian mesh computations are obtained as limits of the stabilization operator for the underlying ALE formulation. In the case of Eulerian meshes, it is shown that most of the SUPG operators designed for compressible flow computations to date are not consistent with Galilean invariance. It is stressed that Galilean invariant SUPG formulations can provide consistent advantages in the context of complex engineering applications, due to the simple modifications needed for their implementation. 4 Acknowledgments This research was partially funded by the DOE NNSA Advanced Scientific Computing Program and the Computer Science Research Institute at Sandia National Laboratories.

40|$|We report {{gas phase}} studies on NCO- {{fragment}} formation from the nucleobases thymine and uracil and their N-site methylated derivatives upon dissociative electron attachment (DEA) and through electron transfer in potassium collisions. For comparison, the NCO- production in metastable decay of the nucleobases after deprotonation in matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is also reported. We {{show that the}} delayed fragmentation of the dehydrogenated closed-shell anion into NCO- upon DEA proceeds few microseconds after the electron attachment process, indicating a rather slow unimolecular decomposition. Utilizing partially methylated thymine, we demonstrate that the remarkable site selectivity of the initial hydrogen loss {{as a function of}} the electron energy is preserved in the prompt as well as the metastable NCO- formation in DEA. Site selectivity in the NCO- yield is also pronounced after deprotonation in MALDI, though distinctly different from that observed in DEA. This is discussed in terms of the different electronic states subjected to metastable decay in these experiments. In potassium collisions with 1 - and 3 -methylthymine and 1 - and 3 -methyluracil, the dominant fragment is the NCO- ion and the branching ratios {{as a function of the}} collision energy show evidence of extraordinary site-selectivity in the reactions yielding its formation.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} the Ugandan {{construction}} industry to be, primarily, an informal sector dominated by unskilled labour contracted mainly on minor building works such as alterations and renovations. Within such a context, the industry has also received negative publicity due to increasing quality failures on sites – {{commonly referred to as}} shoddy work. Some reasons cited for these failures include; use of substandard building materials and ineffective supervision by design consultants. This, inspite of the existing national regulatory and institutional framework regarding the built environment. The omnipresent quality failure attribute, however, is rework. This is because contractual obligations between a client and a contractor may necessitate rework where quality failures are noted, regardless of the causes. Notably,absolute compliance to established client quality requirements is one such contractual obligation, {{but it is difficult to}} attain, particularly, in public building construction due to varying socio-economic, cultural and political factors. It still remains, nevertheless, that where ways of mitigating against the impacts of non-compliance to client quality requirements are not established, there could be adverse impacts to national development plans for example, in Uganda’s case. The research aim, therefore, was to study the causality and magnitude of rework and to recommend ways of mitigating against non-compliance to client quality requirements. Rework and client quality requirements were considered as the units of analysis. With insufficient information available on the subject in the Ugandan context, the research was designed to, therefore, begin with an exploratory study into rework causality and subsequently into explanatory research that studied the magnitude of rework-related impacts on budgets and schedules, non-compliance to client quality requirements and ways of mitigating against non-compliance to client quality requirements. The mixed research methodological approach that used case studies and a questionnaire survey was found useful in aiding the triangulation of data and enhancing the generalisability of inferences from the findings. The identified rework causality factors were; ineffective client-consultant communication, inadequate design information, end-user based causality, inefficient supply chain management, use of non-compliant building materials and inefficient works supervision. Operationrelated rework was found to occur at an average of 0. 25 % of construction contract sums. With regards to the magnitude of rework-related impacts on project budgets and schedules, it was deduced that the average percentage range of rework-related impacts on the project budgets was within 10 - 13 %, while the percentage range contribution of rework to the project schedule overrun was 6 - 11 %. The recommended ways of mitigating against non-compliance to client quality requirements were; stringent action on public sector graft, increased quality testing of materials, increased end-user participation and routine supervisor participation, increased use of vocationally skilled personnel and improved procurement practices that cater for efficient supply chain management and focus more on value-for-money rather than selection of contractors on the basis of “the best bid is the lowest evaluated bid”. The research emphasises viewing rework as a phenomenon that occurs over the life of public buildings and additionally proposes the adoption of a whole-life value philosophy as an intervention in the mitigation of rework-related impacts. Relatedly, public sector client entities in Uganda are encouraged to document quality requirements over the life of buildings and this begins with developing protocols for collecting quality-specific project data from the design through to the operation and maintenance stages of building facilities. It <b>is</b> <b>aknowledged</b> that much more research into rework in Uganda is necessary, with a particular emphasis on rework in the operation and maintenance stages of building facilities...|$|R
40|$|First General Meeting in Prague, May 25 - 29, 2015; [URL] plasmas of {{molecular}} precursors produced in low pressure glow discharges involve intricate mechanisms {{of great interest}} in many scientific and technological fields, such as thin film growth, surface conditioning and so on. In particular, hydrogen containing cold plasmas are currently used in microelectronic devices production, can simulate the border conditions of plasmas generated in fusion reactors, and are efficient sources of very reactive radicals and ions, whose study contributes to clarify the appearance of complex compounds in different regions of interstellar molecular clouds or in Jovian planet ionospheres. In this work, low pressure glow discharges of mixtures of hydrogen with simple molecules and atoms and different isotopic compositions are experimentally diagnosed, and the main mechanisms controlling their behavior are elucidated by kinetic modeling. According to theoretical predictions supported by experimental data, the formation of new molecular species takes place mainly at the reactor surfaces and competes with the fast wall recycling of the precursors, which are previously dissociated by electron impact. On the other hand, the ion distributions result mainly from the balance between electron impact ionizations, which depend markedly on electron energies, and ion-molecule reactions in gas phase, for which the proton affinity of the different neutral species plays a key role. The first detection of the deuterated ammonium ion (NH 3 D+) in the interstellar medium [1, 2], and the refined infrared spectroscopic characterization of the isotopomers 36 ArH+ and 36 ArH+ [3], the first noble gas molecules found in space [4, 5], exemplify the successful interaction between plasma spectroscopy and astronomical observations.

40|$|Traditionally, noise {{abatement}} {{is focused on}} the annoying or harmful effects of sounds, and on minimizing these effects by reducing noise levels. However, it <b>is</b> increasingly <b>aknowledged</b> that, in order to achieve a good environmental quality, the positive as well as the negative aspects of sound have to be considered. The rather new, interdisciplinary field of soundscape research tries to bend this trend. An important feature of the soundscape is its temporal structure. Time patterns in the fluctuations of sound level or frequency are known {{to play an important role}} in the perception of sound. It is a key idea in this work that a good temporal structure contributes to a positive sound environment, and that the temporal aspect is indispensable in soundscape design. However, studies on its influence and efforts to integrate the temporal aspect into soundscape research have been rare. In this work, the emphasis is put on the most important source of noise in urban and rural environment: traffic. To introduce the temporal aspect into the study of soundscapes, one faces two challenges. Firstly, current noise prediction models were developed mainly for the prediction of time-averaged noise levels, and can not estimate the temporal structure easily. Therefore, a time-dependent noise prediction model is developed in this work. Secondly, it is not clear which indicators to use to describe the time variations, and what their relation is to human perception. Various indicators associated with fluctuating noise, each with its own positive aspects as well as shortcomings, have been proposed in the past. In this work, a novel indicator is proposed, based on the spectral density of fluctuations in loudness, which may be able to grasp the time structure of environmental sound in a more covering way. Finally, two fields of application of these concepts are studied in detail: the quality assessment of quiet areas, and the emergence of traffic noise annoyance in an at-home context...|$|R
40|$|National audienceIt {{is a big}} {{challenge}} in the information technology field to develop techniques to help users in their tasks. Forthat purpose, {{we need to develop}} assistants able to help people without disturbing them in their main task. This paperdiscusses building an assistant based on traces and making use of a trace-based system. Traces can <b>be</b> used as <b>aknowledge</b> source to discover other useful knowledge but also to reuse experience. The main idea of the approach is tofind useful episodes (previous experiences) in interaction traces and to reuse them to provide users with contextualizedhelp. The assistant can then adapt the retrieved episodes to provide assistance to the user by reusing previousexperiences. This work has been done in partnership with SAP-BO. We have implemented our proposal in the SAPexplorer project which aims to ensure that all business users have easy access to all the information they need to makeconfident decisions based on up-to-date, reliable information, so they need to help business users while doing theirtasks. The main contribution described in this paper is the algorithm enabling us to retrieve past episodes correspondingto a “task signature” (a description of the main characteristics of the episode).

40|$|Background and Aim: Grasses {{and olive}} {{are the most}} {{relevant}} allergenic species in the Alentejo region. However, aggravation of allergic symptoms {{has been reported in}} the early spring, before grass and olive pollen seasons. Quercus pollen is the most abundant pollen type in the early spring in Alentejo, nonetheless its allergen profile has not yet been evaluated. The aim of this work was to characterize the allergen profile of pollen from Quercus rotundifolia among the most representative species showing pollination in April, prior to the main pollen season in Alentejo. Methods: Pollen from Quercus rotundifolia, Olea europaea and Dactylis glomerata was extracted with ammonium bicarbonate buffer, lyophilized and stored at - 80 ºC until analysis. Extract from Quercus ilex pollen was kindly offered by Bial. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method. SDS-PAGE followed by western blot, using allergic patient sera (obtained from the Hospital do Espírito Santo de Évora – HESE), were performed to evaluate the allergen profile of the pollen. Sensitization and cross-reactivity was assessed by solid phase immunoblot. Results: Most of the patient evidenced sensitization to pollen extracts of Q. rotundifolia. Protein profile of Q. rotundifolia has shown several bands in the Mr 10 - 90 kDa, mostly overlapping with Q. ilex. Western blot have shown several immunoreactive bands. Immunoreactive bands were also observed in the protein profile according to the pI in the range 4. 0 - 6. 1. Cross-reactivity between Q. rotundifolia with O. europaea and D. glomerata was found. Conclusion: These results evidenced allergens found in Q. rotundifolia pollen. It also shows that protein profile of Q. rotundifolia and Q. ilex are mostly alike suggesting that similarities in allergen profile are expected. Moreover, cross–reactivity between Q. rotundifolia and highly allergenic species such as O. europaea and D. glomerata was found which probably contributes to the aggravation of pollinosis in the early spring.
