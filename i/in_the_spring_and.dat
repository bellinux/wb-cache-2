50|$|The {{most common}} example is in a vehicle's suspension, {{where it is}} used to {{describe}} the displacement <b>and</b> forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> shock absorbers. <b>The</b> force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> is (roughly) <b>the</b> vertical force at the contact patch divided by the motion ratio, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> rate is <b>the</b> wheel rate multiplied by the motion ratio squared and angle correction factor.|$|R
50|$|Danger can {{be reduced}} by burying the {{trampoline}} so the bed {{is closer to the}} surrounding surface to lessen falling distance, and padding that surrounding area.

Calves are typically born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.|$|E

5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring.
