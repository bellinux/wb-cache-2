40|$|Although the “virtual heritage” {{has become}} an {{important}} topic in scientific and political discussions, the possibility of writing history out of born <b>digital</b> <b>sources</b> has been neglected in historical research for many years. This {{is supported by the}} fact that there doesn’t exist any systematic source theory for born <b>digital</b> <b>sources.</b> This paper wants to initiate a discussion on the theory and methodology of genuine <b>digital</b> <b>sources</b> by discussing the potentials and problems of <b>digital</b> <b>source</b> analyses. The paper furthermore reflects on the question, whether born <b>digital</b> <b>sources</b> need to be handled as a separate source category, or whether – so the hypothesis of the correalist source theo- ry - they don’t differ from other sources in their material and documentary characteristics, but only in the visibility of their multidimensional, processual and multimodal elements which are inherent in every material source as well...|$|R
