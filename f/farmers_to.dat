5|$|The uses of coal were varied. Coal {{was used}} in limekilns to produce lime for mortar used in {{building}} and by <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> improve the soil. From 1820 coal was used to produce gas for lighting and to power steam driven woollen mills in the area. Coke was used to dry malt for the brewing industry.|$|E

5|$|A central Food Production Committee, set up {{in early}} 1942, {{organised}} the conscripted labourers and attempted to help the white <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> grow all the crops they could. Maize production grew by 40% between 1942 and 1944, the potato harvest doubled and the onion crop grew sixfold {{by the end of}} the war. Production of the colony's most important cash crop, tobacco, was high throughout the war, averaging about 40million pounds (18million kg) annually.|$|E
5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E

A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|For {{the past}} ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has been {{assisting}} Zimbabwe's <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields.

5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, West Wales was {{identified}} as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys. The gross value added economic indicator showed a figure of £14,763 per head in these regions, as compared with a GVA of £22,986 for Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Assembly Government is aware of this, and helped by government initiatives and local actions, opportunities for <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> diversify have emerged. These include farm tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants play an {{important}} role in both the environment and for humans. A single nest is capable of dispersing over 300,000 plant seeds; moreover, meat ants have formed symbiotic relationships with many insects. This ant may be used as a form of pest control to kill the cane toad, an invasive species. They can also help <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> remove animal carcases by consuming and reducing them to bones in a matter of weeks. Despite this, meat ants are sometimes pests around urban areas and eradicating them is difficult.|$|E
50|$|Formation {{and growth}} of cities meant an {{increased}} demand for food stuffs by non-farmers, and their willingness to pay for it. This, in turn, led the <b>farmer</b> <b>to</b> (further) innovation, more intensive farming, the demand/creation of new and/or improved farming implements, and a quest for improved seed which improved crop yield. Thus allowing the <b>farmer</b> <b>to</b> raise his income by bringing more food to non-farming (city) markets.|$|R

5|$|The Japanese {{government}} encouraged <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> raise sheep {{throughout the}} 19th-century. Sheep-rearing programs began to import Yorkshire, Berkshire, Spanish merino, and numerous Chinese and Mongolian sheep breeds, encouraged by government promotion of sheep farming. However, {{a lack of}} knowledge on the farmer's part of how to successfully keep sheep, and the government's failure to provide information to those importing the sheep they promoted, led to the project's failure, and in 1888 it was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E

5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the threat that compelled the Danubian <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, the potato became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight Colorado potato beetles. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on the potato however caused the European Potato Failure, a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and <b>farmers</b> <b>to</b> complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E
