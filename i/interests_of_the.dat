40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child Care Act 74 of 1983 clearly {{illustrates that}} the Act is not directed at serving <b>the</b> best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sexually abused child.

The suggestion is put forward that it has become urgent for a family court to be established.

5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice.

40|$|This thesis explores {{current and}} {{historical}} child custody laws in <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Arizona {{and how they}} have correlated with child development theories. It discusses the impact child development theories have had on Arizona child custody cases. Additionally, it includes an overview of early Arizona Supreme Court cases and the implications it has on <b>the</b> best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. The thesis also provides insight to problems with Arizona courts and the actors involved with making the decision for <b>the</b> best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. The investigation demonstrates a disconnection between judicial discretion and <b>the</b> best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child standard. An example from the United States Supreme Court case Troxel v Granville (1999) is reviewed to illustrate how courts discretion, in general, can be misused. Overall, court discretion in Arizona is liberal and the impact it has on child custody decisions can sometimes conflict with <b>the</b> best <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child...|$|R

By 1524 Mary negotiated significant authority and influence for herself. In 1525, she took control over one powerful political faction and neutralised another.
