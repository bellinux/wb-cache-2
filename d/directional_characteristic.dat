Zirconium, calcium, and rare earth elements are added for sulfide-inclusion shape control which increases formability. These are needed because most HSLA steels have directionally sensitive properties. Formability and impact strength can vary significantly when tested longitudinally and transversely to the grain.

50|$|Rather {{than using}} {{constructive}} and destructive interference, horns achieve directionality by reflecting sound into a specified coverage pattern. In a properly designed line array system, that pattern should closely match the low-frequency <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the array. If the array's vertical dispersion is 60 degrees {{and there are}} 12 boxes, then each horn would need to have 5 degree vertical coverage. (Narrow vertical coverage has the benefit that it minimizes multiple arrivals, which would harm intelligibility.) If this is achieved, then the wave guide elements can {{be integrated into the}} line array and, with proper equalization and crossovers, the beam from the high frequencies and the constructive interference of the low frequencies can be made to align so that the resulting arrayed system provides consistent coverage.|$|E

The Marnach transmitter {{was built in}} 1955 for improving the transmission of the English-speaking program on 1439 kHz (later 1440 kHz), which was transmitted from 1951 with an omnidirectional antenna from Junglinster, to the British Isles and for a better transmission on this frequency to Germany at daytime. Therefore, it was given a directional antenna with a switchable <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic</b> pointing North-northeast towards the Rhine-Ruhr area, Germany's most populated area, and West-northwest {{in the direction of}} the UK. This antenna was implemented in form of a directional antenna consisting of three ground-fed 105-metre tall guyed mast antennas arranged in the form of an isosceles triangle with a 90 degree angle.As transmitters, two 100 kW units switched in parallel were used when it went in service in December 1955.|$|E

40|$|Abstract —Digital halftoning is {{a process}} to convert a continuous-tone image into a binary image with black and white dots. This process is {{necessary}} to print a continuous-tone image using printers. The Error Diffusion {{is one of the}} most popular methods of digital halftoning, because it can generates high quality output images with relatively low computing time. Binary images generated by the Error Diffusion are fine grained in the sense that they have a lot of isolated small black and white dots. However, fine binary images are not appropriate for practical printing, because isolated black and white dots may disappear by dot-gain or dot-loss. Hence cluster-dot halftoning, which generates binary images has no isolated black and white dots are important. It is known that the Error Diffusion with some feedback operation can generate clustered-dot binary images. However, the resulting binary images have strong <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic,</b> which spoils the printing results. The main contribution of this paper is to presents new filters of the Error Diffusion for cluster-dot halftoning with no <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Quite surprisingly, it can generate cluster-dot binary images with no <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic</b> using our new filter. Also, the size of cluster can be adjusted by an additional feedback operation. The experimental results show that the Error Diffusion using our new filter can generate better quality binary images than the previously published know results...|$|E
