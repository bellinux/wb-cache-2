50|$|The lower layer, {{known as}} substrate, is {{typically}} about 15% <b>ground</b> <b>limestone</b> (which is largely calcium carbonate). The limestone reduces cost, and also balances the titanium dioxide, keeping both extrusion streams equally fluid during manufacturing.

50|$|The plant uses {{fluidized}} bed combustion (FBC) technology, in which bituminous coal and finely <b>ground</b> <b>limestone</b> are injected, using air, into the boiler. Air keeps the limestone and coal suspended in a fluid-like condition. The limestone reacts with sulfur dioxide, released during combustion of the coal, removing this pollutant from the plant's emissions. With the enhanced sulfur dioxide removal {{due to the}} FBC technology, Warrior Run can burn approximately 400000 ST of coal from Maryland each year, which tends to be of a higher sulfur content. During 2007, 100 percent of the coal burned at Warrior Run was mined in Maryland.|$|E

40|$|Three {{concentrations}} of K in the liquid feed, two lime sources and three cultivars were compared in a long-season crop of tomatoes grown in a peat substrate with 14 1 per plant. Increasing the K concentration from 180 to 280 mg/l increased the yield but a further rise to 380 mg/l {{did not give}} a significant increase. The higher levels of K reduced uneven ripening and increased the levels of soluble solids, titratable acidity and electrical conductivity of the fruit purée.

Two modern cultivars, Sonatine and Virosa, had better early yields than Ailsa Craig, an old cultivar, but similar total yields.

The future of the Met Square development was uncertain given these findings; however, in a landmark mediation process between public and private entities, the developers worked with archaeologists and government officials to protect partial or all of the site by building around it including a glass floor among other things with the idea to make it a museum.

5000|$|The {{tunnel system}} {{known today as}} the Ohio Caverns was {{discovered}} August 17, 1897 by Robert Noffsinger, a farmhand {{who worked on the}} land. A sinkhole had been forming on land owned by Abraham William Reams over a period of about 10 years. In August 1897, this sink hole measured 50 feet across by 10 feet deep. One particular night, the sinkhole was filled completely with water during a hard rain. By morning, the water was completely gone. Reams reported to the local newspaper that he lost [...] "several hundred barrels of water." [...] Reams had recently hired Robert Noffsinger, a young man from Virginia, to work on his farm. By Reams' orders, Noffsinger and Jordan Reams (unknown relation to William Reams) began to dig in the sinkhole. Noffsinger dug a few feet of soil until he hit the top of the <b>ground's</b> <b>limestone</b> layer. After finding a crack in the limestone, Noffsinger broke through this rock as well. Immediately feeling the caverns' [...] air, Noffsinger was even more curious. He lowered himself into the caverns and became the first living creature inside of the Ohio Caverns system. After crawling 8 feet into the caverns, Noffsinger called back out to Jordan Reams to fetch him an oil lantern. After Noffsinger received the lantern, he explored 802 feet on his first trip into the caverns.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A dietary calcium {{level of}} 1. 75 percent {{supplied}} as <b>ground</b> <b>limestone</b> was inadequate for individually caged medium weight turkeys from a line selected for increased egg production. Egg production was reduced {{but there was}} no significant effect on shell quality or hatchability of fertile eggs. This dietary calcium level was adequate for two large bodied strains. Replacement of two-thirds of the <b>ground</b> <b>limestone</b> in the 1. 75 percent calcium diet by hen-sized oyster shell alleviated the effect of this diet on egg production even though the amount of calcium consumed per egg was less than when all of the supplemented calcium was in the form of <b>ground</b> <b>limestone.</b> In a diet containing 2. 25 percent calcium, there was no effect of replacing two-thirds of the limestone with hen-sized oyster shell. The frequency of normal-shelled eggs decreased and the frequency of weak-shelled and "slab-sided " eggs (i. e., eggs with a flattened side) increased as the laying season progressed for all dietary treatments. The frequency of membraneous eggs increased until about the middle of an 18 -week production period and then declined {{for the remainder of the}} laying period.
