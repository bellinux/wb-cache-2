500|$|The {{assignment}} statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including {{the nature of}} Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to [...] "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to [...] "(generic) name x receives {{a reference to a}} separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." [...] This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a <b>fixed</b> <b>data</b> type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.|$|E
2500|$|In summary, {{the issues}} are as follows. Navitaire contend that {{copyright}} subsists in the command set as a copyright work distinct from the source code. This claim {{has a number of}} aspects: (i) the collection of commands as a whole is entitled to copyright as a 'compilation'; (ii) each of the commands is a copyright work in its own right; (iii) alternatively, each of the 'complex' commands is a work in its own right. As to the displays, Navitaire contend that (i) in respect of the VT100 screen displays, the 'template' (<b>fixed</b> <b>data</b> and layout of variable data) is a separate copyright work for each display and (ii) certain GUI screens on the separate Schedule Maintenance module are copyright works as they stand and have been copied. Then it is said (and this is a quite distinct allegation) that the similarity exhibited by eRes to OpenRes {{in the eye of the}} user is such that there has been 'non-textual copying' of the whole of the source code. This is said to be strictly analogous to taking the plot of a book: an author who takes the plot of another work and copies nothing else will still infringe copyright if a substantial part of the earlier author's work is represented by that plot, and the same goes for computer programs: John Richardson Computers v Flanders [...] FSR 497 (Ferris J).|$|E
60|$|It {{appears to}} your Committee that the ships which brought to England {{the plan of}} the 8th of April did not sail from Bengal until the 1st of May. If the change had been in contemplation for any time before the 30th of April, two days would have sufficed to send an account of it, and it might have arrived along with the plan which it affected. If, therefore, such a change was in {{agitation}} before the sailing of the ships, and yet was concealed when {{it might have been}} communicated, the concealment is censurable. It is not improbable that some change of the kind was made or meditated before the sailing of the ships for Europe: for it is hardly to be imagined that reasons wholly unlooked-for should appear for setting aside a plan concerning the success of which the Council-General seemed so very confident, that a new one should be proposed, that its merits should be discussed among the moneyed men, that it should be adopted in Council, and officially ready for transmission to Madras, in twelve or thirteen days. In this perplexity of plan and of transmission, the Court of Directors may have made an arrangement of their affairs on the groundwork of the first scheme, which was officially and authentically conveyed to them. The fundamental alteration of that plan in India might require another of a very different kind in England, which the arrangements taken in consequence of the first might make it difficult, if not impossible, to execute. What must add to the confusion is, that the alteration has not the regular and official authority of the original plan, and may be presumed to indicate with certainty nothing more than that the business is again afloat, and that no scheme is finally determined on. Thus the Company is left without any <b>fixed</b> <b>data</b> upon which they can make a rational disposition of their affairs.|$|E

40|$|Distributed storage {{systems have}} been {{increasingly}} de-ploying erasure codes (such as Reed-Solomon codes) for fault tolerance.

We present Beehive, a new design of erasure codes, that can <b>fix</b> unavailable <b>data</b> of multiple failures in batches while consuming the optimal network transfer with nearly opti-mal storage overhead. Evaluation results show that Bee-hive codes can save network transfer by up to 69. 4 % and disk I/O by 75 % during reconstruction. ...|$|R
