5|$|New York Riesling {{generally}} has a characteristic effervescent light {{body with a}} similarly light, mellow flavor. The wine can be dynamic though rarely robust, and ranges from dry to sweet. New York is also a notable producer of Riesling-based <b>Ice</b> <b>Wine,</b> although {{a large majority of}} New York <b>Ice</b> <b>Wine</b> is made from Vidal blanc and Vignoles.|$|E
5|$|In Michigan, whose Old Mission Peninsula and Leelanau Peninsula AVAs (near Traverse City) {{are known}} for their <b>ice</b> <b>wine,</b> Riesling is a fairly common variety, in part on account of its {{suitability}} for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Other {{varieties}} {{with significant}} production by harvested acres in 2016 are Syrah, Merlot, Tempranillo, Pinot blanc, Gewürztraminer, Viognier, Cabernet franc, Müller-Thurgau, Sauvignon blanc, and Zinfandel, V. vinifera based wines produced in smaller quantities include Arneis, Baco noir, Black Muscat, Chenin blanc, Dolcetto, Gamay noir, Grenache, Marechal Foch, Malbec, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petite Syrah, Sangiovese, and Sémillon. The state also produces fruit wine, sparkling wine, late harvest wine, <b>ice</b> <b>wine,</b> and dessert wine.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{fermentation}} {{characteristics of}} <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> made from freeze-dried Muscat Bailey A grapes were determined. Muscat Bailey A grapes were concentrated to 34. 8 and 40. 8 oBx by freeze drying and were then fermented. The content of reducing sugar was 0. 3 % in conventional wine after fermentation, but was 21. 5 and 23. 9 % in <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> at 34 and 40 oBx, respectively. The content of alcohol was 9. 6 % in conventional wine but was 10. 3 and 10. 6 % in <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> at 34 and 40 oBx, respectively. It was {{observed that the}} red and violet colors of <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> at 34 and 40 oBx became dominant compared to the controls. In sensory evaluation studies, <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> at 34 and 40 oBx showed higher intensities in color...|$|R

5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the average temperature is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} <b>ice</b> <b>wine.</b> However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can also support different types of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>wines</b> {{are popular}} in the cold northernly wine regions of Germany and Canada where the grapes can freeze on the vine. As the grapes are pressed, the frozen water {{crystals}} are eliminated leaving the highly concentrated sugar behind.|$|R
25|$|The Americas have {{developed}} both {{white and red}} wines, {{some of which are}} now recognized worldwide. White wines have to conquer hostile territories where red wine dominates such as the Rocky Mountains or Canada. In Canada, the technique of <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> can produce exceptional wines in a climate which is apparently unfavourable. Canada is the largest producer of <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Chardonnay vintages of {{the early}} 1990s from British Columbia helped {{generate}} international attention {{to the quality of}} Canadian wines apart from <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> varietals. In British Columbia, Chardonnay from the Okanagan are characterized by delicate citrus fruits. They are typically light-bodied, but producers who use barrel fermentation and oak aging can produce fuller-bodied wines.|$|E
25|$|Cabernet Franc {{is one of}} {{the major}} black grape {{varieties}} worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> in those regions.|$|E
50|$|Pelee Island Winery {{produces}} {{a wide variety}} of grape wines, and may offer for sale as many as 15 white and 15 red wines, most of them bearing the VQA mark. The winery also offers blush, dessert, and <b>ice</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Frontenac gris wines present {{aromas of}} peach and apricot with hints of {{enticing}} citrus and tropical fruit. A brilliant balance {{of fruit and}} acidity creates lively, refreshing wines.

50|$|In {{comparing}} the <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> made from Riesling {{to those of}} Vidal blanc, wine expert Oz Clarke also notes that Vidal wines tend not to have much aging potential but says that these wines usually have a rich concentration of intense fruit flavors.|$|R
25|$|Eiswein (<b>ice</b> <b>wine)</b> wine is made grapes that freeze {{naturally}} on {{the vine}} and have to reach the same potential alcohol level as Beerenauslese. The grapes are harvested and pressed in the frozen state. The ice stays in the press during pressing and hence a concentrated juice flows off the press leading to higher potential alcohol levels, which in turn generally result in sweet wines due to the high potential alcohol. The taste differs from the other high-level wines since Botrytis infection is usually lower, ideally completely absent.|$|E
25|$|Freeze {{distillation}} is {{an analogous}} method of purification using freezing instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a recrystallization where {{the product is}} the mother liquor, and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process {{is used in the}} production of ice beer and <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> to increase ethanol and sugar content, respectively. It is also used to produce applejack. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. However, reducing methanol with the absorption of 4A molecular sieve is a practical method for production. Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{produces}} a {{full spectrum of}} wines ranging from mass-produced to premium boutique wines. It also produces nearly every style of wine including rosé, sparkling, fruit, fortified, still and late harvest dessert wines afflicted with Botrytis cinerea. Some years can even produce favorable conditions for <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> production. In 2006, The Wine Advocate gave two perfect scores of 100 points for Cabernet Sauvignon wines made by Quilceda Creek Vintners using grapes from several Washington AVAs. Only 15 other American wines have ever been scored so highly by The Wine Advocate, all from California. Chateau Ste Michelle Wine Estates (which owns the original Chateau Ste Michelle label {{as well as several}} others) is the largest producer in the state, owning {{more than a third of}} all vineyard land in Washington.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the world's wine producing regions lie between the temperate latitudes of 30° and 50° in both hemispheres with regions lying closer to the equator typically harvesting earlier due to their warmer climates. In the Northern Hemisphere, vineyards in Cyprus begin harvesting as early as July. In California some sparkling wine grapes are harvested in late July to early August at a slightly unripe point to help maintain acidity in the wine. The {{majority of}} Northern Hemisphere harvesting occurs in late August to early October with some late harvest wine grapes being harvested throughout the autumn. In Germany, the United States and Canada, <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> grapes can be harvested as late as January. In the Southern Hemisphere harvest can begin as early as January 1 {{in some of the}} warmer climate sites in New South Wales, Australia. The majority of Southern Hemisphere harvesting occurs between the months of February and April with some cool climate sites like Central Otago, New Zealand picking late harvest wine grapes in June.|$|E
25|$|Traverse City {{was named}} by USA Today among the Top Ten Places for Local Wine. There are nine wineries on the Old Mission Peninsula and 21 wineries on the Leelanau Peninsula, both {{just a few}} minutes drive from {{downtown}} Traverse City. Both peninsulas sit close to the 45th parallel, a latitude known for growing prestigious grapes. The two arms of Grand Traverse Bay provide the ideal maritime climate and the rich glacial soil does the rest. Northern Michigan specializes in growing white grapes and is known for its Rieslings which grow well in the summer months and late fall which Traverse City is known for. Every October the wineries host a harvest fest. Some Riesling grapes are spared being picked in the fall to be picked when they freeze, from which <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> is made. The wineries along the Old Mission Peninsula are Black Star Farms, 2 Lads Winery, Bowers Harbor Vineyards, Brys Estate Vineyard & Winery, Chateau Chantal Winery And Inn, Chateau Grand Traverse, Bonobo Winery, Mari Vineyards, and Peninsula Cellars. The wineries along the Leelanau Peninsula are Black Star Farms, Leelenau Cellars, Silver Leaf Vineyard and Winery, Gill's Pier Vineyard and Winery, Raftshol Vineyards, Circa Estate Winery, Forty-Five North Vineyard and Winery, Good Harbor Vineyards, Chateau Fontaine, Boskydel Vineyards, L. Mawby Vineyards, Ciccone Vineyard and Winery, Willow Vineyards, Chateau de Leelanau Vineyard and Winery, Shady Lane Cellars, Cherry Republic Winery, Longview Winery, Boathouse Winery, Verterra, Brengman Brothers, and Bel Lago Winery.|$|E
500|$|The most {{expensive}} wines made from Riesling are late harvest dessert wines, produced by letting the grapes {{hang on the}} vines well past normal picking time. Through evaporation caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea ("noble rot") or by freezing, {{as in the case}} of <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> (in German, Eiswein), water is removed and the resulting wine is felt to offer richer layers on the palate. These concentrated wines have more sugar (in extreme cases hundreds of grams per litre), more acid (to give balance to the sugar), more flavour, and more complexity. These elements combine to make wines which are amongst the most long lived of all white wines. The beneficial use of [...] "noble rot" [...] in Riesling grapes was discovered in the late 18th century at Schloss Johannisberg. Permission from the Abbey of Fulda (which owned the vineyard) to start picking Riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality.|$|E
25|$|After aging at {{the winery}} most wood-aged Ports, Sherries, Vins doux naturels, Vins de liqueur, basic level <b>Ice</b> <b>wines</b> and {{sparkling}} wines are bottled when the producer feels {{that they are}} ready to be consumed. These wines are ready to drink upon release and will not benefit much from aging. Vintage Ports and other bottled-aged Ports & Sherries will benefit from some additional aging.|$|R
5000|$|Vidal blanc {{is noted}} {{for not having}} the {{characteristic}} [...] "foxy" [...] taste that it is identifiable with many hybrid-varieties which include American grapevines in their parentage. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Vidal blanc tends to produce wines with [...] "bright and pure" [...] fruit and acid levels that can balance out the sweetness of <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> though the wines tend not to have much aging potential.|$|R
5000|$|The United States law for <b>ice</b> <b>wines</b> also {{specifies}} {{that the}} grapes must be naturally frozen. The TTB (Tax and Trade Bureau) regulations state that [...] "Wine made from grapes frozen after harvest {{may not be}} labeled with the term [...] "ice wine" [...] or any variation thereof, and if the wine is labeled to suggest it was made from frozen grapes, the label must be qualified {{to show that the}} grapes were frozen postharvest." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Canada, {{there are}} less than [...] of Sangiovese planted, mostly in Ontario where some {{producers}} in Niagara-on-the-Lake are experimenting with <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> versions of the grape. A small amount of the grape {{can also be found}} in British Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{poetry of}} Virgil recalls {{that of the}} Greek poet Hesiod in its focus on the {{morality}} and virtue of viticulture, particularly the austerity, integrity and hard work of Roman farmers. The second book of the didactic poem Georgics deals with viticultural matters. Virgil advises leaving some grapes on the vine until late November when they become [...] "stiff with frost." [...] This early version of <b>ice</b> <b>wine</b> would have produced sweet wines without the acidity of wine made from grapes harvested earlier.|$|E
2500|$|... "Freezing of grapes" [...] {{and cold}} {{pressing}} {{are used to}} squeeze the liquid part of the berries. The flakes of frozen water remain {{in the press and}} only the sweet juice flows. This is the principle of <b>ice</b> <b>wine.</b> Cryoextraction is a recent technique invented to reproduce the phenomenon in the regions which are not cold enough: the grapes are artificially frozen before being pressed. This method overcomes the climate and harvesting work can continue without waiting for the frosts (risk of loss of the grapes by weather accident or attack by hungry sparrows), but shortening the maturation does not give the same flavour.|$|E
