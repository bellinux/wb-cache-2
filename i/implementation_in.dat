5|$|Offside has {{a unique}} <b>implementation</b> <b>in</b> field lacrosse. Instituted with rule changes in 1921, it limits the number of players that are allowed {{on either side of}} the midfield line. Offside occurs when there are fewer than three players on the {{offensive}} side of the midfield line or when there are fewer than four players on the defensive half of the midfield line (note: if players are exiting through the special-substitution area, it is not to be determined an offside violation).|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} major general, Godley, {{together with}} fourteen British Army officers seconded to the New Zealand Military Forces, was tasked with reorganising and instilling professionalism {{in the military}} establishment of the country. Compulsory military training had recently been introduced by the government but with little thought as to its <b>implementation.</b> <b>In</b> refining the New Zealand Military Forces, Godley drew heavily on the recommendations of Lord Herbert Kitchener, who had visited New Zealand {{earlier in the year}} on an inspection tour.|$|E

5|$|Separately, the {{experimental}} Arwinss branch was created {{as an alternative}} means to improve USER32 and GDI32 support through an alternative implementation of the Win32 API. Whereas ReactOS's original Win32 subsystem was closely modeled after its equivalent in Windows, Arwinss combines the architecture of that subsystem with the corresponding <b>implementation</b> <b>in</b> Wine. To this end, Arwinss uses Wine's GDI32 and USER32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of Wine's existing software compatibility. Arwinss also allows the user to optionally use a remote X server instead of a local display.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its <b>implementation</b> <b>in</b> the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a pause in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that key members of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E
5|$|The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's {{initiative}} {{in response to}} the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of <b>implementation</b> <b>in</b> the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation. Initially, the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.|$|E
