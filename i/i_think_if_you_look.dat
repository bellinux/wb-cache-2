2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here and Now was released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any more, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the way we have evolved over the last few records you could see it coming. We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E

5000|$|De Palma has, however, {{been quick}} to downplay {{the notion that the}} movie {{suffered}} because of studio interference: [...] "The initial producers, once we had cast Tom Hanks, moved on and went over to Columbia Pictures, so I was sort of left to my own devices and pursued ways in which I thought I could make this movie more commercial and keep some edge of the book...I {{thought we were going to}} get away with it, but we didn't. I knew that the people who read the book were going to be extremely unhappy, and I said, 'Well, this is a movie; it isn't the book.' And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the movie now, and you don't know anything about the book, and you get it out of the time that it was released, I think you can see it in a whole different way." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a later {{interview}} with Mess+Noise, Burgman commented {{on how the}} inspiration for the songs on the album had come from Jeremy's previous experiences, stating [...] "It's very much a teenager's record, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at that first album in that light, the songs on the record are just stories." [...] Peter concluded that in hindsight the songs on the record betray Jeremy's troubled soul. [...] "At the time I knew that they were great lyrics, but you were concentrating on the music, and you didn't look at the lyrics as a 19-year-old in terms of how intense and deeply personal they were. Truly in hindsight you think, 'Oh my goodness, these lyrics Jeremy was writing were truly very heartfelt and soulful'. They were his real feelings at the time. They weren't third-party storytelling, they were real heart-on-the-sleeve stuff. The lyrics are incredible now when you're listening to them. I think the longevity of the songs really does relate to the intensity of those lyrics." ...|$|E
5000|$|As a Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, he {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the Northern Ireland peace process. However, after Reiss denied Gerry Adams a visa to the United States to spur the endorsement of policing and justice in Northern Ireland by Adams and his political party, Sinn Féin, Adams criticized Reiss on March 16, 2006 saying, [...] "I don't have high regards for Mitchell Reiss's input into this process" [...] and [...] "If it is he who is advising the president, it's very very bad advice." [...] Reiss responded [...] "We try very hard to be an honest broker. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the record, it demonstrates quite clearly that we don't play favorites - that we call it as we see it... We try to keep our eye on the main objective here - which is moving the peace process forward and keeping the focus on the people of Northern Ireland." [...] Less than a year later, in January 2007, Sinn Féin formally endorsed policing and justice, thereby paving the way for the historic power-sharing arrangement with Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party on March 26, 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't you 'Emily' me!" [...] said Mrs. Hatchard, quickly. [...] "The idea! A lodger, too! You {{know the}} arrangement. You'd better go, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can't behave yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|More recently, comedian and TV host Bill Maher claimed: [...] "I {{think there}} is a gay mafia. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> cross them, you do get whacked. I really do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I am not married, sir; but <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{had asked}} the question, I should have replied that I was engaged, or rather had hopes of being engaged soon.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{will you}} sleep here? I have a guest's room all ready, a lovely little room, only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> sleep there <b>I</b> shall sit by your bedside all night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Blatherwick rose hastily, {{and shook}} his head. [...] "You must excuse me, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please," [...] he said. [...] "I will not smoke any more. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will not mind----" ...|$|R
60|$|NORA. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{you ought}} to be ashamed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were a gentleman, and me alone with you in this place at night, you would die rather than do such a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I have," [...] she answered, {{with some}} slight hesitation, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't object to it, Harry, I'd rather {{go and see}} her alone, {{the first time at}} least, please dearest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” {{she said}} quietly. “Not now, Tony. We are strange creatures; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{had made me}} a {{confession}} {{a little while ago}} I could have forgiven you anything and kissed you afterwards.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there came}} a deep sigh. [...] "Sad," [...] she said, repeating the word; [...] "sad! Yes, it's sad. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't mind, I'll ask you to leave me now. Oh, yes; there's the newspaper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] {{said the}} gardener, [...] "but I am sure this story {{could not have}} {{happened}} in any other way, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will wait until it is finished you will agree with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was my {{idea when}} I put it in. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could both make it {{convenient}} {{to come with us}} about eight o'clock to Caulfield Gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{says she}} is not going; but I am very glad <b>you</b> have come. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were {{to talk to her}} a little".... And Charlotte lowered her voice. [...] "It seems as if she were restless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can play}} that anthem, if that's all,' said Lance; 'and I believe {{you know it}} {{perfectly}} well. Now, Clem, don't be savage; <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will come, we might put that other thing out of Ful's head.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a good}} idea," [...] said Phedo, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, {{you ought}} to find him and kill him, or drive {{him out of the}} country. That's what I should do, if I were you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We do have {{an erosion}} of {{confidence}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go back in history every bubble has basically led to abuses, to fraud, to unethical behaviour and we’re seeing the same."-in an interview with Swissinfo, November 7, 2002 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{exceedingly}} {{sorry for}} this, Mr Bentley,' he said, 'but {{you will understand}} that I cannot--It is, of course, out of the question. It would be best, in the circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did not see my daughter again--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would kill}} me, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did; and yet I cannot {{get it out}} of my head that {{if it had not been}} for me your rank and {{position}} in life might have been so--so suitable to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Martha's letter (to Sarah): [...] "Dear Sarah, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{work on your}} {{leadership}} skills, you {{can have}} a very successful career.

6000|$|... "I cannot {{blame you}} for your being hard of faith, my lord," [...] said Jekyl; [...] "but still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can cut out with your earldom, and your noble {{hereditary}} estate, I would, in your case, pitch Nettlewood to the devil." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{will say}} <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> you know, colonel, I {{have to tell}} you that there are cases where a long course of history in fact does change the Constitution, and <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of one instance. I believe I'm correct on this. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to go back and try to find and review the {{ratification}} of the 16th amendment, which was the internal revenue, income tax, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> went back and examined that carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment ... And nonetheless, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's fair to say that it is part of the Constitution of the United States, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> any court would ever...set it aside.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Fulbert, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had {{a broken}} leg you'd wish some one to speak to you. At any rate, I can't have Lance bullied for his good nature; I was very near doing it myself once, but I was shamed out of it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Why is life {{so cheap}} these days? I agree wholeheartedly with this fatwa against the {{targeting}} of innocent civilians, {{put forward by}} Shaykh Muhammad Afifi Al-Akiti, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> spend some time reading it, you too would realise how true it is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will write}} your note at once, Mrs. Cunningham, I will send one down to Dr. Holloway, {{asking him to}} send an {{experienced}} nurse. He said he should call again this afternoon, but the sooner a nurse comes the better." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “It is {{inclusive}} too, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have surveys {{done before}} you have the surgery and after you have the surgery you feel as though you’re not alone and you’ve got some other body sort of interested in your sort of recovery, and preparation.” (Patient 3).|$|R

60|$|As a story, a comedy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> OTTO {{very well}} constructed; the echoes are very good, all the sentiments change round, and {{the points of}} view are continually, and, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> please), happily contrasted. None of it is exactly funny, {{but some of it}} is smiling.|$|R
