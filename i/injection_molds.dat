The measured AE burst signals during <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> cycle are presented. For <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> tool integrity prediction, different AE burst signals’ descriptors are defined. To lower computational complexity and increase performance, the feature selection method was implemented {{to define a}} feature subset in an appropriate multidimensional space to characterize {{the integrity of the}} <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> tool and the <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> process steps.
