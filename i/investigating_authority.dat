50|$|The {{legality}} of unique bid auctions {{depends on a}} combination of governing gambling laws and the design of the specific auction model. If an <b>investigating</b> <b>authority</b> were to determine that randomness or chance plays too large a role in the outcome, the auction may be considered a type of lottery. If, on the other hand, the <b>investigating</b> <b>authority</b> found strategy and skill played a sufficient enough role in the outcome, they may find the auction to be legal. Worldwide, there are no reported cases or statutes specifically outlawing the lowest-unique bid auction model.|$|E

50|$|As {{used by some}} criminologists {{and others}} who study {{criminal}} investigations (including mystery writers), a perfect crime goes unsolved not because of incompetence in the investigation, {{but because of the}} cleverness and skill of the criminal. In other words, the defining factor is the primary causative influence of the criminal's ability to avoid investigation and reprisal, and not so much the ability of the <b>investigating</b> <b>authority</b> to perform its duties.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this article is to discuss whether a pre-privatization subsidy would be {{extinguished}} after privatization of entities. Since WTO AB held that privatization at arm’s length and for fair market value may, not must result in extinguishing the benefit, it provides possibilities for the <b>investigating</b> <b>authorities</b> to develop more methodologies to examine the issue. Actually, how to define a fair market value directly influences standards employed by the <b>investigating</b> <b>authorities</b> to assess the problem. After reviewing the changes of U.

50|$|The CAB {{was set up}} by the Oireachtas as a body {{corporate}} primarily for the purpose of ensuring that persons should not benefit from any assets acquired by them from any criminal activity. It was given power to take all necessary actions in relation to seizing and securing assets derived from criminal activity, certain powers to ensure that the proceeds of such activity are subject to tax, and also in relation to the Social Welfare Acts. However, as the High Court has noted, it is not a prosecuting body nor a police authority but rather it is an <b>investigating</b> <b>authority</b> which, having investigated and used its powers of investigation, then applies to the High Court for assistance in enforcing its functions.|$|E

5000|$|Citing {{the case}} of United States vs. Nixon (418 U.S. 683), the Court laid out the three {{elements}} needed to be complied with {{in order for the}} claim to executive privilege to be valid. These are: 1.) the protected communication must relate to a quintessential and non-delegable presidential power; 2.) it must be authored, solicited, and received by a close advisor of the President or the President himself. The judicial test is that an advisor must be in [...] "operational proximity" [...] with the President; and, 3.) it may be overcome by a showing of adequate need, such that the information sought [...] "likely contains important evidence," [...] and by the unavailability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate <b>investigating</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{licence fee}} is {{classified}} as a tax, and its evasion is a criminal offence. Since 1991, collection and enforcement of the licence fee has been {{the responsibility of the}} BBC in its role as TV Licensing Authority. Thus, the BBC is a major prosecuting authority in England and Wales and an <b>investigating</b> <b>authority</b> in the UK as a whole. The BBC carries out surveillance (mostly using subcontractors) on properties (under the auspices of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000) and may conduct searches of a property using a search warrant. According to the BBC, [...] "more than 204,000 people in the UK were caught watching TV without a licence during {{the first six months of}} 2012." [...] Licence fee evasion makes up around one tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates' courts.|$|E
5000|$|And as to {{the third}} element, there is no {{adequate}} showing of a compelling need that would justify the limitation of the privilege and of the unavailability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate <b>investigating</b> <b>authority.</b> Presidential communications are presumptively privileged and that the presumption can be overcome only by mere showing of public need by the branch seeking access to such conversations. In the present case, respondent Committees failed to show a compelling or critical need for {{the answers to the}} three questions in the enactment of any law under Sec. 21, Art. VI. Instead, the questions veer more towards the exercise of the legislative oversight function under Sec. 22, Art. VI. As ruled in Senate vs. Ermita, [...] "the oversight function of Congress may be facilitated by compulsory process {{only to the extent that}} it is performed in pursuit of legislation." ...|$|E
