5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|This {{was written}} {{years after the}} {{campaign}} and is affected by hindsight, both {{of the results of}} the battle and of the postbellum criticism of the Lost Cause authors. In letters of the time Longstreet made no reference to such a bargain with Lee. In April 1868, Lee said that he [...] "had never made any such promise, and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> doing any such thing." [...] Yet in his post-battle report, Lee wrote, [...] "It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base, unless attacked by the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of seven months in Los Angeles, New York City and Tokyo. The bulk of the album was recorded at Eagle Rock, Los Angeles. [...] "Letter in the Sky" [...] was recorded in Hollywood, and [...] "Happiness," [...] "Yume no Mukou" [...] and [...] "Utsukushiki Mono" [...] were recorded in Tokyo. Ai felt that moving to a new label was a chance to refresh her music. In the album sessions, Ai felt challenged in many ways. [...] "Dance Together," [...] an electronic song, was something she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> making, as she previously thought she did not enjoy the genre. Ai considered [...] "Utsukushiki Mono" [...] as the most vocally challenging song she had recorded. She used much more of her falsetto range on the album than in previous works. The lyrics of the album were more [...] "heartfelt" [...] than her previous albums, in particular [...] "One Love" [...] and [...] "Happiness." [...] "Happiness" [...] was written with the feelings and mindset Ai had {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
50|$|Chris' {{cousin and}} Sam's older sister. Despite Chris not being her {{biological}} brother, she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him {{as anything other}} than her little brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} do not know; you cannot see {{yourself}} as others see you. For instance, you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> yourself as a golden idol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] Khatim said. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{surrendering}} to the Turks, {{but as it}} is the will of Allah, I will do so." ...|$|R
60|$|The English swore, and {{declared}} that they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that.|$|E
60|$|The Bu'ster was posed. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> food, so his countenance fell.|$|E
60|$|Sam started. Somehow {{this girl}} {{had always been}} so {{individual}} {{to him that he}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her having a father.|$|E
6000|$|... "I?" [...] hesitated {{the little}} woman, [...] "nay, I do not know, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it. Doubtless I shall win through {{in this way}} or in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a {{contingency}} I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of,</b> Aunt. You quite frighten me. I must {{go in for}} a course of severe exercise to prevent the chance {{of such a thing}} occurring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that plan, or I {{would have}} been free long ago," [...] said the Woozy. [...] "But I cannot flash fire from my eyes unless I am very angry." ...|$|R
60|$|Swithin, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> such a contingency, was earnest in his regrets; without, however, showing {{more than}} a sincere friend's disappointment.|$|E
60|$|Miss Price! They <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her! She was the pale, timid-looking little {{teacher in}} the primary {{department}} of the Hazelwood school.|$|E
60|$|Then I remembered all the {{problems}} that had been troubling me, although in truth I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> propounding them to Zikali.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is fine--I {{respect that}} feeling," [...] said Dorothea, with {{returning}} kindness. [...] "But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{anything in the}} matter except what was most for your welfare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure what}} you say is just, cousin, and yet I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it before. I will--I am {{determined}} to begin, after this, to live with some better purpose than I have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{rough on}} the boy, {{and it is}} rough on you," [...] Matravers said kindly. [...] "I wonder you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> sending him to his mother! She would surely like to have him!" ...|$|R
60|$|I thought, for my part, {{that they}} had all said enough already. They had praised and thanked us for things we <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of.</b>|$|E
60|$|Philip <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{such things}} before, but he {{observed}} now that Miss Wilkinson's ankles were thick and ungainly. He withdrew his eyes quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I shall, to-night: I must {{consult the}} archdeacon about this weary hospital. Ah me! I wish I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But--you {{are going}} to say that you don't love him and <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him as a husband," [...] {{interrupted}} the duchess; [...] "I read it in your face,--and it's a very proper thing to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} it is as you say," [...] Edgar said, [...] "though I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it before. Somehow one comes to think of the {{citizens}} of great towns as being above all things peaceful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't really," [...] {{explained}} Mr. Folk. [...] "I {{just walked}} and talked naturally. It made rather a sensation at the time. Your {{mother was a}} genius. You <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going on the stage yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In all my {{thoughts}} of you I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> your going away. I couldn't speak to Penelope. I could {{only look at}} her.|$|E
60|$|They looked one upon {{another in}} consternation. They <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the child, who, of course, had flown up at once with the tidings.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{so stupid}} in him never {{to see that}} we had got loose, and were {{drifting}} off," [...] said Vera, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> inquiring after him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The usual {{interpretation}} of a friendship {{between a man and}} a woman! I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> such a thing; and I am sure she <b>never</b> <b>has.</b> We are not half so intimate as you and Sir Charles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> considering.' He innocently {{turned to}} scrutinize her face. She winced a little. But the {{instinct}} was premature. Time had taken no liberties with her features as yet; nor had trouble very roughly handled her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course! I {{left off}} at seven this evening. I have {{nothing else in}} my life," [...] she added simply, [...] "but my work, our work, the {{breaking}} of these vile bonds. I need no pleasures. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tom {{will be so}} happy, and so proud, and glad,' she said, {{clasping}} {{her little}} hands. 'But so surprised! I am sure he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> such a thing.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{father was}} in San Francisco by that time; and she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him! In her quick remorse she now forgot all else and rose to her feet.|$|E
60|$|Left {{alone with}} the fairy, Willie Willders began his duties as sick-nurse, a sphere of action into which he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> being introduced, even in his wildest dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> asking you, general," [...] {{said the}} commodore, {{as he began}} to {{masticate}} a perch, [...] "whether you are an aristocrat or a democrat. We have had the government pretty much upside-down, too, this morning, but this question has escaped me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have spoken}} to your father, Freda; and he has promised me your hand if you, indeed, are willing to bestow it. I promised to come {{for you if you}} would wait, nearly five years ago, and I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> any other woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} I ought. I wish I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> got into it. I wish you <b>had</b> <b>never,</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> educating me. I wish I {{worked in the}} woods like Marty South. I hate genteel life, and I want to be no better than she." ...|$|R
