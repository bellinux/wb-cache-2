PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E

But that there are similarities in the <b>design,</b> <b>structure</b> and function of the two networks could equally derive from a conscious imitation of the other website without directly accessing and copying of the source code of Facebook. The reference to Facebook's web appearance could have simply happened by using the publicly available HTML texts and stylesheets when programming StudiVZ. Even if the programmer of StudiVZ was given the concrete task to create a website in the style of Facebook, this does not constitute copyright infringement according to German Copyright law, see §69a German Copyright Act Mere similarities between the two websites are not enough to demonstrate with sufficient probability a copying of the source code.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} of the first sixteen vessels was all authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933; the last two were authorised under the Vinson-Trammell Act on 27 March 1934 (as part of a batch of 95 destroyers authorised on that date - covering DD-380 to DD-436 and DD-445 to DD-482). Contracts {{for the first six}} Mahans were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house <b>design</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of Gibbs & Cox was named as the design agent. The firm had no experience in the design of warships, [...] but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy. The decision was made to design the Mahan class and future classes around a new generation of machinery, including a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system that combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and double reduction gears.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the new car led Holden to redesign the Elizabeth plant in South Australia so that entire sections of the car can be assembled off the foremost production line. This new production method allows for complete sub-sections like the engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production. This process {{is applied to the}} front-end module of the VE Commodore, consisting of the headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. It can be easily removed as one-piece leading to lower repair costs and easier access to the engine bay. This design represents the first time such a method has been used within GM, and garnered the SAE Australasia's 2006 Automotive Engineering Excellence Award. A modular <b>design</b> <b>structure</b> known within Holden as [...] "Flex Vision" [...] has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the different Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs. The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed: Functional, Performance and Luxury. The closely related long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice derivatives feature a fourth interior type referred to as Prestige.|$|E

I {{wish you}} {{especially}} to notice these points, because the false theory that ornamentation should be merely decorated structure is so pretty and plausible, {{that it is}} likely to take away your attention from the far more important abstract conditions of <b>design.</b> <b>Structure</b> should never be contradicted, and in the best buildings it is pleasantly exhibited and enforced: in this very porch the joints of every stone are visible, and you will find me in the Fifth Lecture insisting on this clearness of its anatomy as a merit; yet so independent is the mechanical structure of the true design, that when I begin my Lectures on Architecture, the first building I shall give you as a standard will be one in which the structure is wholly concealed. It will be the Baptistery of Florence, which is, in reality, as much a buttressed chapel with a vaulted roof, as the Chapter House of York;--but round it, in order to conceal that buttressed structure, (not to decorate, observe, but to conceal,) a flat external wall is raised; simplifying the whole to a mere hexagonal box, like a wooden piece of Tunbridge ware, on the surface of which the eye and intellect are to be interested by the relations of dimension and curve between pieces of incrusting marble of different colors, which have no {{more to do with the}} real make of the building than the diaper of a Harlequin's jacket has to do with his bones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} using genetic algorithms to <b>design</b> <b>structures.</b> We relax one constraint on classical genetic algorithms and describe a genetic algorithm that uses differential information about search direction to <b>design</b> <b>structures.</b> This differential information is captured by a masked crossover operator which also removes the bias toward short schemas. We analyze performance and present some preliminary results. Further, consideration of this problem suggests a partial solution to {{the identification of the}} deception problem. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of <b>designing</b> <b>structures</b> is pervasive in science and engineering. The problem is: Given a function and some materials to work with, <b>design</b> a <b>structure</b> that performs this function subject to certain constraints. As an example of the design problem, consider the combinational circuit design problem: Given a set of logic gates, design a circuit that performs a desired function.
