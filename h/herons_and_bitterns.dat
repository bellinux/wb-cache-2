25|$|One {{pleasure}} of Huxley's life in Texas was {{the sight of}} his first hummingbird, though his visit to Edward Avery McIlhenny's estate on Avery Island in Louisiana was more significant. The McIlhennys and their Avery cousins owned the entire island, and the McIlhenny branch used it to produce their famous Tabasco sauce. Birds were one of McIlhenny's passions, however, and around 1895 he had set up a private sanctuary on the Island, called Bird City. There Huxley found egrets, <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns.</b> These water birds, like the grebes, exhibit mutual courtship, with the pairs displaying to each other, and with the secondary sexual characteristics equally developed in both sexes.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the noise}} was the great point. That {{was the thing that}} took Martin and Barney quite aback, {{although}} it was by no means new to them; but they could not get used to it. And no wonder! Ten thousand paroquets shrieking passionately, like a hundred knife-grinders at work, is no joke; especially when their melodies are mingled with the discordant cries of <b>herons,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and cranes, and the ceaseless buzz and hum of insects, like the bagpipe's drone, and the dismal croaking of boat-bills and frogs,--one kind of which latter, by the way, doesn't croak at all, but whistles, ay, better than many a bird! The universal hubbub is tremendous! I tell you, reader, that you don't understand it and you can't understand it; and if, after I had used the utmost excess of exaggerated language to convey a correct impression of the reality, you were to imagine that you really did understand it, you would be very lamentably mistaken--that's all! ...|$|E
6000|$|Of all his names--and {{there were}} many more that I picked up from {{watching}} him in a summer's outing--"Old Father Longlegs" [...] seemed always the most appropriate. There is a suggestion of hoary antiquity about this solemn wader of our lakes and streams. Indeed, of all birds he is the nearest to those ancient, uncouth monsters which Nature made to people our earth in its uncouth infancy. Other <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns</b> have grown smaller and more graceful, with shorter legs and necks, to suit our diminishing rivers and our changed landscape. Quoskh is also, undoubtedly, much smaller than he once was; but still his legs and neck are disproportionately long, when one thinks of the waters he wades and the nest he builds; and the tracks he leaves in the mud are startlingly like those fossilized footprints of giant birds that one finds in the rocks of the Pliocene era, deep under the earth's surface, to tell what sort of creatures lived in the vast solitudes before man came to replenish the earth and subdue it.|$|E
50|$|The current International Ornithological Committee {{classification}} has pelicans grouped {{with the}} shoebill (Balaenicipitidae), hamerkop (Scopidae), {{ibises and spoonbills}} (Threskiornithidae) <b>and</b> <b>herons,</b> egrets <b>and</b> <b>bitterns</b> (Ardeidae).|$|R
50|$|The Malayan {{night heron}} (Gorsachius melanolophus), {{also known as}} Malaysian night <b>heron</b> <b>and</b> tiger <b>bittern,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} heron. It is distributed in southern and eastern Asia.|$|R
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the <b>herons,</b> egrets, <b>and</b> <b>bitterns.</b> <b>Herons</b> <b>and</b> egrets are medium-sized to large wading birds with long necks <b>and</b> legs. <b>Bitterns</b> {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive.

50|$|The {{flight is}} slow, with the neck retracted. This is {{characteristic}} of <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, and spoonbills, which extend their necks. The white underwing coverts are striking in flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight is}} slow, with its neck retracted. This is {{characteristic}} of <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and distinguishes them from storks, cranes and spoonbills, which extend their necks. The species feeds in shallow water, spearing fish with its long, sharp bill. It will wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim.|$|E

This is {{characteristic}} of <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, ibises, and spoonbills, which extend their necks in flight. The great egret walks with its neck extended and wings held close. The great egret is not normally a vocal bird; it gives a low hoarse croak when disturbed, and at breeding colonies, it often gives a loud croaking cuk cuk cuk and higher-pitched squawks.|$|E
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the <b>herons,</b> egrets, <b>and</b> <b>bitterns.</b> <b>Herons</b> <b>and</b> egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks <b>and</b> legs. <b>Bitterns</b> {{tend to be}} shorter necked and more secretive.

50|$|The park's narrowness reduces {{its quality}} as {{wildlife}} habitat somewhat. Nevertheless, {{it serves as}} north-south continuous corrider along the St. Croix River, which {{is used as a}} migration route for many birds. Prevalent mammals include beaver, raccoon, river otter, fox, coyote, squirrel, mink, and white-tailed deer. Black bear sightings are on the rise. Ducks, <b>herons,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns</b> frequent the wetlands. Wild River State Park's bird list documents 200 species that can be viewed at different times throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|Flight is slow, {{with the}} neck {{retracted}} and the legs extending {{a long way}} behind the tail. This is characteristic of <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and distinguishes them from storks, cranes and spoonbills, which extend their necks in flight. It is a secretive bird, spending less time {{out in the open}} than the grey heron and tending to skulk in reed beds. Its long toes mean it can walk on floating vegetation, and it sometimes walks over bushes in the same way, not making any attempt to grip the branches. It seldom perches in trees, preferring more terrestrial sites to rest.|$|E

Nine species have been recorded in Tasmania, one of which (the cattle egret) is a recent self-introduction and three others are vagrants.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} local {{marshland}} birds and water birds including the little egret, the little green <b>heron</b> <b>and</b> cinnamon <b>bittern,</b> <b>and</b> migratory birds form Northern Hemisphere have been spotted there. Binoculars {{will come in}} handy for bird watching. The visitors can also enjoy a leisurely walk, jog or cycle along its bicycle track.|$|R
50|$|Of the 100 {{different}} {{bird species}} spotted within the park, the belted kingfisher, pileated woodpecker, red-winged blackbird, great blue <b>heron,</b> <b>and</b> least <b>bittern</b> {{are the most}} commonly seen. A birding checklist {{is available at the}} park office. In addition to the multitude of bird species spotted within the park, there are also a variety of mammals including white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, cottontail rabbits, and muskrats.|$|R
50|$|The <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns</b> are carnivorous. The {{members of}} this family are mostly {{associated}} with wetlands and water, and feed {{on a variety of}} live aquatic prey. Their diet includes a wide variety of aquatic animals, including fish, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, and aquatic insects. Individual species may be generalists or specialise in certain prey types, such as the yellow-crowned night heron, which specialises in crustaceans, particularly crabs. Many species also opportunistically take larger prey, including birds and bird eggs, rodents, and more rarely carrion. Even more rarely, herons eating acorns, peas, and grains have been reported, but most vegetable matter consumed is accidental.|$|E
50|$|The {{grey heron}} has a slow flight, with its long neck {{retracted}} (S-shaped). This {{is characteristic of}} <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, and spoonbills, which extend their necks. It flies with slow wing-beats and sometimes glides for short distances. It sometimes soars, circling to considerable heights, but not as often as the stork. In spring, and occasionally in autumn, birds may soar high above the heronry and chase each other, undertake aerial manoeuvres or swoop down towards the ground. The birds often perch in trees, but spend much time on the ground, striding about or standing still for long periods with an upright stance, often on a single leg.|$|E
50|$|The herons are medium- to large-sized {{birds with}} long legs and necks. They exhibit very little sexual {{dimorphism}} in size. The smallest species is usually considered the little bittern, which can measure under 30 cm in length, although all the {{species in the}} Ixobrychus genus are small and many broadly overlap in size. The largest species of heron is the goliath heron, which stands up to 152 cm tall. The necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the cervical vertebrae, of which they have 20-21. The neck is able to retract and extend, and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The neck is longer in the day herons than the night <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> <b>bitterns.</b> The legs are long and strong and in almost every species are unfeathered from {{the lower part of}} the tibia (the exception is the zigzag heron). In flight, the legs and feet are held backward. The feet of herons have long, thin toes, with three forward-pointing ones and one pointing backward.|$|E
25|$|Marshes, {{wetlands}} {{with water}} stagnation. These may support bullfrogs and spring peepers, spotted salamanders, great blue <b>heron,</b> American <b>bittern,</b> <b>and</b> painted turtles. Pickerel weed often forms large colonies.|$|R
500|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the <b>herons,</b> egrets, <b>and</b> <b>bitterns.</b> <b>Herons</b> <b>and</b> egrets are wading birds with long necks <b>and</b> legs. <b>Herons</b> are large <b>and</b> egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or [...] "cow bird" [...] is seen amongst flocks of cattle, {{for instance in}} ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even {{the head of the}} animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve.|$|R
50|$|During {{spring and}} fall migrations, between 90 and 100,000 {{waterfowl}} {{may be on the}} refuge. Over 100 species of birds have been spotted in the refuge. More than a dozen species of ducks and wading birds have been documented. The most common waterfowl usually seen include the Canada geese, mallards, pintails, blue-winged teal, shovelers, and gadwall. Other bird species that are relatively common include grebe, double-crested cormorant, great blue heron, black-crowned night <b>heron,</b> <b>and</b> American <b>bittern.</b> Other shorebirds such as the plover are also common.Mammals such as white-tailed deer, badger, skunk, beaver, raccoon, mink, muskrat, along with other grassland dwellers such as the exotic ring-necked pheasant, and sharp-tailed grouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} also attract numerous marsh, shore, {{and water}} birds. Sora and Virginia rails are numerous but seldom seen. If they are present, Wilson's phalarope, American avocet, willet, sandpipers, Greater yellowlegs, and dowitchers {{will be easy}} to observe. Other less common species include great blue heron, black-crowned night <b>heron,</b> American <b>bittern,</b> <b>and</b> eared and pied-billed grebe.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} book to deal {{exclusively}} with the Australian members of the Family Ardeidae (<b>herons,</b> egrets <b>and</b> <b>bitterns).</b> It gives a comprehensive, easy-to-read account of their origins, classification and biology, and explains the features that distinguish them from other birds. The book devotes a major chapter to the 14 Australian species, covering their distribution and movements, feeding, breeding, population dynamics and conservation. Some of Australia’s herons have become very scarce in the southern half of the continent and {{are at risk of}} national or local extinction. In northern Australia <b>heron</b> habitats <b>and</b> resources are largely pristine and consequently this region accommodates large numbers of certain species. A final chapter on population and conservation provides a useful summary of the present status of the Australian herons, some of whom are thriving and others who are in a very precarious position.

50|$|The bill is {{generally}} long and harpoon-like. It {{can vary from}} extremely fine, as in the agami heron, to thick as in the grey heron. The most atypical bill {{is owned by the}} boat-billed heron, which has a broad, thick bill. The bill, as well as other bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black, or brown in colour, although this can vary during the breeding season. The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10 or 11 primary feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15-20 secondaries. and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the <b>herons</b> are soft <b>and</b> the plumage is usually blue, black, brown, grey, or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons, little sexual dimorphism in plumage is seen (except in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> smaller <b>bitterns.</b> Many species also have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef <b>heron,</b> both dark <b>and</b> light colour morphs exist, and the percentage of each morph varies geographically. White morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches.|$|R
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, <b>herons</b> <b>and</b> the desolate <b>bitterns</b> have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|R
40|$|The key patch {{approach}} {{assumes that}} metapopulations in fragmented landscapes {{are likely to}} be viable with at least one "key" sub-population that is sufficiently large to ensure re-colonization of surrounding minor habitat patches. It is based on a minimum viable number of breeding pairs and within-breeding season dispersal distance, linked to size of the animal and longevity. It was tested using census data of 15 wetland bird species (bearded tit, bluethroat, great reed warbler, sedge warbler, Savi's warbler, grasshopper warbler, spotted crake, water rail, common snipe, common teal, garganey, little bittern, night <b>heron,</b> great <b>bittern</b> <b>and</b> marsh harrier) in 14 wetland complexes of variable size (3 - 55 k...|$|R
50|$|Arrowwood Wetland Management District {{is located}} in the U.S. state of North Dakota. Arrowwood WMD {{is a part of the}} Arrowwood National Wildlife Refuge Complex, and is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The {{district}} consists of 28 Waterfowl Production Areas, 314 Wetland easements (cooperative arrangements with private landowners), one easement refuge known as Johnson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and another four easements through the Farmers Home Administration, altogether totalling 28,922 acres (117 km2).Arrowwood WMD is in the center of what is known as the prairie - potholes country. When the ice ages ended 15,000 years ago, the weight of the glacial ice had displaced the soil beneath them, creating depressions which later filled up with water into countless lakes and ponds. In the centuries since, migratory birds have come to depend on these wetlands for food and as nesting areas. Over 250 species of birds have been spotted in the refuge. More than a dozen species of ducks and wading birds have been documented. The most common waterfowl usually seen include the Canada geese, mallards, pintails, blue-winged teal, shovelers, and gadwall. Other bird species that are relatively common include grebe, double-crested cormorant, great blue heron, black-crowned night <b>heron,</b> <b>and</b> American <b>bittern.</b> Other shorebirds such as the plover are also common.|$|R
6000|$|No {{domain of}} nature is quite closed to man at all times, {{and now we}} draw near to the empire of the fishes. Our feet glide swiftly over unfathomed depths, where in summer our line tempted the pout and perch, and where the stately {{pickerel}} lurked in the long corridors formed by the bulrushes. The deep, impenetrable marsh, where the <b>heron</b> waded, <b>and</b> <b>bittern</b> squatted, is made pervious to our swift shoes, as if a thousand railroads had been made into it. With one impulse we are carried to the cabin of the musk-rat, that earliest settler, and see him dart away under the transparent ice, like a furred fish, to his hole in the bank; and we glide rapidly over meadows where lately [...] "the mower whet his scythe," [...] through beds of frozen cranberries mixed with meadow grass. We skate near to where the blackbird, the pewee, and the kingbird hung their nests over the water, and the hornets builded from the maple in the swamp. How many gay warblers following the sun, have radiated from this nest of silver-birch and thistledown. On the swamp's outer edge was hung the supermarine village, where no foot penetrated. In this hollow tree the wood-duck reared her brood, and slid away each day to forage in yonder fen.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of birds in the lake shores: ducks, like the red-crested pochard, common pochard, mallard and tufted duck, as well as the Eurasian coot, common moorhen, great reed warbler, bearded reedling, purple <b>heron,</b> little <b>bittern</b> <b>and</b> egrets.In the waters of the lakes there are also endemic Iberian fishes like the Rutilus lemmingii, Luciobarbus guiraonis, Iberian barbel, Luciobarbus microcephalus, Squalius pyrenaicus, as well as {{introduced}} species, like the common carp, northern pike, largemouth bass and Gambusia holbrooki.
