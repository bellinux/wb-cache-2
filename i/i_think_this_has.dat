2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E

60|$|Another {{striking}} {{quality in}} Hamlet's nature is his perpetual inclination to irony. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been generally passed over too lightly, {{as if it}} were something external and accidental, rather assumed as a mask than part of the real nature of the man. It seems to me to go deeper, to be something innate, and not merely factitious. It is nothing like the grave irony of Socrates, which was the weapon of a man thoroughly in earnest,--the boomerang of argument, which one throws in the opposite direction of what he means to hit, and which seems to be flying away from the adversary, who will presently find himself knocked down by it. It is not like the irony of Timon, which is but the wilful refraction of a clear mind twisting awry whatever enters it,--or of Iago, which is the slime that a nature essentially evil loves to trail over all beauty and goodness to taint them with distrust: it is the half-jest, half-earnest of an inactive temperament that has not quite made up its mind whether life is a reality or no, whether men were not made in jest, and which amuses itself equally with finding a deep meaning in trivial things and a trifling one in the profoundest mysteries of being, because the want of earnestness in its own essence infects everything else with its own indifference. If there be now and then an unmannerly rudeness and bitterness in it, as in the scenes with Polonius and Osrick, we must remember that Hamlet was just in the condition which spurs men to sallies of this kind: dissatisfied, at one neither with the world nor with himself, and accordingly casting about for something out of himself to vent his spleen upon. But even in these passages there is no hint of earnestness, of any purpose beyond the moment; they are mere cat's-paws of vexation, and not the deep-raking ground-swell of passion, as we see it in the sarcasm of Lear.|$|E
50|$|While not {{inclined}} to openly criticise other artists, Logsdail did, in his memoirs, relate a story concerning Walter Sickert. As he worked on his Ponte della Paglia (1898), Sickert arrived and set up his easel nearby. He then 'began to caper like a master of fence, backing and lunging with sudden stabs at his canvas'. An American passing by noticed {{a button on the}} pavement, retrieved it and, offering it to Sickert, said, 'Excuse me, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> worked loose!'.|$|E

5000|$|Outgoing President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, 85, {{was asked}} to run for another mandate by the centre-right House of Freedoms, with the strong support of the centre-left Union. However, Ciampi {{declined}} to run again, noting that [...] "none of the past nine presidents of the Republic has been re-elected. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> become a meaningful rule.

5000|$|The series, {{including}} its title, {{is inspired by}} Iceland's tourism boom, following the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull. Actor Atli Bollason discussed the premise in an interview: But these are interesting times in Reykjavík because the outsider’s gaze has never been as prominent as it is right now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{a profound effect on}} not only how we perceive ourselves but how we behave as well.

500|$|The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long-planned; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had {{approached}} series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{for a film}} based on the show, but he refused {{for more than a}} year. Hillenburg was concerned, after watching The Iron Giant and Toy Story with his sons, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically-consequential and inspiring without losing what he calls the SpongeBob [...] "cadence." [...] He said, on a break from season-four post-production, [...] "To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>This</b> <b>had</b> to be SpongeBob in a great adventure.

5000|$|On September 10, 2008, Evo Morales {{declared}} the US Ambassador to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, persona non grata—the eighth U.S. ambassador to be declared so, which was quickly {{followed by the}} ninth. Goldberg said of the decision that [...] "I regret that the Bolivian government took this decision. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> set back U.S.-Bolivian relations." [...] Morales had accused him of conspiring with the opposition after Goldberg was caught on film leaving the office of opposition prefect Rubén Costas following a secret meeting {{in the early hours}} of the morning. [...] The U.S. reciprocated by expelling the Bolivian ambassador in Washington. Tensions grew further when Bolivia refused permission for planes from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to fly over Bolivian territory. Morales said: [...] "It's important that the international community knows that here, we don't need control of the United States on coca cultivation... We can control ourselves internally. We don't need any spying from anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon after that,--within {{a day or}} two,--there {{came out}} a {{paragraph}} {{in one of the}} fashionable newspapers of the day, saying that an alliance had been arranged between the heir to the Wharton title and property and the daughter of the present baronet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> probably originated in the club gossip.

5000|$|Although {{some of the}} {{recordings}} took place in London, most of the song's recording was conducted in Record Plant studios in Los Angeles, where for example Nathan East's bass parts were mixed and recorded. East also notes, the recording sessions were very busy, because many international successful artists {{wanted to work with}} Babyface at the time, however, the pop producer put Clapton and [...] "Change the World" [...] first. In 2013, Clapton explained his take on the song in an interview with MOJO magazine: [...] "When I heard Tommy Sims' demo, I could hear Paul McCartney doing that, so I needed to, with greatest respect to Paul, take that and put it somewhere black. So I asked Babyface who, even though he may not be aware of it, gave it the blues thing. The first two lines I play on that song on the acoustic guitar are lines I quote wherever I can and they come from the beginning of [...] "Mannish Boy" [...] by Muddy Waters. On every record I make where <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> got a chance of doing well, I make sure I pay my dues on this. So I think I've found a way to do it, but it has to have one foot in the blues, even if its subtly disguised". While journalists from MusicTunes were in conversation with the single's producer Babyface, the American R&B artist recalled: [...] "It was a real pleasure working in the studio with Eric Clapton" [...] and added, that Clapton's [...] "music is legendary and he is truly one of the entertainment industry's musical geniuses".|$|E
5000|$|... "The first {{corners of}} my last lap went smoothly, {{but then there}} were several cars driving very slowly on their in-laps. Apparently they had no {{information}} that the qualifying was still going on. Before Turn Four I {{lost a lot of}} time because both McLarens were cruising on the racing line. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> cost me about two tenths of a second, which would have meant being third instead of seventh. I just couldn't drive on the line I wanted and, even more importantly, could not brake were I wanted." [...] Nick Heidfeld, on the McLaren drivers' antics. In qualifying, Massa earned his tenth career pole position, after recording a lap of 1:35.748 during the third and final session. He was joined on the front row by teammate Räikkönen, although the Finn's fastest time was more than half a second slower than that of Massa. Third and fourth had originally gone to the McLarens of Kovalainen and Hamilton, however post-qualifying, both drivers were demoted five places on the grid for dangerous driving; having completed their flying laps, the McLaren pair and other drivers slowed to conserve fuel on their in-laps, and impeded Nick Heidfeld of BMW Sauber and Fernando Alonso of Renault whilst they were both on flying laps. This led to a new rule being introduced for Bahrain giving drivers a set time to complete in-laps in. McLaren's misfortune was to the gain of the Toyota of Trulli, both victims of the impeding (Heidfeld and Alonso), Heidfeld's teammate Kubica and Webber's Red Bull machine. Timo Glock rounded out the top ten in his Toyota.|$|E

500|$|In 1937, {{a justice}} of the New York State Supreme Court freed a {{prisoner}} who {{had been arrested for}} parole violation and beaten by Broderick, saying that [...] "the police of the City of New York beat him so badly that he will be a cripple for life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> man <b>has</b> more than expiated his crime."

5000|$|Mitzeee {{struggles in}} prison {{as she is}} tormented by other prisoners and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is later {{transferred}} to Mitzeee's prison. Myra is convinced that Mitzeee stabbed her daughter and uses this opportunity to get revenge. Shenton told All About Soap: [...] "I think at that point Mitzeee just wonders if things could get any worse for her. She's already having a really rough time, and then Myra shows up. It's a very calculated decision on Myra's part to get moved to the same jail. Myra will battle tooth and nail for her daughter, {{and you can just}} imagine the fighting spirit she has. There's a lot of serious verbal scrapping between Myra and Mitzeee, which in some ways is worse than a punch-up." [...] Shenton also said that Riley is not as supportive as Mitzeee would like him to be as he is dealing with his own problems back in the village. She added that it's devastating for Mitzeee as she is madly in love with Riley and hopes that he will have a change of heart. Shenton said in September 2012 that Mitzeee will play a big role in the fifth series of Hollyoaks Later. Speaking to Inside Soap, Shenton revealed [...] "So many horrible things have happened to Mitzeee - she's so far removed from the girl she was six months ago. This whole chain of events sends her into an even deeper depression. Her mum comes to visit her in jail, and that's the first point viewers will see something's really not quite right with Mitzeee now." [...] She later added that Mitzeee's recent experiences will [...] "change her for the good" [...] and she will come out fighting. Shenton said that all of the latest trouble's in Mitzeee's life has ruled out any possibility of returning to her [...] "glamour past" [...] and that being framed for attempted murder has [...] "hardened her". Speaking to a Daily Star reporter, Shenton said that [...] "When she first arrived a year ago, she was this ditzy glamour model with big hair. Now you've seen a different side to her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> changed her forever. I'd like to see her go back to a version of herself but I don't think you can ever go right back when something like this has happened." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the notion of habit as an {{instance}} of Thirdness in Peirce’s work, {{it is necessary to}} go back to the intuitions at the basis of Peirce’s categories, trying to spell out concretely, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not been done before, the meaning of the three categories. This involves entangling the notions of fallibilism and of the collaborative work of the community of scholars, which may not have been taken seriously by most scholars pursuing the Peircean tradition. It is suggested that Peirce’s phenomenology is a version of Husserl’s phenomenology imposing a lot of constraints on the variation in imagination. In order to make sense of habit as Thirdness, we have to extend Peircean phenomenology into Husserlean phenomenology, abandoning the language of degeneracy, which is not very enlightening. Important contributions to the study of habit has also been made by several sociologists and psychologists...|$|E
