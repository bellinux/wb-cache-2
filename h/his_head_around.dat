5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|On {{the side}} of the Juarez Theater, there is the Rincon del Arte. Next to this is a cable car that rises up to the Pípila Monument on San Miguel Hill. The {{monument}} honors the insurgent who managed to torch the main entrance of the Alhondiga de Granaditas. The monument consists of a giant statue of Pipila raising a torch over <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Around</b> the monument, there is an esplanade and overlook with permits a panoramic view of nearly the entire city.|$|E
25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a one-car accident that caused him to bump <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can {{figure out what is}} going on, there remains the question of how much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles Emerson Winchester III (David Ogden Stiers) {{was brought}} in as an {{antagonist}} of sorts to the other surgeons, but his relationship with them was not as acrimonious, although he was a more able foil. Unlike Frank Burns, Winchester did not care for the Army. His resentment stemmed, in part, {{from the fact that}} he was transferred from Tokyo General Hospital to the 4077th due, in part, to a cribbage debt owed to him by his commanding officer, Lt. Col. Horace Baldwin. What set him apart from Burns as an antagonist for Hawkeye and B.J. was that Winchester was clearly an excellent, technically superior surgeon, although his work sometimes suffered from his excessive perfectionism when rapid [...] "meatball surgery" [...] was called for. As with many new MASH surgeons, Winchester took some time to wrap <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> the fact that faster, less precise work saved lives that more elegant, slower work might cost.|$|E
2500|$|Ghazan Khan's {{conversion}} to Islam in 1295 heralded for Persian Jews a pronounced {{turn for the}} worse, as they were once again relegated {{to the status of}} dhimmis. Öljeitü, Ghazan Khan's successor, [...] pressured some Jews to convert to Islam. The most famous such convert was Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, a physician, historian and statesman, who adopted Islam in order to advance his career at Öljeitü's court. However, in 1318 he was executed on fake charges of poisoning Öljeitü and for several days crowds carried <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> his native city of Tabriz, chanting [...] "This {{is the head of the}} Jew who abused the name of God; may God's curse be upon him!" [...] About 100 years later, Miranshah destroyed Rashid al-Din's tomb, and his remains were reburied at the Jewish cemetery. Rashid al-Din's case illustrates a pattern that differentiated the treatment of Jewish converts in Persia from their treatment in most other Muslim lands, where converts were welcomed and easily assimilated into the Muslim population. In Persia, however, Jewish converts were usually stigmatized on account of their Jewish ancestry for many generations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you would, would you?" [...] demanded her father, {{delighted with}} her defiance, and {{twisting}} <b>his</b> fat <b>head</b> <b>around</b> over <b>his</b> shoulder {{to look at}} her. [...] "Well, you wouldn't do it on my money, {{if you were a}} son of MINE, young lady." ...|$|R

2500|$|Qs Tom Doyle {{hailed the}} album, saying, [...] "These 10 {{magnificent}} songs see the singer and lyricist {{trying to get}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> life, death, love, the universe and what he calls 'the mysteries of the human heart'... Always musically sure-footed and prog-minded – less, of course, in terms of never-ending solos; more {{in the sense that}} you never know what's up next sonically – here Elbow stretch themselves musically without tearing up their original blueprint... Topping even The Seldom Seen Kid, The Take Off... is the perfect expression yet of everything that is Elbow. As their best album to date, it will lift yor heart and fill your soul." [...] Referring to the group's concert at Jodrell Bank in 2012, Mojos Victoria Segal noted, [...] "You don't need the world's largest radio telescope to pick up the issues of mortality and make-or-break change pulsing through the record... Plotting their course through these highs and lows – those take-offs and landings – Elbow are no clearer than anyone else about how they will reach the final destination. By sharing that uncertainty and navigating by what little light there is, artistically, at least, they never lose their way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Against {{the protests}} {{of the three}} women, the {{officers}} simply covered Sinthasomphone with a towel and walked him to Dahmer's apartment where, {{in an effort to}} verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. The officers later reported having noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment (this odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes). Dahmer stated that to investigate this, one officer simply [...] "peeked <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." [...] The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer [...] "take good care" [...] of Sinthasomphone. Had they conducted a background check upon Dahmer, it would have revealed that he was a convicted child molester under probation. Upon the departure of the two police officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain; on this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes, whose decomposing body had been lying in his bedroom as police brought Sinthasomphone back to his apartment. He retained both victims' skulls.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} season, Rypien {{made the}} Canucks' line-up out {{of training camp}} {{for the first time}} in his career. After scoring two goals in the first five games in 2008–09, he suffered a sports hernia on October 19, 2008. Upon recovering, he was granted an indefinite leave of absence for personal reasons. The Canucks organization alluded to Rypien's history of injuries as the main reason for him not returning to the team. Assistant general manager Lorne Henning stated that [...] "It's just wearing on him now - it's frustrating for him. He just has to deal with the injuries … and wrap <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> it." [...] It was later made known, following his death, that Rypien was struggling with clinical depression. He returned after a 70-game absence on March 31, 2009, in a contest against the Minnesota Wild. He appeared in 12 games for the Canucks in 2008–09, recording three goals and no assists. The season marked Vancouver's return to the playoffs after failing to qualify the previous season. After eliminating the St. Louis Blues in the first round, they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks. Rypien appeared in all ten Canucks playoff games and recorded two points (both assists) while playing on the fourth-line alongside Darcy Hordichuk and Ryan Johnson. He recorded his first playoff point in Game 4 of the second round against Chicago, assisting on a Hordichuk goal with a spin-o-rama pass.|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes, must,” {{repeated}} the youth; when, turning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> proudly <b>around</b> him, {{as if to}} see who would dare to controvert his rights, he met the astonished gaze of Elizabeth, and proceeded more mildly: “That is, if a man is allowed the possession of that which his hand hath killed. and the law will protect him in the enjoyment of his own.” ...|$|R
60|$|Joe saw the Indian guard {{leaning against}} a tree, asleep. Silvertip was gone. The captive raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looked <b>around</b> for the chief. There were only four Indians left, three {{on the ground and}} one against the tree.|$|R

60|$|The ungovernable {{feeling that}} caused the {{violence}} of the youth had passed away, and he stood gazing after the retiring figure of Marmaduke, with a vacancy in his eye that denoted the absence of his mind. At length he recollected himself, and, turning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>around</b> the apartment, he beheld Elizabeth, still seated on the sofa, but with her head dropped on her bosom, and her face again concealed by her hands.|$|R
60|$|Another awkward one was Jack Pumpkinhead, {{for walking}} would jar <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> {{on his neck}} {{and then he would}} be likely to go in the wrong direction. But the Frogman took Jack's arm and then he {{followed}} the path more easily.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he stopped}} {{nibbling}} {{all of a}} sudden, {{as if he had}} just thought of something, and as soon as he remembered what it was, he twisted <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> and began to scratch one of his long ears with his hind foot. He looked so funny doing this that Kate came near laughing but, fortunately, she remembered that that would not do just then.|$|E
5000|$|The moniker [...] "Chili" [...] {{comes from}} Davis' childhood, {{when his father}} gave him a {{particularly}} poor bowl cut.

60|$|The two men separated. The Bishop walked thoughtfully {{towards the}} Strand, his hands clasped behind his back, {{the echo of}} those quoted words of his still in his ear. As {{he came to the}} busy crossing, he raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looked <b>around</b> him.|$|R
60|$|There was no reply, {{but in a}} {{twinkling}} {{his hands}} were caught and bound tightly behind him, and a bag was thrust over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and fastened <b>around</b> <b>his</b> throat. The bag was so thick {{that he could not}} see a thing before him.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} as well that he did, for as he thrust <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> the corner of the {{building}} the first thing that his eyes fell upon was the figure of an Austrian sentry, scarcely three paces from him. The soldier was standing in a listening attitude, his head half turned away from the American. The sounds coming {{from the direction of the}} inn were apparently what had attracted his attention.|$|E
60|$|He slid <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around</b> {{a corner}} of rock, where began an unusually large bend in the stream, and his quick eyes made out {{something}} that sent him crouching swiftly down. It was the maker of the track, a large female lynx. She was crouching as he had crouched once that day, {{in front of her}} the tight-rolled ball of quills. If he had been a gliding shadow before, he now became the ghost of such a shadow, as he crept and circled around, and came up well to leeward of the silent, motionless pair.|$|E
60|$|And {{now that}} we had Wolf Larsen in irons, how little did we need it! Like his first attack, his second had been {{accompanied}} by serious disablement. Maud made the discovery in the afternoon while trying to give him nourishment. He had shown signs of consciousness, and she had spoken to him, eliciting no response. He was lying on his left side at the time, and in evident pain. With a restless movement he rolled <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>around,</b> clearing his left ear from the pillow against which it had been pressed. At once he heard and answered her, and at once she came to me.|$|E
60|$|As Dave {{leaned down}} to give Poole his hand, {{the door of the}} barn was flung open and a farmer strode in, a lantern {{in one hand and a}} stout stick in the other. The man held the light over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looked <b>around</b> suspiciously.|$|R
50|$|Ravanelli's {{signature}} celebration when {{scoring a}} goal involved pulling his shirt over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and running <b>around</b> the field.
