5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who <b>headed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's {{opinion on}} what {{system would be}} best to {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{new unit}} was a {{stronger}} console than originally proposed, {{it was not}} compatible with Saturn games.

Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it [...] "a coder's dream for the day" [...] with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.
