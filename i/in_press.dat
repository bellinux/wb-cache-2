5|$|Eriksson's {{private life}} came under scrutiny, with an number of well-publicised accusations of trysts with women {{including}} Ulrika Jonsson, and FA secretary Faria Alam, despite his on-going relationship with Nancy Dell'Olio.

5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws.

5|$|The inaugural {{edition of}} the Echo was printed <b>in</b> <b>Press</b> Lane, Sunderland on 22 December 1873; 1,000 copies were {{produced}} and sold for a halfpenny each. The Echo survived intense competition in its early years, {{as well as the}} depression of the 1930s and two World Wars. Sunderland was heavily bombed in the Second World War and, although the Echo building was undamaged, it was forced to print its competitor's paper under wartime rules. It was during this time that the paper's format changed, from a broadsheet to its current tabloid layout, because of national newsprint shortages.|$|E
5|$|The Capcom Five {{announcement}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2. These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics. Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube. This lone GameCube exclusive was P.N.03 and not Resident Evil 4, as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized <b>in</b> <b>press</b> releases. GameCube owners and Nintendo fans were disappointed by the Capcom Five's failure to improve the GameCube's reputation and sales. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku noted that despite best intentions, Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's console wars. The dramatic reversal of the five is representative of the attitudes of third-party developers toward Nintendo's platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} okapi is Okapia johnstoni. It was first described as Equus johnstoni by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name Okapia derives from the Lese Karo name o'api, while the specific name (johnstoni) is {{in recognition of the}} British Governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the Ituri Forest while repatriating a group of Pygmies to the Belgian Congo. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found <b>in</b> <b>press</b> reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887. Remains of a carcass were later sent to London by the English adventurer and colonial administrator Harry Johnston and became a media event in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a {{professional}} footballer and for years afterwards, Ramsey claimed to be two years younger than he really was — including in his ghosted autobiography, Talking Football, published in 1952. This began when Ramsey first turned professional with Southampton during the Second World War. He told Southampton he was born in 1922 rather than 1920, reasoning that this might improve his career prospects and compensate for the years he had lost to the hostilities. He propagated this false age for over two decades, <b>in</b> <b>press</b> articles, his autobiography and Who's Who — but not on official documents such as his marriage papers, in which he listed his true date of birth. Only after his knighthood in 1967 did Ramsey reveal his true age, deciding that he could not lie to Debrett's, publisher of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage.|$|E
