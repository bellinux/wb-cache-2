5|$|The male {{actors were}} asked to grow their hair and moustaches. The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters. The costumes had a faded look, a {{reflection}} that people of the period owned few clothes, often only two outfits. None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before {{of what they were}} to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> daily scenes. The Romani were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie, and were only told that the story was set in hard times comparable to Ceaușescu's tenure in Romania. In the scene where the Romani revolt against the police over the death of Taloche, they were made aware of the character's death only when the scene was being shot, leading to a genuine outpouring of emotions, making their fight with the police appear more real. Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt by the Romani in Auschwitz on May 16, 1944.|$|E

25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for things to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Christopher P. Earley {{hypothesized}} that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that {{focused more on}} achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted {{a study in the}} United States and China, two polar opposites in terms of culture (with the U.S. being individualistic and China being collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two types of cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes for each item, and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. Each participant was given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low shared responsibility groups.|$|E

He also said he was angry at being unable to live at Ickworth, as the remaining lease had been sold to the National Trust. His half-sister Victoria shared similar sentiments, and stated that she has avoided drugs {{as a result of}} her relationship with John.

500|$|As Lauret indicates, Angelou {{and other}} female {{writers in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s used {{autobiography}} to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African-American fiction and autobiography, meaning that Angelou {{was one of the}} first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, [...] "a powerful and authentic signification of [...] womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair". Lauret sees a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls [...] "fictions of subjectivity" [...] and [...] "feminist first-person narratives", and fictional first-person narratives (such as The Women's Room by Marilyn French and The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing) written during the same period. [...] As French and Lessing <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> novels, Angelou employs the narrator as protagonist and depends upon [...] "the illusion of presence in their mode of signification".|$|E
500|$|Writing in Still the Greatest: The Essential Solo Beatles Songs, Andrew Grant Jackson {{considers}} that with [...] "Give Me Love", Harrison [...] "captured {{the essence of}} what he had set out to do with the [...] concerts – and what the Beatles had tried to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> more idealistic moments". Describing it as Harrison's [...] "finest plea to God", with a vocal that [...] "perfectly suits the yearning" [...] implicit in the lyrics, Jackson adds: [...] "'Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)' stands alongside 'All You Need Is Love,' 'Let It Be,' and 'Imagine' as the purest expression of the Aquarian Age dream." [...] In his Harrison obituary for The Guardian in December 2001, former Melody Maker critic Chris Welch concluded with a reference to the track, saying that the ex-Beatle's [...] "feelings and needs were best expressed in one of his simplest songs – 'Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)'".|$|E

[...] Sal Basile of UGO Networks wrote, [...] "How anyone can make Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation likable is beyond us, but Offerman does it effortlessly. Before we knew it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron {{at the start of}} the show, and called him [...] "a bit of the dud (who) offers little to the show, and almost just stand to sour the whole thing." [...] However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became [...] "an absolute stand-out in the series." [...] Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he did not}} {{campaign}} or advertise, Perot won a {{large share}} of the vote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries in Oregon and Washington in mid-May. In the Oregon primary, he was written-in by 13% of Democrats and 15% of Republicans. Exit polling showed Perot's favorability at or above that of Clinton and Bush in their respective party's primaries. At the end of May, Perot called on Bush to [...] "climb in the ring", claiming that the President was using surrogates to attack him. To strengthen his own team, Perot's campaign interviewed Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign manager and White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan and [...] Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign manager Ed Rollins to fill a position in the campaign. Eventually, both were hired as co-campaign managers. On May 29, Perot ended his talk show hiatus after talking with Barbara Walters on 20/20. He discussed his three-part plan for balancing the budget, starting with a Congressional act to limit spending, followed by a cut in government waste, of which he would be more specific in coming weeks, and a reform of the existing tax system. During the interview, Perot also stated that he would avoid adding homosexuals to his cabinet to prevent [...] "a point of controversy with the American people". However, he commented that [...] "what people <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> private lives is their business." ...|$|E
