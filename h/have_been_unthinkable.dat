5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E
25|$|She ruled {{at a time}} of {{political}} uncertainty, {{which is one of the}} possible explanations for why Assyrians may have accepted her rule (as normally a woman as ruler would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable).</b> In the city of Ashur, she had an obelisk built and inscribed, which read:Stele of Sammuramat, queen of Shamshi-Adad, King of the Universe, King of Assyria, Mother of Adad Nirari, King of the Universe, King of Assyria, Daughter-in-Law of Shalmaneser, King of the Four Regions of the World.Her son was King Adad-nirari III and her grandson was King Shalmaneser IV.|$|E
25|$|The Saint {{starring}} Val Kilmer {{was made}} in 1997 but diverged far from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; this would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even the main villains live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had no qualms about taking another life. Kilmer's Saint {{is presented as a}} master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Sir Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.|$|E

50|$|The {{death of}} Gwen Stacy shocked the American comic book community. Previously, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> to kill off such an {{important}} character—the girlfriend of a title character with a large fanbase. Generally, a superhero did not fail this disastrously unless {{it was part of}} his or her origin story.

25|$|In 1963, O'Neill succeeded Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. He {{introduced}} {{new policies}} that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> with Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism {{and to bring}} Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland. O'Neill seemed to strongly believe in industrialisation and modernisation. However {{it is clear that}} he was in some ways trying to prevent the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) from gaining ground. Northern Ireland was influenced by British politics so the arrival of Harold Wilson in Downing Street meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O'Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted {{at the outset}} of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the blue of the sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of primary color—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several deciduous woody plants of the genus Populus. Though native to many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (la banlieue ouest) where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, Courbevoie. The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887. Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Of course, such a scene of naked bathers would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.|$|E
500|$|During {{the search}} for a {{suitable}} conductor, Disney and Walt Disney Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher invited Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine and manager Peter Gelb to a meeting in September 1991. Disney recalled: [...] "I asked James what his thought was on a three minute version of Beethoven's fifth symphony. He paused and went 'I think the right three minutes would be beautiful'". In November 1992, Disney, Schumacher, Levine, Gelb, and Butoy met in Vienna to discuss a collection of story reels developed, one of them being Pines of Rome, which Levine took an immediate liking to. Butoy described Levine's enthusiasm toward the film as [...] "like a kid in a candy store". Because Katzenberg continued to express some hostility towards the film, Disney held development meetings without him and reported directly to Eisner instead, something that author James B. Stewart wrote [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> on any other future animation project." ...|$|E
5000|$|This couplet {{testifies to}} a social revolution: Homer's poetry was a {{powerful}} influence on later poets and yet in Homer's day it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> for a poet to be a warrior. Archilochus deliberately broke the traditional mould even while adapting himself to it. [...] "Perhaps {{there is a special}} relevance to his times in the particular gestures he elects to make: the abandonment of grandly heroic attitudes in favour of a new unsentimental honesty, an iconoclastic and flippant tone of voice coupled with deep awareness of traditional truths." ...|$|R
50|$|After the {{publication}} of Humanae vitae in 1968, several problems emerged {{with the notion of}} collegiality promoted in the document. The fact that several episcopal conferences would openly rebel against the Pope <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> during the papacy of Pius XII. Prominent members in the Roman Curia deplored the fact that conference leaders appeared to behave as if they were regional popes. This complaint is notably found in the 1985 Ratzinger Report, a series of interviews where Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger deplores the lack of structure, organization and coordination between Rome and the local assemblies of Catholic bishops.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} the State, Javier Roiz proposes that the rhetoric which provided contingency in public life <b>had</b> to <b>be</b> neutralized. From this emerged a dialectic without rhetoric - something that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> until then. Once the inventio of rhetoric <b>had</b> <b>been</b> transferred to dialectics, the idea of knowing as a dialectic activity established itself in Europe. This approach was already prevalent in medieval colleges and schools due to the methodological imposition of the scholastic ars disputatrix in the 13th century. Rhetoric could then be identified with a mere adornment of discourse (ornatus) or with techniques for deception or seduction (ars fallendi).|$|R
500|$|Male {{survivors}} of the massacre {{have been subjected to}} criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they [...] "abandoned" [...] the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women. [...] René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Confederacy's {{military}} fortunes flagged, {{there was}} increasing consideration {{of what would}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in 1861—enlisting male slaves {{in the army and}} emancipating them for their service. In August 1863, B. H. Micou, a relative of a former law partner, wrote to Benjamin proposing the use of black soldiers. Benjamin responded that this was not feasible, principally for legal and financial reasons, and that the slaves were performing valuable services for the Confederacy where they were. According to Meade, [...] "Benjamin did not offer any objections to Micou's plan except on practical grounds—he was not repelled by the radical nature of the proposal". A British financial agent for the Confederacy, James Spence, also urged emancipation as a means of gaining British recognition. [...] Benjamin allowed Spence to remain in his position for almost a year despite the differences with Confederate policy, before finally dismissing him in late 1863. Despite official neutrality, tens of thousands from British-ruled Ireland were enlisting in the Union cause; Benjamin sent an agent to Ireland hoping to impede those efforts and Dudley Mann to Rome to urge Pope Pius IX to forbid Catholic Irish from enlisting. [...] The Pope did not do so, though he responded sympathetically.|$|E
500|$|For reasons {{including}} expected hostilities with Japan, requiring travel {{across the}} Pacific Ocean, long operational range was a recurrent theme in all US battleship designs. [...] As an experiment, these ships received different powerplants. Delaware received triple-expansion reciprocating engines, while North Dakota was fitted with Curtiss direct drive steam turbine engines. Both ships had 14 Babcock & Wilcox boilers, both original power plants were rated at and both ships {{were capable of}} reaching 21 knots. Chief Constructor Washington L. Capps predicted North Dakota would have a 25 percent shorter radius than Delaware at 16 knots and 45 percent less at 14 knots, based on tank tests and the known performance of steam turbines at that time. This estimate was proved true during the ships' trial runs in 1909. Also, because Delawares engine bearings were equipped with forced lubrication instead of a gravity-fed system, {{she was able to}} steam at full speed for 24 hours without any need for engine repair. This would normally <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> as reciprocating engines were known generally to shake themselves apart if run at full power for long. However, this penchant for reliability came under question in the late 1930s as battleships with reciprocating engines performed poorly in the Pacific. By 1915, more powerful and efficient geared turbines had been installed in North Dakota to replace her Curtiss turbines. [...] These provided [...] horsepower, some [...] greater than her original engines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) probably plays a greater {{part in the}} aerodynamic design of turbomachinery than it does in any other engineering application. For many years {{the design of a}} modern turbine or compressor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the flow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The benefits of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail...|$|R

40|$|Investigative journalism {{that aims}} to prise out {{information}} that the state or certain businesses want to keep undisclosed <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> under many postcolonial African regimes. However, since the promulgation of democratic constitutions, a generation of ambitious investigative journalists has grown up in Africa. In order to show how journalism has changed, the paper brings Anas Aremeyaw Anas’s activities into focus. Anas’s single-minded mission to bring justice has targeted organisations involved in human trafficking, smuggling, and forced labour in West African countries since 2010. Although his team’s way of gathering information raises moral concerns about undercover journalism, their efforts illustrate that human trafficking is widespread among the countries of West and Central Africa. Therefore, the author suggests that both the AU and ECOWAS must create a more stable legal environment for investigative journalists, as their reports can help these institutions and national governments protect human rights...|$|R

David Winner, the author of , wrote about Cruyff's {{influential}} career in the football world, [...] "There have been lots of brilliant football figures down the years, but none has been as significant as Johan Cruyff. As a player with Ajax, Barcelona and the Netherlands, he put himself in the pantheon along with greats such as Pelé, Diego Maradona, Ferenc Puskás, Lionel Messi and Zinedine Zidane. As coach at Ajax and Barcelona, he built thrilling sides, nurtured a remarkable number of genius players and influenced {{many of the most}} important teams in the world.

2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{advancement}} Andrews achieved {{in her career}} as a writer, textbook author, and teacher would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> {{had it not been for}} the collapse of her beloved antebellum estate in Washington, Georgia. The question then becomes whether she was motivated to advance her career and assert her independence out of want or need. A good illustration of her often contradictory nature was her desire to remain unmarried for life. This is apparent in her first novel A Family Secret (1876) which creates a vivid image of the role of women in the post war South. She remarks upon the misery inherent in marrying for money and writes at one point [...] "Oh, the slavery it is to be a woman and not a fool." [...] At the same time, Andrews believed that the domestic wife and mother was the only acceptable role for women in Southern society, and she considered teaching [...] "a mental tread-mill, a dull road traveled over and over requiring only patience." [...] On the surface, her ideas seem to be in direct conflict with her accomplishments as a teacher and scholar, but over time she seems to have become more accepting [...] that she could not rescue her beloved antebellum society. As she observed in the introduction to her Wartime Journal that “In the lifetime of a single generation the people of the South have been called upon to pass through changes that the rest of the world has taken centuries to accomplish” she had been assuming a new role in an era where society was experiencing rapid economic and social changes.|$|E

5|$|For reasons {{related to}} class and race, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> {{before the war}} for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain, but the postwar world saw social and {{political}} changes in the Caribbean. Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain, Headley was appointed {{as one of the}} West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948. Crab Nethersole, the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket, argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached. Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches, played in Barbados and Jamaica, and the white players Gerry Gomez and John Goddard were given the captaincy of the second and third matches. In the event, Headley only played in the first Test. In the first innings, he scored 29 but strained his back while fielding. Batting towards the end of West Indies' second innings, he scored seven not out. Rain helped England to draw the match. Headley's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests, but he was fit enough to play for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test. After the first island game, in which he scored 65, Headley's request to miss the second match to rest his back was refused by the Jamaican Board. He scored 36 not out, but aggravated his back pains and he withdrew from the final Test. West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard, who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test. He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948–49, despite Headley's availability and apparently superior claims to the position.|$|R
