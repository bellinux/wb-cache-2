25|$|The {{state of}} New York, {{which also has}} a civil law history from its Dutch colonial days, began a {{codification}} of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete {{is known as the}} <b>Field</b> <b>Code</b> applying to civil procedure. The original colony of New Netherland was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was recaptured by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique {{in the history of the}} British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the patroon system of land holding, based on the feudal system and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of Roman-Dutch law continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.|$|E

Gise, arrived at Henderson <b>Field</b> (<b>code</b> name [...] "Cactus") on 12 February. The first recorded combat engagement was on 14 February 1943, when Corsairs of VMF-124 under Major Gise assisted P-40s and P-38s in escorting a formation of Consolidated B-24 Liberators on a raid against a Japanese aerodrome at Kahili. Japanese fighters contested the raid and the Americans got the worst of it, with four P-38s, two P-40s, two Corsairs and two Liberators lost. No more than four Japanese Zeros were destroyed. A Corsair was responsible {{for one of the}} kills, albeit due to a midair collision. The fiasco was referred to as the [...] "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre". Despite the debut, the Marines quickly learned how to make better use of the aircraft and started demonstrating its superiority over Japanese fighters. By May, the Corsair units were getting the upper hand, and VMF-124 had produced the first Corsair ace, Second Lieutenant Kenneth A. Walsh, who would rack up a total of 21 kills during the war.

40|$|Shannon’s seminal 1948 work {{gave rise}} to two {{distinct}} areas of research: information theory and mathematical coding theory. While information theory has had a strong influence on theoretical neuroscience, ideas from mathematical coding theory have received considerably less attention. Here we take {{a new look at}} combinatorial neural codes from a mathematical coding theory perspective, examining the error correction capabilities of familiar receptive <b>field</b> <b>codes</b> (RF codes). We find, perhaps surprisingly, that the high levels of redundancy present in these codes do not support accurate error correction, although the error-correcting performance of receptive <b>field</b> <b>codes</b> catches up to that of random comparison codes when a small tolerance to error is introduced. However, receptive <b>field</b> <b>codes</b> are good at reflecting distances between represented stimuli, while the random comparison codes are not. We suggest that a compromise in error correcting capability may be a necessary price to pay for a neural code whose structure serves not only error correction, but must also reflect relationships between stimuli...|$|R
