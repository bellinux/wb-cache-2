50|$|Fast shifting, {{with only}} a single operation. This {{requires}} less skill to learn than techniques like double <b>declutching</b> and it offers faster shifts when racing.|$|E
50|$|The gate gear {{manual gearbox}} {{featured}} four speeds and reverse, controlling {{a coil spring}} clutch acting on the flywheel system. A lever produced both <b>declutching</b> and deceleration together.|$|E
50|$|The new MCT {{transmission}} {{is essentially the}} 7G-Tronic transmission without a torque converter. Instead of a torque converter, it uses a compact wet startup clutch to start the car off, and also supports computer-controlled double <b>declutching.</b> The MCT (Multi-Clutch Technology) acronym refers to a planetary (automatic) transmission’s multiple clutches and bands for each gear.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920 Breguet {{showed a}} [...] "quadrimoteur" [...] made of two Type U-24s coupled together, with {{provision}} to <b>declutch</b> any cylinder bank to {{enable it to}} be stopped while the other three units continued to provide power.|$|R
50|$|In large ships, an {{emergency}} stop button pulls the countershaft for the fuel pumps to the stop position, cutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch propeller, the stop button may <b>declutch</b> the engine from the propeller.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream {{up through the}} rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then <b>declutched</b> prior to executing the take-off run.|$|R
50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic <b>declutching</b> when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|E
50|$|The Meadows engine {{drove the}} tracks though a four-speed gearbox {{to the front}} drive wheels. Steering was a {{combination}} of <b>declutching</b> the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The track was tensioned by a rear idler—which being set at the same height as the drive sprocket was new in British tank designs—and returned over three rollers.|$|E
50|$|These {{control the}} {{transmission}} system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting. Automatic transmissions use controls for their operation, and also many semi-automatic transmissions having a fully automatic clutch or a semi-auto clutch (<b>declutching</b> only). The {{engine control unit}} and the transmission control exchange messages, sensor signals and control signals for their operation.|$|E
50|$|A few cars, {{notably the}} Alfa Romeo Alfetta, Porsche 924, and Chevrolet Corvette (since 1997), sought a more even weight {{distribution}} between {{front and back}} by placing {{the weight of the}} transmission {{at the rear of the}} car, combined with the rear axle to form a transaxle. The clutch was mounted with the transaxle and so the propeller shaft rotated continuously with the engine, even when in neutral gear or <b>declutched.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The now {{ubiquitous}} constant-mesh gearboxes, {{which can}} include non-synchronised, or synchronized/synchromesh systems, where typically diagonal cut helical (or sometimes either straight-cut, or double-helical) gear sets are constantly [...] "meshed" [...] together, {{and a dog}} clutch is used for changing gears. On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or [...] "synchro-rings" [...] are used {{in addition to the}} dog clutch to closely match the rotational speeds of {{the two sides of the}} (<b>declutched)</b> transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.|$|R
5000|$|... "I used to {{love the}} old cars," [...] {{explained}} Robert Hardy. [...] "Except when they gave up. They were always giving up. We had a permanent mechanic up there {{and he was always}} deep inside the bonnet of this or that car. But I had some nice cars to drive, and when they worked they were great fun. And, of course, I was old enough to remember how to double <b>declutch</b> and all that sort of thing, so they weren't a shock to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... (TMS) which {{contains}} two ECU's the {{transmission control unit}} (TECU) and the gear selector control unit (GECU). I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching engine rpm to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct engine rpm so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar to double <b>declutching.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the MG, the 15/50 engine {{had only}} a single SU {{carburettor}} so the power output was slightly less at [...] at 4400 rpm. Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a [...] "Manumatic" [...] two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a vacuum servo. Having no synchromesh on bottom gear could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require double <b>declutching,</b> difficult.|$|E
50|$|In {{a gearbox}} with neutral between gears, a typical shift {{actually}} involves two gear changes, once into neutral, and {{again into the}} next gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the engine and transmission of the force from the opposing components. Using the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is double (<b>de)clutching.</b> Due {{to the absence of}} a neutral spacing, double clutching is ill-advised for sequential gear changes, as in a fully sequential gearbox such as a typical motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then <b>declutched.</b> The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled drag hinges with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to {{leap into the}} air. With all the engine power now applied to the forward thrusting propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.|$|R
5000|$|Neither Bugatti's U-16 or the King-Bugatti were {{particularly}} successful engines. Few were installed in aircraft, {{and even fewer}} actually flew. After World War I no further developments {{were made in the}} US, while in France Breguet took over the license and continued development under the designation [...] "Type U-24". In 1920 Breguet showed a [...] "quadrimoteur" [...] made of two Type U-24s coupled together, with provision to <b>declutch</b> any cylinder bank to enable it to be stopped while the other three units continued to provide power.|$|R
5000|$|Pulse and Glide {{consists}} of rapid acceleration {{to a given}} speed (the [...] "pulse" [...] or [...] "burn"), followed by a period of coasting or gliding down to a lower speed, {{at which point the}} burn-coast sequence is repeated. Coasting is most efficient when the engine is not running, although some gains can be realized with the engine on (to maintain power to brakes, steering and ancillaries) and the vehicle in neutral. Most modern petrol vehicles cut off the fuel supply completely when coasting (over-running) in gear, although the moving engine adds considerable frictional drag and speed is lost more quickly than with the engine <b>declutched</b> from the drivetrain.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{features}} {{in which the}} Volvo 66 differs from the DAF 66 are also mostly safety related. It has different seats featuring headrests, a safety steering wheel, steel side-impact bars in the doors, a <b>declutching</b> servo which enabled the driver to change gear with the choke engaged (In the older DAF models this was not possible, because the increased idle caused the centrifugal clutch to engage). The Volvo 66 also has a 'park' mode in the CVT, which locks the driveline. From 1977 the estate version featured a window wiper on the bootlid.|$|E
5000|$|The 3.8-litre unit {{found in}} the 991 GT3 is {{replaced}} with a 4.0-litre unit with 500 horsepower and 339 lb.ft Nm of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The drivetrain delivers 0 to 100 km/h in 3.3 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0-200 km/h (0-124 mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as <b>declutching</b> by [...] "paddle neutral" [...] — comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox - and Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 991 GT3, there is rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock.|$|E
50|$|The Mark III light tank {{suspension}} {{was made}} out of Horstmann coil springs controlling bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, invented by Sidney Horstmann and exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used up to the Light Tank Mk VI of the British Army. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it {{had the advantage of}} having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field.

Steering was a combination of <b>declutching</b> the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was electrically actuated.|$|E
50|$|A {{major problem}} with the {{autogyro}} was driving the rotor before takeoff. Several methods were attempted {{in addition to the}} coiled rope system, which could take the rotor speed to 50% of that required, at which point movement along the ground to reach flying speed was necessary, while tilting the rotor to establish autorotation. Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then <b>declutched</b> before the take-off run.|$|R

50|$|The {{ship was}} 168.8 m long and 24.7 m beam, {{originally}} measured 19,910 GRT and was built at Nordseewerke, Germany. She could carry 646 passengers, {{and had a}} top speed of 21.5 kn. The Discovery Cruises web site listed her gross tonnage as 20,186, top speed as 18 kn and passenger capacity as 698. Propulsion was by four Fiat medium speed diesel engines with a combined power output of 18,000 shaft horsepower. The engines were individually clutched and geared in pairs to each of the two shafts which drive controllable pitch propellers. This arrangement enabled one or more engines to be shut down and <b>declutched</b> as required. Last registry was under the Saint Kitts and Nevis flag.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the T-15 {{obviously}} {{was similar to that}} of the Mark III light tank prototype. The suspension was made out of Horstmann coil spring resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie.

50|$|Navy {{test pilot}} Cdr. Hugh Wood was killed {{attempting}} {{to land the}} first prototype XA2D-1, BuNo 122988, on 19 December 1950, on its 15th flight. He was unable to check the rate of descent, resulting in a high-impact crash on the runway. Investigation found the starboard power section of the coupled Allison XT40A turboprop engine had failed and did not <b>declutch,</b> allowing the Skyshark to fly {{on the power of}} the opposite section, nor did the propellers feather. As the wings' lift disappeared, a fatal sink rate was induced. Additional instrumentation and an automatic decoupler was added to the second prototype, but {{by the time it was}} ready to fly on 3 April 1952, sixteen months had passed, and with all-jet designs being developed, the A2D program was essentially dead. Total flight time on the lost airframe was barely 20 hours.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans {{decided to}} find out what his {{customers}} wanted in an [...] "owner driver's ideal" [...] car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need to double <b>declutch.</b> There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed constant-mesh gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available.|$|R
5000|$|So in 1936 a {{new vehicle}} was {{imported}} from the traditional supplier, the Vickers company - Belgian experiences with ordering from competing foreign companies such as the Renault company had been very disappointing (see AMC 35). This was the Vickers-Carden-Loyd Light Dragon Mk. II B (see Light tanks of the United Kingdom) in the export version, equipped with a 88 hp Meadows 6 cylinder gasoline engine and a [...] "crash" [...] type gearbox. The general design of the vehicle was almost identical to the T-15 Light tank already in service with the Belgian armed forces, also designed and produced by the Vickers company. The suspension was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie.

5000|$|Motorcycles {{have been}} {{produced}} in Kiev since 1946 at the Kiev Motorcycle Plant (Kyivskyi Mototsykletnyi Zavod (KMZ), Київський Мотоциклетний Завод, (КМЗ)). Initial production was of a 98 cc two-stroke model that was confiscated from the German firm Wanderer as reparations. The original design for KMZ heavy motorcycles, and their cousin the IMZ, is taken from the pre-World War II German BMW motorcycle R71, which the Soviet Union licensed in 1940. The plant and equipment {{needed to make the}} M-72 (the Soviet derivative of the BMW R71) was transferred from the Gorky Motorcycle Plant (Gorkovskyi Mototsykletnyi Zavod, GMZ located in the city of Gorkiy (Nizhny Novgorod) in 1949. The first batch of M-72 motorcycles was produced in 1952 with the supply of 500 engines from IMZ. In 1958 KMZ replaced the plunger framed M72-N with the swingarm framed K-750. In 1964, KMZ introduced a military model, the MV-750 with a differential two-wheel drive to the sidecar wheel. In 1967, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, KMZ released their first OHV engine in the [...] "Dnepr" [...] K-650. Unlike the earlier sidevalve engines with their roller bearing crankshafts, this engine featured a sleeve bearing crankshaft as found in the World War II Zündapp KS750. The K-650 was superseded by model MT-9 650 cc, which was available in both solo and sidecar models (often referred to as the best [...] "Cossack") as it was reliable and featured a new transmission with reverse gear and an automatic <b>declutching</b> mechanism incorporated into the riders foot pedal. The MT-10 was the first Soviet motorcycle to feature 12 volt electrics.|$|E
40|$|The solo duck wave-energy {{converter}} (WEC) captures {{power in}} a point absorber manner, hence it exhibits high power-capture efficiency within only a narrow bandwidth. Passive control {{is characterized by a}} unidirectional power flow, and thus its engineering implementation can be simplified. In this paper, two typical passive control strategies, latching and <b>declutching</b> control, are applied to the solo duck WEC to improve its power-capture performance at wave periods larger and smaller than the natural period of the WEC, respectively. Special attention is paid to the peak value of instantaneous WEC performance parameters, including the peak motion excursion, the peak power take-off (PTO) moment, and the peak-to-average power ratio, when the captured power is maximized. Performance differences between the linear and coulomb loads are also investigated. Results show that both latching and <b>declutching</b> control can effectively improve captured power, but also incidentally increase the peak motion excursion and peak-to-average power ratio. When under latching and <b>declutching</b> control, the coulomb load leads to the same maximum relative capture width and peak motion excursion as the linear load, but presents smaller peak PTO moment and peak-to-average power ratio than the linear load, hence making the coulomb load the better choice for the solo duck WEC...|$|E
25|$|At 19:00 {{overheating}} alarm {{was received}} from the cooling water system of the port main engine and its power had to be reduced to half. At times the engine had to be run at full power for {{short periods of time}} to keep the bow facing the wind. Shortly after 22:00 the speed of the starboard main engine suddenly dropped from 1,000 rpm to roughly 270 rpm, but was restored when the engine was <b>declutched</b> from the shaft. When the second engineer closed the clutch at the normal coupling speed of 400 rpm, the engine stalled. After restarting he attempted coupling the engine again at 1,000 rpm, but it still would not run faster than 270 rpm when connected to the shaft. When the captain received a report that the starboard main engine was no longer usable he decided to abandon the ship and ordered the evacuation of the remaining crew at 22:16. The combination turned parallel to the waves with port side facing the wind and began to drift uncontrollably.|$|R
50|$|A novel {{alternative}} to the lift jet for auxiliary vertical thrust is to be employed by the VTOL Lockheed F-35B version of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program. This {{does not have a}} jet lift engine, but a central lift fan that is powered by the main engine via a driveshaft. When not needed, it is <b>declutched</b> from the engine so that it does not consume power (analogous to the transfer case of a four-wheel drive vehicle). The operational viability of this system remains to be seen, and all of the above drawbacks still apply: it is dead weight in flight, and together with the aircraft's internal weapons bays it takes up a great deal of internal space, reducing fuel and avionics load and requiring a bulkier and wider fuselage cross-section (which passes on to the A and C versions, even though they don't have a fan or V/STOL capability). It has, however, in pre-operational testing proven the ability to take off vertically and go supersonic in level flight in the same mission, a first for a combat aircraft.|$|R
