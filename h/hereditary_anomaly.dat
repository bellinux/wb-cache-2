40|$|Hair {{and nails}} are often stated {{to have much}} in common in {{relation}} to their origin, anatomical structures, and common involvement in many diseases. Hair and nails are predominantly epithelial structures derived from primitive epidermis and made up of keratinous fibrils embedded in a sulfur-rich matrix. It was first noted early in the 20 th century that the nail unit was comparable in several respects to a hair follicle sectioned longitudinally and laid on on its side. The epithelial components of hair follicle and nail apparatus are differentiated epidermal structures that may be involved jointly in several ways as congenital and <b>hereditary</b> <b>anomalies</b> and acquired conditions such as alopecia areata, lichen planus, iatrogenic causes, and fungal infection. Multielemental characterization of human hair and nails shows that even after sample washing, many elements are enriched in the surface of the nails...|$|R
40|$|The kidney {{is one of}} {{the organs}} most {{frequently}} affected by cystic disease, which can be defined as the morbidity attributable to the presence of renal cysts. Renal cysts appear in a series of very diverse <b>hereditary</b> <b>anomalies,</b> acquired or developmental, occurring as an isolated form or in association with other renal or systemic alterations. Cysts are microscopic or macroscopic abnormal cavities, with saccular or fusiform shape, coated with epithelium and filled with liquid. They origin in the nephron or the collecting tubules, with which a connection can be maintained or not. They can occur at any point in life, from the prenatal period to adulthood, and one or both kidneys may be affected in a focal or diffuse form. Renal cyst pathogenesis is not completely understood, although there is evidence that it may be caused by hyperproliferative dysplasic secretion and matrix remodelling alterations, modulated by endocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine and autocrine stimuli, which induce obstructive alterations that are determinant in its genesis and evolution.

40|$|Brugada {{syndrome}} {{was described}} in 1992 as a new clinical and electrocardiographic syndrome involving susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with no obvious structural heart disease. Brugada syndrome {{is characterized by a}} <b>hereditary</b> <b>anomaly</b> in the sodium ion channel (mutation of the SCN 5 A gene) identified by a wide QRS associated with the ST-segment elevation and the T‑wave inversion in the right precordial leads. The Brugada-like electrocardiographic pattern can be caused by sodium channel-blocking drugs and electrolyte disorders. Hyperkalemia may produce multiple ECG abnormalities, including the ST-segment elevation and pseudomyocardial infarction with a resolution of these abnormalities after the correction of hyperkalemia. This article describes 8 cases of pseudoanteroseptal myocardial infarction in acute renal insufficiency with hyperkalemia. The ST-segment elevation related to hyperkalemia is resolved by the reduced serum potassium level. Clinicians should recognize that hyperkalemia is one of the etiologies of the Brugada-like electrocardiographic pattern...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Lumbosacral {{transitional}} vertebra (LTV) is {{a common}} congenital and <b>hereditary</b> <b>anomaly</b> in many dog breeds. It predisposes to premature degeneration of the lumbosacral junction, and is a frequent cause of cauda equina syndrome, especially in German shepherd dogs. Ventrodorsal hip radiographs are most often used in diagnosis of LTV in screening programs. In this study, value of laterolateral lumbar spine radiographs as additions to ventrodorsal radiographs in diagnosis of LTV, and characteristics of LTV and the eighth lumbar vertebra (L 8) in laterolateral radiographs were studied. Additionally, computed tomography (CT) features {{of different types of}} LTV were elucidated. Methods The ventrodorsal pelvic and laterolateral lumbar spine radiographs of 228 German shepherd dogs were evaluated for existence and type of LTV. Morphology of transverse processes was used in classification of LTV in ventrodorsal radiographs. The relative length of sixth (L 6) and seventh (L 7) vertebrae (L 6 /L 7) was used in characterization of these vertebrae in laterolateral radiographs. CT studies were available for 16 dogs, and they were used for more detailed characterization of different types of LTV. Non-parametric χ 2 statistics, generalized logit model for multinomial data, and one-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analyses. Results In all, 92 (40 %) dogs had a LTV, the most common type being separation of first spinous process from the median crest of the sacrum in 62 dogs (67 % of LTV). Eight dogs had eight lumbar vertebrae. Those dogs with LTV had longer L 7 in relation to L 6 than dogs with normal lumbosacral junctions. When L 6 /L 7 decreased by 0. 1 units, the proportion of dogs belonging to the group with L 8 was 14 -fold higher than in the group with normal lumbosacral junctions. L 8 resembled first sacral vertebra (S 1) in length and position and was therefore classified as one type of LTV. With CT it was shown that categorizing LTV, based on shape and visibility of transverse processes seen in ventrodorsal radiographs, could be misleading. Conclusions We suggest that L 8 be included {{as a part of the}} LTV complex, and the laterolateral radiographs of the lumbar spine be considered as an addition to ventrodorsal projections in the screening protocols for LTV. </p...|$|E
40|$|Canine hip {{dysplasia}} (CHD) is a <b>hereditary</b> developmental <b>anomaly,</b> most frequent in large dog breeds. Clinical {{confirmation of the}} disorder is based on hip X-ray imaging. Twenty Tornjak dogs aged between 9 - 36 months, and weighted from 35 - 42 kg were examined for CHD. Scoring was performed according to six clearly defined radiographic parameters by Flueckiger method (5). Dysplastic changes of various severity were observed in 11 dogs, while in 9 dogs changes were absent. The study describes 4 CHD cases of varying degrees of severity. The results indicate the presence of CHD in Bosnian Tornjak. Determining the incidence of dysplasia in this autochthonous breed requires a more detailed study, which will enable determination of the prevalence of dysplasia {{and analysis of the}} relationship to other dog breeds.

40|$|Background: Blindness and {{low vision}} are major causes of {{morbidity}} and constitute a significant public health problem, both {{detrimental to the}} quality of life for the individual and an economic burden on the individual, family, and society in general. People with low vision have the potential for enhancement of functional vision if they receive the appropriate low vision services. The present study aims to determine the profile of the low vision population attending a low vision clinic at a peripheral eye hospital in Nepal. Methods: The low vision evaluation report cards of all the patients attending the low vision clinic at Biratnagar Eye Hospital between January 1, 2010 to March 31, 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Out of 396 low vision patients, 280 (70. 71 %) were males and 116 (29. 29 %) were females. The age range of patients was from six to 89 years, with a mean of 43. 29 ± 11. 06 years. Retinitis pigmentosa (70, 18 %) and macular diseases except age related macular degeneration (AMD) (55, 14 %) were the most common causes of low vision. Nystagmus and amblyopia (34, 26. 36 %), retinitis pigmentosa (49, 23. 33 %) and AMD (16, 28. 07 %) were the most common causes of low vision in the 0 - 15, 16 - 60, and > 60 years age groups, respectively. Telescopes (52, 39. 10 %) and stand magnifiers (45, 33. 83 %) were the most commonly prescribed low vision devices. Conclusion: <b>Hereditary</b> <b>anomalies</b> and age related degeneration constitute the major causes of low vision in the study population. Telescopes and stand magnifiers were the most commonly prescribed and preferred low vision devices. The burden of visual impairment can be tackled in an effective way through the provision of quality and affordable low vision services and also provide a basis for national and regional level planning to combat visual impairment...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD) {{in a young}} athlete {{represents}} a dramatic event, and {{an increasing number of}} medico-legal cases have addressed this topic. In addition to representing an ethical and medico-legal responsibility, prevention of SCD is directly correlated with accurate eligibility/disqualification decisions, with an inappropriate pronouncement in either direction potentially leading to legal controversy. This review summarizes the common causes of SCD in young athletes, divided into structural (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary artery anomalies, etc.), electrical (Brugada, congenital LQT, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, etc.), and acquired cardiac abnormalities (myocarditis, etc.). In addition, the roles of <b>hereditary</b> cardiac <b>anomalies</b> in SCD in athletes and the effects of a positive result on them and their families are discussed. The medico-legal relevance of pre-participation screening is analyzed, and recommendations from the American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology are compared. Finally, the main issues concerning the differentiation between physiologic cardiac adaptation in athletes and pathologic findings and, thereby, definition of the so-called gray zone, which is based on exact knowledge of the mechanism of cardiac remodeling including structural or functional adaptions, will be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor of the testis (LCCSCT) {{is a rare}} tumor that {{is usually}} benign and multifocal. It may be {{associated}} with <b>hereditary</b> endocrine <b>anomalies</b> such as Carney's and Peutz-Jeghers syndromes. It is a rare histological variant of sex cord stromal tumors. It is exceptional in elderly men and the outcome is rarely fatal. We report a case of LCCSCT in a 44 year-old man with fatal outcome. The tumor involved the right testis and several areas of the tunica albuginea were grossly invaded. It composed of cords and trabeculae of large polygonal cells embedded in a myxoid and fibrous stroma with areas of calcification along with nuclear atypia, necrosis, and abundant mitoses. The Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is known to be commonly associated with ovarian tumors. However, its association with testicular tumors is uncommon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the eight such case being reported in the literature. Our case, to our knowledge, is the only other reported case of malignant large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor with clinical and histopathological features related to aggressiveness, such as large tumor size, cellular pleomorphism, high mitotic rate, necrosis and aneuploid deoxyribonucleic acid. Such characteristics are not found in benign large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors...|$|R
