60|$|The corvée, {{vexatious}} as it was, yet excited less violent heats and inflicted less misery {{than the}} abuses of military service. There had been a militia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country {{as far back as}} the time of the Merovingians, but the militia-service with which Turgot had to deal only dated from 1726. Each parish was bound to supply its quota of men to this service, and the obligation was perhaps the most odious grievance, though not the most really mischievous, of all that then afflicted the realm. The hatred which it raised was due to no failure of <b>the</b> military spirit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> people. From Frederick the Great downwards, everybody was well aware that the disasters to France which had begun with the shameful defeat of Rossbach and ended with the loss of Canada <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east (1757-1763), were due to no want of valour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> common soldier. It was the generals, as Napoleon said fifty years afterwards, who were incapable and inept. And it was the ineptitude of the administrative chiefs that made the militia at once ineffective and abhorred. First, they allowed a great number of classified exemptions from the ballot. The noble, the tonsured clerk, the counsellor, the domestic of noble, tonsured clerk, and counsellor, the eldest son of the lawyer and the farmer, the tax collector, the schoolmaster, were all exempt. Hence the curse of service was embittered by a sense of injustice. This was one of <b>the</b> many springs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old régime that fed the swelling and vehement stream of passion for social equality, until at length when the day came, it made such short and furious work with the structure of envious partition between citizen and citizen.|$|R

Such interpretations appear to have originated in Purcell’s late 17 th century opera The Fairy Queen when English trade with India and the east was well under way, {{but at the time}} of the first performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1595 - 6 there is no connection with the east Indies. At the time of the first performance of the play “India” still signified America or <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>Indies,</b> as it does in many Shakespeare plays and in contemporary discourse [...] a fact overlooked by the dogma of an eastern Indian boy which actually has no definitive textual authorisation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play itself. At the time of the play the English desire for <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>Indies</b> is paramount, and this is manifested in Sir Walter Ralegh’s voyage to Guiana in 1595 when he returns with a real Indian prince. America as “India” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play therefore grounds it in its historical context, places Titania’s description of “India” as an early modern English perception of the New World, and radicalises centuries of received wisdom on its interpretation: pixie-dust trivialisations of Oberon, Titania and fairyland are set aside in favour of historical analysis of England’s hopes for American empire which was made possible by Ralegh’s return with a real Indian prince...|$|R

5000|$|William Sayle {{established}} the first English {{settlement of the}} Bahamas between 1646-48 {{on the island of}} Eleuthera, establishing England's claim to the Bahamas archipelago. He left Bermuda with seventy settlers, mostly Bermudians and some English, who were looking for a place where they could worship God freely. To this end they settled on the Island of Segatoo which they gave the name Eleuthera, from the Greek word meaning freedom. [...] This settlement was planned and authorised from England, and did not result from Bermuda's internal strife. As England's first trans-Atlantic colony to become self-sustaining, Bermuda had been important <b>in</b> supporting <b>the</b> establishment of other English colonies in North America and <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>Indies,</b> and <b>the</b> settlement of the Bahamas was to take place from the Bermuda, rather than directly from England.
