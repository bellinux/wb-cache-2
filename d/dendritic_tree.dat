25|$|Neurons {{exist in}} a number of {{different}} shapes and sizes and can be classified by their morphology and function. The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further divided by where the cell body or soma is located. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by the myelin sheath. Around the cell body is a branching <b>dendritic</b> <b>tree</b> that receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching terminals (axon terminal) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.|$|E

40|$|The way {{in which}} a {{neuronal}} tree expands {{plays an important role in}} its functional and computational characteristics. We aimed to study the existence of an optimal neuronal design for different types of cortical GABAergic neurons. To do this, we hypothesized that both the axonal and <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> of individual neurons optimize brain connectivity in terms of wiring length. We took the branching points of real three-dimensional neuronal reconstructions of the axonal and <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> of different types of cortical interneurons and searched for the minimal wiring arborization structure that respects the branching points. We compared the minimal wiring arborization with real axonal and <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees.</b> We tested this optimization problem using a new approach based on graph theory and evolutionary computation techniques. We concluded that neuronal wiring is near-optimal in most of the tested neurons, although the wiring length of <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> is generally nearer to the optimum. Therefore, wiring economy is related to the {{way in which}} neuronal arborizations grow irrespective of the marked differences in the morphology of the examined interneurons...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{controlling the}} formation and maintenance of neuronal trees are poorly understood. We examined the dynamic development of two arborized mechanoreceptor neurons (PVDs) required for reception of strong mechanical stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans. The PVDs elaborated <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> comprising structural units we call “menorahs. ” We studied how the number, structure, and function of menorahs were maintained. EFF- 1, an essential protein mediating cell fusion, acted autonomously in the PVDs to trim developing menorahs. eff- 1 mutants displayed hyperbranched, disorganized menorahs. Overexpression of EFF- 1 in the PVD reduced branching. Neuronal pruning appeared to involve EFF- 1 – dependent branch retraction and neurite-neurite autofusion. Thus, EFF- 1 activities may act as a quality control mechanism during the sculpting of <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees.</b> Morphologies of <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> vary fromone neuronal type to another, and thepattern of these arbors determines {{the manner in which}} a neuron processes its synaptic or sensory input.

Using electron microscopy and serial reconstructions, we analyzed the <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> of four morphologically distinct neocortical interneuron subtypes to reveal two underlying organizational principles common to all. First, cross-sectional areas at any given point within a dendrite were proportional to the summed length of all dendritic segments distal to that point. Consistent with this observation, total cross-sectional area was almost perfectly conserved at bifurcation points. Second, dendritic cross-sections became progressively more elliptical at more proximal, larger diameter, dendritic locations. Finally, computer simulations revealed that these conserved morphological features limit distance dependent filtering of somatic EPSPs and facilitate distribution of somatic depolarization into all dendritic compartments. Because these features were shared by all interneurons studied, they may represent common organizational principles underlying the otherwise diverse morphology of <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the strength of backpropagating action potentials varies greatly between different neuronal types (Hausser 2000). Some types of neuronal cells show little to no decrease in the amplitude of action potentials as they invade and travel through the <b>dendritic</b> <b>tree</b> while other neuronal cell types, such as cerebellar Purkinje neurons, exhibit very little action potential backpropagation (Stuart 1997). Additionally, there are other neuronal cell types that manifest varying degrees of amplitude decrement during backpropagation. It is thought that this is due to the fact that each neuronal cell type contains varying numbers of the voltage-gated channels required to propagate a dendritic action potential.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of neurons; multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar. Multipolar neurons, {{such as the}} one shown in the image, are {{composed}} of one axon and many dendritic trees.

Bipolar neurons have one axon and one <b>dendritic</b> <b>tree</b> at opposing ends of the cell body. Unipolar neurons have a stalk that extends from the cell body that separates into two branches with one containing the dendrites and the other with the terminal buttons.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors determining the variety of geometric shapes exhibited by <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> remains unclear. This question was addressed by developing {{a model of the}} growth of <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> based on diffusion-limited aggregation process. The model reproduces diverse neuronal shapes (i. e., granule cells, Purkinje cells, the basal and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, and the axonal trees of interneurons) by changing only the size of the growth area, the time span of pruning, and the spatial concentration of 'neurotrophic particles'. Moreover, the presented model shows how competition between neurons can affect the shape of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees.</b> The model reveals that the creation of complex (but reproducible) dendrite-like trees does not require precise guidance or an intrinsic plan of the dendrite geometry. Instead, basic environmental factors and the simple rules of diffusive growth adequately account for the spatial embedding of different types of dendrites observed in the cortex. An example demonstrating the broad applicability of the algorithm to model diverse types of tree structures is also presented.

40|$|Pyramidal {{cells are}} characterised by {{markedly}} different sized <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees,</b> branching patterns and spine density across the cortical mantle. Moreover, pyramidal cells {{have been shown}} to differ in structure among homologous cortical areas in different species; however, most of these studies have been conducted in primates. Whilst pyramidal cells have been quantified in a few cortical areas in some other species there are, as yet, no uniform comparative data on pyramidal cell structure in a homologous cortical area among species in different Orders. Here we studied layer III pyramidal cells in V 1 of three species of rodents, the greater cane rat, highveld gerbil and four-striped mouse, by the same methodology used to sample data from layer III pyramidal cells in primates. The data reveal markedly different trends between rodents and primates: there is an appreciable increase in the size, branching complexity and number of spines in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> of pyramidal cells with increasing size of V 1 in the brain in rodents, whereas there is relatively little difference in primates. Moreover, pyramidal cells in rodents are larger, more branched and more spinous than those in primates. For example, the <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees</b> of pyramidal cells in V 1 of the cane rat are nearly three times larger, and have more than ten times the number of spines in their basal <b>dendritic</b> <b>trees,</b> than those in V 1 of the macaque (7900 and 600, respectively), which has a V 1 40 times the size that of the cane rat.

50|$|Since the 1950s, {{evidence}} has existed that neurons {{in the central}} nervous system generate an action potential, or voltage spike, that travels both through the axon to signal the next neuron and backpropagates through the dendrites sending a retrograde signal to its presynaptic signaling neurons. This current decays significantly with travel length along the dendrites, so effects are predicted to be more significant for neurons whose synapses are near the postsynaptic cell body, with magnitude depending mainly on sodium-channel density in the dendrite. It is also dependent on the shape of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>tree</b> and, more importantly, on the rate of signal currents to the neuron. On average, a backpropagating spike loses about half its voltage after traveling nearly 500 micrometres.|$|E
50|$|The microelectrodes used by Katz and {{his contemporaries}} pale in {{comparison}} to the technologically advanced recording techniques available today. Spatial summation began to receive a lot of research attention when techniques were developed that allowed the simultaneous recording of multiple loci on a <b>dendritic</b> <b>tree.</b> A lot of experiments involve the use of sensory neurons, especially optical neurons, because they are constantly incorporating a ranging frequency of both inhibitory and excitatory inputs. Modern studies of neural summation focus on the attenuation of postsynaptic potentials on the dendrites and the cell body of a neuron. These interactions are said to be nonlinear, because the response is less than the sum of the individual responses. Sometimes this can be due to a phenomenon caused by inhibition called shunting, which is the decreased conductance of excitatory postsynaptic potentials.|$|E
50|$|Recording the {{activity}} of a single neuron {{at any given time}} at many locations in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>tree</b> has been accomplished using voltage-sensitive dyes with optical monitoring. Signals are rapid but also small, and measurements from single cells require intense illumination. As the dyes are very phototoxic, the cells usually die after only a few action potentials. However, measurements from both somatic and dendritic patch recordings show that the peak membrane potential deflection during a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS) is 10mV greater in the apical trunk (supragranular location) than the soma. This is consistent with the anatomy of neocortical networks because the most powerful reciprocal layer connections are in supragranular layers 2 and 3. This may resolve the conflicting information suggesting that {{the activity}} spreads primarily at the supragranular layers or at the large layer 5 neurons.|$|E
