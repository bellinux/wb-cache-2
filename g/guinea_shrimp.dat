40|$|Considering {{the fact}} that nearly 25 % of the Ghanaian people live in the coastal zone and about 10 % depend on the coastal fishery for livelihood, {{it is likely that}} any changes in the {{production}} of the fishery may impact on the socio-economic lives of the people. For the past four decades, climatic conditions ha ve been found to be changing in the country. This period coincided with the conspicuous fluctuations in the landings of the most significant pelagic species exploited by the canoe fleet. This study provides an assessment of the influence of precipitation and sea surface temperature changes on yield and catch of Round Sardinella (Sardinella aurita), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus), Flat Sardinella (S. maderensis) and <b>Guinea</b> <b>Shrimp</b> (Parapenaeopsis atlantica). The abundance of these stocks is believed to be correlated with upwelling and sea surface temperature conditions and a local manifestation of global scale climatic changes is suspected to be taking place. It was hypothesized that climate as represented by sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation affects either catchability or the population growth rate of each species. Forty years of climatological data (mean air temperature and precipitation) were assessed; 38 and 33 years each of hydrological data (sea surface temperature and salinity) were then used to investigate the possible relation between climatic changes and species production. Forecasts of future climate scenarios were made, and stock dynamics were simulated with an environmentally coupled dynamic surplus production model. Stock production and, to a lower extent, catchability were found to be closely tied to climatological factors. Lower catch rates of the Round Sardinella coincided with years of higher SST and the reverse was true for the anchovy. For the shrimp and flat sardine, precipitation was found to have the most substantial effect on production and total annual catchability. It was concluded that changes in climate directly affect the productivity of the ecosystem as well as its catchability and most importantly, the population growth rate of the species. For sustainable management of the fishery resources, it is imperative that climatic and hydrological parameters be incorporated into fishery management models...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the duration of}} formation of the giant Ok Tedi porphyry copper-gold deposit in Papua New <b>Guinea</b> using zircon <b>SHRIMP</b> U-Pb dating. The intrusions that host the Cu-Au mineralisation have a maximum age of 1. 43 ± 0. 22 Ma. Since previously published K-Ar dates on the same intrusion constrain the last thermal event at 1. 11 ± 0. 05 Ma, we conclude that the magmatic-hydrothermal event that produced the deposit lasted ~ 0. 45 megayears (Myr). A comparison of Ok Tedi’s calculated volatile fluxes with those from arc volcanoes and active mineralising hydrothermal systems suggests that the efficiency of metal deposition is {{a key factor in}} determining the duration of deposit formation...|$|R
40|$|During {{a survey}} made on {{symbionts}} of comatulids in Hansa bay (Bismark Sea, Papua New <b>Guinea),</b> the <b>shrimp</b> Synalpheus stimpsoni was observed on 4 species {{out of the}} 25 which occur in the bay: Comaster multibrachiatus (P. H. Carpenter), C. multifidus (Müller), C. gracilis (Hartlaub) and C. alternans (P. H. Carpenter). Many individuals (ca. 70 %) of C. multifidus —the most common comatulid of the bay—were infested. The shrimp are ectosymbionts that occur alone or in a pair (one male, one female) under the calyx of their host. While Synalpheus stimpsoni has no apparent effect on its host, the comatulid provides, at least, protection against predators. When isolated from its natural host and placed close to different comatulid species, S. stimpsoni significantly prefers to reassociate with its natural host. Experiments made for testing the role of vision and olfaction in the recognition and selection of shrimps' hosts show that S. stimpsoni is unable to visually distinguish its natural host either from other comatulids or from branched corals. In contrast, S. stimpsoni differentiates significantly a water flow carrying the odour of its natural host from any other water flow. It is suggested that vision is the first sense involved, enabling the symbiont to move near any comatulid-like object; olfaction then acts, allowing the shrimp to recognize and select an appropriate comatulid host...|$|R
