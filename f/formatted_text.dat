25|$|Opening a Word Document file in {{a version}} of Word {{other than the one}} with which it was created can cause {{incorrect}} display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not so subtle ways (such as changing the font, or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version. Rich Text Format (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging <b>formatted</b> <b>text</b> between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.|$|E

2500|$|... iOS 9 {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Dan Seifert of The Verge {{praised the}} improvements in Proactivity and Siri, highlighting how the notification drop-down contains most, if not all, the information the user needs. Although {{he pointed out}} that Google's Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana personal assistants offer similar services, sometimes with [...] "better and more varied ways" [...] of achieving results, the improvements to iOS [...] "lay the foundation for even more capabilities in the future". Chris Velazco of Engadget liked the [...] "small, thoughtful" [...] design changes, but was most impressed by the new multitasking features for the iPad, referring to Split Screen as a [...] "lovely little feature". He did, however, criticize the low number of decent-looking articles in Apple News, writing that [...] "you'll notice a discrepancy in how some articles are handled -- most are just <b>formatted</b> <b>text</b> on a white background with the outlet's logo up top" [...] and also noted the limited number of locations in Apple Maps that, at launch, supported mass transit directions. Matt Swider of TechRadar wrote that Siri and Proactivity lists were [...] "robust", and enjoyed that notifications were sorted chronologically rather than by app. Samuel Gibbs of The Guardian welcomed the changes to the built-in apps such as drawing and photo insertion in Notes, unknown number identification from emails through Phone, and Siri automatically launching the Music app upon plugging in headphones. He also praised the updates to the keyboard, calling it [...] "much easier to use".|$|E
50|$|<b>Formatted</b> <b>text</b> cannot rightly be {{identified}} with binary files or be distinct from ASCII text. This is because <b>formatted</b> <b>text</b> is not necessarily binary, it may be text-only, such as HTML, RTF or enriched text files, {{and it may be}} ASCII-only. Conversely, a plain text file may be non-ASCII (in an encoding such as Unicode UTF-8). Text-only <b>formatted</b> <b>text</b> is achieved by markup which too is textual, while some editors of <b>formatted</b> <b>text</b> like Microsoft Word save in a binary format.|$|E

50|$|<b>Formatted</b> <b>text</b> {{documents}} in binary files have, however, the disadvantages of formatting scope and secrecy.

This can lead to formatting mistakes and maintenance troubles. As for secrecy, <b>formatted</b> <b>text</b> document file formats tend to be proprietary and undocumented, leading to difficulty in coding compatibility by third parties, and also to unnecessary upgrades because of version changes.|$|E
