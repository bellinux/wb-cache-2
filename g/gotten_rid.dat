500|$|Chaplin denied being a communist, instead {{calling himself}} a [...] "peacemonger", but felt the government's effort to {{suppress}} the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties. Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and {{the activities of the}} House Un-American Activities Committee. Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify. As his activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, told Congress in June 1947: [...] " [...] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and <b>gotten</b> <b>rid</b> of at once." ...|$|E

While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had <b>gotten</b> <b>rid</b> of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

500|$|Those who {{expected}} that party loyalty would cause McCarthy {{to tone down}} his accusations of Communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed. Eisenhower had never been an admirer of McCarthy, and their relationship became more hostile once Eisenhower was in office. In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing [...] "1,456 Truman holdovers who were... <b>gotten</b> <b>rid</b> of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion." [...] He {{then went on to}} complain that John Paton Davies Jr. was still [...] "on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration," [...] even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to [...] "put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the Central Intelligence Agency." [...] In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War. By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the [...] "twenty years of treason" [...] catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to [...] "twenty-one years of treason" [...] to include Eisenhower's first year in office.|$|E
500|$|Originating from New Jersey, Angelina {{arrived in}} Genoa City, Wisconsin {{to be with}} her father Angelo. She also wanted to fulfill her new-found dreams of {{becoming}} a recording artist. Her father hired music producer Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) to create her music. However, it was soon evident that she lacked in talent. She developed a crush on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), which she takes to extreme heights, conning him into a short-lived marriage {{with the help of her}} father. Angelina eventually achieved her musical dream, having released a song entitled [...] "Good Goodbye" [...] which was written and produced by DeGarmo. The song was about how the character evolved into a better person when she left, and detailed her [...] "emotional journey". DeGarmo said that she had finally <b>gotten</b> <b>rid</b> of her selfish ways and expressed this through music. After a five-month stint on the series, on March 27, 2012, Angelina left Genoa City to further pursue her music career in Los Angeles. Described as [...] "mafia princess" [...] and an alter ego, TV Guide credited her as being comedic relief for the daytime drama. However, Luke Kerr of Zap2it was not receptive of the character's Jersey Shore concept, criticizing the soap opera for it. DeGarmo likened Angelina's transformation to My Fair Lady.|$|E

The parties met south of Teda in the [...] Three battles of Sarbakusa; Ras Mikael was defeated and surrendered to Wand Bewossen on 4 June 1771.

2500|$|The 1902 Constitution {{instituted a}} poll tax and {{required}} bulk payment after a voter missed elections, making voting a luxury that poor people, which included many African-Americans, could not often afford. The Constitution also required that voters pass a literacy test, a poll test on the Virginia Constitution, with their performance graded by the registrar. When questioned {{as to whether}} these measures were potentially discriminatory, Glass exclaimed, [...] "Discrimination! Why {{that is exactly what}} we propose. To remove every negro voter who can be <b>gotten</b> <b>rid</b> of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate." [...] Indeed, the number of African-Americans qualified to vote dropped from 147,000 to 21,000 immediately.
