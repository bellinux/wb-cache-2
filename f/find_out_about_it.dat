5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
25|$|The Rumlu, Afshar, and the Qajar clan favored Ismail Mirza Safavi, who {{was jailed}} in the Qahqaheh Castle. Pari Khan Khanum also favored Ismail Mirza, {{and she had}} the support of the Circassians. While Tahmasp was still ill, those who {{supported}} Haydar Mirza, sent a message to the castellan of Qahqaheh Castle, named Khalifa Ansar Qaradghlu. They requested him to have Ismail Mirza killed. However, Pari Khan Khanum managed to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and told Tahmasp about the plot. Tahmasp, who still had some feelings for Ismail Mirza due to the courage he used to have in the encounters with the Ottoman Empire, sent a group of Afshar musketeers to the Qahqaheh Castle to safeguard him. Two months later, Tahmasp healed from the life-threatening illness he had. Two years later, on 14 May 1576, he died in Qazvin. Haydar Mirza was the only son who was with him when he died, and thus the following day, he announced himself as the new shah. Normally, some Qizilbash tribes would guard the royal palace and take turns with other others—unfortunately for Haydar Mirza, on that day all the Qizilbash guards were either from the Rumlu, Afshar, Qajar, Bayat, or the Dorsaq tribe—all loyal supporters of Ismail Mirza.|$|E
500|$|... "I haven't {{really been}} focused {{as much as}} I {{should be on the}} music part of my career because this movie has just {{consumed}} every inch of me. Between that and my four children, I don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
