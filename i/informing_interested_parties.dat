50|$|A {{recently}} prepared Strategic Plan {{focuses on}} science that is broad based, relevant, and farsighted, and providing advice that is rigorous, reliable, and objective. The Plan identifies a Mission {{which calls for}} 1) establishing effective arrangements to provide scientific advice; 2) <b>informing</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> and the public objectively and effectively about marine ecosystem issues; 3) coordinating and enhancing physical, chemical, biological, and interdisciplinary research; 4) fostering partnerships with other organizations that share a common interest; and 5) developing and maintaining accessible marine databases. The Strategic Plan addresses six critical themes: 1) Science, 2) Collaboration, 3) Advice, 4) Data, 5) Communication, and 6) Service support. An Action Plan specifies the activities that will be undertaken over the coming years {{in order to achieve}} the goals. It explains how ICES will continue to advance scientific knowledge and improve scientific advice, whereas the goals in the Strategic Plan tell what the overall objectives will be.|$|E
