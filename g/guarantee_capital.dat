40|$|Following the 1997 / 1998 {{financial}} crisis, Indonesian banks experienced major regulatory changes, {{including the}} adoption of the blanket guarantee scheme (BGS) in 1998, a limited guarantee (LG) in 2005, and changes in capital regulation in 1998 and 2001. We examine the impact of these regulatory changes on market discipline during the period 1995 - 2009. The price of deposits is used to measure market discipline in a dynamic panel data methodology on a sample of 104 commercial banks. We find a weakening of market discipline following the introduction of the BGS. The result is consistent with the deposit insurance scheme being credible in the lower capital requirement environment. The adoption of LG in a recovering economy also mitigates the role of market discipline. However, market discipline is more pronounced in listed banks than unlisted banks and in foreign banks than domestic banks. These results have important implications for banking regulation and supervision, particularly during a crisis period.

After the defeat in the Crimean War, the state began to consider two basic ways construction of railways: the expense of the treasury at the expense of private capital, including foreign ones. Attempts to organize joint capital of private foreign and domestic on the example of the main Russian Railway Company ended sadly. Foreign capital is mainly interested in speculation on the Russian stock exchange, as a result the majority of the company's shares went to the Russian capital. To support the private Russian capital the government has gone the way of the <b>guarantee</b> <b>capital,</b> in certain cases, as a joint stock or bond or one of the types of capital. When distribution concessions were not crucial economic factors, and the proximity to the elite or the corruption component. Often concession won by those who offered the lowest price, which affects the quality of railway construction in the country. As a result of the concession is not got the most professionally trained people who are almost entirely the burden shifted to the state, and profits for the most part getting any private owners. As a result, such practice is ruinous for the Treasury forced the government to buy back a significant portion of private railways on acceptable terms.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the application for {{the preparation of}} insurances {{in order to reduce}} credit risk and <b>guarantee</b> <b>capital</b> adequacy for the banks. This field is increasingly growing and with the Basel II Capital Accord it has gained additional value and is expanding in bank management as well as in inter-bank business throughout the world. Reasons and legal bases for the implementation of insurances are given in the introduction. A description of credit risk problematic, seen from the economic point of view, and the current procedures of insurances implementation follow. The requirements the application has to meet conclude the introduction. A quick overview of the elements of the project is included {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Besides its architecture – a three-level architecture, some additional modules, needed for the consistency of data and the implementation of regulations, prescribed by the law, and regulations, prescribed by the committee of central bank governors from ten countries, are listed as well. The central part of the work is formed by chapters, dedicated to individual levels of the three-level architecture of the application. There is a detailed description of the concept of the implementation of each level and the implementation of the modules and the connections between given. In addition there is the module for data processing presented. This module serves to supplementary control the consistency of data, originating from the revalorisation of insurances, and to inform the trustees/ persons in charge for the supervision of insurances in case of any irregularities. The working methods used in the development of the project and the structure of the project group is then described, focusing on my contribution to the realisation of the project. There are some problems, which occurred during the development – the technical side of the project, the procedures for the testing of the application and the processing presented too. It is necessary to transfer the object of the development into production – to present it to the users – at the end of each cycle. The last part of the thesis thus includes the reasons for its transfer (carried out in three phases) as well as some of the problems that arose during the process and their solutions. It concludes with the proposed improvements and complements to the established application. I participated in the project as a programmer. The tasks I performed are presented in the order they were actually executed. My first duty was to programme a graphic user interface: implementation of objects representing specific insurance data and the logic, hidden under the mask. I had to fulfil the rules of single insurance types within the business layer, allocated to me by the project manager. Programming included the accuracy control and the transformation of data, gathered from the data base. The business layer functions are directly related to web service calls. The already existing functions of the web service had to be supplemented with additional queries. As all the needed functionalities were not included in the web service it was necessary to supplement it with additional functions. Besides the above enumerated tasks, I was also in charge of data processing, including data inaccuracy and course of insurances or investments processing. My tasks are presented in each chapter separately, while the conclusion of the thesis includes the résumé of my entire contribution to the project.

Unfortunately, many examples of framing exist whereby a change in the wording of a problem leads to other preferences.

In this way, <b>capital</b> <b>guaranteed</b> funds serve a good purpose. However, the frame used to disclose information about the fund to the investor, matters.

40|$|For {{households}} seeking {{retirement income}} security, short-term deposits (such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and Treasury bills) seem an ideal and appropriate investment choice – particularly given the recent extraordinary turbulence {{in the financial}} markets. Over the past year, an investment in short-term deposits would have actually outperformed investments in corporate bonds and far outperformed corporate stocks. Retired households exhibit a strong preference for holding such apparently safe investments. One study found that 86 percent of households nearing retirement (ages 60 - 64) had bank accounts, while only 33 percent owned stocks directly and only 7 percent owned bonds directly. And the desire for short-term investments increased with age. But short-term investments, while safe, produce uncertain returns. This Issue in Brief highlights the trade-off that households must make between a <b>guaranteed</b> return of <b>capital</b> and a <b>guaranteed</b> return on <b>capital</b> – they cannot have {{both at the same}} time. Short-term deposits provide a <b>guaranteed</b> return of <b>capital,</b> but offer no guarantees as to the return the household will receive on its capital. In contrast, a portfolio of Treasury bonds of appropriate maturities provides a <b>guaranteed</b> return on <b>capital,</b> but with the return of <b>capital</b> <b>guaranteed</b> only at maturity. This brief argues that retired households seeking a secure and dependable income should prioritize return on capital over return of capital. For such households, the true risk-free asset is a portfolio of bonds and, in particular, inflation-protected bonds of appropriate maturities. ...|$|R

In Asia’s export-dependent economies, this entails relying more on private domestic demand as a driver of growth. While some countries need to raise consumption, several need to raise investment or reorient it from tradable to nontradable sectors. These changes in investment could be facilitated by financial reforms that enhance domestically oriented firms’ access to credit, stronger incentives for corporate restructuring, policies to bolster the business climate and reduce uncertainty, and by improvements in infrastructure that raise the returns to private investment.
