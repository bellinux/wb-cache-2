5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes <b>degenerate</b> prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes <b>degenerate,</b> and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a <b>degenerate</b> star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a <b>degenerate</b> white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E

5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the <b>degenerate</b> helium core.|$|E

Moderately and severely <b>degenerated</b> cells were normal-sized or atrophic and showed additional changes, including extensive myofibrillar lysis and loss of T tubules. The appearance of the most severely <b>degenerated</b> cells usually reflected the cytoplasmic organelle (sarcoplasmic reticulum, glycogen, or mitochondria) which underwent proliferation and filled the myofibril-free areas of these cells. Moderately and severely <b>degenerated</b> cells {{were present in}} areas of fibrosis, had thickened basement membranes, and had lost their intercellular connections.

5|$|Later on June18, {{forecast}} models {{indicated that}} the system might rapidly <b>degenerate</b> prior to landfall. However, the NHC continued to forecast that the depression would attain tropical storm-status before landfall. Shortly after, the depression became increasingly disorganized as convection separated {{from the center of}} circulation due to increasing wind shear. Stable air ahead of the system inhibited the possibility of rapid development as warm waters supported intensification. By the morning of June19, the center of circulation was situated along the southern edge of deep convection, indicating that the depression was beginning to <b>degenerate.</b> Despite this, the NHC continued to anticipate intensification prior to landfall. Embedded within an easterly flow ahead of a mid-level trough, the storm turned towards the north-northeast and accelerated slightly. At 11:00am PDT (1800UTC), the depression reached its peak intensity with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.62inHg). Operationally, the depression was considered to be slightly stronger, having a minimum pressure of 1001mbar (hPa; 29.56inHg). Later that day, the depression began to <b>degenerate</b> into an open trough as it was situated underneath cirrus clouds instead of cumulonimbus clouds. Visible satellite imagery showed that the depression became increasingly ill-defined and the NHC estimated that the depression degenerated into a trough of low pressure near the Islas Marías during the afternoon of June19. The remnants of the depression were monitored by the United States Naval Research Laboratory for several more hours until the system moved inland over Sinaloa.|$|E

To evaluate the morphology of the caprine preantral follicles in situ, one fragment from each ovary was fixed individually in Carnoy for 12 h, sectioned serially at a thickness of 7 μm and stained with Periodic Acid Shiff-hematoxylin. Preantral follicles were then classified according to the stage of development. Preantral follicles were classified individually either as morphologically normal; as Type 1 <b>degenerated</b> follicles (only the oocyte was degenerated); or as Type 2 <b>degenerated</b> follicles (when degeneration occurred at both oocyte and granulosa cells). The total examined was 235 primordial, 195 primary and 101 secondary follicles. The distribution of <b>degenerated</b> follicles as primordial, primary and secondary follicles was 8. 5, 14. 3 and 16. 8 %, respectively. When Types 1 and 2 <b>degenerated</b> follicles were pooled, secondary follicles were significantly more <b>degenerated</b> than primordial and primary follicles. When degeneration Types 1 and 2 was compared in each follicular class, a higher (P< 0. 05) percentage of Type 1 degeneration was observed in primordial and primary follicles.

When the follicular classes were taken together, a significantly higher percentage of Type 1 <b>degenerated</b> preantral follicles was observed when compared with Type 2 <b>degenerated</b> follicles (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, a low percentage of <b>degenerated</b> preantral follicles was observed and secondary follicles were more affected by degeneration than primordial follicles.
