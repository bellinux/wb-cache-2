500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with this wonderful discovery? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> keep it? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> if <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> your scalp?" [...] asked Zack--"tell us {{all about}} it. Upon my life, you're the most {{interesting}} fellow I ever met with!

6000|$|... "Say, did you, O Rames, also steal {{that other}} signet on your hand, a Queen's gift, I think, {{that once a}} Pharaoh wore? Say also how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the little finger of that hand? Was it perchance in the maw of a certain god that dwells in the secret pool of a temple at holy Thebes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> when you showed {{yourself}} {{not only a}} traitor to the Cause, but a cur, gaining the confidence of your comrades only that you might betray them to a British prison? Can such as you walk the streets freely while I, who have made no pretense of being other than what your governor calls a rebel, must remain in hiding?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Mangin was despised {{by some of}} {{his troops}} (who gave him the {{nickname}} [...] "The Butcher"), his Tenth Army {{was responsible for the}} crucial Allied counter-attack at the Second Battle of the Marne. It was this that largely promoted his military reputation. He also became known for the observation: [...] "Quoi qu'on fasse, on perd beaucoup de monde" [...] ("Whatever <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> a lot of men"). In the closing months of the war, he served as part of General Castelnau's Army Group East, advancing towards Metz.|$|R
5000|$|Routier later {{commented on}} the Silly String video, saying, [...] "He wanted to be seven. I did the only thing I knew to do to honor him and give him all his wishes because he wasn't here anymore.

[...] "A certain amount of non-responsiveness to my advances I can put up with--from a brother--but this morning you are positively inattentive. Tell me your troubles at once.

6000|$|... "'To his own money,' Jocelyn repeated, coming {{a little}} nearer. 'You know, Murchison, well enough what I mean--you and your two confederates here. You're nothing more nor less than common card sharpers. I took {{a pack of}} your cards up-stairs. I needn't say {{anything}} more. I think you'd better give the boy back his money.

40|$|The {{journalist}} John Lloyd {{has written}} extensively {{about the relationship between}} journalism and power. It’s {{at the heart of a}} book I am writing, so I asked John to send me a summary of his views that I had heard him express at a conference a couple of years ago. The idea that interested me sounds obvious, but is not often set out. Journalism is powerful mainly because it organises itself into professional institutions. This gives the individual journalist, or act of journalism, support and resource. If <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> those institutions (for example if we all turned into bloggers!) <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the journalism? Here’s John’s view in full that he was kind enough to send me and that I will quote in part in the book...|$|R

[...] "Just at present he is terribly put out because you lost Brazos. He says Brazos never stumbled in his life, and even if you had fallen from his back he would have stood beside you waiting for you to remount him. You see he was the kindest horse on the ranch--especially picked for me to ride. However in the world <b>DID</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> him, Mr. Bridge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In what manner <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> your eye, Tony," [...] said Charles, {{in a tone}} {{of sympathy}} that Julia blessed him for in her heart, {{although}} she knew that the member was uninjured, and only hidden to favour his disguise. Antonio hesitated a little in his answer, and stammered while giving it--"It was in the wars," [...] at length he got out, and Julia admired the noble magnanimity which would not allow him, even in imagination, to suffer in a less glorious manner--notwithstanding his eye is safe and as beautiful as the other, he has suffered in the wars, thought our heroine, and it is pardonable for him to use the deception, situated as he is--it is nothing more than an equivoque. But this was touching Charles on a favourite chord. Little of a hero as Julia fancied him to be, he delighted in conversing about the war with those men, who, having acted in subordinate stations, would give a different view of the subject from the official accounts, in which he was deeply read. It was no wonder, therefore, that he eagerly seized on the present opportunity to relieve the tedium of a ride between Albany and Schenectady.|$|E
6000|$|The {{first thing}} I would remark on this (and I believe your Lordships have rather gone before {{me in the}} remark) is, that Mr. Hastings came down to Calcutta on the 5th of February; that then, or a few days after, he calls to him his {{confidential}} and faithful friend, (not his official secretary, for he trusted none of his regular secretaries with these transactions,)--he calls him to help him to make out his accounts during his absence. You would imagine that at that time he trusted this man with his account. No such thing: he goes on with the accountant-general, accounting with him for money expended, without ever explaining to that accountant-general how that money came into his hands. Here, then, we have the accountant making out the account, and the person accounting. The accountant does not in any manner make an objection, and say, [...] "Here you are giving me an account by which it appears that you have expended money, but you have not told me where you received it: how shall I make out a fair account of debtor and creditor {{between you and the}} Company?" [...] He does no such thing. There lies a suspicion in his breast that Mr. Hastings must have taken some money in some irregular way, or he could not have made those payments. Mr. Larkins begins to suspect him. [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> this bodkin?" [...] said one lady to another, upon a certain occasion. [...] "Pray, Madam, where did you find it?" [...] Mr. Hastings, at the very moment of his life when confidence was required, even when making up his accounts with his accountant, never told him one word of the matter. You see he had no confidence in Mr. Larkins. This makes out one of the propositions I want to impress upon your Lordships' minds, that no one man did he let into every part of his transactions: a material circumstance, which will help to lead your Lordships' judgment in forming your opinion upon many parts of this cause.|$|E
