5|$|The series begins while set in 1978, as Frank {{gets into}} trouble with the law. Mr. Jarvis (John Stone), {{a man from the}} {{department}} of child services, explains that Frank's father Les (Mario Kery), is a criminal and his mother, Helena (Lee Sanderson) is an alcoholic. As he grows up he aspires to emulate Les' criminal dealings. Pippa and Tom take Frank in as their first foster child. Upon moving to Summer Bay, Frank tries to get a job in Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) shop where he meets Roo. Frank is attracted to Roo and tells Alf that he had been helping Roo with her school work. Alf gives him the job alongside helping Roo with her studies. Frank is not good with school work so he pays his foster brother, Steven to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> They begin dating, but Alf becomes angry with Frank for convincing Roo to skip school. The pair nearly sleep together, but Roo asks him to wait.|$|E
25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both {{had a sense of}} physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|Roly {{has several}} brushes with death over the years. He is {{injured in a}} car {{accident}} caused by a drunk Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and is nearly burnt alive (along with Sharon) when Grant torches The Vic in an insurance scam. However, in October 1993, Roly's luck finally runs out when Sharon asks Grant to take Roly for a walk, but he pays Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) £10 to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> A few hours later, Mandy returns to explain the circumstances of Roly's death to Grant and Sharon. According to Mandy, Roly slipped his lead to chase a cat and was run over by a lorry. Sharon is devastated. 14.8 million viewers tuned in to see Roly's last appearance on-screen.|$|E

60|$|Martyn went off, {{somewhat}} awed. Clarence {{was cold}} and shivering, and stood warming himself. He was {{going to wind up}} his watch, but his hand shook, and I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> noting the hour--twenty minutes past one.|$|R
5000|$|The {{king was}} not pleased with such a son-in-law. He had a sack each of wheat, barley, oats, and rye mixed {{together}} and told Jesper he had to sort them in a day. The ants <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
500|$|Röhm {{was held}} briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler {{considered}} his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm had to die. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or they would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Röhm demurred, telling them, [...] "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself." [...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E
500|$|Peel (presumably one of {{the liberal}} proprietors with {{excellent}} regulations who assured his support) introduced his Bill in 1802. [...] In doing so Peel {{said that he was}} convinced of the existence of gross mismanagement in his own factories, and having no time to set them in order himself, was getting an Act of Parliament passed to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> [...] but (given his dealings with the Manchester Board of Health) this may well have been a pleasantry, rather than the whole truth[...] [...] In 1816 Peel introduced a further Factory Bill; his explanation to the consequent Select Committee of the need for further legislation included this account of the origins of the 1802 Act: The house in which I have a concern gave employment at one time to near one thousand children of this description. [...] Having other pursuits, it was not often in my power to visit the factories, but whenever such visits were made, I was struck with the uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were regulated by the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending on the quantity of the work done, he was often induced to make the poor children work excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling bribes ...|$|E
500|$|Due {{to being}} vivified electricity, Cole {{is unable to}} use vehicles, take up weapons, or swim. Cole easily climbs {{buildings}} and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game; once acquired the player can use experience points, awarded for specific actions, stunts and missions, to increase the power's effectiveness. The growth of these powers is affected by Cole's current Karma level. Starting in a neutral position, it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on the Good side, [...] and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole's, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments, when the action pauses and the player is told, through a monologue by Cole, of two actions that can be taken, always a good and bad option. For example, one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face (Good), or force a civilian to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> (Evil). There are also a number of paired Good/Evil side missions in the game; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal. Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Doing so will lock out any purchased power(s) in the original chosen Karma sector. In addition to altering Cole's appearance and certain aspects of the game's story, Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City, they will come to help Cole in battle if his Karma is Good, but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma.|$|E
50|$|On getting {{degree in}} Computer Science, Guy {{mentions}} {{that he had}} {{set out to be}} a pure math major but he realized that he had no intuition whatsoever for infinite dimensional Banach spaces and that's what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to switch to applied math major.|$|R
60|$|Sir Garnet Wolseley {{set up his}} Kilkenny cat Government in Zululand, or the Home Government <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> I <b>do</b> {{not know}} which.

The boy could not <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but his oldest brother <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and the fox became the prince, the princess's brother. He married the king's daughter, and the gardener's son married his sister.|$|R

50|$|Farll loathes {{both parties}} {{and refuses to}} {{cooperate}} when {{he is on the}} stand. Oxford's solicitor, Mr. Pennington (Alan Mowbray), gets Farll's cousin to testify that he has two moles on his upper left chest. Farll refuses to open his shirt, but Alice <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> proving his true identity. Afterward, Farll and Alice move to where he can paint in blissful seclusion.|$|R
6000|$|John {{was very}} penitent. He {{did not reply}} at first, but putting baby into the crib--where it {{instantly}} drowned with a great yell the shriek of a passing train--he went {{down on his knees}} and began to [...] "swab" [...] up the water with a jack-towel. Loo ran laughingly from the corner where she had been sewing, and insisted on <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Somerset {{shook his}} head. 'No,' he murmured, with the {{composure}} {{of a man}} who, knowing he had done {{nothing of the sort}} himself, was blinded by his own honesty to the possibility that another might have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> 'That must be some other affair with which I had nothing to <b>do.</b> O no, <b>it</b> was nothing like that; the reason for her change of manner was quite different!' ...|$|R

60|$|The Honourable John was {{determined}} to give his cousin a helping hand, as he considered it. He thought that Frank was very ill-used in being put off with so incomplete a stud, and thinking also that the son had not spirit enough to attack his father himself on the subject, the Honourable John determined to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

50|$|British Politicians on Twitter include David Cameron and Nick Clegg. In Australia, the Greens were {{initially}} more successful on Twitter than other political parties. The Australian Labor Party's politicians have used Twitter to attack their opposition, with some one creating a parody account featuring Tony Abbott. Kevin Rudd {{does not appear}} to be making his own tweets, rather some one else is likely to be <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|He didn't like {{opening it}} at fust. The last letter he had 'ad kept <b>'im</b> hiding indoors <b>for</b> a week, {{and then made}} him ship a {{fortnight}} afore 'e had meant to.

60|$|The earl thought {{upon the}} subject, however, a good deal; and before Mr Armstrong's arrival {{he had all}} but {{made up his mind}} that he must again swallow his word, and ask his ward's lover back to his house.

60|$|And so Stubbs {{went off}} happy, pulling at the forelock of his shock {{head of hair}} in honour of the steward's clemency and giving another double pull at it in honour of the farmer's kindness. And as he went he swore within his {{grateful}} heart that if ever Farmer Greenacre wanted a day's work done for nothing, he was the lad to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Which promise it was not probable that he would ever be called on to perform.|$|E
50|$|Cox {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} UNIA and later with the Peace Movement of Ethiopia. In 1936 Cox visited Grant who was by then confined to bed by illness, but who nonetheless agreed to create a $10,000 endowment to fund lobby activities in congress for repatriation and deportation legislation. Grant did not live {{to make good on}} his promise, but his friend Wickliffe Draper <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and also funded additional printings of Cox' book.|$|R
25|$|Miss Elizabeth {{disappeared}} from WWF television until WrestleMania VII, when Savage lost a retirement match to The Ultimate Warrior. Upon his loss, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth, {{who was sitting}} at ringside, entered the ring and defended Savage. Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair and threw {{her out of the}} ring, reuniting Savage and Elizabeth. Macho Man punctuated the reunion by holding down the ropes for Elizabeth after years of her <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{described}} on the live album Festival Wind, Alexander was reading an Internet filk mailing list when his fans observed that they could sing [...] "March of Cambreadth" [...] {{to the tune of}} his children's song [...] "Hap'n'Frog" [...] and vice versa. Determined to embarrass himself before anyone else <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> he took the two songs [...] "and let them have an afternoon together and breed." [...] The result is [...] "Hap'n'Frog of Cambreadth," [...] recorded on Festival Wind.|$|R
60|$|Emma, in the meanwhile, {{could not}} be {{satisfied}} without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting {{at the bottom of}} the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

60|$|Now {{all these}} {{proceedings}} occupied time, for somehow {{it was very}} charming to talk to Miss Lark; and by degrees St. Cleeve informed Tabitha of his great undertaking, and of the voluminous notes he had amassed, which would require so much rearrangement and recopying by an amanuensis as to absolutely appal him. He greatly feared he should not get one careful enough for such scientific matter; whereupon Tabitha said she would be delighted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Then blushing, and declaring suddenly that it had grown quite late, she left him and the garden for her relation's house hard by.|$|E
60|$|The young American {{hesitated for}} a little, debating in his mind whether he should not go down and post up the daily record of his {{impressions}} which he kept for his home-staying sister. But the cigars of Colonel Cochrane and of Cecil Brown were still twinkling {{in the far corner}} of the deck, and the student was acquisitive in the search of information. He did not quite know how to lead up to the matter, but the Colonel very soon <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

50|$|The parents {{continued}} to mistreat their youngest, so he also set out.

He found the same cave and realized from bones and scraps of cloth that it was an ogress's lair, but remained. When she set him to sweep the floor, he called on Tritill, who <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
