25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>pension</b> is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think {{that this can be}} because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} my diploma thesis is a {{comparison}} of the Czech pension system with pension systems of chosen European Union countries. I focus also on planned changes and a further development in the Czech pension system and in chosen states. For the comparison I chose four states ? the Slovak Republic, Poland, Germany and the Great Britain. I chose the Slovak Republic, Poland and Germany because these are states with the pension systems similar to the Czech Republic. On the contrary I selected the Great Britain because its system is very different. The aim of this thesis was to compare pension systems in chosen European Union countries: the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Poland, Germany and the Great Britain and to map their further development. The thesis was processed theoretically and it is focused only on the pension that secures a man in the retirement age. The introduction outlines a demographic development, {{which is one of the}} factors why there are changes in individual systems. Furthermore, in this thesis there are characterized pension systems of the chosen states. There are mentioned conditions for a participation in the pension schemes, types of retirement pensions and conditions for an entitlement to a pension payment. To outline the development of individual systems, I tried, in the second part of the thesis, to briefly describe pension reforms and current changes that occurred. In all countries a necessary condition for an <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>pension</b> payments is to pay a social security insurance that is why I compared amounts of the insurances in individual states, which I further took into account in a discussion. I always compared the Czech Republic with the other states in the discussion. I focused on the comparison of the retirement age, years of the insurance required for the entitlement for the retirement pension, current changes and especially an opt-out system in the Czech Republic which is planned for the next year. I tried to compare the conditions that were during the implementation of this system established in other states and which are planned in this country. I believe that the thesis can be used by a professional and lay public for a better orientation in the legislation of pension systems of the chosen states...|$|E
40|$|The fast {{growth of}} the Chinese oldest old {{population}} indicates higher demand for long-term care. In China, families assume the primary responsibility of caring for older adults. Since the oldest elders {{are more likely to}} be widowed, their adult children usually become their caregivers. Focusing on the Chinese adult children who provide care for their oldest-old parents, this study documented and helped to explain Chinese adult children 2 ̆ 7 s caregiving strain. A conceptual framework was developed based on Pearlin 2 ̆ 7 s stress process theory, Higgins 2 ̆ 7 framework of self-concept discrepancy, and previous studies on family caregivers of elders. Using an existing dataset from the 2005 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey of 895 caregivers and their care recipients, the researcher tested whether and how caregiving context (caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s structured context and care recipients 2 ̆ 7 needs for care), caregiving performance, and sibling support were related to five types of caregiving strain including sacrifice strain, exhaustion strain, capability strain, expectation strain, and dependency strain. The results indicate that caregiving context and caregiving performance are statistically related to different types of caregiver strain. Three independent variables in the set of caregiving context, self-evaluation of living standard, education, and cultural identity, were related to two types of caregiver strain in different directions. The caregivers who were the eldest sons, who were females caring for female elders, who had a close relationship with their care recipients, who lived with the care recipients, who provided care for the elders with more needs for care in ADL (Activities of Daily Living), or whose care recipients had health insurance reported higher levels of at least one type of caregiver strain. Care recipients 2 ̆ 7 cognitive status and <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>pension</b> were negatively related to at least one type of caregiver strain. Caregivers 2 ̆ 7 rural residence, having a job outside the family, having a child under age 16, and care recipient 2 ̆ 7 s needs for care in IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) were not found to be related to any type of caregiver strain. Monetary assistance, which was indicated by the proportion of their annual household per capita income that the caregivers provided to care recipients, was found to be positively related to caregivers 2 ̆ 7 capability strain. The amount of time spent in caregiving (time assistance) was positively related to three types of caregiver strain: exhaustion, expectation, and dependency strain. Time assistance was also found to mediate the relationship between care recipients 2 ̆ 7 needs for care in ADL and caregivers 2 ̆ 7 exhaustion strain and the relationship between dependency strain and three caregiving context variables: closeness between caregivers and care recipients, co-residence with care recipients, and care recipients 2 ̆ 7 needs for care in ADL. The results revealed the importance of caregiving context and caregiving performance in explaining Chinese adult-child caregivers 2 ̆ 7 experience and the necessity of investigating caregiver strain in different dimensions. This study contributes to understanding caregiver strain from a filial perspective. The results imply directions for future research, social work practice and education, and policy legislation in addressing Chinese adult children 2 ̆ 7 s strain in caring for their oldest-old parents...|$|E

30|$|The term ‘legal {{retirement}} age’ usually {{refers to}} {{the age at which}} workers are eligible for benefits. There are strong incentives to stop working after this standard entitlement age. In general, there are indirect restrictions that take the form of an earnings test. Friedberg (2000) and Disney and Smith (2002) show how, above a certain amount of earnings, there is a cut in benefits (not applied to capital income). In some countries, these restrictions are direct (Portugal or Spain make <b>entitlements</b> <b>to</b> <b>pension</b> benefits beyond the standard age conditional on complete withdrawal from work) or frequently, individuals have to leave their current jobs to receive their pensions; see Blondal and Scarpetta (1998) or Gruber and Wise (1997). Indeed, the average retirement age in some OECD countries is very close to this standard retirement age (e.g. the United Kingdom, Portugal or Ireland). 4 For these reasons, in this model we consider the legal retirement age to be the age at which workers must leave the labour force, that is, a mandatory retirement age.|$|R

30|$|Although many {{countries}} consider {{a person to}} be elderly when they have reached 65  years of age, this view is often disputed because of improving life expectancy, {{quality of life and}} level of function within an aged population (Sanderson and Scherbov 2008). Some organisations suggest using the age at which <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> state <b>pensions</b> commences, however definitions of an elderly population are multidimensional and often accommodate factors such as chronology, change in social role and change of capabilities (United Nations 2012). The complexity of defining elderly age means that examining the treatment benefits in an aged population {{has the potential to be}} challenging to clinicians practicing evidence based medicine. The key issue is whether the definition of an elderly person is uniform when examining specific areas of clinical practice, or whether it is variable, and hence produces uncertainty in interpreting the available body of evidence.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to uncover some of the {{mechanisms}} that could make the older workforce willing and able to stay employed. Our focus is on work-related factors that predict the probability of staying in employment despite <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> old-age <b>pension.</b> The analyses are based on data from the first and second waves of the Panel Survey of Ageing and the Elderly (PSAE).

The analysis focuses on the work situation for the respondents in 2002 – 2003. Our analysis shows that physical job demands (negatively) and job satisfaction (positively) have an effect on the probability of staying.

In this Article I examine the historical roots and evolution of the American system of <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> old-age income security in order to understand why in one technical area [...] the integration of private pension plans with Social Security [...] workers 2 ̆ 7 presumed <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> private <b>pensions</b> is less secure than their <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> Social Security.

To answer that question, it is necessary to go far beyond the technical structure of the pension nondiscrimination rules, and examine the historical and political evolution of old-age entitlements and the modern institution of voluntary old-age retirement. The peculiarly prospective character of retirement entitlements is the key to discovering a consistent set of principles upon which an appropriate relationship between public and private retirement benefits can be based...|$|R

Individuals {{are asked to}} take more responsibility, and funded, supplementary pension schemes have been established in many countries.

It examines the debate about whether it is worthwhile for some people <b>to</b> participate in <b>pension</b> schemes that are not mandatory – particularly those with low incomes and/or potentially broken careers.

We identify this effect based on the 1993 reform of the French pension system, which was heterogeneously introduced among the population. With each cohort, the French government gradually increased the incentive to work using two tools: the contribution period required for <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> a full <b>pension</b> and the number of reference earning years taken <b>to</b> calculate <b>pensions.</b> We use a unique database on health and employment in France in 1999 and 2005, when the cohorts affected by the reform started to retire. A difference-in-differences approach, with the control group comprising public sector employees (not concerned by the 1993 reform), finds that the people more affected by the reform, and hence with a stronger incentive to work, were those posting less of an improvement and even a deterioration in their health between 1999 and 2005. Subsequently, taking the reform as a tool to filter out the potential influence of health on employment choices, we show that retirement improves physical and social health. The more physically impacted are the low-educated individuals...|$|R

40|$|To explore {{knowledge}} and understanding among self-employed people of the Class 2 NICS scheme, including liabilities for payments, associated <b>entitlements</b> <b>to</b> contributory <b>pensions</b> and benefits, and views regarding participation in this scheme. The research also considered contributors' {{knowledge and}} understanding and their preferences for payment method. The main findings are: Individual people do not fit neatly into those who do and do not register with the CA, do and do not pay regularly, and do and do not get into debt. People may fall into all these categories at different stages in their working lives. Reasons for not registering immediately for NICs included non-recognition of formal employment status and corresponding NI liabilities and not getting round to the task in a busy start-up period. A number of factors influenced {{the maintenance of a}} pattern of regular payments: feelings of obligations to comply, incentives, in terms of benefits expected in return, avoidance of penalties, interventions, such as advice, prioritisation of income, such that NICS were relatively high on a list of priorities, appropriate methods of collection of payments, and {{knowledge and understanding}}. Many factors lead to people missing Class 2 NICs payments including: financial constraints, financial choices, transitional situations, receipt of wrong information, experience of procedural and administrative aspects, lack of commitment to the NI scheme, dissatisfaction with entitlements and views on indebtedness. Those who got into serious debt to the CA generally had no specific complaints about they way they were treated. Most were trying to repay what they owed. Factors that help people deal with debts to the CA included: considerate, helpful and understanding staff, time to pay, sensible negotiations, advice and support from professionals, stability of income...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDigital human {{modelling}} (DHM) {{has often}} focused on user populations {{that could be}} characterised as able-bodied and in the working age group. It is clear however that demographic changes are resulting in older populations in developed countries but this is also becoming increasingly true even in developing countries. The economic pressures of increased life expectancy are resulting in demands for workers to remain in employment well past what would previously have been considered a normal retirement age. In many countries legislation is increasing retirement ages for <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> state <b>pensions,</b> and enforceable retirement ages are being outlawed. As a consequence older working populations can be expected. Age in the workforce has many positive aspects including increased experience, wisdom, loyalty and motivation, but an inevitable consequence of ageing is negative effects such as the loss of capabilities in strength, mobility, vision and hearing. The challenge of including older workers is recognised as {{an important aspect of}} Inclusive Design and DHM is recognised as a potentially useful method for its implementation. Today's highly demanding and competitive working environments require the highest levels of productivity from individuals so that overall operational and business objectives can be achieved. DHM-based workplace risk assessment methods have successfully been used to improve working environments by conducting virtual posture based ergonomic risk analysis. Older workers are significantly different from younger workers in terms of their physical, physiological and cognitive capabilities and these capabilities directly or indirectly affect human work performance. This article suggests the use of human capability data in a virtual environment to explore the level of acceptability of a working strategy based on real capability data (joint mobility in this case) of older workers. A case study shows that the proposed DHM-based inclusive design method is useful recommending working strategies that are acceptable for older workers in terms of work productivity, well-being and safety...|$|R

Such an applicant must satisfy, among other things, a requirement that the anxiety or other mental condition that he/she experiences is not idiosyncratic and personal but service-related and is a diagnosed mental illness described in the Statements of Principle (SoP) issued by the Repatriation Medical Authority. This article argues that the tradition of skepticism and circumspection taken toward service-caused mental harm claims in this jurisdiction has been confirmed in 2 ̆ 7 Todd v Repatriation Commission 2 ̆ 7 to apply to the situation in which an applicant wishes <b>to</b> argue <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> a <b>pension</b> because diagnosis with asbestosis has triggered a fear of cancer. In 2 ̆ 7 Todd 2 ̆ 7, the Federal Court found that, because there was evidence that the applicant had been experiencing most, if not all of these symptoms for some time previously he could not satisfy the SoP requirement that there was a connection between his GAD and the conditions of his military service.
