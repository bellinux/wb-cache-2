5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton brokers in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the <b>forger.</b> The police began to search for the <b>forger</b> of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the <b>forger</b> they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their <b>forger.</b>|$|E

In 1392, a man was boiled alive in Nuremberg for having raped and murdered his own mother. Coin <b>forgers</b> were boiled to death in 1452 in Danzig and in 1471 in Stralsund. Even as late as in 1687, a man was boiled to death in oil in Bremen for having been of valuable help to some coin <b>forgers</b> who had escaped justice.|$|R

5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the <b>forger,</b> and hearing that Stern had paid ninemillion DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the <b>forger</b> agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all along that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E
5|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex {{is believed to}} be the Mountain God with split head. This image was otherwise unknown in the 1960s. Other examples of it were later discovered at the Maya sites of Tancah and Pasión del Cristo. Coe and his colleagues argue that it is very unlikely that a <b>forger</b> would have known about this deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} that {{is estimated to}} take about 15 minutes on average to complete. Using the WASD keys and mouse, the player controls the main character, an unnamed spy who participates in an alcohol-smuggling operation. The player works alongside non-playable characters Anita, a demolitions expert, and Borges, a <b>forger.</b> The game follows the group as they prepare for a heist and experience its aftermath. The robbery is omitted from the game, although it is revealed that it went wrong.|$|E
50|$|Up to {{a certain}} point, most of the Spanish <b>Forger’s</b> miniatures had been {{identified}} due to unique stylistic characteristics. In 2009, Lucia Burgio, Robin Clark, and Richard Hark performed spectroscopic investigation, comprehensive analysis of pigments by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence, upon five of the Spanish <b>Forger’s</b> miniatures {{in order to determine}} with scientific certainty that the forgeries were exactly that. Use of the pigments ultramarine blue (first synthesized after 1828) and Scheele’s green (synthesized after 1775) were discovered, providing solid evidence that the <b>Forger’s</b> imitations were fabricated in post-medieval period.|$|R

5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the {{following}} day, the reporter revealed an additional lure {{he had brought}} with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call {{him as soon as}} he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the <b>forger,</b> to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through {{the inclusion of a}} German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish <b>forger</b> who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E

5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted <b>forger,</b> was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.|$|E
5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his <b>forger</b> try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
5|$|English Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson cast strong doubts {{upon the}} {{authenticity}} of the Grolier Codex in his 1975 article The Grolier Codex, published in volume 27 of the Contributions of the University of California. Thompson argued that the codex was a modern forgery and that the unusual mix of styles in the document was not due to the mixing of cultures but rather due to the hand of a <b>forger.</b> Thompson queried the illustration of all four stations of Venus in the codex, noting that other Mesoamerican codices only illustrated the more spectacular appearance of Venus as morning star. This claim has been refuted more recently, with evidence presented from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis that the god of the morning star also presided over the evening star. The contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices, although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{initially}} titled {{this new}} work Tintin et les Faussaires ("Tintin and the Forgers") before changing this working title to Tintin et L'Alph-Art. The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, {{was based on}} a real-life art <b>forger,</b> Fernand Legros, whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the Paris Match. In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980. Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.|$|E
5|$|Monroe Edwards (1808– January 27, 1847) was an American slave trader, <b>forger</b> {{and convicted}} {{criminal}} {{who was the}} subject of a well-publicized trial and conviction in 1842. Originally from Kentucky, Edwards moved to New Orleans then settled in Texas. He smuggled slaves into Brazil in 1832, and used the proceeds to purchase land in Texas. In 1836 he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to swindle his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the Republic of Texas to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various abolitionists in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's {{success as}} a leader of the {{opposition}} only intensified the Queen's animosity towards the Marlboroughs. Although she could not dismiss Sarah from Anne's service, Mary responded by evicting Sarah from her court lodgings at the Palace of Whitehall. Anne responded by leaving the court as well, and Sarah and she went to stay with their friends Charles Seymour, the sixth Duke of Somerset, and Elizabeth, the Duchess of Somerset at Syon House. Anne continued to defy the Queen’s demand for Sarah’s dismissal, even though an incriminating document signed by the Earl of Marlborough supporting the recently exiled James II and his supporters had been discovered. This document is likely to have been forged by Robert Young, a known <b>forger</b> and disciple of Titus Oates; Oates was famous for stirring a strongly anti-Catholic atmosphere in England between 1679 and the early 1680s. The Earl was imprisoned in the Tower of London. The loneliness Sarah suffered during these events drew her and Anne closer together.|$|E

5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the <b>forger</b> repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E
5|$|The Prison Gallery showcases {{and offers}} for sale the artworks {{of current and}} ex-prisoners of Western Australia. It also hosts other {{exhibits}} related {{to the history of}} the prison, including historical artefacts. Many cells and areas of the prison depict prisoners' artwork, including that of the 19th-century <b>forger</b> James Walsh, whose artwork was hidden beneath layers of white-wash for decades. Painting or drawing on walls was originally forbidden, though graffiti, which could be viewed as art or vandalism, occurred throughout the prison's operational years. This rule was relaxed in special cases – including, from 1976, long-term prisoners within their own cells – but only for work considered art and not graffiti. Art, or art therapy, was not officially permitted until the 1980s; graffiti was never formally permitted, but in the prison's last six months, with closure imminent, the rule was not enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a <b>forger</b> played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E
