The engine is a gasoline-powered 360-cubic-inch Chrysler V8, same as in the early gas models of the M113 armored personnel carriers. Its 5-speed manual transmission allows it to traverse relatively rough terrain. The M706 has a road speed of 62 mi/h km/h, and can travel across water at 3 mi/h km/h. A Commando's armor consists of <b>high</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>alloy</b> steel called Cadaloy, which protects against projectiles up to 7.62×51mm. Partly because of its armor, the M706 has an unloaded mass of over 7 tons. As a result, a common problem with the vehicle is rear axle failure caused by the extreme weight. However, because the armor also provides the monocoque structural framework, it can be lighter than a soft vehicle to which armor has been added, and the angle of the armor also helps protect against hits and mine blasts.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of a <b>high</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>alloy</b> steel containing microstructural banding were determined in both transverse (T-L) and longitudinal (L-T) orientations {{with respect to}} the rolling direction. Tests undertaken included tensile, Charpy impact, fracture toughness, stress corrosion and constant amplitude fatigue. The specimen orientation was found to have little influence on the tensile properties however, Charpy V-notch specimens tested in the L-T orientation showed impact energy values four times higher than those in the T-L orientation. When fatigue tested, microstructural banding in the steel caused secondary cracking normal to the primary crack direction which in turn was found to influence crack propagation and fracture resistance. Discontinuous bands normal to the direction of the primary fracture plane (L-T orientation) were beneficial in resisting crack extension whereas, when the bands were continuous (T-L orientation), they were detrimental to the overall fracture process. The morphology of secondary cracking in the L-T orientation was different to the secondary cracking observed in the T-L orientation. Secondary cracking in the L-T orientation promoted crack arrest and resulted in higher mechanical properties when compared with specimens tested in T-L orientation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a wear study of {{innovative}} Ti-Ta alloys is present. Samples of Ti- 30 %Ta, Ti- 52 %Ta, were produced by laser cladding. This technology uses a high power density {{generated by a}} laser beam to melt the base material and the filler material. The interaction between the laser and the substrate {{is a function of}} the radiation absorption properties of the material and that conditions the heat flow. Laser technology allows working with high temperatures and melting powders of titanium and the alloying elements as tantalum. As this is a continuous process enables rapid cooling of the molten material and the consequent solidification. The principal importance of these innovative alloys is the low Young’s Modulus, the closest to Young´s Modulus of the bone, the biocompatibility of titanium and tantalum and consequently its applicability to biomedical industry. The wear behavior is an important factor that influences the structural integrity of materials and must be studied for innovative alloys. So in this work the micro-scale abrasive wear tests were used to characterize the wear behavior of Ti- 30 %Ta, Ti- 52 %Ta alloys. The results shows that the wear volume increases linearly as the rotation of the ball test and with the sliding distance and the analysis of the ball cratering shows that for this test there just grooving abrasion and the volume wear abrasion is higher for the <b>highest</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>alloy...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>hardness</b> TiAlN <b>alloys</b> for {{wear-resistant}} coatings exhibit limited lifetimes at elevated temperatures {{due to a}} cubic-AlN to hexagonal-AlN {{phase transformation}} that leads to decreasing hardness. We enhance the hardness (up to 46 GPa) and maximum operating temperature (up to 1050 degrees C) of TiAlN-based coatings by alloying with scandium nitride to form both an epitaxial TiAlScN alloy film and epitaxial rocksalt TiN/(Al,Sc) N superlattices on MgO substrates. The superlattice hardness increases with decreasing period thickness, which is understood by the Orowan bowing mechanism of the confined layer slip model. These results make them worthy of additional research for industrial coating applications. Funding Agencies|National Science Foundation; U. S.

It is concluded that the refining element {{should be able to}} spontaneously produce precipitates at high temperatures with little solubility in their Cr-rich counterparts. After exploring the theoretical backgrounds on how to select the refining element, Nb and Zr were selected and the phase formation reactions of Zr- or Nb-modified Ni-Cr-B-Si-C alloys were calculated using Thermo-Calc (R) simulations.

The constitution and microstructure of the alloy have been studied for aging treatments between 800 degrees C and 600 degrees C using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. For a long aging duration and for the highest temperatures, micrometric precipitates of mu phase are found preferentially at grain boundaries of the alloy. At lower temperatures, nanometric precipitates of R phase are observed inside the grains in addition to mu sub-micron precipitates at the grain boundaries. The mu precipitates show lattice parameters slightly different from the Fe 7 Mo 6 phase and contain a high density of crystalline defects.

Heat treatments were chosen to simulate an industrial production line for car body-sheet material and included natural ageing (NA), pre-ageing at 80 °C (PA), paint-bake ageing at 180 °C (PB) and 10 second ageing at 180 °C (spike). The Cu content and the chosen heat treatments were found to influence the microstructural evolution of the alloy considerably. Based on the determined microstructures and matrix solute concentrations, mechanisms for the effect of NA, PA and Cu additions were proposed. NA had a deleterious effect on the PB hardening response, which was delayed dramatically after 20 minutes NA or longer. When the NA time was 1 minute, β" precipitates were formed within 30 minutes PB resulting in <b>high</b> <b>hardness</b> of the <b>alloy.</b> The delay with NA time was caused by a decrease in the nucleation rate of elongated precipitates during the subsequent PB. This decrease was thought to be due to a combination of a decrease in the matrix solute concentrations and clusters acting as vacancy sinks. PA before NA improved the PB response due to the formation of a high density of short elongated precipitates. Small Mg-Si clusters were detected after both NA and PA. Clusters formed during PA were found to be, on average, Mg-richer and larger than those formed during NA. Larger clusters were found to be more stable during PB and, upon PB, to grow into nucleation sites for elongated precipitates. Application of a spike before PA resulted in faster growth of clusters during PA. Growth of clusters and nucleation of short elongated precipitates during PB was found to be enhanced with increasing Cu content when no PA was given. Cu was found to be present in all precipitates and clusters in the alloy with the highest Cu content. These precipitates were thought to be precursors to the Q' phase.
