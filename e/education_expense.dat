On {{one hand}} are {{positive changes in}} lifestyle, raising of living standards, now people eat better, wear better clothes, use amenities and facilities seen in towns.

The costs in farming were little, medical expenses almost non-existent, no expense on water-electricity, no <b>education</b> <b>expense,</b> no transportation expense; no expense on detergents & cosmetics. The expenses were very few since the living standards were low and even little income led to an economy of surplus & self-reliance. In addition, farmers do not know where their interests lie.

As a matter of fact such rallies are to benefit other sections of society at the cost of the farmer.|$|E

40|$|Education {{may be a}} {{cornerstone}} of our society, but the tax treatment of higher <b>education</b> <b>expenses</b> {{does not appear to}} have resulted from an intellectual exercise that would make our nation’s educators’ proud. The Internal Revenue Code provides two separate, but equally unsatisfying, routes that allow taxpayers to offset their income with the costs of higher education. Where an individual can reduce her tax liability while receiving an education, the effect is to reduce significantly the cost of that education. First, where amounts spent on education qualify as an “ordinary and necessary business expense,” a taxpayer will be entitled to deduct such expenses in computing her taxable income. However, the Service’s current interpretation of this deduction is more restrictive with respect to <b>education</b> <b>expenses</b> than with respect to other expenditures. The second, and more limited, route to obtaining a tax subsidy arises from certain tax incentives enacted for higher <b>education</b> <b>expenses.</b> These incentives include exclusions from gross income for certain amounts used to pay for higher <b>education</b> <b>expenses,</b> as well as a number of deductions or credits for taxpayers who make such expenditures. While providing incentives for higher education is a worthy goal, the tax incentive provisions consist of a hodgepodge of confusing statutes that fail to meet their stated objectives. The correlation between education and compensation – i. e., the more education one has, the more one earns – should be properly reflected in the tax code. More specifically, the Code should be revised to provide similar tax treatment for <b>education</b> <b>expenses</b> as is afforded other business expenses. This Article will discuss the tax treatment of higher educational expenses. Part II traces the history of Section 162 with respect to <b>education</b> <b>expenses</b> leading to the Service’s current interpretation, and provides criticism of the current law in this area. Part III discusses the myriad of tax incentive provisions set forth in the Code, and it briefly discusses some of the concerns associated with those provisions. Part IV provides a framework for revising the Code in connection with higher <b>education</b> <b>expenses,</b> providing guidelines for when such expenses should be currently deductible and when capitalization and amortization should be required. Part V concludes the Article. This Article does not attempt to address generally whether the government should subsidize such education. The Code has, for years, provided tax incentives for higher education. Nor is it an attempt to end the debate on whether incentives for higher education should be provided through the tax code. Rather, this Article attempts to discuss the current and historical tax treatment of higher <b>education</b> <b>expenses</b> and to provide a system that more properly matches a taxpayer’s income with the associated educational expenses...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether an <b>education</b> <b>expense</b> is deductible, taxpayers must examine {{a series of}} tests. The first test determines whether the education qualifies under Section 162 as a trade or business expense. To pass this test, the taxpayer must be engaged in a trade or business and the education must have a direct and proximate relationship to the individual's skills required {{in his or her}} profession. If the taxpayer does not satisfy both criteria, then the education is considered personal in nature and is not deductible. If the individual satisfies both criteria, then another set of tests are analyzed. The second test is often ref erred to as the disqualifying test. Under this test, if the education is required to meet the minimum educational requirements or if {{it is part of a}} program of study that qualifies the taxpayer for a new trade or business, then the <b>education</b> <b>expense</b> is never deductible. Educational expenses that survive the disqualifying test are then analyzed using the third and final test often referred to as the qualifying test. The two criteria of the qualifying test allow an expenditure to be deductible provided the education maintains or improves the skills required in the taxpayer's business or is required to maintain the individual's current employment status.

40|$|Since 2005, Ethiopia {{has been}} {{implementing}} a large-scale housing program {{which aims to}} reduce the housing supply shortage and improve the living standard of the urban low and middle income households {{through the construction of}} high-rise condominium houses equipped with basic services. This paper evaluates the impact of the condominium housing program on the welfare of the beneficiary households using a cross-sectional data from a sample of 335 households who applied for the houses, in Mekelle city. To account for the selection bias due to differences in observable characteristics the PSM method is used. Moreover, to check the robustness of the impact estimates sensitivity analysis is applied. The result shows that the program has a positive significant impact on wealth of household, approximated by a wealth index including housing quality, use of consumer durables and access to services, and on annual total <b>education</b> <b>expense</b> of households per attending child. The wealth index and the annual total <b>education</b> <b>expense</b> per attending child of the beneficiary households have increased by 0. 23 to 0. 25 and by Birr 502 to Birr 641, respectively. However, there is no statistically significant evidence as whether the program affects the other welfare indicators (monthly per capita food expenditure, incidence of sickness and children’s educational attainment, as explained by highest level of children’s schooling and by the proportion of school age children attending school). The sensitivity analysis on the significant outcome indicators shows that the estimations are robust to deviations from the identifying CIA assumption...|$|E
