In 2010 speaking of his ten-year tenure on the serial Dawson said he felt he like he was [...] "turning a bit into Ken Barlow" [...] and added that he enjoyed playing Darren more each year. Dawson added that he was [...] "still learning" [...] and did not take his role for granted. He stated, [...] "I’m not ignorant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I can just go off and be a Hollywood star! I’d like to take on some more challenges for Darren".|$|E

If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{arraignment}} {{was spent}} on Durkin's disclosure of his connections with Hastert. Durkin contributed $500 in 2002 and $1000 in 2004 to the Hastert for Congress campaign; the contributions were made while Durkin was a partner {{at the law firm}} Mayer Brown, before he was appointed to the federal bench in 2012, and Hastert's son Ethan is a partner at Mayer Brown. At the arraignment, Durkin stated he had never met Hastert and that [...] "I have no doubt I can be impartial in this matter," [...] but also said that [...] "I am not naive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that a reasonable person would not question my impartiality" [...] and gave the parties time to decide whether to object and thus trigger the reassignment of the case to a different judge. On June 11, federal prosecutors and Hastert's lawyers filed notices waiving any objection to Durkin presiding over the case.|$|E

500|$|... "And {{he never}} tried to impress {{us that he was}} doing any miracles," [...] Welles recalled. [...] "I was calling for things only a {{beginner}} would have been ignorant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> anybody could ever do, and there he was, doing them." [...] Toland later explained that he wanted to work with Welles because he anticipated the first time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do. Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities. During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.|$|E
500|$|During his childhood, and {{owing to}} his {{considerable}} strength and bulk, Steiger {{became known as}} [...] "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he {{ran away from home}} at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II. [...] He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: [...] "I loved the Navy. I was stupid <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I was being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon, which became known as Halsey's Typhoon, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115mph) and [...] waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the Taussig survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.|$|E

[...] "Thank you to the Coens for being crazy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I could do that and put {{one of the most}} horrible hair cuts in history on my head," [...] Bardem said in his {{acceptance}} speech at the 80th Academy Awards. He dedicated the award to Spain and to his mother, actress Pilar Bardem, who accompanied him to the ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, the Ascension {{itself has}} become an embarrassment, a remnant of an outmoded cosmology. As {{expressed}} in a famous statement by theologian Rudolf Bultmann in his essay The New Testament and Mythology: [...] "We no longer believe in the three-storied universe which the creeds take for granted... No one who is old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for himself supposes that God lives in a local heaven ... And if this is so, the story of Christ's ... ascension into heaven is done with." [...] Modern theologians have therefore de-mythologised a heaven in which God sits enthroned above Jerusalem for one which is [...] "the endless, self-sustaining life of God," [...] and the Ascension which is [...] "an emblem {{in space and time}} of God's eternal life." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] {{was awarded}} the Hugo Award in 1968 for the [...] "Best Dramatic Presentation" [...] at that year's World Science Fiction Convention. This {{was based on the}} filmed version, and not Ellison's original. But since the script {{remained}} credited to Ellison, he won the award once more. It was 25 years before another television program won that award again, the next occasion being for the episode [...] "" [...] from [...] Roddenberry later claimed that he was present at the Hugo Awards, and said that Ellison rushed past him up onto the stage. However, he was not present. Ellison remarked afterwards when talking about the Hugo win for the filmed version of the script, [...] "I would like to be arrogant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the script was so good that even butchering it couldn't hurt it" [...] and that compared to the other episodes of Star Trek that it was [...] "a pretty good show". Roddenberry would claim in response to Ellison's awards wins for the episode, that he had won a Nebula Award for his work on it. However, this was untrue, and the Dramatic Presentation category was not created until 1974.|$|E
