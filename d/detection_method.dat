5|$|For visual localization, {{the robot}} {{estimates}} its position {{relative to the}} aircraft using visual elements (doors, windows, tires, static ports etc.) of the aircraft. During {{the evolution of the}} robot, these visual elements are extracted from a three-dimensional virtual model of the aircraft and projected in the image plane of the cameras. The projected shapes are used for pattern recognition to detect those visual elements. The other <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> used is based on the extraction of features with a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) approach. A pairing is performed between images of each element to be detected and the actual scene experienced.|$|E
5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance <b>detection</b> <b>method,</b> Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E

Moving shadow <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> can employ the frame difference technique to locate moving objects and their moving shadows. Then, {{the problem of}} shadow detection becomes differentiating the moving objects and the moving shadows. Prati et al. [11] provided a good review for shadow <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> in video sequences. To adapt to background changes, learning approaches have proven useful. Huang and Chen [12] employed Gaussian mixture model to learn the color features and to model the background appearance variations under cast shadows. Brisson and Zaccarin [13] presented an unsupervised kernel-based approach to estimate the cast shadow direction. Siala et al. [14] described a moving shadow detection algorithm by training the manually segmented shadow regions. Joshi and Papanikolopoulos [15] used SVM and co-training technique to detect shadows. Compared with static shadow <b>detection</b> <b>methods,</b> moving shadow <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> can employ the powerful background subtraction techniques. Therefore, the majority of moving shadow <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> cannot be directly used to detect static shadows in single images.|$|R

From the current technology, the <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> of fatigue driving are mainly divided into three categories [20]: <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> based on physiological indicators, <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> based on driver behavior characteristics analysis, and <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> based on facial expression recognition.|$|R

30|$|Several {{studies for}} {{detecting}} game bots {{have been proposed}} in academia and industry. These studies can be classified into three categories: client-side, network-side, and server-side. Most game companies have adopted client-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> that analyze game bot signatures as the primary measure against game bots. Client-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> use the bot program’s name, process information, and memory status. This method is similar to antivirus programs that detect computer viruses (Mohaisen and Alrawi 2014). Client-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> can be readily detoured by game bot developers, in addition to degrading the computer’s performance. For this reason, many countermeasures {{that are based on}} this approach, such as commercial anti-bot programs, are not currently preferred. Network-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods,</b> such as network traffic monitoring or network protocol change analysis, can cause network overload and lag in game play, a significant annoyance in the online gaming experience. To overcome these limitations of the client-side and network-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods,</b> many online game service providers employ server-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods.</b> Server-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> are based on data mining techniques that analyze log data from game servers. Most game servers generate event logs whenever users perform actions such as hunting, harvesting, and chatting. Hence, these in-game logs facilitate data analysis as a possible method for detecting game bots. Online game companies analyze user behaviors or packets at the server-side, and then online game service providers can selectively block those game bot users that they want to ban without deploying additional programs on the client-side. For that, most online game service providers prefer server-side <b>detection</b> <b>methods.</b> In addition, some online game companies introduced big data analysis system approaches that make use of data-driven profiling and detection (Lee et al. 2016). Such approaches can analyze over 600 TB of logs generated by game servers and do not cause any side-effects, such as performance degradation or conflict with other programs.|$|R

25|$|Absence of {{evidence}} {{is a condition}} in which no valid conclusion can be inferred from the mere absence of detection, normally due to doubt in the <b>detection</b> <b>method.</b> Evidence of absence is the successful variation: a conclusion that relies on specific knowledge in conjunction with negative detection to deduce the absence of something. An example {{of evidence}} of absence is checking your pockets for spare change and finding nothing, but being confident that the search would have found it if it was there.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{ground-based}} methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use. The first <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> {{is called the}} air Cherenkov telescope, designed to detect low-energy (<200nbsp&GeV) cosmic rays by means of analyzing their Cherenkov radiation, which for cosmic rays are gamma rays emitted as they travel faster {{than the speed of}} light in their medium, the atmosphere. While these telescopes are extremely good at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic-ray origin, they can only function well on clear nights without the Moon shining, and have very small fields of view and are only active for a few percent of the time. Another Cherenkov telescope uses water as a medium through which particles pass and produce Cherenkov radiation to make them detectable.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{similarity}} of different amino acid sequences {{has been the most}} common method of inferring homology. Sequence similarity is considered a good predictor of relatedness, since similar sequences are more likely the result of gene duplication and divergent evolution, rather than the result of convergent evolution. Amino acid sequence is typically more conserved than DNA sequence (due to the degenerate genetic code), so is a more sensitive <b>detection</b> <b>method.</b> Since some of the amino acids have similar properties (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size), conservative mutations that interchange them are often neutral to function. The most conserved sequence regions of a protein often correspond to functionally important regions like catalytic sites and binding sites, since these regions are less tolerant to sequence changes.|$|E
25|$|Neutrinos {{cannot be}} {{detected}} directly, {{because they do}} not ionize the materials they are passing through (they do not carry electric charge and other proposed effects, like the MSW effect, do not produce traceable radiation). A unique reaction to identify antineutrinos, sometimes referred to as inverse beta decay, as applied by Reines and Cowan (see below), requires a very large detector to detect a significant number of neutrinos. All detection methods require the neutrinos to carry a minimum threshold energy. So far, there is no <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> for low-energy neutrinos, in the sense that potential neutrino interactions (for example by the MSW effect) cannot be uniquely distinguished from other causes. Neutrino detectors are often built underground to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation.|$|E
