Amaris Castilloof of Latina summarized that Fernández and Aguilera [...] "appear {{to be in an}} abandoned mansion and overwhelmed with a tremendous desire for each other." [...] She provided a mixed review for the video, questioning if the [...] "glimpses of skin touching, scenes of someone swimming (we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who)</b> with luxurious pearls, and a cheesy telenovela-esque embrace" [...] were overdone.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Hawke {{appeared}} alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert De Niro in Great Expectations, {{a contemporary}} film {{adaptation of the}} Charles Dickens novel of the same name, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. During the same year, Hawke collaborated with Linklater again on The Newton Boys, based on {{the true story of}} the Newton Gang. Critical reviews for both films were mixed. The following year, Hawke starred in Snow Falling on Cedars, based on David Guterson's novel of the same title. The film met with an unenthusiastic reception; Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> Ishmael is or why he acts as he does." ...|$|E

Ferguson changed into the club tracksuit in order {{to carry out his}} television duties. Speculation that the player who threw the pizza was Cesc Fàbregas arose when Cole hinted that the culprit was neither English nor French. In his autobiography, Ferguson said: [...] "They say it was Cesc Fàbregas who threw the pizza at me but, to this day, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> the culprit is."

500|$|... "Acércate" [...] {{was leaked}} onto the Internet {{prior to the}} album's release; a first in Queen's 15-year career. Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E
500|$|The lead single, [...] "La Vida es Así", was {{released}} on May 11; the music video (directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on May 17 in Miami and premiered on mun2 on June 22 and VEVO on June 28. Queen said that the genre of bachata is meaningful, since it reveals more feelings. The a cappella version of [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production, allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred. The Keko Musik version was later released as a pre-order bonus track for Drama Queen on iTunes. The second single, [...] "Amor Puro" [...] {{was released}} for Puerto Rican radio on September 24. The music video (also directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on September 28, and premiered on VEVO November 30. The video was also filmed in Miami, at the Spanish monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (a historic building dating to 1133 in Sacramenia, Segovia, Spain, later reconstructed in Miami). [...] "Acércate" [...] was leaked online before the album was released, the first time Queen experienced copyright infringement in her 15-year career. Originally titled [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} copyright violation and retitled [...] "Acércate". She said, [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song.

2500|$|While {{commonly}} {{cited as}} the father of Christian rock, Larry Norman struggled to gain acceptance from the Christian music industry, and was largely estranged from it for his career. His 1969 solo debut has been described by secular observers as [...] "perhaps the first truly accomplished and relevant Christian rock testimony ever recorded," [...] and 1972's Only Visiting This Planet {{became one of the most}} revered albums of all time in Christian music.

2500|$|The {{place of}} the divi among state deities is far from clear. They had {{precedent}} in the di parentes, who were elevated to [...] "godhead" [...] by their sons and accorded ancestral rites, but dead ancestors, no matter how honoured, remained manes of the underworld. A mortal did not normally possess the divine power (numen), which according to Gradel [...] "can also be synonymous with deus". Official divi were politico-religious creations of the senate {{or at least the}} senate played a formal role in their creation. As long as the correct rituals and sacrifice were offered, the divus would be received by the heavenly gods as a coelicola (a dweller in heaven), a lesser being than themselves. What the divus was supposed to be or do in heaven was left to imagination, not theology. Popular belief held that the divus Augustus would be personally welcomed by Jupiter but in Seneca's Apocolocyntosis, the unexpected arrival of Augustus' equally divine descendant Claudius creates a problem for the Olympians. They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> or what he is and when they find out, they cannot think what to do with him. Seneca's sarcastic wit, an unacceptable impiety towards a deus, freely portrays the divus Claudius as just a dead, ridiculous and possibly quite bad emperor.|$|E

Tom Hudson, his wife (Kristin Peterson) and Kristy, together with several others at the accident scene are captured and held hostage within this tunnel which has already been closed off on both sides by the group. Seven hours, no communication is heard from the tunnel - the police, the anti-terrorism unit and the general public <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> the [...] "terrorists" [...] are or what they want. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Tamuno tells Tom that they are in Los Angeles to save Ebiere and declares that if Ebiere is eventually hung in Nigeria, then the [...] "truly guilty" [...] ones should go with her.
