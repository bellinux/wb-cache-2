This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place.

In the following year, he asked the monks of Chartreux to oversee the spiritual welfare of his college, which he had set on a firmer footing, with regular rules, approved by the Chapter of Notre Dame Cathedral. The Admiral of France, Louis Malet de Graville gave him a property which brought in 120 livres a year, which he used for the College. The Admiral also paid for a new building. He got another gift to the same value the following year from Jean de Rochechouart, which he dedicated to the college. When he preached at St Georges at Abbéville during Lent in 1496, the only payment he asked for was some black and <b>grey</b> <b>cloth</b> to clothe his students.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{thousand}} {{copies of}} The Story of Miss Moppet were released in a panorama format priced at a shilling in November 1906, and another 10,000 copies in December 1906. There were no subsequent printings in the panorama format. The strip folded accordion-fashion into a <b>grey</b> <b>cloth</b> wallet measuring [...] When opened, the panorama strip measured [...] As Lear writes, Potter [...] "experimented with a panorama format of fourteen pictures on one long {{strip of paper}} which folded into a wallet tied with a ribbon". Lear explains that the format [...] "although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful, because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded". Potter referred to this fact late in life when she said, [...] "Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long strips—The shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to fold up again". MacDonald {{points out that the}} fragile panorama format was inappropriate for very young children.|$|E

50|$|Taylor soon {{started to}} get into trouble with the police and in May 1905 at the age of 16 was arrested for {{insulting}} behaviour. He was discharged without conviction by the local magistrates, {{but this was the first}} of many court appearances.

5000|$|At the 2010 Winter NAMM expo Vox {{introduced}} the Custom series; these models were updates to the 2004 Custom Classic series amplifiers and featured two channels (Normal and Top Boost) with two inputs {{for each channel}} (High and Low), more akin to the original AC30/4 layout released in 1958. It was available with either Greenback speakers (C2) or Alnico Blue Speakers (C2x), and was also available as the AC15. Later limited edition models include the AC30BL, a tygoon blue tolex with <b>grey</b> speaker <b>cloth,</b> an AC30C2RD with a red finish, an AC30C2-BRG a British Racing Green tolex finish with a <b>grey</b> speaker <b>cloth</b> and the AC30C2 Black Comet; featuring a patterned finish all are identical to the C2. The amp featured an option known as [...] "Jumping" [...] where the High-Normal channel could {{be linked to the}} Low-Top Boost channel with a patch lead, whilst the guitar is plugged into the High-Top Boost channel, allowing both channels to sound and create a fuller, thicker overdrive sound. The amp also featured a solid-state rectifier to increase reliability. Controls include a Normal volume, Top Boost Volume, Treble and Bass controls, Reverb Tone and Level controls, Tremolo Speed and Depth controls, a Tone Cut control (to add further control over the higher-frequencies), a Master Volume, and a Standby and Power Switch. A true bypass effects loop, extension cab output and external cab output were also included; as well as an input for the external foot switch (to control Reverb and Tremolo). The amps are produced in China. The amps were released to critical success, garnering awards such as Music Radar's [...] "Guitarist Choice" [...] award.|$|R
50|$|The {{early to}} mid 1950s also {{witnessed}} {{the beginnings of}} the Ivy League look among young, wealthy high school and college students in the Eastern United States. Due to the GI Bill, more men were able {{to go to college and}} aspired to imitate both the wardrobe and the athletic pursuits of the long-established upper class students. Typical hairstyles included the crew cut, Harvard clip, and regular haircut, and common accessories included cardigan sweaters, sweater vests, Nantucket reds, khaki chino pants, white Oxford shirts, Tootal or Brooks Brothers ties, Ascot neckties, tartan, <b>grey</b> tweed <b>cloth</b> or flannel sportcoats, and seersucker blazers in the South. Known as Squares, Socs, and Jocks, this subculture underwent a revival in the 1980s as the preppy look.|$|R
60|$|The summer {{dress of}} the Indian {{is almost entirely}} {{provided}} for him by the Hudson Bay Company. It consists chiefly of a blue or <b>grey</b> <b>cloth,</b> or else a blanket capote reaching below the knee, made much too loose for the figure, and strapped round the waist with a scarlet or crimson worsted belt. A very coarse blue striped cotton shirt is all the underclothing they wear, holding trousers to be quite superfluous; in lieu of which they make leggins of various kinds of cloth, which reach from a few inches above the knee down to the ankle. These leggins are sometimes very tastefully decorated with bead-work, particularly those of the women, and are provided with flaps or wings on either side.|$|E
60|$|Cossar, the {{well-known}} civil engineer, {{found them in}} the great doorway of the flat mansions, Redwood holding out the damp pink paper, and Bensington on tiptoe reading over his arm. Cossar was a large-bodied man with gaunt inelegant limbs casually placed at convenient corners of his body, and a face like a carving abandoned {{at an early stage}} as altogether too unpromising for completion. His nose had been left square, and his lower jaw projected beyond his upper. He breathed audibly. Few people considered him handsome. His hair was entirely tangential, and his voice, which he used sparingly, was pitched high, and had commonly a quality of bitter protest. He wore a <b>grey</b> <b>cloth</b> jacket suit and a silk hat on all occasions. He plumbed an abysmal trouser pocket with a vast red hand, paid his cabman, and came panting resolutely up the steps, a copy of the pink paper clutched about the middle, like Jove's thunderbolt, in his hand.|$|E
60|$|A {{very smart}} female, in a showy bonnet, {{stepped into a}} pair of <b>grey</b> <b>cloth</b> boots, with black fringe and binding, that were studiously {{pointing}} out their toes {{on the other side of}} the top-boots, and seemed very anxious to engage his attention, but we didn’t observe that our friend the market-gardener appeared at all captivated with these blandishments; for beyond giving a knowing wink when they first began, as if to imply that he quite understood their end and object, he took no further notice of them. His indifference, however, was amply recompensed by the excessive gallantry of a very old gentleman with a silver-headed stick, who tottered {{into a pair of}} large list shoes, that were standing in one corner of the board, and indulged in a variety of gestures expressive of his admiration of the lady in the cloth boots, to the immeasurable amusement of a young fellow we put into a pair of long-quartered pumps, who we thought would have split the coat that slid down to meet him, with laughing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the word ‘maud’ is uncertain. Writing in 1894, Miss Russell said that {{it came from the}} Gaelic maudal or maundal, a poetic synonym for plaid. [...] Her view seems to be backed by an old poem in Gaelic, The Tale of Connal, {{recorded}} in Ross-shire in 1859, which has the line, “And wrapped my maundal around;” [...] An alternate source is that the word derives from ‘maldy’, meaning a course <b>grey</b> woollen <b>cloth,</b> which in turn comes from ’medley’, meaning a parti-coloured cloth, by way of mispronunciation. [...] However, the reverse is also said to be true, whereby ‘maldy’ was an early nineteen century noun for yarn and cloth used to make mauds, as in ‘a cloak of maldy’, where it was pronounced ‘mawdy’.|$|R
