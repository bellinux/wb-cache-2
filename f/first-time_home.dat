25|$|This {{was further}} amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were {{guaranteed}} by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue in}} Ybor City after World War II was {{the aging of}} the area’s housing stock. New {{construction}} had all but stopped during the Depression and the war, and thousands of homes built during the neighborhood's era of rapid growth around 1900 were still in use. These old wooden structures were becoming dilapidated and were thus not particularly attractive to <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> buyers such as returning veterans, who tended to gravitate to West Tampa or the booming suburbs of Tampa.|$|E
500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> buyers. Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{expansion}} of the Irish economy in the 1990s, during the [...] "Celtic Tiger" [...] years, Drogheda became one of the main secondary locations for people who work in Dublin to buy a house, as property prices in the capital became prohibitive for many <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> buyers. This was aided by {{the expansion}} of transport infrastructure in the direction of Drogheda i.e. the Swords and Balbriggan bypasses, the Boyne River Bridge and the increased number of commuter trains serving the town. Partly as a result, the downtown area of Drogheda has redeveloped, and two large shopping centres have opened, while several national and international retailers have opened stores. In 2007 the partial pedestrianisation of the town's main street, West Street, was completed.|$|E

50|$|Colchester {{started the}} month with {{a trip to}} Deepdale to face Preston North End on 3 October. The match started brightly for the U's, taking the lead through Rhys Healey, scoring his second goal in his first start for the club after 16 minutes. However, Preston first {{equalised}} five minutes later with a goal from Scott Wiseman, before taking the lead four minutes after that through Alan Browne. Alex Gilbey scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard strike to level the scores once again on 37 minutes. Paul Gallagher regained the lead for the Lilywhites shortly after half-time with a long range shot, before Gallagher provided the assist for Chris Humphrey to round off the 4-2 win for Preston in the 57th minute. On the back of the defeat, Colchester once again dipped into the loan market on 6 October to sign Ipswich Town right-back Elliott Hewitt for one-month, alongside securing the services of former player David Fox on a short-term three-month contract after spending time training with the U's. Having not featured under Tony Humes, Jabo Ibehre was sent out on a 93-day emergency loan to Oldham Athletic on 9 October. Following this news, it was announced that youth team product Sammie Szmodics had signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension with the club. Szmodics then featured in the U's first home win of the season the following day as a substitute, as Colchester came from behind to beat Fleetwood Town 2-1 and move out of the relegation zone courtesy of a brace from Gavin Massey. Fleetwood took the lead in the 18th minute against the run of play through Liam McAlinden as his side took the initiative. Colchester hit back with a neat cross from top-scorer Freddie Sears, setting up Massey to hit <b>home</b> <b>first-time</b> with a volley five minutes before the break. Putting in a man of the match display, Massey wrapped up the victory with a curling effort {{from the edge of the}} box on 76 minutes. Massey, alongside defenders Tom Eastman and Frankie Kent, then all signed contract extensions with the club on 16 October. Eastman agreed to an extension set to expire in 2016, Massey in 2017 and Kent 2018.|$|R
2500|$|Asked [...] "How {{will you}} help with the housing and {{foreclosure}} problems in the U.S.?", Romney responded {{that it would be}} best not to try and stop the foreclosure process, to let it run its course and hit the bottom, and that he might be open to some government action to encourage refinancing. He also referred to the Obama administration as having [...] "slow walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang", and that the credit that was given to <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> buyers was inadequate to turn around the housing market. He nevertheless is open to some government intervention but demands that it make sense from a business standpoint. Should the foreclosure process run its course, Romney sees recovery for the market as investors are allowed to salvage property values and move people back into their homes as renters, with the possibility to buy when they are fiscally prepared.|$|E
