Therefore, optimal response strategies can be recommended based on individual risk tolerance levels. The applicability of the proposed module is evaluated using an A-C court case.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the GPS traces of 258 volunteers for a better {{understanding}} of both the human mobility patterns and the mechanism. We report the regular and scaling properties of human mobility from several aspects, and importantly we identify its levy flight characteristic which is consistent with the previous studies. We further assume two factors that may govern the levy flight property: (1) the scaling and hierarchical properties of the purpose clusters which serve as the underlying spatial structure, and (2) the <b>individual</b> <b>preferential</b> behavior. To verify the assumptions, we implement an agent-based model with the two factors, and the simulated results indeed capture the same levy flight pattern as the observed one. In order to enable the model to reproduce more mobility patterns, we add the model a third factor, the jumping factor which means the probability that one person may cancel the regular mobility schedule and explore a random place. With this factor, our model could cover a relatively wide range of human mobility patterns with scaling exponent values from 1. 55 to 2. 05. QC 20121113 </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Coevolution of {{individual}} strategies and social ties, {{in which individuals}} not only adjust their strategies by social learning but also switch their adverse partners to search for potential beneficial ones, has attracted increasing attention very recently. It is found that the interplay of strategic updating and partner network adaptation can facilitate the escape from the stalemate of cooperation in social dilemmas. But the question how <b>individual</b> <b>preferential</b> partner choice shapes the dynamical and topological organization of cooperation {{has yet to be}} fully answered. Here we propose a simple evolutionary game model to address this problem. In our model, when severing a current disadvantageous partnership, individuals can choose a new partner, either among their friends of friends preferentially according to their reputation scores or randomly from the remaining population. In addition to partner switching, individuals also update their strategies by imitating social neighbors. The interplay between these two processes gives rise to rich evolutionary dynamics. We focus on both strategic and topological evolution. We find that reputation-based partner selection leads to highly heterogeneous and often disassortative partner networks. During the coevolutionary process, a few successful individuals who attain a large number of partners emerg...|$|R

This Locomotor-Respiratory Coupling (LRC) is fundamental for the energy transfer between the two subsystems during long duration exercise and originates from mechanical and neurological interactions. Different methodologies {{have been used to}} compute LRC, giving rise to various and often diverging results in terms of synchronization, (de-) stabilization via information, and associated energy cost. In this article, the theory of nonlinear-coupled oscillators was adopted to characterize LRC, through the model of the sine circle map, and tested {{it in the context of}} cycling. Our specific focus was the sound-induced stabilization of LRC and its associated change in energy consumption. In our experimental study, participants were instructed during a cycling exercise to synchronize either their respiration or their pedaling rate with an external auditory stimulus whose rhythm corresponded to their <b>individual</b> <b>preferential</b> breathing or cycling frequencies. Results showed a significant reduction in energy expenditure with auditory stimulation, accompanied by a stabilization of LRC. The sound-induced effect was asymmetrical, with a better stabilizing influence of the metronome on the locomotor system than on the respiratory system.

According to the results, preferential flowpaths were formed by roots, erosion related to soil water flow, freezing thawing cycles, and soil fauna. The role of roots and stones {{in the formation of}} preferential flowpaths was emphasized.

Rose (2005) also produced positive WTO trade effects after accounting for the diverse trade effects produced by <b>individual</b> <b>preferential</b> trade agreements (PTAs). When Subramanian and Wei (2007) emphasize general equilibrium trade effects by controlling for multilateral resistance, they find strong WTO trade effects only for industrialized countries.

We unify the Rose, Tomz et al., and Subramanian and Wei specifications in one comprehensive approach that minimizes omitted variable bias to show that all specifications produce one consistent result: WTO effects on trade flows are not statistically significant, while PTAs produce strong but uneven trade effects. Extending the gravity model to address specific avenues in which WTO may have affected trade flows, we find that WTO membership boosts trade prior to PTA formation and increases trade among proximate developing countries (at the expense of distant trade). An augmented gravity model that accounts for WTO terms-of-trade theory shows that countries with greater incentives to bargain for tariff reductions before WTO accession experience positive and significant subsequent WTO trade effects.

I identified three populations of grizzly bears in the study area using multivariate cluster analysis of movement data and population range analyses. High exchange among population units for both females and males, however, suggest that identified grizzly bear population units cannot be managed independently from one another. I documented highly selective patterns of habitat selection by grizzly bears in a central, 75, 000 km 2 portion of the study area. Using resource selection functions, I examined habitat selection {{at the level of the}} home range (second order selection). Coverage of habitat was determined from Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes. The general pattern was for bears to possess home ranges, relative to the study area, that contained <b>preferential</b> <b>amounts</b> of esker habitat, tussock/hummock successional tundra, lichen veneer, birch seep, and tall shrub riparian areas over other habitat types. I also examined habitat selection at a finer level of selection (third order selection), whereby habitat use was determined from individual satellite telemetry locations and compared to the availability of habitats within home ranges of individual animals. Overall, esker and riparian tall shrub habitats were the most preferred habitats by bears throughout the year. Annual ranges of males ('X' = 7, 245 km 2) were significantly larger than the annual ranges of females ('X' = 2, 100 km 2). Annual ranges are the largest ranges yet reported for grizzly bears in North America. Multiple regression revealed that ranges increased in size as the proportional amount of poor bear habitat in the environment, supplying constant amounts of quality habitats.

CNS regions vary by cellular and chemical composition, including white matter (myelin) content, blood-brain barrier properties or prevaling neurotransmitters. Such a micromilieu could instruct as well as require local adaptions of microglial features.

40|$|Pervasive social {{difficulties}} {{among individuals}} with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often construed as deriving from reduced sensitivity to social stimuli. Behavioral and neurobiological {{evidence suggests that}} typical <b>individuals</b> show <b>preferential</b> processing of social (e. g., voices, faces) over nonsocial (e. g., nonvocal sounds, images of objects) information, whereas individuals with ASD may not. This reduction in sensitivity may reflect disrupted reward proc-essing [Dawson & Bernier, 2007], with significant developmental consequences for affected individuals. In this study, we explore effects of social and monetary reward on behavioral and electrodermal responses (EDRs) among 8 - to 12 -year-old boys with (n 518) and without (n 518) ASD, with attention to the potential moderating effects of stimulus familiarity. During a simple matching task, participants with and without ASD had marginally slower reactions dur-ing social vs. nonsocial reward, and boys with ASD had less accurate responses than controls. Compared to baseline, reward and non-reward conditions elicited more frequent and larger EDRs for participants as a whole, and both groups showed similar patterns of EDR change within reward blocks. However, boys with and without ASD differed in their EDRs to non-reward, and response amplitude was correlated with social and emotional functioning.

However, there have been relatively few field tests of their predictions. We tested the 4 models by studying the process of sequential settlement on territory in 2 distant populations of a migratory raptor, the black kite Milvus migrans. Results were mainly consistent with the site-dependent model: on arrival, kites settled on progressively lower quality territories, and earlier arriving individuals were older, larger, and in better body condition than later arriving ones, leading to a state- dependent arrival sequence also predicted by a previous theoretical model of settlement pattern. Occupation of superior territories by superior phenotypes resulted in cascading advantages for earlier arriving individuals in terms of subsequent reproductive performance. At the population level, the populations expanded/retracted from lower quality sites during pop- ulation increases/declines. The above scenario was consistent across the 2 populations, and {{a review of the}} literature uncovered a remarkably consistent picture of state-dependent arrival, progressive monopolization of best quality sites, and cascading effects on subsequent breeding performance.

40|$|Background: The major aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the motivational salience of food cues (as reflected by their attention-grabbing properties) differs between obese and normal weight subjects in a manner consistent with altered reward system function in obesity. Methodology/Principal Findings: 18 obese and 18 normal weight, otherwise healthy, adult females between the ages of 18 - 35 participated in an eye-tracking paradigm in combination with a visual probe task. Eye movements and reaction time to food and nonfood images were recorded during both fasted and fed conditions in a counterbalanced design. Eating behavior and hunger level were assessed by self-report measures. Obese individuals had higher scores than normal weight individuals on self-report measures of responsiveness to external food cues and vulnerability to disruptions in control of eating behavior. Both obese and normal weight individuals demonstrated increased gaze duration for food compared to nonfood images in the fasted condition. In the fed condition however, despite reduced hunger in both groups, obese individuals maintained the increased attention to food images, while normal weight individuals had similar gaze duration for food and nonfood images. Additionally, obese <b>individuals</b> had <b>preferential</b> orienting towards food images at the onset of each image. Obese and normal weight individuals did not differ in reaction time measures in the fasted or fed condition. Conclusions/Significance: Food cue incentive salience is elevated equally in normal weight and obese individuals during fasting. Obese individuals retain incentive salience for food cues despite feeding and decreased self-report of hunger. Sensitization to food cues in the environment and their dysregulation in obese individuals may play a role in the development and/or maintenance of obesity...|$|R

To assess diversity of the TCR β chain, RNA was isolated directly from the tumor specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same patient, cDNA was synthesized, and variable (V) β chain gene usage was determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In each basal cell (n = 11) and squamous cell (n = 7) carcinoma studied, several Vβ families were overrepresented in TIL versus PBMC, in that they accounted for greater than 5 % of the repertoire in TIL and were at least 2 % higher in TIL than in PBMC.

After {{the initiation of}} antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells.

We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD 8 + T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD 8 + T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding {{with a lack of}} detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated <b>individuals</b> drives <b>preferential</b> maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system.

Using radio telemetry (external transmitters, 75 x 17 mm diameter, 35 g in air, ATS, Isanti, MN, USA), adaptation and behaviour of externally tagged, restocked cage-raised (124 - 143 cm TL, n= 14) and wild A. gigas (117 - 153 cm TL, n= 8), were monitored, focusing observations on <b>individual</b> behaviour and <b>preferential</b> localization in the lake. Home range size determined by minimum convex polygons (MCP 95) or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE 95) varied from 0. 001 to around 4 km(2), but the average KDE 50 was relatively small (0. 1 km(2)) in comparison to the tracked fish size (117 - 153 cm TL), indicating strong residency and presumably territoriality in this species. Also observed was that the habitat was concentrated along the shoreline of the lake and closely related to the presence of aquatic vegetation. Home range localization estimates and apparent travelled distance of wild and restocked fishes were very similar, thereby suggesting a rapid and good acclimation and survival of cultured re-stocked fish to a natural environment...|$|R
40|$|Dominance {{hierarchies}} {{are thought}} to provide various fitness-related benefits to dominant <b>individuals</b> (e. g., <b>preferential</b> access to food or mating partners). Remarkably, however, different studies on this topic have produced contradictory results, with some showing strong positive association between rank and fitness (i. e., dominants gain benefits over subordinates), others weak associations, and some others even revealing negative associations. Here, we investigate dominance-related benefits across primate species while controlling for phylogenetic effects. We extracted data from 94 published studies, representing 25 primate species (2 lemur species, 4 New World monkeys, 16 Old World monkeys, and 3 apes), to assess how dominance affects life-history and behavior. We used standard and phylogenetic meta-analyses to analyze the benefits of dominance in primates. Dominant females had higher infant survival to first year, although we found no significant effect of dominance on female feeding success. Results for female fecundity differed between the two meta-analytical approaches, with no effect of dominance on female fecundity after controlling for phylogeny. Dominant males had a higher fecundity and mating success than subordinate males. Finally, the benefits of dominance for female fecundity were stronger in species with a longer lifespan. Our study supports the view that dominance hierarchies are a key aspect of primate societies as they indeed provide a number of fitness-related benefits to individuals...|$|R
40|$|The World Health Organization Antiretroviral Treatment Guidelines {{recommend}} phasing-out stavudine {{because of}} its risk of long-term toxicity. There are two mutational pathways of stavudine resistance with different implications for zidovudine and tenofovir cross-resistance, the primary candidates for replacing stavudine. However, because resistance testing is rarely available in resource-limited settings, {{it is critical to}} identify the cross-resistance patterns associated with first-line stavudine failure. We analyzed HIV- 1 resistance mutations following first-line stavudine failure from 35 publications comprising 1, 825 individuals. We also assessed the influence of concomitant nevirapine vs. efavirenz, therapy duration, and HIV- 1 subtype on the proportions of mutations associated with zidovudine vs. tenofovir cross-resistance. Mutations with preferential zidovudine activity, K 65 R or K 70 E, occurred in 5. 3 % of <b>individuals.</b> Mutations with <b>preferential</b> tenofovir activity, >= two thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) or Q 151 M, occurred in 22 % of individuals. Nevirapine increased the risk of TAMs, K 65 R, and Q 151 M. Longer therapy increased the risk of TAMs and Q 151 M but not K 65 R. Subtype C and CRF 01 _AE increased the risk of K 65 R, but only CRF 01 _AE increased the risk of K 65 R without Q 151 M. Regardless of concomitant nevirapine vs. efavirenz, therapy duration, or subtype, tenofovir was more likely than zidovudine to retain antiviral activity following first-line d 4 T therapy...|$|R
40|$|Tectono-stratigraphic {{models of}} {{foredeep}} sedimentation have generally presumed {{a direct link}} between changing rates of tectonism and concomitant sedimentological response as manifested by change in thickness, composition or depositional environment of sediment accumulating in adjacent basins. Lacustrine limestone units within the early Cretaceous fluvial/lacustrine Gannett Group of western Wyoming exhibit systematic variation in several geochemical proxies of relative rates of precipitation and evaporation, indicating that lakewater chemistry was controlled by variation in regional climate. Change in proportion of allochthonous terrigenous clastic vs. autochthonous carbonate deposition, as well as carbonate Mg/Ca ratio and stable isotopic composition, occurs at two scales. Metre-scale alternation of micritic limestone and argillaceous marl is accompanied by mineralogical and isotopic variation within <b>individual</b> beds, indicating <b>preferential</b> carbonate accumulation during intervals of decreased regional meteoric precipitation relative to lake-surface evaporation. Limestone deposition began during intervals of maximum aridity, and decreased as increased meteoric precipitation-driven flux of terrigenous clastic sediment overwhelmed sites of carbonate accumulation. Similar upsection variation in limestone mineralogy and isotopic composition at a scale of tens of metres reflects the multiple processes of long-term increase in meteoric precipitation and lakewater freshening prior to influx of terrigenous sediment, across-basin fluvial-deltaic progradation, and renewed accumulation of riverine terrigenous units. Such trends suggest that formation-scale alternation between fluvial clastic and lacustrine carbonate deposition was controlled by climate change...|$|R
40|$|Viral DNA was {{isolated}} from lysates of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 -infected cells which had been incubated {{in the presence of}} 0. 1, 1. 0, or 3. 2 [mu]M [3 H]ara-A. The DNA was purified by isopycnic centrifugation and was enzymatically digested with micrococcal nuclease and spleen phosphodiesterase. The resulting nucleotides and nucleosides were resolved by means of thin-layer chromatography. Examination of the distribution of radioactivity on the chromatograms revealed that 92 - 96 % of the label was present as nucleotides demonstrating that [3 H]ara-A was internally incorporated into viral DNA. Virtually identical results were obtained using DNA isolated from mature virions. Additional analysis of virion DNA using HindIII restriction endonuclease demonstrated that the incorporation of [3 H]ara-A into the viral genome was random and did not occur at <b>preferential</b> sites. The <b>amount</b> of ara-A incorporated into viral DNA from infected cells was compared with the amount incorporated into cellular DNA from uninfected cells. Viral DNA isolated from cells maintained in 0. 1, 1. 0, or 3. 2 [mu]M [3 H]ara-A, contained 2. 3, 9. 7, or 27. 5 ara-AMP residues/ 10, 000 dAMP residues, respectively, whereas uninfected cellular DNA. contained 4. 1, 41. 0, or 160 ara-AMP residues/ 10, 000 dAMP residues, respectively. These data establish that (i) ara-A is not an absolute chain terminator of HSV- 1 DNA synthesis, and (ii) the amount of ara-A incorporated into viral DNA is less than the amount incorporated into cellular DNA...|$|R
40|$|When Belgian voters go to {{the polling}} booth on {{election}} day, they are presented {{with a set of}} candidate lists of different political parties. Voters know that they can either cast a list vote, which implies that they endorse the party list in its entirety, or they can cast an <b>individual</b> <b>preferential</b> vote for one or several candidates from the same list. What most voters are unaware of, however, is the amount of effort and preparation that political parties have invested in drafting those candidate lists and selecting candidates, long before election day. In list proportional systems such as Belgium, party selectorates are inclined to carefully balance their lists in terms of various candidate characteristics, in order to include candidates from all social groups. There are both electoral and organizational incentives to balance the ticket. From the electoral perspective, the exclusion of any major social group could signal discrimination, which discourages voters and could result into an electoral setback. From the organizational perspective, balancing the ticket decreases the chances of internal conflicts between the various party factions. While previous research has traditionally focused on the gender and ethnic dimensions of the candidate selection process, this dissertation examines the geographical aspect of ticket-balancing. In Belgium, but also in other list proportional systems worldwide, parties {{go out of their way}} to select candidates from all regions, municipalities or other localities within the electoral district. This is an intriguing observation, as empirical research shows that elections are becoming increasingly nationalized and homogenized and the role of the local seems to have diminished over time. Based on the case of the Belgian Lower House elections between 1987 and 2010, this dissertation aims to tackle this research problem and examines how and why political parties geographically balance their ticket. How important are local and geographical candidate characteristics for parties, vis-à-vis other candidate characteristics? Which intraparty mechanism are at work to realize geographical representation on party lists? What impact does geographical representation have on the electoral result? And do political parties develop a clear strategy with regard to geographical representation, for instance in response to electoral losses in some districts or local areas? Chapter 2 presents a descriptive analysis of the place of residence of Belgian parliamentary candidates, and shows that the share of small municipality candidates has systematically decreased over the years. The analysis also shows that the number of represented municipalities on party lists decreased, possibly as a result of the consecutive electoral district reforms that took place in Belgium during the period of investigation. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the importance of local candidate characteristics as candidate nomination criteria and electoral assets. The results suggest that political parties especially nominate local mayors, incumbents and party employees for realistic list positions, and that candidates from larger municipalities and cities are more often assigned to these attractive positions. Moreover, for marginal positions party selectorates look for local office holders from larger municipalities. With regard to election results, a multilevel analysis shows that municipality size in itself does not have a significant effect on the number of preferential votes, but the expected interaction between local office and municipality size (which was also found in Chapter 3) was confirmed. This implies that the electoral advantage of holding a local office increases with one’s municipality size in the district. These findings show that local office holders, and especially local-office holders in large cities, dominate intra-party competition (both in terms of candidate selection as election results). With regard to the determinants of geographical representation, the empirical analysis in Chapter 5 has shown that especially the level of decentralization in candidate selection processes plays the decisive role. If local party branches are allowed to participate, a more balanced representation of municipalities within the district is reached. Although the analysis in Chapter 6 suggests that geographical dispersion in itself does not lead to electoral victories, geographical representation on candidate lists can be an important antidote for intraparty turmoil. From the individual politician’s perspective, this dissertation demonstrates the added value of combining parliamentary office with local office, as a ‘cumul des mandats’ provides a career insurance for national politicians and gives them a head start in intraparty candidate selection and electoral competition. From the political party perspective, it seems that investing in local elections and local party branches still pays off as both the aggregate list result as the individual results of party candidates are strongly determined by local roots. status: publishe...|$|R
