In response, numerous studies have been conducted in recent years throughout the United States regarding how secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs are perceived by school leaders. For the first time, this study sought to shed light on how secondary principals in Kentucky perceived <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs. Considered in this study, were how secondary principals with <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools perceived those programs differently than secondary principals without <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools. Secondary principals in Kentucky were selected to participate in this study based on the population of Kentucky counties that had at least one secondary school with <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> and at least one secondary school without <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> (N = 95). This quantitative descriptive study measured how participants perceived secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs by utilizing a survey with Likert-type and demographic questions. Four constructs guided the survey items to measure how secondary principals perceived <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> based upon overall program success, the courses offered in <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs, the quality of agriculture teachers, and personal familiarity with the FFA. Results indicated that secondary principals with <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools have significantly higher perceptions of such programs than do secondary principals without <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in their schools. Furthermore, results revealed that all constructs included in this study have predictive variables of one’s overall perception of secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs.

Additionally, he was {{the editor of the}} Pacific Rural Press, an influential publication popular in the agricultural community. During this same time period, <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> in California's secondary schools took root and spread rapidly. Within eleven years, <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> grew from non-existence in California's high schools to being included in nearly one-third of them. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the socio-historical context of the tension between California's academic and agricultural communities and Wickson's involvement in mediating this conflict, while quietly advancing his educational agenda. Additionally, this study explores the various changes in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> curriculum within California's educational institutions prior to the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. By investigating the origins of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> within California's secondary schools, this study offers a portrayal of the rural community during a period of tension and transition and an <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> community that struggled with self-identity during the early twentieth century. The data for this study includes a variety of primary sources, including personal correspondence, local and national newspaper articles, secondary <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> textbooks, and California's Agricultural Experiment Station bulletins...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{induction}} portfolio guidelines specific to <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education.</b> The study was conducted in two phases guided by three questions: What constitutes an induction assessment for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education?</b> What is the specific pedagogical content for a beginning teacher in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education?</b> How might this work inform and align the state teacher effectiveness rubric with an <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education</b> student teaching performance assessment? With the elimination of the induction portfolio by the State of Indiana, content specific items for <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education</b> were aligned to the Indiana Department of Education Teacher Effectiveness Rubric. The content items were based upon the Indiana Department of Education Career Technical-Agriculture Teacher standards and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) standards. Also considered were the Purdue University Teacher Education Program student teaching rubric domains. Data gathered from Phase I validated the elimination of the state portfolio and its process as well as identified important teaching characteristics of beginning <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education</b> teachers. Phase II findings resulted in somewhat positive support of a teacher effectiveness rubric with specific <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Education</b> items. The rubric can serve to influence teachers in how they will be evaluated. There are many questions, concerns, and uncertainties that remain. Recommendations are made to study the intended and unintended outcomes of the teacher effectiveness rubric. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the importance and}} inclusion of emotional intelligence in the existing curriculum by <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> instructors. Although much {{research has been conducted}} about the importance of emotional intelligence in the realm of education, {{research in the area of}} emotional intelligence in <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> programs is limited. The concept of incorporating emotional intelligence into the agriscience curriculum is not a new idea. The very philosophy of <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> lends itself to the development of emotional intelligence. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>education</b> instructors identified eight out of twenty emotional intelligence competency areas identified through the review of literature as high-level success abilities. This means <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> instructors believe these competency areas are important and they are actually including them in their current curriculum. Eleven of the twenty emotional intelligence competency areas were identified as low-level needs. This indicates that <b>agricultural</b> <b>education</b> instructors do not believe these competency areas are important, and therefore they do not believe that the competency areas need to be included in their programs. One competency area, conflict resolution, was identified as being a critical need. This indicates that teachers believe conflict resolution is important, but they are not including it in their program curriculum...|$|R
