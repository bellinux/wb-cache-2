40|$|Julia <b>Driver</b> <b>s</b> Uneasy Virtue {{offers a}} theory of virtue and the virtues without being an {{instance}} of virtue ethics. It presents a consequentialist challenge to recent virtue ethics, but its positive views and especially its interesting examples have great significance in their own right. <b>Driver</b> <b>s</b> defence of virtues of ignorance has force despite all the challenges to it that have been mounted over the years. But there are also examples differing from those Driver has mentioned that favour the idea of such virtues. Perhaps certain virtues of religious faith and the virtue necessary for dealing as best one can with moral dilemmas both require ignorance. However, some of the examples Driver does discuss raise the question whether virtue status is based solely on consequences, rather than perhaps having (in addition) a motivational component. ...|$|R

40|$|Virtue consequentialism {{has been}} held by many {{prominent}} philosophers, but has never been properly formulated. I criticize Julia <b>Driver</b> <b>s</b> formulation of virtue consequentialism and offer an alternative. I maintain that according to the best version of virtue consequentialism, attributions of virtue are really disguised comparisons between two character traits, {{and the consequences of}} a trait in non-actual circumstances may affect its actual status as a virtue or vice. Such a view best enables the consequentialist to account for moral luck, unexemplified virtues, and virtues and vices involving the prevention of goodness and badness. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{state legislatures}} have enacted laws that remove men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>licence</b> to rape women {{with whom they}} share marital or {{established}} relationships, our understanding of whether this resulted in effectively changing the social, cultural and legal response to sexual violence by male intimate partners is surprisingly limited.

While a reluctance to respond to male partner sexual violence is shown to exist within the practice and enforcement of law, it is also reflected in our failure to acknowledge the difficulties women face in naming their experience of rape, by a range of services marginalising their responses to rape, and through our neglecting to identify the particular health effects, and emotional impact of rape.

Participants were 101 commercial drivers who operated vans, pickups, or other light trucks from the U. S. and Canada.

Unbelted participants experienced either a constant delay (8  s) or a variable delay (M  =  8  s). A 16 -s delay was introduced for those U. <b>S.</b> <b>drivers</b> who did not show significant improvement. Seat belt use increased from 48 % to 67 % (a 40 % increase) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>drivers</b> and from 54 % to 74 % (a 37 % increase) for Canadian drivers.

40|$|Abstract. Mobility-pricing {{is one of}} the avenues {{leading to}} the {{information}} highway. Using a combination of positioning, communication and information processing, automobile insurance can be priced based on actual mileage of the vehicle. Vehicle s location is periodically and electronically disclosed to a central server for invoice generation. This raises the possibility of this data being used to reveal the <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> identity and social activity. Past research has only been speculative of the motorists privacy perspective. This paper uses mobility-priced insurance as a case study and reports the results of a survey where respondents are asked to indicate their preferred trade-off between location privacy and the setup costs of a hypothetical mobility-priced insurance product. The respondents are also asked about their willingness to reveal location information to various social groups {{as a function of the}} time of day and day of week. It is hoped that the results of this research can be used to influence the design of other mobility-based payment systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{introduced}} {{a concept of}} analyzing the performance of dynamic network organization (NO) in response to multiple input objectives of network organization (NO) and input set of unpredictable external environment, and we have correlated plasticity of NO with this performance measure. A three stage conceptual model of {{the process has been}} described which comprised of dynamic system of multi-agent network, multiple objectives and input goals of network <b>driver</b> (<b>S</b> n), unpredictable external environment (ϵ). Dynamic system of the network organization takes through its two phase and processes this based on time and system response variables. Processing of input information by the system variables gives a ratio of system response variable and input. Further analysis is based on the value of this performance values. This model suggests a performance measuring technique which takes an input set of objectives from network driver of the NO, a set of input from external environment (ϵ) state and processes this input based on the existing state of the dynamic system in the NO. This process output shows dynamic system performance in dynamic environment and how this performance coefficient correlates with the Plasticity of network organization.

40|$|A {{strategy}} for autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle across hazardous terrain {{involves the use}} of a measure of traversability of terrain within a fuzzy-logic conceptual framework. This navigation strategy requires no a priori information about the environment. Fuzzy logic was selected as a basic element of this strategy because it provides a formal methodology for representing and implementing a human <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> heuristic knowledge and operational experience. Within a fuzzy-logic framework, the attributes of human reasoning and decision- making can be formulated by simple IF (antecedent), THEN (consequent) rules coupled with easily understandable and natural linguistic representations. The linguistic values in the rule antecedents convey the imprecision associated with measurements taken by sensors onboard a mobile robot, while the linguistic values in the rule consequents represent the vagueness inherent in the reasoning processes to generate the control actions. The operational strategies of the human expert driver can be transferred, via fuzzy logic, to a robot-navigation strategy {{in the form of a}} set of simple conditional statements composed of linguistic variables. These linguistic variables are defined by fuzzy sets in accordance with user-defined membership functions. The main advantages of a fuzzy navigation strategy lie in the ability to extract heuristic rules from human experience and to obviate the need for an analytical model of the robot navigation process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} two complementary {{methods for}} ISA effect assessment, {{and how to}} apply them in a coherent manner. The first level consists of the effects on individual driving behaviour, typically measured with an instrumented vehicle or a driving simulator. Results at this level form {{the starting point for}} the second level, which consists of microscopic traffic flow simulation. ISA system characteristics and behavioural effects should be incorporated in the traffic simulation model. The main focus of the paper is on an explorative case study, in which the MIXIC model was applied to study the effects of a dynamic ISA system. The ISA penetration level was varied as an independent variable. The in-car control unit consisted of a mandatory ISA The road configuration that was studied of consisted of a lane drop from 3 to 2 lanes, and the roadside part of the ISA system determined the actual ISA speed limit based on the traffic state. The driver model was adjusted {{to take into account the}} set speed of the in-car ISA system, but otherwise, no strategic changes in driving behaviour were assumed. Results shows a decrease in throughput (volume) combined with positive effects on safety (shock waves, speed variance) when ISA is introduced. For the validation of these results more research into the <b>driver</b> <b>s</b> behaviour in the presence of ISA is recommendable...|$|R
