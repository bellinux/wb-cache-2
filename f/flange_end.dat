40|$|The hose of {{the oxygen}} lancing {{equipment}} in LD shop # 2 has failed at the weld-bellows interface by reverse bending fatigue. The bending stresses were resulted due to inclined fitment of the hose at the fixed <b>flange</b> <b>end.</b> No metallurgical abnormalities or weld defects or mechanical damages {{were responsible for}} the fatigue crack initiation. It is recommended that if inclined fitment of the hose is not a process requirement, the original design be restored to realize the expected life of the component.

Twisted, stranded 0. 0045 inch diameter NbTi superconductor in a copper matrix was selected. Winding the coil from this bundle facilitated uniform winding of the small diameter wire. Test coils were wound using a first lot of the wire. The actual packing density was measured from these. Interwinding voltage break down tests on the test coils indicated the need for adjustment of the wire insulation on the lot of wire subsequently ordered for construction of the delivered superconducting magnet. Using the actual packing densities from the test coils, a final magnet design, with the required enhancement and field profile, was generated. All mechanical and thermal design parameters were then also fixed. The superconducting magnet was then fabricated and tested. The first test was made with the magnet immersed in liquid helium at 4. 2 K. The second test was conducted at 2 K in vacuum.

The NuMI beam line is capable of operating at 400 kW of primary beam power and the upgrade will allow up to 700 kW. Ceramic beam tubes are utilized in numerous kicker magnets in different accelerator rings at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Kovar flanges are brazed onto each beam tube end, since kovar and high alumina ceramic have similar expansion curves. The tube, kovar <b>flange,</b> <b>end</b> piece, and braze foil alloy brazing material are stacked in the furnace and then brazed.

The tube of the insulator is a cylindrical shell of fibers-glass in a resin-based matrix with aluminum <b>flange</b> <b>end</b> fittings. The integrity of the tube-flange connection is checked for leaks, slip, damage, and bond degradation. Tests indicate that he actual cantilever load causing failure was much higher than the rated SML provided by the manufacturers. While there were occasionally sounds indicating that something {{was going on in the}} insulator prior to catastrophic failure, there was no change in the force deflection curve of the test. While there were slight changes in the damping and frequency of the insulators as the loading increased, the changes were small and did not indicate degradation of the insulator. Two failure modes were observed: failure of the lower flange and shear failure at the tube-flange connection. In one case the shear failure was in the bond to the flange and in the other it was in the tube adjacent to the bonding material. In the unbonded tube, there was clear friction damping.

40|$|M. Ing. 3 CR 12 is a {{corrosion}} resistant steel that {{was developed in the}} 1980 ’s as an alternative to coated mild steel in the construction industry. The low chromium content together with an absence of nickel result in a competitative production cost. It has good welding characteristics when compared to the other ferritic grades. Because of the cost and difficulties involved, structural hot-rolled sections in 3 CR 12 (or any other stainless steel for that matter) are not commercially available. Sections are either cold formed or built-up through various welding techniques. Design in cold formed stainless steel sections are done in accordance to the SABS 0162 - 4 : 1997 code of practice. In general welded built-up sections should comply with the SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 code of practice. Little is known about the structural behaviour of built-up stainless steel and particularly 3 CR 12 fabricated sections. Currently sections are fabricated using both manual metal arc and laser welding. The effect of using different welding techniques (which has become common practice) is totally unexplored. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate the structural behaviour of built-up 3 CR 12 sections when fabricated by using either manual metal arc or laser welding techniques. The investigation was initiated by conducting a comprehensive literature review with specific reference to built-up 3 CR 12 structural sections. This is followed by an experimental investigation utilizing the neutron diffraction technique to determine the typical residual stress profile associated with manual metal arc and laser-welded built-up 3 CR 12 sections. This data is then used as input to a non-linear finite element investigation where the effect of the residual stress profile on the structural integrity of selected axial structural members (columns) is evaluated. An experimental program where a selected number of full scale fabricated sections were tested as axial members was then conducted to act as comparison and validation of the numerical model. The research found that both the welding techniques investigated may be successfully used to fabricate the structural sections. There is however a distinct difference in the residual stress profile within the sections between the two welding techniques. Laser welding induces smaller compressive residual stresses in the <b>flange</b> <b>end</b> regions when compared to manual metal arc welding. This has a beneficial effect on the axial buckling strength of the axial members. The difference could be up to about 8 % depending on the slenderness ratio and the column in question. SANS 0162 - 1 : 2005 was found to adequately describe the column behaviour for the sections tested as far as design is concerned...|$|E
