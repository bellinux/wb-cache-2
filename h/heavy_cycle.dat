The ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium octylsulfate was {{proven to be}} a suitable solvent through screening experiments with model diesel, giving the highest sulfur partition coefficient out of the five studied ILs [3]. The cross solubility of real fuel and BMIMOcSO 4 ionic liquid (IL) was also assessed because it may be a key factor in evaluating the extraction efficiency as BMIMOcSO 4 solubility in liquid fuel may give rise to extractant loss and liquid fuel contamination i.e., if 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium octylsulfate ionic liquid in diesel have noticeable solubility, it may contaminate the fuel and further lead to a NOx pollution, as well as increase the cost of the ionic liquid recycling. By analyzing the BMIMOcSO 4 -saturated diesel sample using HPLC, no IL peak was found. Therefore, it may be concluded that BMIMOcSO 4 has negligible solubility in the real diesel. However, the solubility of real diesel in BMIMOcSO 4 IL was measured using a gravimetric method by weighing the mass difference of a given amount of ILs and the ILs saturated with diesel and {{it was found that the}} Light Cycle Oil (LCO) has a solubility (wt%) of 0.84 in BMIMOcSO 4 IL while the <b>Heavy</b> <b>Cycle</b> Oil (LCO) has a solubility of 1.09 (wt%).|$|E

However, the time {{required for}} O 2 to return to its normal profile following prior heavy exercise is not known.

The second-by-second O 2 responses were modeled using nonlinear regression. Prior heavy exercise had no effect on the primary O 2 time constant (from 25. 9 ? 4. 7 s to 23. 9 ? 8. 8 s after 10 min of recovery; P = 0. 338), but it increased the primary O 2 amplitude (from 2. 42 ? 0. 39 to 2. 53 ? 0. 41 l/min after 10 min of recovery; P = 0. 001) and reduced the O 2 slow component (from 0. 44 ? 0. 13 to 0. 21 ? 0. 12 l/min after 10 min of recovery; P < 0. 001).

Eight healthy men performed two 6 -min bouts of heavy leg cycling (at 70 % of the difference between the lactate threshold and peak O 2) separated by 12 min of recovery. The iEMG was measured throughout each exercise bout. The amplitude of the primary O 2 response was increased after prior heavy leg exercise (from mean ?

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{accumulated}} O 2 deficit (AOD) assumes that the O 2 deficit increases monotonically with increasing work rate (WR), to plateau at the maximum AOD, {{and is based on}} linear extrapolation of the relationship between measured steady-state oxygen uptake (V̇O 2) and WR for moderate exercise. However, for high WRs, the measured V̇O 2 increases above that expected from such linear extrapolation, reflecting the superimposition of a "slow component" on the fundamental V̇O 2 mono-exponential kinetics. We were therefore interested in determining the effect of the V̇O 2 slow component on the computed AOD. Ten subjects [31 (12) years] performed square-wave cycle ergometry of moderate (40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 90 % θˆL), heavy (40 %Δ), very heavy (80 %Δ) and severe (110 % V̇O 2 peak) intensities for 10 – 15 min, where θˆL is the estimated lactate threshold and Δ is the WR difference between θˆL and V̇O 2 peak. V̇O 2 was determined breath-by-breath. Projected "steady-state" V̇O 2 values were determined from sub- θˆL tests. The measured V̇O 2 exceeded the projected value after ~ 3 min for both heavy and very heavy intensity exercise. This led to the AOD actually becoming negative. Thus, for heavy exercise, while the AOD was positive [0. 63 (0. 41) l] at 5 min, it was negative by 10 min [− 0. 61 (1. 05) l], and more so by 15 min [− 1. 70 (1. 64) l]. For the very heavy WRs, the AOD was [0. 42 (0. 67) l] by 5 min and reached − 2. 68 (2. 09) l at exhaustion. For severe exercise, however, the AOD at exhaustion was positive in each case: + 1. 69 (0. 39) l. We therefore conclude that the assumptions underlying the computation of the AOD are invalid for heavy and very <b>heavy</b> <b>cycle</b> ergometry (at least). Physiological inferences, such as the "anaerobic work capacity", are therefore prone to misinterpretation...|$|E

Specimens in each group were immersed in 150 ml of the treatment for seven 2 min cycle in addition to an extra 30 min cycle. Specimens were gently dried after each 2 min cycle to take quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images while non- contact light profilometry (NCLP) scans were performed at the end of the seven 2 min and the extra 30 min cycles. Results: ClO 2 specimens showed a significant increase in %ΔF only after the first 2 min cycle (p < 0. 05); however, a significant increase in %ΔF within H 2 O 2 specimens was found at the end of the seven recommended treatment cycles (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Chlorine dioxide does cause enamel erosion but to a lesser extent than that caused by hydrogen peroxide...|$|R
40|$|The project TECNOMET {{is part of}} the {{cooperative}} research group TUSCH and deals with the preparation of in-situ experiments on <b>heavy</b> metal <b>cycles</b> in the deep-sea during the research cruise SO 106. An active sampling and measuring system was developed and constructed, which was integrated into a benthic experimental chamber (cooperation with the VWS project PARTRANS). The system will take water and particle samples, enrich heavy metals on ion exchange columns and measure pH value, redox potential and dissolved oxygen during the one-week experiments. The equipment was tested in the laboratory and during a short cruise in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the material of the systme and the chamber was checked for its suitability for trace metal investigations, and the trace metal analytics for the cruise was worked out. Heavy metals will be measured by sensitive stripping voltammetric methods. Finally, a detailed planning of the cruise, the experiments and the deployment of the instrumentation was carried out.

40|$|Continuous {{particle}} flux measurements above rigidity thresholds of 1. 2, 2. 2, 5. 5 and 11 GV {{were made}} by using the thresholds of two Cerenkov detectors aboard the ISEE- 3 spacecraft. The ISEE- 3 was launched in August 1978, {{near the beginning of}} the current solar <b>cycle's</b> <b>heavy</b> modulation phase, and the data presented represent the first direct measurement made at these energies with such a long time base. The measured long term modulation rigidity spectrum is compared with other data and with the spectrum of Forbush decreases, and it is found that the agreement between electron and positively charged particle results must be considered a constraint on cosmic ray modulation models involving the mechanism of gradient and curvature drift in the interplanetary magnetic field...|$|R
