500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] {{had been coming}} {{together}} since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, {{the way in which}} to portray the teenagers on screen was [...] "tricky". He noted, [...] "it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since we had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." [...] However, the story quickly developed [...] "deeper" [...] meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{inserted}} {{a reference to}} the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms" [...] in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow {{to be able to move}} independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect. Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script. However, the series staff realized that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be [...] "more than just paranoia". Thus, X was written into the story. Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, [...] "it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow." ...|$|E
500|$|Rumours of a co-headlining tour from Linkin Park and Thirty Seconds to Mars first {{circulated}} on March 3, 2014, when a Texas {{radio station}} {{revealed that the}} two [...] "modern rock icons" [...] would be partaking in a tour starting in late summer and that a performance in The Woodlands would take place on September 5. The tour was officially announced the following day, on March 4, 2014 {{at a press conference}} held at Milk Studios in Los Angeles, California with Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington from Linkin Park, and Jared Leto from Thirty Seconds to Mars. The conference was broadcast on the internet through the interactive social platform VyRT. In an interview with Billboard, Bennington explained that a co-headlining tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> coming; Linkin Park, indeed, had polled their fans a number of times in order to identify which artist they would like to join them on tour and Thirty Seconds to Mars was the most sought-after band multiple times. Thirty Seconds to Mars first worked with Linkin Park in 2007, opening some European shows for the band.|$|E

2500|$|On March 23, 1907, the United States Military Academy Detachment of Cavalry {{was changed}} to a [...] "colored" [...] unit. This <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> coming. It had been {{proposed}} in 1897 at the [...] "Cavalry and Light Artillery School" [...] at Fort Riley, Kansas that West Point cadets learn their riding skills from the black noncommissioned officers who were considered the best. The 100-man detachment from the 9th Cavalry served to teach future officers at West Point riding instruction, mounted drill, and tactics until 1947.|$|E
2500|$|The Expos {{finished}} 1991 with a 71–90 record, {{sixth in}} the NL East, and drew fewer than one million fans {{for the first time}} since 1976. However, the foundation of the Expos' future was establishing their places in MLB: [...] Larry Walker, Marquis Grissom and Delino DeShields had made their debuts the season prior, and the team acquired Moisés Alou in a trade with Pittsburgh. Moises' father Felipe, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> employee of the Expos, was promoted to manager during the [...] season and became the first native of the Dominican Republic to manage a Major League Baseball team. In , DeShields was sent to Los Angeles in exchange for Pedro Martínez; the deal was initially pilloried by the Montreal Gazette and other local publications as a move designed to save money rather than improve the ball club. [...] Nonetheless, the Expos improved on the field; they won 87 games in 1992, 94 in 1993 and finished second in the NL East both seasons.|$|E
