50|$|The {{temperament}} of dogs can {{be affected}} by different factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. The German Shorthaired Pointer was developed to be a dog suited for family life, {{as well as a}} versatile hunter. Therefore its temperament is that of an intelligent, bold, boisterous, eccentric, and characteristically affectionate dog that is cooperative and easily trained. This breed is smart, friendly, willing, and enthusiastic. The GSP is usually good with children, although care should be taken because the breed can be boisterous especially when young. These dogs love interaction with humans and are suitable pets for active families who will give them an outlet for their considerable energy; they must be avidly run multiple times a week. The breed should be socialized, which includes exposure to different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they are young. This early socializing will help to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> German Shorthaired Pointer puppy will {{grow up to be a}} well-rounded dog. An important part of training would be to enroll your dog into a training class. Most German Shorthaired Pointers make excellent watchdogs.

5000|$|Six-line wrasse inhabit warm {{tropical}} waters {{around the}} islands of Indonesia and Oceania, and have also been observed around various islets and seamounts in the Pacific Ocean==Captivity== Six-lined wrasse are vibrant, colorful, hardy, disease and parasite resistant and inexpensive, tempting beginning and experienced aquarists alike to move one to their tank. Big mistake. These semi-aggressive fish will fight with, injure, and kill delicate, weak, old, baby or small fish and are best kept with other semi-aggressive fish like clowns or damsels. A single-species tank is okay, too, {{but keep in mind}} that [...] "a wrasse will harass." [...] Wrasses are best kept alone unless they're different species, and if you're planning to keep one with fish like mandarins, tangs, or gobies, put it in last. As in the wild, captive fish have territories, too. Delicate or small fish tend to only shoo intruders away and may allow certain species in. Semi- aggressive or aggressive fish will defend their territory fiercely. If an aggressive or semi-aggressive fish is introduced to the tank first or {{at the same time as}} other fish, it will see its territory as the whole tank and attack other [...] "invading" [...] fish. If such a fish is put in last, it has no territory to defend and won't bother anyone. But be careful of the timing, as any peaceful or non-aggressive fish is introduced after that, the aggressive chaps and sometimes even the whole tank will fight. Sometimes, a certain species of fish is incompatible with another type whatsoever.

50|$|The hydroflight {{industry}} {{is full of}} hazards and potential for things to go wrong. Here {{is a list of}} things that pilots must keep their eyes peeled for whilst operating a device.• Rocks and other submerged objects can be a very dangerous hazard for all hydroflight participants. Before diving under the water it is best to have a good understanding of what lies beneath the surface and the depth of the water. • Water depth is another critical element to the sport of hydroflight. If the pilot is operating only 1-3 meters above the water, then they should have at least 2 meters of depth below them. If the pilot exceeds 3 meters, then the water depth must now be at a depth of 4 meters.• Objects above the water can be as equally as dangerous as any other submerged objects. Whilst flying in the air a pilot must keep on the lookout for any 3D objects such as bridges, buoys, boats, jetties, other hydroflight pilots and the hose and jet ski that they’re attached to.• Dolphin dives is a fantastic manoeuvre that is usually performed more on the jet-boards. Although it looks spectacular it holds a great danger because the pilot is diving head first into the water from any height between 1-15 meters. Whilst performing this manoeuvre it is essential to know how to execute it perfectly and also to have the knowledge of what lies beneath the surface and how much water depth you have to work with.• Knee knockouts are the most common of injuries when it comes to advanced manoeuvres. If the pilot bends his knees and goes into a squat position whilst the board is lifting them up with high power, {{there is a good chance}} the knee will make contact with the face.• Weather and tides can be hazardous to any pilot no matter their skill level. Tides and currents can play a big factor because if the tide goes out it may take away the valuable water depth that is needed to maintain your safety. If the current is creating rips on the beach, then the pilot can easily drift out of his designated zone or float out to sea if they’re not concentrating. If storms approach it is best to exit the water because there are many electricity conducting components in the jet skis and hydroflight devices that could end up giving you a nasty shock if lighting gets too close.• Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning can be hazardous to your health and even cause death. To ensure safety you must never get to close to the back of the jet ski where these fumes are released whilst the engine is turned on.• Flotation equipment is essential. Always <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> PFD has a rating of level 3 and that your chosen hydroflight devices floatation is still buoyant.• Not only should their always be someone observing your flight from the jet ski but for extra safety you should also have another on the beach. Always discuss and arrange your hand signals so that all participants are on the same page before starting.|$|E
