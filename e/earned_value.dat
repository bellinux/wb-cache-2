5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the <b>earned</b> <b>value</b> gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} change in {{inequality}} of educational opportunity in Israel. Recent studies in Israel and elsewhere have found declining inequality of opportunity at the primary and secondary levels of education coupled with more persistent inequality at higher levels. However, these studies {{ignore the fact that}} the relative value of qualifications change as education expands over time. Many scholars agree that that the value of qualifications lies in their relative position in the distribution of education. And yet, in empirical research education is typically represented in absolute rather than relative terms. I analyze all available Israeli mobility data for the cohorts born between 1951 - 1981 and estimate models of both absolute and relative education, as well as of education recoded into its <b>earning</b> <b>value.</b> When education is defined in absolute terms, I find the familiar decline in the effects of parents’ education. When it is measured in terms of its <b>earning</b> <b>value</b> or in relative terms, the results show significant increases in the effect of parents’ education on education. I also study change in the effects of ethnicity and of gender. ...|$|R

40|$|In an {{uncertain}} and changing environment, a composite service needs to continuously optimize its business process and service selection through runtime adaptation. To achieve the overall satisfaction of stakeholder requirements, quality tradeoffs {{are needed to}} adapt the composite service {{in response to the}} changing environments. Existing approaches on service selection and composition, however, are mostly based on quality preferences and business processes decisions made statically at the design time. In this paper, we propose a requirements-driven self-optimization approach for composite services. It measures the quality of services (QoS), estimates the <b>earned</b> business <b>value,</b> and tunes the preference ranks through a feedback loop. The detection of unexpected <b>earned</b> business <b>value</b> triggers the proposed self-optimization process systematically. At the process level, a preference-based reasoner configures a requirements goal model according to the tuned preference ranks of QoS requirements, reconfiguring the business process according to its mappings from the goal configurations. At the service level, selection decisions are optimized by utilizing the tuned weights of QoS criteria. We used an experimental study to evaluate the proposed approach. Results indicate that the new approach outperforms both fixed-weighted and floating-weighted service selection approaches with respect to <b>earned</b> business <b>value</b> and adaptation flexibility. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> Management is a {{globally}} {{accepted and}} well established integrated planning and control methodology that combines {{the measurement of}} cost, schedule and technical performance. It enables early detection of performance issues and allows corrective actions to be implemented in a timely manner. The objective {{of this study is}} to establish the possibility of introducing <b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> Management as an ICTAD Condition of Contract for Major Contracts for the performance reporting and evaluation. In literature review derived the several important benefits of the EVM as an effective performance measuring technique, the problems in implementing and commonly used practice standards in the globe. The construction industry was an early private industry adopter of EVM. EVM is commonly used in United States of America, United Kingdom, Australia and other European and Asian countries to evaluate construction projects. EVM is a flexible and universally applicable project management technique. However, in Sri Lankan construction industry there is a need of a globally established performance monitoring technique for the development of the industry and better performance. Under these circumstances, it is important to find out the feasibility of introducing EVM as an ICTAD condition for the construction industry. The effectiveness of the ICTAD document to the industry is high. The level of acceptance is significant; the responses show that 64 % of respondents accept the Time Schedule as an effective tool and 37. 3 % submit it on-time for all projects to fulfil the ICTAD requirement. However, Sri Lankan construction industry doesn’t have a proper understanding and knowledge about the use of Time Schedule and its limitations. The lack of knowledge about the technique hinders the getting appropriate use of the technique. However, respondents believe effective performance measuring technique should not have these limitations. The result of this study confirms the possibility of introducing the EVM in Sri Lankan construction industry for performance reporting and evaluation. Further, results highlight that the importance and necessity of <b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> Management to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Sri Lankan construction industry. The majority of respondents believe the most important aspect of the EVM is, it helps projects to be completed within time and cost constraints compared to other benefits. The survey results illustrate that more than 80 % of respondents believe Sri Lankan construction industry need EVM concept for effective and accurate performance management. The cost performance management is the primary concern of the Industry. The Industry’s perception on the possibility of EVM implementation is satisfactory...|$|R

This research motivated by Febrianto and Widiastuty’s research (2006) which tested 3 points of accounting i. e. gross income, operating income and net income. However, looked from econometric side comparison between 3 points of accounting is not relevant. This fact based on reality that gross income is not final result in income statement, {{so it would}} be refracted if putted in value relevance model. This refraction resulted from proportion of marketing cost components and administrations are not counted in profit determination. Because of that, this research used operating income, net income and transitory earning as independent variable and stock return as dependent variable.

Second, value relevance of operating income is higher than net income relevance.

In principle, a controller at runtime can monitor the change impact on quality {{requirements of}} the system, update the expectations and priorities from the environment, and take reasonable actions to improve the overall satisfaction. In practice, however, existing controllers are mostly designed for tuning low- level performance indicators rather than high-level requirements.

The reasoning result is involved to reconfigure the variation points of the goal model, and accordingly mapped to the system architecture reconfiguration.
