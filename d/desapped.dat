50|$|The fruit {{may also}} be damaged by {{eriophyid}} coconut mites (Eriophyes guerreronis). This mite infests coconut plantations, and is devastating; it can destroy up to 90% of coconut production. The immature seeds are infested and <b>desapped</b> by larvae staying in the portion covered by the perianth of the immature seed; the seeds then drop off or survive deformed. Spraying with wettable sulfur 0.4% or with Neem-based pesticides can give some relief, but is cumbersome and labor-intensive.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was the structural optimization of thin shell structures that are subjected to stress and displacement constraints. In order to accomplish this, the structural optimization computer program <b>DESAP</b> 1 was modified and improved. In the static analysis part of the <b>DESAP</b> 1 computer program the torsional spring elements, which are used to analyze thin, shallow shell structures, were eliminated by modifying the membrane stiffness matrix of the triangular elements in the local coordinate system and adding a fictitious rotational stiffness matrix. This simplified the <b>DESAP</b> 1 program input, improved {{the accuracy of the}} analysis, and saved computation time. In the optimization part of the <b>DESAP</b> 1 program the stress ratio formula, which redesigns the thickness of each finite element of the structure, was solved by an analytical method. This scheme replaced the iterative solution that was previously used in the <b>DESAP</b> 1 program, thus increasing the accuracy and speed of the design. The modified program was used to design a thin, cylindrical shell structure with optimum weight, and the results are reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|<b>DESAP</b> 2 is {{described}} as a finite element program for computer-automated, minimum weight design of elastic structures with constraints on stresses (including local instability criteria) and buckling loads. No limits are placed on the number of load conditions for stress-constrained design, but only one of these load conditions can be chosen as the potential buckling load. A substantial portion of <b>DESAP</b> 2, particularly the analysis of the prebuckling state, is derived from the SOLID SAP finite element program. The stress-constrained design is based on the classical stress ratio method, which drives the design towards a fully stressed state. The constraints on the buckling load are handled by solving the appropriate optimality criterion by successive iterations. During each iteration, the element sizes determined by the stress ratio method are used as the minimum size constraints. The element subroutines are organized in a manner that permits the user to make additions and changes with a minimal programming effort. Consequently, <b>DESAP</b> 2 can readily be changed into a special-purpose program to handle the user's specific design requirements and failure criteria...|$|R

40|$|Sapburn {{injury is}} {{regarded}} as the most serious threat to external fruit quality of mango. When the stem (pedicel) of a mango fruit is broken, the sap exudes out; spreading over the fruit peel causes serious skin damages. This study was intended to determine the best time of harvest and <b>desapping</b> for maximum control of sapburn injury in mango fruits. The performance of lime [Ca(OH) 2] was evaluated at different times of the day in comparison with Australian industry product “Mango Wash”. The fruits were harvested at three different times of the day: morning (7 a. m.), noon (12 p. m.) and evening (5 p. m.) and subjected to lime (@ 0. 5 %) and Mango Wash (@ 0. 4 %) treatments. No sap injury (0 score) was observed in the fruits harvested and de-sapped during morning whereas maximum sap injury was observed at noon in both the cases (0. 5 score for lime, 0. 75 score for Mango Wash). Both lime and Mango Wash showed significantly less sap injury as compared to control for all the three times of treatment application. Almost all of the physico-chemical attributes (except fruit peel colour and non-reducing sugar contents) were non-significantly affected by the <b>desapping</b> treatments. Fruit peel colour was slightly suppressed by Mango Wash. Lime was found to impart attractive appearance to the fruits; however the skin colou...|$|R

40|$|Reaction of chilli genotypes against mites, [Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) ] and thrips, [Scirthothrips dorsalis (Hood) ] under natural conditions* Chilli (Capsicum annuum L.) is an {{important}} vegetable specially known for its pungency capsaicin (8 -methyl-N-vanillyl- 6 -enamide), aroma and spicy taste (Choudhary and Samadia, 2004). Chilli is {{a rich source of}} vitamin C. It also contains vitamin A, vitamin B and minerals (Singh, 2007). India is the leading country in the production of chillies contributing 41. 11 per cent of the worlds production. Andhra Pradesh is the largest chilli growing state followed by Karnataka and Maharashtra. Andhra Pradesh contributes 28 per cent of area and 62 per cent of production followed by Karnataka with 17 per cent of area and 12 per cent of production (Peter, 2009). Despite continuous efforts of various levels the chilli productivity did not get momentum. A number of limiting factors could be attributed to the low productivity. Of these, damage due to insect is {{an important}} one. The characteristic leaf curl syndrome called “Murda ” is a typical malady with which chilli suffers in the India. The syndrome is due to the attack of either mites or thrips or both (Puttarudriah, 1959). The mechanical feeding injury and <b>desapping</b> by the young and adults of these two pests o...|$|R
40|$|Pakistan {{is one of}} {{the major}} mango-producing and -exporting {{countries}} in the world. During 2007 - 15, significant postharvest research and development (R&D) work was conducted under the Australian-funded ASLP mango supply chain management/value chain improvement projects (two phases). The project started by laying a postharvest foundation R&D infrastructure in 2007. Fruit quality losses in supply chains were documented. Protocols were developed for maturity testing, <b>desapping,</b> storage/sea-freighting, and ripening and postharvest disease management of major mango cultivars. Quantity loss (unmarketable fruit) was around 20 % while quality loss (affecting price) was 65 and 70 % in Sindhri and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa mango, respectively. Sap burn and postharvest diseases were the most important fruit quality issues at retail. Cultivars differed in terms of fruit harvest maturity indicators, postharvest treatment response, controlled atmosphere conditions and temperatures for storage and ripening. Besides physical de-sapping (on racks), lime wash (de-stemming and dipping fruit in 0. 5 % lime solution for 2 - 3 min) was also found to be effective, with morning being the best time for fruit picking. Significant relationships of production locality, orchard management, nutrition (Ca, B and K) and pre-cooling were found with postharvest disease incidence. Postharvest hot-water fungicidal dip of Scholar (active ingredient (a. i.) fludioxonil), Amistar (a. i. azoxystrobin) and Sportak (a. i. procholaz) gave significant fruit disease control. An integrated approach of good production practices, right maturity, correct postharvest fungicidal treatments and pre-cooling was an effective strategy for reducing disease incidence and maintaining better shelf-life at retail. On the basis of R&D and interventions, significant improvement was brought to the local mango industry and export. Sindhri mangoes were sea-freighted commercially to the EU and UK with good fruit quality outturn and overall postharvest life of 40 - 45 days...|$|R
