5|$|A. V. M. Rajan portrayed Shanmugasundaram's brother Thangarathnam. According to playwright Crazy Mohan, Gopulu's {{caricature}} {{of the character}} Vaithi in Subbu's novel was similar to Nagesh, who portrayed Vaithi in the film. Manorama played the wildly expressive, loud-talking but tender-hearted folk dancer Karuppayi, who has to contend with living under the shadows of landlords; she changes her identity <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to escape from them. In an interview with Maalai Malar, Manorama stated that she was initially nervous acting in front of Ganesan and Balaiah, but Nagarajan assured her that whenever her character appeared {{she would be the}} centre of attention, which gave her the confidence to play her role. Serial and theatre artist M. L. Bhanumathi played the nurse who treats Shanmugasundaram. Other supporting actors included K. Sarangkapani, S. Ramarao, M. K. Murthy, Balusundaram, T. N. Sivadhanu, S. R. Dasarathan, Sivasooriyan, Senthamarai, Kallapart Natarajan, Gundu Karuppaiah, Chandranbabu, S. V. Rajagopal, A. M. Maruthappa, Udayachandrika, Ambika and Kalpalatha.|$|E

He is a deliberate player, but <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E

60|$|As a {{representative}} author, a literary figure, no man else will bequeath {{to the future}} more significant hints of our stormy era, its fierce paradoxes, its din, and its struggling parturition periods, than Carlyle. He belongs to our own branch of the stock too; neither Latin nor Greek, but altogether Gothic. Rugged, mountainous, volcanic, he was himself more a French revolution {{than any of his}} volumes. In some respects, so far in the Nineteenth century, the best equipt, keenest mind, even from the college point of view, of all Britain; only he had an ailing body. Dyspepsia is to be traced in <b>every</b> page, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fills the page.

Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.

60|$|The moonbeam {{fell upon}} {{the roof and}} garden of Gerard. It suffused the cottage with its {{brilliant}} light, except where the dark depth of the embowered porch defied its entry. All around the beds of flowers and herbs spread sparkling and defined.

Farther on the fruit-trees caught the splendour of the night; and looked like a troop of sultanas taking their gardened air, when the eye of man could not profane them, and laden with jewels. There were apples that rivalled rubies; pears of topaz tint: a whole paraphernalia of plums, some purple as the amethyst, others blue and brilliant as the sapphire; an emerald here, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> a golden drop that gleamed like the yellow diamond of Gengis Khan.|$|R

25|$|Kiritimati's lagoon and the saltflats are a prime {{location}} for migratory birds to stop over or even stay all winter. The most commonly seen migrants are ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis) and wandering tattler (Tringa incana); other seabirds, waders and even dabbling ducks can be encountered <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brigham Young formalized and anointed these assassins as the Danites, {{whose mission}} {{included}} espionage, suppression of information, and quietly, permanently disposing {{of people who}} threatened the Mormon prophet or the Latter-day Saint organization.

25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing.

60|$|They {{headed for}} the boulder beach, where they landed the half-breed. He made a line fast to the craft and went up-stream {{with the end of}} it, while Carnally thrust the canoe out and, with Andrew's help, forced her up against the current, aided by the line. It was arduous work. The foam stood high about the bows; eddies {{swirling}} up from the rough bottom swung them to and fro and, although they strained <b>every</b> muscle, <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> brought them to a standstill. Angry waves broke on board freely, and Andrew realized that if Lucien lost his footing or slackened his efforts the line would be torn from him and they would be swept back to the tail of the pool. This, however, would be better than being sucked into the cataract close outshore, which would no doubt result in the canoe's capsizing. At last they reached a spot where they must stem the main rush, which swung in nearer the bank.|$|R
60|$|For {{six days}} from our time of {{starting}} we sailed down the Indian River. Sometimes the banks were miles apart, {{and sometimes they}} were very near each other; sometimes we would come upon a solitary house, or little cluster of dwellings; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there would be many, many miles of wooded shore before another human habitation was to be seen. Inland, to the west, stretched a vast expanse of lonely forest where panthers, bears, and wild-cats prowled. To the east lay a long strip of land, through whose tall palmettoes came {{the roar of the}} great ocean. The blue sky sparkled over us <b>every</b> day; <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> we met a little solitary craft; countless water-fowl were scattered about {{on the surface of the}} stream; a school of mullet was usually jumping into the air; an alligator might sometimes be seen steadily swimming across the river, with only his nose and back exposed; and nearly always, either to the right or to the left, going north or going south, were seven pelicans, slowly flopping through the air.|$|R
60|$|They {{found it}} a bleak and cheerless country, crossed by the ravines of a few {{sluggish}} creeks, the water of which was unpleasant to drink, and dotted at long intervals by ponds bitter with alkali. In places, stunted poplar bluffs cut against the sky, but, for the most part, {{there was only a}} rolling waste of dingy grass. The trail was heavy, the wheels sank deep in sand as they climbed a low rise, and, to make things worse, the rounded, white-edged clouds which had scudded across the sky since morning were gathering in threatening masses. This had happened <b>every</b> afternoon, but <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the cloud ranks had broken, to pour out a furious deluge and a blaze of lightning. Harding anxiously studied the sky.|$|R
25|$|Although mostly nocturnal, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit crepuscular behaviour. Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face {{away from the}} disturbance, but peek <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to check the situation. The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.|$|E
25|$|The Pequod gams {{next with}} the Bachelor, a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> the Pequod lowers for whales with success. On {{one of those}} nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab.|$|E
25|$|Bishen Singh Bedi, {{the under}} {{pressure}} {{captain of the}} Indian cricket team, was not convinced the Vaseline was to keep sweat out of the eyes. He said Lever had used unfair means to shine the ball. The English paceman’s habit of rubbing the ball over his eyebrows <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> was also noticed. Tests on the cricket ball revealed presence of greasy substance. Whether the Vaseline had been intentionally applied to the ball or not was later disputed, and Lever's previous performances on the tour questioned.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning the Bungay church bells rang merrily, and half its population was present to see John Crumb made a happy man. He himself {{went out to the}} farm and drove the bride and Mrs Pipkin into the town, expressing an opinion that no hired charioteer would bring them so safely as he would do himself; nor did he think it any disgrace to be seen performing this task before his marriage. He smiled and nodded at <b>every</b> one, <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> pointing back with his whip to Ruby when he met any of his specially intimate friends, as though he would have said, 'see, I've got her at last in spite of all difficulties.' Poor Ruby, in her misery under this treatment, would have escaped out of the cart had it been possible. But now she was altogether in the man's hands and no escape was within her reach. 'What's the odds?' said Mrs Pipkin as they settled their bonnets in a room at the Inn just before they entered the church. 'Drat it,--you make me that angry I'm half minded to cuff you. Ain't he fond o' you? Ain't he got a house of his own? Ain't he well to do all round? Manners! What's manners? I don't see nothing amiss in his manners. He means what he says, and I call that the best of good manners.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ten {{months passed}} away, however, and Eustace Le Neve didn't {{seem to get}} much nearer any {{permanent}} appointment than ever. He began to tire at last of applying unsuccessfully for <b>every</b> passing vacancy. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he got odd jobs, to be sure; but odd jobs won't do {{for a man to}} marry upon; and serious work seemed always to elude him. Walter Tyrrel did his best, no doubt, to hunt up all the directors of all the companies he knew; but no posts fell vacant on any line they were connected with. It grieved Walter to the heart, for he had always had the sincerest friendship for Eustace Le Neve; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> that Eustace was going to marry Cleer Trevennack, Walter felt himself doubly bound in honor to assist him. It was HE who had ruined the Trevennacks' hopes in life by his unintentional injury to their only son; the least he could do in return, he thought, and felt, was to make things as easy as possible for their daughter and her intended husband.|$|R
60|$|Does any one say--These {{things are}} too high for me; I cannot {{understand}} them? My dear friends, are they not too high for me likewise? Do you fancy that I understand them, though my reason, as well as Holy Scripture, tells me that they are true? I understand them no more than I understand how I draw a single breath, or think a single thought. But {{it is good for}} you, and for me, <b>and</b> for <b>every</b> man, <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> to hear things which we do NOT understand; that so we may learn our own ignorance, and be lifted up above ourselves, and renounce our fancied worldly wisdom, and think within ourselves:--Would it not be wiser to confess ourselves fools, and take our Lord's advice, and be converted, and become as little children? For otherwise, our Lord says, we shall in nowise enter into this very kingdom of heaven of which I have been telling you. For {{this is one of the}} things which God hides from the wise and prudent, and yet revealeth unto babes. Yes, that is the way to understand all things, however deep--to become as little children. A little child proves that all I say is true, and that it knows that all I say is true. Though it cannot put its feelings into words, it acts on them by a mere instinct, which is the gift of God. Why does a little child pick flowers? Why does a little child dance when it hears a strain of music? And deeper still, why does a little child know when it has done wrong? Why does it love to hear of things beautiful and noble, and shrink from things foul and mean, if what I say is not true? The child does so, because it is nearer heaven, not further off, than we grown folk.|$|R
