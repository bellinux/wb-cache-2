The alloy components (iron recovered in hydrogen (99.96 mass %), single-crystal silicon (99.999 mass %), niobium (≥ 99.7 mass %), Fe 2 B master alloy preliminary melted using amorphous boron (99.8 mass %), and electrical copper (99.9 mass %) were melted in a ceramic crucible and held 6 – 7  min at temperature 1500  °С; then, the melt was cast into a graphite mold.

The high speed slicer blade-head weight was reduced to 37 pounds, allowing surface speeds of up to 500 feet per minute.

A recovered gold <b>ingot</b> <b>weighing</b> 80 lb sold for a record $8 million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency {{in the world at}} that time. Thompson was sued in 2005 by several of the investors who had provided $12.5 million in financing, and in 2006 by several members of his crew, over a lack of returns for their respective investments.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the verification of casting and solidification of heavy slab <b>ingot</b> <b>weighing</b> 40 t from tool steel {{by means of}} numerical modelling with use of a finite element method. The pre-processing, processing and post-processing phases of numerical modelling are outlined. Also, the problems with determination of the thermodynamic properties of materials and with determination of the heat transfer between the individual parts of the casting system are discussed. The final porosity, macrosegregation {{and the risk of}} cracks were predicted. The results allowed us to use the slab ingot instead of the conventional heavy steel ingot and to improve the ratio, the chamfer and the external shape of the wall of the new design of the slab ingot.

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} of {{room temperature}} ductility and {{high temperature strength}} have shown that Fe 3 Al-based alloys could start their cut-and-try commercial applications in industry. This paper presents the results on development of large-ingot Fe 3 Al-based alloys, including melting, thermomechanical processing and mechanical properties. A large <b>ingot</b> <b>weighing</b> 269 kg, with a high quality surface was fabricated by vacuum induction melting. Conventional thermomechanical processes were used to produce bars, sheets and seamless tubes. By controlling the thermomechanical treatment, a room temperature ductility with a value of more than 10 % was achieved which is only a little lower than that prepared in the laboratory. The creep lifetime at 600 degreesC and 200 MPa was more than 2000 h after annealing. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Vacuum {{induction}} melting (VIM) is {{the most}} widely used process for the commercial production of NiTi alloys. But, the major drawback in VIM is the carbon contamination of the ingot from the graphite crucible. During melting, carbon reacts with Ti and forms TiC. This alters the Ni/Ti ratio in the alloy and thereby changes the transformation temperatures drastically. Also, the TiC particles in the matrix hinder the workability of the alloy as well as the memory properties of the products. The present experimental study deals with the VIM of NiTi alloys melted in graphite crucible wherein {{it has been shown that}} the carbon pick up in the melt can be reduced significantly when Ni and Ti are placed in the graphite crucible by a novel method of charging. The cast <b>ingots</b> (<b>weighing</b> 7 x 2013; 8 kg each) were subjected to various secondary metal processing operations viz., forging, rolling and wire drawing.

40|$|It {{has been}} a {{principal}} aim {{of research at the}} Isotrace Laboratory in Oxford to establish Bronze Age trading patterns in the Mediterranean, especially for metals. The metals copper and tin, together with silver, lead and gold, were the metals which constituted the ‘trade’ in metals in the Late Bronze Age Mediterranean. Archaeology per se had failed to establish these trading patterns, as had scientific methods using chemical analyses. However it was established by the Isotrace Laboratory in 1982 that comparative lead isotope analyses of metal ores and artefacts could be extended from the study of lead and silver to provide a method to establish trading patterns for copper. A principal form in which copper was traded around the Mediterranean region in the period roughly between 1600 BC and 1100 BC was {{in the form of the}} so called copper oxhide <b>ingots,</b> <b>weighing</b> on average about 30 kilograms. The present paper proves that the large number of copper oxhide ingots found on Sardinia were not made of copper from Sardinian ore deposits, as surmised by some archaeologists, but were instead made from copper from the Apliki mining region deposits in Cyprus, in common with all other analysed copper oxhide ingots from around the LBA Mediterranean, including the ingots excavated from the LBA shipwreck of Cape Gelidonya. It is also proved that copper alloy artefacts excavated from nuragic contexts on Sardinia are consistent with having been made of copper from Sardinian ore deposits. Citation: Gale, N. H. (2006).

5000|$|Helston, {{the nearest}} {{town to the}} Lizard peninsula, {{is said to have}} once headed the estuary of the River Cober, before it was cut off from the sea by Loe Bar in the 13th century. It is a matter of debate as to whether Helston was once a port, albeit no actual records still exist. Geomorphologists believe the bar was most likely formed by rising sea levels, after the last ice age, {{blocking}} the river and creating a barrier beach. The beach is formed mostly of flint and the nearest source is found offshore under the drowned terraces of the former river that flowed between England and France, and now under the English Channel. The medieval port of Helston was at Gweek, possibly from around 1260 onwards, on the Helford river which exported tin and copper. Helston was believed to be in existence in the sixth century, around the Dowr Kohar.The name comes from the Cornish [...] "hen lis" [...] or [...] "old court" [...] and [...] "ton" [...] added later to denote a Saxon manor; the Domesday Book refers to it as Henliston (which survives as the name of a road in the town).
