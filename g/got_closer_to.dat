In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit.

As we <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design."

Inspired by Pudovkin's treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often [...] "re-direct" [...] a film, and he remarked: [...] "I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed... It can make or break a film". Biographer John Baxter stated that [...] "Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line.

At this time, Breckinridge halted his forces until the supply trains arrived to resupply the troops. While the infantry was being resupplied, Confederate cavalry General Imboden arrived with his brigade with the news that the creek was too swollen to be crossed. Union General Sullivan arrived during this time with the 28th and 116th Ohio Infantry; Sigel managed to organize a rearguard on Rude's Hill, with Sullivan's infantry east of the turnpike, some of Stahel's cavalry west of the road, and the artillery behind the line. Due to the exhaustion of the men and low ammunition, Sigel decided to retreat back across the Shenandoah River to Mount Jackson. The Union army managed to cross the river and burn the bridge before the Confederates could catch up.|$|E
2500|$|The Tidal Wave Pool: The first patron death {{occurred}} here in 1982; another visitor {{drowned in}} this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, {{the number of}} people the lifeguards saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, [...] "The Grave Pool". It was [...] wide by [...] long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as 40inches (102cm) in height. It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not swim when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim well did not realize that the waves, as fresh water, were not as buoyant as their ocean counterparts, and they sometimes exhausted themselves doing more swimming than they were ready for, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents. Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a pool or lake. Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the [...] "High Tide Wavepool" [...] but made the pool much shallower.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{started to}} get ideas for Magnolia during the long editing period of Boogie Nights (1997). [...] As he <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> {{finishing}} the film, he started writing down material for his new project. After the critical and financial success of Boogie Nights, New Line Cinema, who backed that film, told Anderson {{that he could do}} whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, [...] "I was in a position I will never ever be in again". Michael De Luca, then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for Magnolia, granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film. Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was [...] "intimate and small-scale", something that he could shoot in 30 days. He had the title of [...] "Magnolia" [...] in his head before he wrote the script. As he started writing, the script [...] "kept blossoming" [...] and he realized that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put [...] "an epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment". He wanted to [...] "make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie". Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that [...] "start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue", actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress Melora Walters. The next image that came to him was of Philip Baker Hall as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her. Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree's bark helped cure cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Cassius Dio, {{who wrote}} the most {{detailed}} account of the period, {{did not mention the}} Luca conference. In his version, instead, Pompey and Crassus agreed to stand for the consulship between themselves as a counterpoise to Caesar. [...] Pompey was annoyed about the increasing admiration of Caesar due to his success in the Gallic Wars. He felt that this was overshadowing his own exploits. He tried to persuade the consuls not to read his reports from Gaul and to send someone to relieve his command. He was unable to achieve anything through the consuls and felt that Caesar no longer needed him. He thought that he was in a precarious situation. He begun to arm himself against Caesar and <b>got</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Crassus because he thought he could not challenge Caesar on his own. The two men decided to stand for the consulship so that they could be more than a match for Caesar. They gave up their pretence that {{they did not want to}} take the office and begun canvassing outside the legally specified period. The consuls said that there would not be any elections that year and that they would appoint an interrex to preside over the elections in the next year so that they would have to seek election in accordance with the law. There was a lot of wrangling in the senate and the senators left the session. Cato, who in that year was a plebeian tribune, called people from the forum into the senate house because voting was not allowed in the presence of non-senators. However, other plebeian tribunes prevented the outsiders from getting in. The decree was passed. Another decree was opposed by Cato. The senators left and went to the forum and one of them, Marcellinus, presented their complaints to the people. Clodius took Pompey’s side again to get his support for his aims. He addressed the people, inveighing against Marcellinus and then went to the senate house. The senators prevented him from entering and he was nearly lynched. He called out for the people to help him and some people threatened to torch the senate house. Later Pompey and Crassus were elected consuls without any opposing candidates apart from Lucius Domitius. One of the slaves who was accompanying him in the forum was killed. This frightened him and he withdrew his candidacy. Publius Crassus, a son of Crassus who was one of Caesar’s lieutenants, brought soldiers to Rome for intimidation.|$|E
