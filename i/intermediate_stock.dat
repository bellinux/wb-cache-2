5000|$|One key {{indicator}} {{of the success of}} production scheduling based on demand, pushing, is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a push. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [...] "pull" [...] comes from demand. Re-supply or production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer. In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that <b>intermediate</b> <b>stock</b> held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, stock building may be deemed more appropriate, and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the production and}} inventory management problem of a two-stage semi-process production system. In case both production stages are physically connected {{it is obvious that}} materials are forced to flow. The economic lotsize depends on the holding cost of the end-product and the combined change-over cost of both production stages. On the other hand this 'flow shop' is forced to produce at the speed of the slowest stage. The benefit of this approach is the low amount of Work In Process inventory. When on the other hand, the involved stages are physically disconnected, a stock of intermediates acts as a decoupling point. Typically for the semi-process industry are high change-over costs for the process oriented first stage, which results in large lotsize differences for the different production stages. Using the stock of intermediates as a decoupling point avoids the complexity of synchronising operations but is an additional reason to augment the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stock</b> position. The disadvantage of this model is the high amount of Work-In-Process inventory. This paper proposes the 'synchronised planning model' realising a global optimum instead of the combination of two locally optimised settings. The mathematical model proves (for a two-stage single-product setting) that the optimal two-stage production frequency corresponds with the single EOQ solution for the first stage. A sensitivity study reveals, within these two-stage lotsizing models, the economical cost dependency on product and change-over cost ratio‟s. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand under which conditions the „joined setup‟ or the „two-stage individual eoq model‟ remain close to the optimal model. Numerical examples prove that the conclusions about the optimal settings remain valid when extending the model to a two-stage multi-product setting. The research reveals that two-stage individually optimized EOQ lotsizing should only be used when the end-product stage has a high added value and small change-over costs, compared to the first stage. Physically connected operations should be used when the end-product stage has a small added value and low change-over costs, or high added value and large change-over costs compared to the first production stage. The paper concludes with suggesting a practical common cycle approach to tackle a two-stage multi-product production and inventory management problem. The common cycle approach brings the benefit of a repetitive and predictable production schedule...|$|E

The capacity of this optimisation model to provide rich insight into the effects of higher stocking rates within grazing systems is demonstrated in an empirical application. In accordance with system trials, this application shows that higher stocking rates on pasture-based New Zealand dairy farms generally increase pre-grazing pasture biomass, decrease post-grazing pasture biomass, increase pasture utilisation, decrease herbage allowance, decrease intake and energy consumption per cow, decrease milk production per cow, increase milk production per ha, and reduce conception rate.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} {{stocking}} density on production of Mugil platanus fingerlings in laboratory was analyzed. Five stocking densities were evaluated: 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 mullet/L. After 28 days, the highest growth rate was reported for animals reared {{at the lowest}} stocking density (1 mullet/L). Survival rate and water quality were also higher at the lowest stocking density. Although more fingerlings were produced at 10 mullet/L, greater number of animals decreased the water quality, which was reflected in their reduced growth and survival rates. M. platanus fingerlings should be reared in commercial production at <b>intermediate</b> <b>stocking</b> densities (3 - 5 mullet/L) but higher water exchange rates are recommended for lower ammonia concentration.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of {{long-term}} sheep grazing in salt marshes on the diversity of moths and derives conclusive management suggestions {{for the conservation of}} invertebrate diversity in salt marshes. Study sites were located on the Hamburger Hallig, on the Western coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Between 2006 and 2009, salt marshes that have been under four levels of livestock density (0, 1 - 2 sheep/ha, 3 - 4 sheep/ha, 10 sheep/ha) for over 20 years were sampled using light traps and photoeclectors. Plant and moth species richness were highest under low stocking densities, moth species richness, however, showed no difference between low stocking densities and abandonment. Species richness of moths was only weakly correlated with vegetation parameters (species richness, vegetation height, cover and litter). Using additive diversity partitioning we show that no single grazing treatment harbored all recorded moth species and that grazing increases habitat heterogeneity within each treatment. Additionally, we show that moths react more sensitively to grazing than plants, and that therefore assessments of plant species richness in salt marshes do not allow conclusions on invertebrate diversity. For the evaluation of salt-marsh diversity, a multi-species approach should be favored combining plant and invertebrate assessments. A mosaic of abandoned sites and sites with low and <b>intermediate</b> <b>stocking</b> densities would benefit moth diversity in salt-marsh conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|How do large herbivores affect {{grassland}} {{communities with}} regard to their evolutionary grazing histories? And how can we use this knowledge to develop conservation strategies for these areas? This bachelor thesis aims to provide an answer to these questions by constructing an overview of the effects of grazing to a grassland system (with either a short or a long evolutionary history of grazing) in the absence or presence of large herbivores. Grazing is defined as a gradient from low to high grazing intensity (i. e. grazing can be “low”, “intermediate” or “high”). To construct this overview, first and foremost the generalized grazing model for grasslands created by Milchunas et al. (1988) is used. In addition, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is used to clarify differences in magnitude of disturbance caused by grazing to different communities. Furthermore, it is considered how plant-plant interactions are altered in the presence of increasing grazing pressure by large herbivores. Grassland communities with a short evolutionary history are less resistant to stress induced by grazing than communities with a long evolutionary history. From a conservation point of view, low stocking rates are optimal for communities with a short evolutionary grazing history and <b>intermediate</b> <b>stocking</b> rates are optimal for communities with a long evolutionary grazing history. High stocking rates of large herbivores should always be avoided in grassland communities with a short evolutionary history of grazing, or else the system will become susceptible to invasion by exotic species and ultimately degrade. Abandoning grazing entirely results in a homogeneous vegetation structure dominated by a few plant species that outcompete all others, resulting in diminished habitat opportunities and diversity in higher trophic groups. ...|$|R
