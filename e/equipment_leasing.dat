5|$|Vildanden {{was founded}} on 23 November 2004 by 18 local investors who wanted to start {{commercial}} scheduled flights from Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. For a long period, {{there had been a}} public debate about closing the airport. Owned by the municipality, the airport was receiving annual subsidies of NOK2.5 million from the municipality, and NOK3.8 million from the state. It was decided to operate Vildanden as a virtual airline (one that owns none of its <b>equipment,</b> <b>leasing</b> everything from others), and wet lease operations from other companies. Initial plans had been started in 2003 to cooperate with Dutch airline Denim Air, with a 50-seater aircraft, but these plans did not work out.|$|E

In April 1985 the company acquired four savings and loans in Florida and began paying five cents per share quarterly dividend to stockholders. In September of that year, PSFS began doing business under the name Meritor Financial Group to emphasize its expansion into financial services. In 1986 Meritor began operating mutual funds through a subsidiary, completing {{the transition to a}} full-service financial institution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to determine the optimal upgrade and preventive maintenance actions that minimize the total expected cost (maintenance costs+penalty costs). Design/methodology/approach – The problem is a four-parameter optimization with two parameters being k-dimensional. The optimal solution is obtained by using a four-stage approach where at each stage a one-parameter optimization is solved. Findings – Upgrading action is an extra option before the <b>lease</b> of used <b>equipment,</b> in addition to preventive maintenance action. Upgrading action makes equipment younger and preventive maintenance action lowers the ROCOF. Practical implications – There is a growing trend towards <b>leasing</b> <b>equipment</b> rather than owning it. The lease contract contains penalties if the equipment fails often and repairs are done within reasonable time period. This implies that the lessor needs to look at optimal preventive maintenance strategies in the case of new <b>equipment</b> <b>lease,</b> and upgrade actions plus preventive maintenance in the case of used <b>equipment</b> <b>lease.</b> The paper deals with this topic and is of great significant to business involved with <b>leasing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Originality/value – Nowadays many organizations are interested in <b>leasing</b> <b>equipment</b> and outsourcing maintenance. The model in this paper addresses the preventive maintenance problem for <b>leased</b> <b>equipment.</b> It provides an approach to dealing with this problem...|$|R
