He also noted that Pet Sounds had become a ubiquitous object of comparison; [...] " [...] are <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I have to pinch myself and reflect that I'd never thought I'd see the day." [...] Treblezines Brian Roster wrote that Grizzly Bear's album Veckatimest was a [...] "landmark exploration of the changing landscapes of pop in 2009" [...] that represented an attempt to create [...] "a sort of abridged conclusion to chamber pop's earliest days".|$|E

He says he purposefully made the film [...] "to improve his bank account and success quotient". and admitted it was [...] "an aberration in the career line". He added that [...] "whatever [...] deficiencies, I think the wistful quality was there. I was <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> The picture did well and made money." ...|$|E

[...] She later told The New York Times that [...] "I am not <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program." [...] Westheimer joined the Haganah in Jerusalem. Because of her diminutive height of , she was trained as a scout and sniper. Of this experience, she said, [...] "I never killed anybody, but I know how to throw hand grenades and shoot."

2500|$|In {{the vault}} final, Maroney won {{a silver medal}} with a score of 15.083. She {{performed}} an Amanar for her first vault but fell on her second. This fall ended her 33-vault hitting streak in competition. Even with the fall, Maroney still came in second. She said, [...] "I didn't get my full block, my hands didn't really touch the vault. I still walked out with a silver medal and I'm <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I'll have to watch the video {{and figure out what}} happened. It's really sad that I had to fall on that vault but I'm glad I won a silver medal. I know I can do better vaults but I also know I didn't deserve the gold medal because I fell on my second vault. It happens. It's gymnastics. You can't always be perfect. Sometimes things don't go as planned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hook {{tries to}} comfort Emma by {{telling her that}} when his brother died {{all he could do}} was live in the moment. But Emma wonders how she can be still alive if Snow died. All of a sudden, a ladybug buzzes around Hook and just as he is about to kill the insect, Charming shouts “wait!” Charming takes the ladybug, places it on his hand and it is {{transformed}} back into Snow White by the Blue Fairy, thanks to a special form of fairy dust. The Blue Fairy is also aware that Emma wasn't Leia all along, but says it’s all right, her secrets can be hers. Snow is startled when Emma hugs her with tears in her eyes, shouting, “You’re alive.” Snow and Charming seem to be warming up to each other, causing a slight restoration in the timeline. Emma looks at the prisoner and suggests that she and Hook take her with them back to Storybrooke, but the woman is not <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> idea, prompting Emma to knock her out to kidnap her. As Emma, Hook, and their additional guest go their separate ways, both Snow and Charming reach the troll bridge, but thanks to the altered timeline Snow doesn’t have her dust as a weapon to defeat the trolls, so she goes towards them and bluffs. They drop their weapons and take off. The timeline is back on track as Charming is now smitten with Snow before they go their separate ways, with Snow holding on to the ring and trying it on. [...] Emma watches from a distance and gets weepy. Hook says, “It’s ok, Swan. Not everyone gets a chance to watch their parents fall in love.” Emma opens the book, and discovers a picture of Snow and Charming getting married, and as expected Regina still seeking vengeance on Snow, resulting in the timeline being restored, only this time Regina turns the trolls into bugs with the dark magic and squashes them.|$|E

I was sheriff and collector, {{and it was a}} big thing for me then. I was married, and we had a boy and a girl--a four and a six year old. There was a {{comfortable}} house next to the courthouse, furnished by the county, rent free, and I was saving some money. Bob did most of the office work. Both of us had seen rough times and plenty of rustling and danger, and I tell you it was great to hear the rain and the sleet dashing against the windows of nights, and be warm and safe and comfortable, and know you could {{get up in the morning}} and be shaved and have folks call you 'mister.'

6000|$|It is {{said that}} Paganism is a {{religion}} of joy and Christianity of sorrow; {{it would be just}} as easy to prove that Paganism is pure sorrow and Christianity pure joy. Such conflicts mean nothing and lead nowhere. Everything human must have in it both joy and sorrow; the only matter of interest is {{the manner in which the}} two things are balanced or divided. And the really interesting thing is this, that the pagan was (in the main) happier and happier as he approached the earth, but sadder and sadder as he approached the heavens. The gaiety of the best Paganism, as in the playfulness of Catullus or Theocritus, is, indeed, an eternal gaiety never to be forgotten by a grateful humanity. But it is all a gaiety about the facts of life, not about its origin. To the pagan the small things are as sweet as the small brooks breaking out of the mountain; but the broad things are as bitter as the sea. When the pagan looks at the very core of the cosmos he is struck cold. Behind the gods, who are merely despotic, sit the fates, who are deadly. Nay, the fates are worse than deadly; they are dead. And when rationalists say that the ancient world was more enlightened than the Christian, from their point of view they are right. For when they say [...] "enlightened" [...] they mean darkened with incurable despair. It is profoundly true that the ancient world was more modern than the Christian. The common bond is in the fact that ancients and moderns have both been miserable about existence, about everything, while mediaevals were <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> at least. I freely grant that the pagans, like the moderns, were only miserable about everything--they were quite jolly about everything else. I concede that the Christians of the Middle Ages were only at peace about everything--they were at war about everything else. But if the question turn on the primary pivot of the cosmos, then there was more cosmic contentment in the narrow and bloody streets of Florence than in the theatre of Athens or the open garden of Epicurus. Giotto lived in a gloomier town than Euripides, but he lived in a gayer universe.|$|E
6000|$|I take it very kindly indeed {{of you to}} {{have found}} thought and time to send me the {{publication}} with the five brave sonnets. The circumstances (so to call the unspeakable matter) that have conduced to them, and that, taken together, seem to make a sort of huge brazen lap for their congruous beauty, have caused me to read them with an emotion that somehow precludes the critical measure, deprecates the detachment involved in that, and makes me just want--oh so exceedingly much--to be moved by them and to [...] "like" [...] and admire them. So I do greet them gladly, and am right consentingly struck with their happy force and truth: they {{seem to me to}} have come, in a fine high beauty and sincerity (though not in every line with an equal degree of those--which indeed is a rare case anywhere;) and this evening, alone by my lamp, I have been reading them over and over to myself aloud, as if fondly to test and truly to try them; almost in fact as if to reach the far-off author, in whatever unimaginable conditions, by some miraculous, some telepathic intimation that I am in quavering communion with him. Well, they have borne the test with almost all the firm perfection, or straight inevitability, that one must find in a sonnet, and beside their poetic strength they draw a wondrous weight from his having had the right to produce them, as it were, and their rising out of such rare realities of experience. Splendid Rupert--to be the soldier that could beget them on the Muse! and lucky Muse, not less, who could have an affair with a soldier and yet feel herself not guilty of the least deviation! In order of felicity I think Sonnet I comes first, save for a small matter that (perhaps superfluously) troubles me and that I will presently speak of. I place next III, with its splendid first line; and then V ("In that rich earth a richer dust concealed!") and then II. I don't speak of No. IV--I think it the least fortunate (in spite of [...] "Touched flowers and furs, and cheeks!") But the four happy ones are very noble and sound and round, to my sense, and I take off my hat to them, and to their author, in the most marked manner. There are many things one likes, simply, and then there are things one likes to like (or at least that I do;) and these are of that order. My reserve on No. I bears on the last line--to the extent, I mean, of not feeling <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> but before the last word. It may be fatuous, but I am wondering if this line mightn't have acquitted itself better as: [...] "And the worst friend and foe is only death." [...] There is an [...] "only" [...] in the preceding line, but the repetition is--or would be--to me not only not objectionable, but would have positive merit. My only other wince is over the [...] "given" [...] and [...] "heaven" [...] rhyme at the end of V; it has been so inordinately vulgarized that I don't think it good enough company {{for the rest of the}} sonnet, which without it I think I would have put second in order instead of the III. The kind of idea it embodies is one that always so fetches this poor old Anglomaniac. But that is all--and this, my dear Eddie, is all. Don't dream of acknowledging these remarks in all your strain and stress--that you should think I could bear that would fill me with horror. The only sign I want is that if you should be able to write to Rupert, which I don't doubt you on occasion manage, you would tell him of my pleasure and my pride. If he should be at all touched by this it would infinitely touch me. In fact, should you care to send him on this sprawl, that would save you other trouble, and I would risk his impatience. I think of him quite inordinately, and not less so of you, my dear Eddie, and am yours all faithfully and gratefully, ...|$|E
