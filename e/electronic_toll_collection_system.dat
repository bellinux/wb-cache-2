5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system,</b> with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets.

The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December14, 2002.|$|E
5|$|The A5 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. Toll charged along the A5 route between Osijek and the Sredanci interchange depends on the route traveled and ranges from 4.00 kuna (0.54 euro) to 30.00 kuna (4.05 euro) for passenger cars and 13.00 kuna (1.76 euro) to 98.00 kuna (13.24 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. Motorcycles are charged {{approximately half of the}} passenger car rate. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter include smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> which is used by motorways across Croatia, with discounted rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. Toll collection systems along the A5 and A3 are unified; vehicles switching from one motorway to the other at Sredanci, for example, do not pass toll plazas at the interchange.|$|E

25|$|In August 1993, NYSTA {{became the}} first agency to {{implement}} the E-ZPass <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system.</b> By December 1996, it was implemented {{at all of the}} Thruway's fixed-toll barriers and at exits along the Berkshire Connector and the New York City–Buffalo section of the mainline. E-ZPass was installed at all of the mainline exits by March 1998. On May14, 2010, a new E-ZPass configuration, consisting of two highway speed E-ZPass lanes in each direction, became operational at the Woodbury toll plaza, with concrete barriers separating the faster traffic from the staffed toll lanes necessary for vehicles not equipped for E-ZPass. A similar project is in development at the Williamsville toll plaza.|$|E

Also on February 20, the Bayonne Bridge became the first Port Authority crossing to use a fully automated and cashless <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system.</b> All vehicles proceed without stopping at the toll plaza.

In 1997, tolls for cars were eliminated at the Spring Valley toll plaza, with tolls remaining for trucks and other commercial vehicles.

500|$|The roads {{maintained}} by DelDOT include Interstate Highways, other freeways, arterial roads, collector roads, and local roads serving both {{urban and rural}} areas. Delaware has a total of [...] of freeway {{considered part of the}} Interstate Highway System. Non-Interstate freeways in the state include the portion of DE 1 between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana, the section of DE 141 between south of Newport and Prices Corner, and the Puncheon Run Connector that links US 13 and DE 1 in Dover. Two toll roads exist in the state. A mainline toll plaza is located along the Delaware Turnpike portion of I-95 near the Maryland border in Newark. Tolls are also collected along the DE 1 freeway, with mainline toll plazas at Dover and Biddles Corner and ramp tolls at North Dover, South Smyrna, and Boyds Corner. Tolls along I-95 and DE 1 may be paid with cash or an <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> known as E-ZPass. The DRBA also collects tolls for the Delaware Memorial Bridge for motorists entering Delaware from New Jersey using cash or E-ZPass. Highways and other transportation projects in Delaware are funded through both the Transportation Trust Fund and the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The Transportation Trust Fund receives revenue from tolls along I-95 and DE 1, motor fuel taxes of 23 cents per gallon on gasoline and 22 cents per gallon on special fuels, motor vehicle document and registration fees, and DMV fees. In 2013, revenues from the Transportation Trust Fund were $445.4 million while revenue from the Federal Highway Trust Fund totaled $214.5 million.|$|E
40|$|As California {{develops}} toll roads {{during the}} 1990 s and considers {{the use of}} congestion pricing to resolve freeway congestion, <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> technology will assume increasing importance. These electronic, computer-based <b>systems</b> permit nonstop <b>collection</b> of charges for highway use, without requiring costly toll booths. They also facilitate charging different prices {{at different times of}} day and for different segments of a highway—qualities necessary for congestion pricing. It would be desirable for drivers {{to be able to use}} a single electronic “tag ” statewide, rather than having to obtain separate tags for each tolled facility. A 1990 state law required the California Department of Transportation to develop a statewide technical specification for <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> This statewide specification was issued in July 1992.

500|$|The A8 is a {{toll road}} {{based on the}} Croatian vehicle {{classification}} using a ticket system—charging {{for use of the}} motorway based on distance travelled. The system was introduced as a unified toll charge system throughout the Istrian Y motorways in June 2011. Consequently, vehicles using either the A8 or the A9 or switching between the two at the Kanfanar interchange are charged a toll only when they leave the Istrian Y system, no matter where their toll ticket was issued. Along the A8 motorway, a toll is charged only for using the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar–Rogovići section; the remaining sections of the motorway are toll-free as of June 2012. Despite this, toll tickets are issued and collected at all exits with toll plazas. For instance, vehicles traveling between Rogovići and Vranja interchanges are issued toll tickets and are required to stop at toll plazas when entering and leaving the A8, but they are not charged for using the route. The toll charge for travelling {{the entire length of the}} motorway ranges from 36.00kuna (...) for passenger cars to 205.00kuna (€27.33) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll can be paid in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and several prepaid toll collection systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC; the last is an <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> that is shared between all motorways in Croatia except the A2, providing drivers with discounted toll rates and dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
