5|$|Rainfall in Georgia {{peaked at}} 8inches (203mm) in Mount Vernon.

5|$|After the Act's initial success <b>in</b> <b>combating</b> tactics {{designed}} to deny minorities {{access to the}} polls, the Act became predominately used {{as a tool to}} challenge racial vote dilution. Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory annexations, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution. Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution. Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 lawsuits, and {{they were more likely to}} succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.|$|E
