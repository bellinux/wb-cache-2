40|$|In this research, a drop impact {{analysis}} of a fuel assembly in a research reactor is carried out {{to determine whether the}} fuel plate integrity is maintained in a drop accident. A fuel assembly drop accident is classified based on where the accident occurs, i. e., inside or outside the reactor, since each occasion results in a different impact load on the fuel assembly. An analysis procedure suitable for each drop situation is systematically established. For an accident occurring outside the reactor, the direct impact of a fuel assembly on the pool bottom is analyzed using implicit and explicit approaches. The effects of the key parameters, such as the impact velocity and structural damping ratios, are also studied. For an accident occurring inside the reactor, the falling fuel assembly may first hit the <b>fixing</b> <b>bar</b> at {{the upper part of the}} standing fuel assembly. To confirm the fuel plate integrity, a fracture of the <b>fixing</b> <b>bar</b> should be investigated, since the <b>fixing</b> <b>bar</b> plays a role in protecting the fuel plate from the external impact force. Through such an analysis, the suitability of an {{impact analysis}} procedure associated with the drop situation in the research reactor is shown...|$|E
40|$|When a striker of {{finite mass}} impinges {{on the end}} of bar which is imperfectly fixed at its distal end, the impact stress of striker and bar is {{analysed}} by accounting for reflection coefficient of stress wave at the striker-bar interface and terminal end of bar. The reflection coefficients of stress wave in this case are determined in the same way with the evaluation of reflection and transmission of wave passing through shafts having discontinuous cross-sectional area or interface of dissimilar materials. The results of analysis are compared with impact stress of bar perfectly fixed and experiment. The impact stress of bar imperfectly fixed is about 60 %- 80 % of perfectly. The period of impact stress acting in imperfect <b>fixing</b> <b>bar</b> is shorter than in perfect <b>fixing</b> <b>bar.</b> Although the magnitude of impact stress predicted by the analysis is in agreement with the experiment, the shape of wave is a little difference. It is shown that the impact stress of striker-bar interface can be indirectly determined by evaluating the stress caused in striker...|$|E

50|$|The {{three-roll}} mill {{has proven}} to be the most successful of the range of roll mills which saw extensive development in the 19th century. These included the single-roll mill and the five-roll mill. The single-roll mill works by material passing between the roll and a <b>fixed</b> <b>bar</b> pressing against the roll. The five-roll mill incorporates four successively smaller in-running nips and hence, compared to the three-roll mill, allows the use of larger agglomerates as part of the input material- but is correspondingly more complicated and expensive.|$|R

It is tastefully decorated in green throughout including the <b>fixed</b> <b>bar</b> counter. The ceiling is also decorated with period cornicing. In the 50s the Green Salon {{was used as a}} restaurant for guests to the Ball House. During 1961 to 1990 the Green Salon was used as the editor’s suite for the recording studios and was connected via cameras to the Meistersaal.|$|R

The lifter holds the bar with an {{overhand}} grip, straight arms, straight body, upper body hanging with heels on the ground close together. The lifter pulls the chest toward the bar until it touches, before returning to the starting position under control. Good form means that the body is kept straight throughout the movement. The chin should remain tucked during the motion, keeping the cervical portion of the spine lined up {{with the rest of the}} body.|$|R

50|$|Zero-center {{ammeters}} {{are used}} for applications requiring current to be measured with both polarities, common in scientific and industrial equipment. Zero-center ammeters are also commonly placed in series with a battery. In this application, the charging of the battery deflects the needle {{to one side of}} the scale (commonly, the right side) and the discharging of the battery deflects the needle to the other side. A special type of zero-center ammeter for testing high currents in cars and trucks has a pivoted bar magnet that moves the pointer, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>bar</b> magnet to keep the pointer centered with no current. The magnetic field around the wire carrying current to be measured deflects the moving magnet.|$|R

If the change in the resonance frequency is considerable, measuring with a <b>bar</b> <b>fixed</b> to a post tightly should be performed because the <b>bars</b> are <b>fixed</b> tightly to the post when inspecting wooden guardrails.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{the unusual}} Dakota {{convertible}} was rolled out. The first American convertible pickup since the Ford Model A, it featured a <b>fixed</b> roll <b>bar</b> {{and a simple}} manual top. Roughly 2,482 were sold that first year.

50|$|The device {{consists}} of two pieces which, when locked together, form one long, <b>fixed</b> <b>bar</b> with two protruding hooks opening towards {{the ends of the}} bar. Each piece has one hook, intended to fit around the rim of the steering wheel. The smaller of the two pieces fits inside the larger piece and slides in and out for sizing. When the lock is set, the larger piece's long handle protrudes out, so that the wheel is practically impossible to turn due to collision with other parts of the car or with the driver's legs, and the device cannot be removed because it is too large to slip around the wheel. To remove the device, the user unlocks the central bar, and slides the pieces together so that the hooks no longer surround the rim of the wheel; this allows it to slip out, freeing the wheel.|$|R

40|$|Natural {{evolution}} is intrinsically a robust search and optimization mechanism. Genetic algorithm uses operators taken from natural evolution. This method is fundamentally iterative {{operating on a}} set of candidate solutions, which is called a population. All the population evolves toward better candidate solutions. As subject for the genetic algorithm application is a two link pendulum, which tried to be a model of a gymnast at <b>fixed</b> <b>bar.</b> This must learn how to swing his legs, the second link of the pendulum, in order to get amplified oscillations of the body, the first element. Applied genetic algorithm intends to determine the initial position, the length of time of the relative motion of the second element, and the program by which the movement of the second element stimulates the oscillation of the whole system. The two link pendulum is only an example of how can be solved a problem of programmed behaviour using a genetic algorithm...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the model-based {{development}} of a monkey robot {{that is capable of}} performing continuous brachiation locomotion on swingable rod, as the intermediate step toward studying brachiation on the soft rope or on horizontal ropes with both ends fixed. The work is different from other previous works where the model or the robot swings on <b>fixed</b> <b>bars.</b> The model, which is composed of two rigid links, was inspired by the dynamic motion of primates. The model further served as the design guideline for a robot that has five degree of freedoms: two on each arm for rod changing and one on the waist to initiate a swing motion. The model was quantitatively formulated, and its dynamic behavior was analyzed in simulation. Further, a two-stage controller was developed within the simulation environment, where the first stage used the natural dynamics of a two-link pendulum-like model, and the second stage used the angular velocity feedback to regulate the waist motion. Finally, the robot was empirically built and evaluated. The experimental results confirm that the robot can perform model-like swing behavior and continuous brachiation locomotion on rods...|$|R
40|$|Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata) is {{the largest}} and most {{abundant}} lamprey species in the Snake and Columbia River system. As an endemic and anadromous species, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has an interest in facilitating their protection at federally operated hydroelectric projects. The goal {{of this study was to}} begin to determine the effects of the John Day Dam bypass facilities, specifically the turbine intake screens, and project operations on the behavior and survival of juvenile Pacific lamprey. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine swim speed capability and response to a <b>fixed</b> <b>bar</b> screen in an experimental flume. We found that juvenile Pacific lamprey were highly nocturnal with> 90 % of their swimming activity restricted to hours of darkness. They also had a strong preference for substrate and remained near the bottom of test aquaria during daylight hours. This behavior is consistent with lack of buoyancy compensation (i. e., they have no swim bladder and slightly negative specific gravity). That lamprey are mainly demersal and nocturnal would be advantageous for predator avoidance, but this same behavior increases the possibility that they will pass dams via turbines and underneath the screen or surfac...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{tangential}} drive (Tdrive) polysilicon, {{linear actuator}} is presented which produces large magnitude tangential motion by flexing a microstructure in an essentially straight line with moderate input voltage. These devices have been designed, fabricated, and successfully tested to have substantial displacements even for static positioning. The working {{principle of the}} T-drive is that the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between a <b>fixed</b> <b>bar</b> and a free bar are converted to large amplitude tangential motion by the parallelogram flexural suspension of the free bar. Operating devices are capable of tangential displacements as great as 32 pm. This displacement is stable and easily varied, since the tangential displacement can be controlled by adjusting the potential between the fixed electrode and the traversing bar. Static displacements are detectable for voltages as low as 15 VDC. Typical T-drives have free bars 200 m long, 12 pn wide, with flexural suspensions 450 pn long and 2 pm wide. All component thicknesses are 2 pn. Theoretical models for both the flexural suspension and electrostatic forces have been derived and they predict the relation between tangential displacement and excitation voltage...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} (1) {{quantify}} the respective physical workloads of bar bending and fixing; and (2) compare the physiological and perceptual responses between bar benders and bar fixers. Field studies were {{conducted during the}} summer in Hong Kong from July 2011 to August 2011 over six construction sites. Synchronized physiological, perceptual, and environmental parameters were measured from construction rebar workers. The average duration of the 39 field measurements was 151. 1  ±  22. 4  min under hot environment (WBGT =  31. 4  ±  2. 2  °C), during which physiological, perceptual and environmental parameters were synchronized. Energy expenditure of overall rebar work, bar bending, and <b>bar</b> <b>fixing</b> were 2. 57, 2. 26 and 2. 67  Kcal/min (179, 158 and 186  W), respectively. <b>Bar</b> <b>fixing</b> induced significantly higher physiological responses in heart rate (113. 6 vs. 102. 3  beat/min, p <  0. 05), oxygen consumption (9. 53 vs. 7. 14  ml/min/kg, p <  0. 05), and energy expenditure (2. 67 vs. 2. 26  Kcal/min, p <  0. 05) (186 vs. 158  W, p <  0. 05) as compared to bar bending.
