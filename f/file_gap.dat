The animation function relies on GIMP's layering and image file name numbering capability. Animations are created either by placing each frame {{on its own}} layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), or by manipulating each numbered file {{as if it were}} a frame in the video: moving, rotating, flipping, changing colors, applying filters, etc. to the layers by taking advantage of interpolation within function calls(plug-in usage), within a specified frame range. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video <b>file.</b> <b>GAP</b> also provides programmed layer transitions, frame rate change, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.|$|E

40|$|Majority of {{the rain}} {{producing}} monsoon systems in India form or intensify over the Bay of Bengal and move onto the land. We expect the air-sea interaction to be a crucial factor in the frequent genesis and intensification of monsoon systems over the Bay. Knowledge of air-sea fluxes is essential in determining the air-sea interactions. However, the Bay remains a poorly monitored ocean basin {{and the state of}} the near surface conditions during the monsoon months remains to be studied in detail. For example, we do not know yet which among the various flux formulae used in the General circulation models are appropriate over the Bay since there are no direct measurements of surface fluxes here during the peak monsoon months. The present thesis aims towards <b>filing</b> that <b>gap.</b> In this thesis fluxes were computed using the Bulk method, Inertial dissipation method and direct covariance method. The flux comparisons were reasonable during certain flow conditions which are clearly identified. When these conditions are not met the differences among the fluxes from these methods can be larger than the inherent uncertainties' in the methods. Stratification, flow distortion and averaging time are the key variables that give rise to the differences in the fluxes. It is found that there are significant differences in the surface flux estimates computed from different atmospheric General Circulation Model bulk parameterization schemes. In this thesis, the flow gradients are estimated by taking advantage of the natural pitch and roll motion of the ship. A attempt is made to gain insight into the flow distortion and its influence on the fluxes. In our analysis it is found that the displacement of the streamlines is an important component in quantifying flow distortion...|$|R

40|$|A concept {{inventory}} (CI) is a multiple-choice instrument {{designed to}} evaluate whether a person has an accurate, working knowledge of {{a specific set of}} concepts. An important role of CI’s is to provide instructors with clues about the pre-conceptions (or misconceptions) their students hold which may be actively interfering with learning. Only a few engineering CI’s have been able to be applied successfully in instructional settings, due in part to statistical analysis techniques that are typically applied to the instrument. These techniques include psychometric interpretative techniques such as Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT), which measure the item performance data of the CI’s. However, these strategies do not measure students’ cognitive abilities (misconceptions). To begin <b>filing</b> this <b>gap,</b> the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the applicability of a new statistical method called the Fusion Model to the Concept Assessment Tool for Statics (CATS) among engineering students from various US universities. Specifically, the research question that guided this study was: Can the Fusion Model be appropriately used with the Cognitive Assessment Tool for Statics (CATS) to diagnostically measure students’ cognitive understanding of Statics concepts? ^ In this study, the Fusion Model was applied to CATS through a four-phase procedure. Each phase had a specific objective that was tied to the primary research question. The analysis performed resulted in the generation of a Q-matrix that relates a set of cognitive attributes to specific questions. These attributes were determined using the expertise of the author of this study and most importantly the developer of CATS. Results of the study indicated that CATS has high capability to be used as diagnostic assessment, and also identified items (questions) that needed to be revised because they were not able to discriminate between examinees who were masters and non-masters of the specified attributes.

These patterns have the potential to help instructors to target their instruction on those attributes which are problematic and thus the corresponding concepts that are expected to be difficult for students. ...|$|R

30|$|Rupture path {{selectivity}} {{and distribution}} or partitioning of slip to such branch faults are {{also an important}} issue in the rupture dynamics. Previous 2 -D simulations {{have shown that the}} selection of the rupture paths among branch faults largely depends on the branch geometries and their relative orientations to the principal stress axes (e.g., Kame et al. 2003; Ando and Yamashita 2007). Although this condition is uniquely determined in 2 -D because the faults are described by curved lines, in the current 3 -D case where faults are described by curved surfaces, the condition varies depending on the rupture propagation direction. Thus, for the dominant rupture propagation directions over {{the northern part of the}} fault, we test the two different representative cases by slightly changing the fault geometry. In the first case Model S (Fig.  5 middle), we consider the mix of horizontal and upward rupture propagation, which is realized by assuming a step over (gap) between the central and northern fault segments at shallow depths. In the second one Model C (Fig.  5 bottom), we examine the case of purely horizontal rupture propagation by assuming continuous geometry and <b>filing</b> the aforementioned <b>gap</b> as a fault bend.

40|$|Anodic TiO 2 {{nanotubes}} (ATNTs) {{have been}} studied extensively for many years. However, their mysterious formation mechanism still remains unclear. The formation of gaps and ribs around the nanotubes has not been elucidated. Here, various surface and cross-section morphologies of ATNTs obtained under different anodizing conditions and their evolution process have been investigated in detail. Based on many experimental facts, new explanations for the gaps and ribs are presented. An entire surface layer covered on the nanotubes plays a primary role on the formation of gaps and ribs. The gaps result from the radial distribution of the electric field at the pore bottom. No newly-formed oxide will exist along the gap direction, because the electric <b>filed</b> along the <b>gap</b> is the minimum. The ribs result from the electrolyte entering into the wider gaps among the ATNTs due to the rupture of the entire surface layer. The rings or ribs on the outer wall of ATNTs are formed at the electrolyte/Ti interface due to the discontinuous existence of {{a small amount of}} electrolyte within the gap base. The present viewpoint was demonstrated by an original micro-dam, which can block the electrolyte entering into the gaps and avoid the formation of ribs. © The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

To define a single technique that can be reliably used for evaluation of missing data in time series of weather and building energy use data is a complex task. This thesis evaluates the application of spline and Fourier series mathematical techniques for filling in 1 - 6 hour periods of missing building energy use and weather data. The procedure followed created artificially missing points in measured data sets and was based on the local behavior of the data set around those pseudo-gaps. Seventeen approaches, five related to the spline technique and 12 belonging to the Fourier series, were tested over 20 yearlong samples of energy use and weather data. Two primary factors have been used to determine the preferred interpolation technique and approach to be used for <b>filing</b> data <b>gaps.</b> The principal factor is the reliability of the values yielded. The primary measure of reliability used was the mean bias error (MBE), although the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square (CV-RMSE) was also evaluated. The other factor is the simplicity of the interpolation technique. Simplicity is of great value when a technique must be applied to a large database where the data are managed and stored. The CV-RMSE is the more stable statistical parameter, produces values very similar for each of the techniques, and is independent of the number of points that are being evaluated. In contrast, the MBE is highly dependent on the number of gaps evaluated and shows a little more stability as the pseudo-gap increases. From the results of the normalized MBE, it is recommended that linear interpolation be used for tilling in missing data in time series of dry bulb and dew point temperature data. For building energy use data sets, the Fourier series approach with 24 data points before and after each gap and six constants was found to be the most suitable. In cases where there are not enough data points for the application of this approach, simple linear interpolation is recommended. Also linear interpolation gives the smallest relative errors of CV-RMSE when used to fill pseudo-gaps for all variables analyzed in this thesis...|$|R

The aim of this thesis was to identify the non-technical skills used by anaesthetists in the operating theatre environment {{and to develop a}} behavioural marker system for observing and assessing these skills. Adapting research techniques used in aviation, four stages of research were conducted: 1) Anaesthetists’ non-technical skills were identified through interviews using cognitive task analysis techniques with 29 consultant anaesthetists. 2) A team of anaesthetists and psychologists developed a prototype behavioural marker system. 3) This prototype was evaluated in an experimental study to investigate aspects of its validity, reliability and usability. 4) Finally, user trials were conducted in theatre to investigate practical use of the tool in a real environment; initial user guidance was developed. The result of the research was an empirically based behavioural marker system, called the Anaesthetists’ Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) System, which with training can be used for observation, assessment and discussion of anaesthetists’ non-technical skills.

40|$|The {{problem of}} private {{information}} retrieval (PIR) is to retrieve one message out of K messages replicated at N databases, without revealing {{the identity of}} the desired message to the databases. We consider the problem of PIR with colluding servers and eavesdroppers, named T-EPIR. Specifically, any T out of N databases may collude, i. e. they may communicate their interactions with the user to guess {{the identity of the}} requested message. An eavesdropper is curious to know the database and can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions of any E databases. The databases share some common randomness unknown to the eavesdropper and the user, and use the common randomness to generate the answers, such that the eavesdropper can learn no information about the K messages. Define R^* as the optimal ratio of the number of the desired message information bits to the number of total downloaded bits, and ρ^* to be the optimal ratio of the information bits of the shared common randomness to the information bits of the desired file. In our previous work, we found that when E ≥ T, the optimal ratio that can be achieved equals 1 -E/N. In this work, we focus on the case when E ≤ T. We derive an outer bound R^* ≤ (1 -T/N) 1 -E/N· (T/N) ^K- 1 / 1 -(T/N) ^K. We also obtain a lower bound of ρ^* ≥E/N(1 -(T/N) ^K) /(1 -T/N) (1 -E/N· (T/N) ^K- 1). For the achievability, we propose a scheme which achieves the rate (inner bound) R= 1 -T/N/ 1 -(T/N) ^K-E/KN.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an algorithm for restoring broken pixels, which can appear in graphic <b>files</b> with statistical <b>gaps.</b> The suggested algorithm {{is based on}} the method of hierarchical analysis of the decision support theory. The choice of the broken pixel color depends on the nearest neighbors and their next neighbors. Three parameters inherent in each nearest neighbor are analysed. Firstly, it is the number of neighbors, which have the same color as the given nearest neighbor. Secondly, it is a deviation of the given pixel from the average value of its neighbors. Thirdly, it is a difference between the pixels being on the opposite sides of the broken pixel. Based on these three criteria, for each nearest neighbor of the broken pixel, a weight coefficient is defined. A hierarchical two-level tree for making decision is constructed. As a color of the broken pixel, its neighbor color with the maximum weight is chosen. A computer experiment to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method is conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed method was determined by comparing the similarity degree of the broken and restored images to the source image. To compare images Minkowski metric was used. To conduct experiments photographic and artificial images were used. The paper investigates a dependence of the proposed algorithm efficiency on the broken image amount. It was found out that the proposed algorithm has the advantage over the known algorithms for restoring broken pixels near the sharp edges. An image restored by our method has more sharply defined edges as compared to what the smoothing filters provide. The proposed method can be iteratively applied. As the experiments have shown, the first five iterations provide image enhancement. The proposed method together with the algorithms for detecting the broken pixels can be used to design filters of noisy images. The method efficiency enhancement can be achieved in case of taking into account the large number of neighbors in making decision. This method can be also developed using the increased number of criteria when making decisions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{conservative}} {{treatment of}} a vertical root fracture is bonding and sealing the gap of the root fracture. It is difficult to seal the gap completely from the root canal side. Grinding the gap wall using an ultrasonic endodontic file from the root canal side improves sealability of the gap However, there may be excessive and insufficient grinding. It is possible that dissolving the root canal wall with 10 % citric acid 3 % ferric chloride solutions （ 10 - 3 ） and 10 % sodium hypochlorite （NC） enlarge a region that is difficult for mechanical expansion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the sealability after enlarging the gap of a root fracture with a chemical method and together with an ultrasonic endodontic filing and chemical agents. In the first experiment, 1 millimeter thick dentin pieces were cut out from extracted human teeth, fractured in the direction of tooth axis, restored to the original position, and held. The gaps were treated by 10 - 3 for five minutes and NC for two minutes one time （one time group）, three times （three time group） and no time （control group）. In all groups, gaps were bonded using 4 META/MMA-TBB resin （Super Bond） to seal the fractured gaps. All pieces were then tested by dye penetration tests and the gaps were microscopically measured. In the second experiment, extracted human teeth were fractured vertically and restored. The gaps were treated by the following methods. 1 ） not treated （control group）, 2 ） ground from the root canal wall side with an ultrasonic endodontic file, until the Root ZX reading showed 1. 0 （grinding group）, 3 ） treated by 10 - 3 for 5 minutes and NC for 2 minutes three times （chemical group）, 4 ） treated by 3 rd method after grinding by 4 th method （combination group）. In all groups, gaps were sealed using Super Bond, tested by dye leakage tests, and microscopically measured. In the first experiment, enlarged width was significantly larger in the three times group than in the control and one time group. The rate of dye penetration was significantly smaller in the three times group than in the control and one time group. In the second experiment, the rate of dye penetration was significantly statistically smaller in the combination group than the other groups. These findings indicate that the combination of a chemical method and a mechanical method with the ultrasonic endodontic <b>file</b> in the <b>gap</b> of root fractures is effective to enhance the sealability of the fractured gap while preventing over grinding. 垂直歯根破折に対する保存治療の基本は，破折間隙を接着し，封鎖することである．超音波エンドファイルを用い，根管内から破折線を切削すると，破折間隙の封鎖性は向上するが，過剰切削や切削不足が生じることが課題である．一方，化学的な根管壁の溶解によって，機械的拡大が困難な部位の根管拡大が可能であるので，本研究では破折間隙の切削と化学的拡大を併用することで，接着後の封鎖性が向上するかを検討した． 　実験１．ヒト抜去歯から厚さ１mmの象牙質片を作製して破折，復位固定した．破折間隙に対して，処理群は 10 ％クエン酸/ ３％塩化第二鉄溶液（ 10 -３溶液）５分， 10 ％次亜塩素酸ナトリウム溶液（NC）２分の処理を１回あるいは３回行った．未処理群では破折間隙の処理は行わなかった．３群ともスーパーボンドで破折間隙を接着し，色素侵入試験を行うとともに破折間隙幅を計測した．その結果，間隙幅は３回処理群が他の２群より有意に広く（p＜ 0. 05 ），色素侵入率は３回処理群が他の２群より有意に小さかった（p＜ 0. 05 ）． 　実験２．ヒト抜去歯を垂直破折させて復位固定し，破折間隙に対して以下の処置を行った．①未処理群：処理なし．②形成群：ソルフィーZXのオートストップ値を 1. 0 に設定して超音波エンドファイルで破折間隙を切削．③化学的拡大群： 10 -３溶液５分，NC 2 分の処理を３回．④併用群：②の後に③の処理．４群ともスーパーボンドで破折間隙を接着後，色素侵入試験を行った．その結果，併用群においては歯根表面に切削が達している試料はなく，その色素侵入率は他の３群と比較して有意に小さかった（p＜ 0. 05 ）． 　以上の結果から，超音波エンドファイルによる破折間隙の切削と化学的な拡大を併用することは，過剰な切削を防止して封鎖性を向上するのに有効である...|$|R

Thesis, English Department, Tarbiyah faculty. Advisor: (1) Dr. Anang Syaifuddin, MA (2) Drs. Saadillah, M. Pd Music {{is a great}} {{language}} package that bundles culture, vocabulary, listening, grammar {{and a host of}} other language skill in just a few rhymes. Music can also provide a relaxing lesson on a hot boring day. Every one believes that teaching-learning with fun and enjoyable approach has to be applied because it can help students to understand the materials easily, especially in teaching learning English. One of the schools that uses a song/music as a media and method in teaching learning is MAN 3 Banjarmasin. Therefore it is interesting to research. Furthermore, there are three problems which will be analyzed; the first, how is the teacher using a song and what are the advantages at the second year at senior high school MAN 3 Banjarmasin 2009 / 2010 ?, the second, what steps are taken to teach grammar and vocabulary with English song and the third, how is the students’ respond to singing in teaching learning English?. The subjects of this research are an English teacher and students of second year at senior high school MAN 3 Banjarmasin. The number of subject is two classes. And the object of this research is the use of song as an approach in improving grammar and vocabulary in teaching English grammar of the second year students of MAN 3 Banjarmasin and the students’ respond through the song. To collect the data the writer used questionnaire, interview, observation and documentary. After completing the data, it will be divided into four stages namely editing, coding, tabulating, and interpretation. Then, to analyze the data, the writer used qualitative descriptive. The result of the research shows that the English teacher of the second year at senior high school MAN 3 Banjarmasin used a song followed with predicting, <b>gap</b> <b>filing,</b> translation, singing method, and any other methods, such as drilling, cloze procedure or gap activity filling activity, reordering (sort return), puzzle, and closing method to teach grammar and vocabulary. All these activities are useful to improve their skill in grammar and vocabulary. Then, the students responded positively, felt spirited, enjoyable, and easier to understand the material. Most of the students like this method with music media very much as the classroom become alive and more interesting. Moreover, students become active in learning process, because the teacher involved all students in all activities. It made the students understand the materials better. Finally, it is no doubt that a song as an approach is one of the way which can help the teacher in teaching English grammar and vocabulary at the second year at senior high school MAN 3 Banjarmasin...|$|R
40|$|The COST Action C 25 “Sustainability of Constructions - Integrated Approach to Life-time Structural Engineering” is {{a network}} of {{scientists}} and researchers from 28 European countries and the EU Joint Research Centre in Ispra. It was established to promote science-based developments in sustainable construction in Europe through research on life-time structural engineering. The Action is in its fourth year of activity. The Action concentrates on R&D issues that are fundamental for sustainable construction processes and technologies. These include methods to assess environmental, social and economic impacts of construction activities; methods to analyse eco-efficiency of materials, components, buildings and infrastructures; methods to integrate research approaches from various disciplines; and methods of structural design that incorporate holistic understanding of safety, eco-efficiency and sustainability. The Action has organised three major events, an event every year, where the findings of joint efforts of the Members have been discussed and published: - 1 st Workshop in Lisbon, Portugal, on 13, 14 and 15 September 2007; - the Midterm Seminar in Dresden, Germany, on 6 - 7 October 2008; - International Workshop in Timisoara, Romania, on 23 - 24 October 2009. Some of the Action results were already applied through the dissemination of the life-time engineering approach to the sustainability issues in tasks carried out by C 25 members. However, a short investigation of university syllabuses, completed by an add-hoc C 25 group on educational issues, has shown cleariy {{the need for a}} new approach in teaching structural engineers on sustainability issues. One of the important aspects in <b>filing</b> this <b>gap</b> is the training of young research students. So far, two very successful Training Schools were organised: - The first Training School was “The LCA Training School” and was organised for 16 participants in Eindhoven, Netherlands, on 13 - 15 February 2008. The participants were mainly Early Stage Researchers from C 25 who could learn and deepen their knowledge on the use of Life Cycle Analysis theories and tools; - The second Training School “Sustainability in structures and structural interventions: Improving the contemporary and historical urban habitat constructions within a sustainability and risk assessment framework” was held in Thessaloniki, Greece, on 17 - 24 May 2009. It was jointly organised by C 25 and C 26 and the number of Early Stage Researchers was 40, from these two Actions. The third C 25 Training School, organised under the theme “Sustainable Construction: A Life Cycle Approach in Structural Engineering”, aims at providing C 25 and non-C 25 Early Stage Researchers and PhD students with theories, tools and assignments to address sustainability in engineering and the life-cycle approach in structural engineering. The Training School is hosted by the Department of Building and Civil Engineering, Faculty for the Built Environment of the University of Malta and offers excellent opportunities for collaboration among the researchers. The whole event consists of two complementally activities: The International Early Stage Researchers Symposium, from the 23 rd of July till the 25 th of July 2010; The International Training School, from the 26 th of July till the 1 st of August 2010. The programme and the scientific content of the Malta Training School were prepared with the support of an international group of experts and were approved by the Management Committee of the COST Action C 25. The group of experienced lecturers were selected to teach and supervise the group work during the school. The aim of the International Early Stage Researchers Symposium is to give the opportunity to the participants to present their own work and to get an overview of the research work that is being done by the other researchers all around Europe. The Symposium will be also an important forum for the discussion of new ideas in the field of Sustainable Construction and will bring together all those who are interested in collaborating on common projects. These Proceedings cover a wide range of up-to-date issues that reflect the research areas of the participating Early Stage Researchers in the Sustainable Construction field. The issues presented include: •Sustainable Building: design guidelines and assessment tools; •Eco-efficiency: eco-efficient use of natural resources in construction and processes; •Life-time Structural Engineering: life-cycle performance, design for durability, maintenance and deconstruction. This publication represents one more important milestone in the fulfilment of the main aims of the COST Action C 25. The organisers of the Training School hope that this initiative will promote further the sustainability of construction industry and of the built environment.
