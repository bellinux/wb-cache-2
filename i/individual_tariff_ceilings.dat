40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} trade agreements where "politics" play an central role. This stands {{in contrast with the}} standard theory, where even politically-motivated governments sign trade agreements only to deal with terms-of-trade externalities. We develop a model where governments may be motivated to sign a trade agreement both by the presence of standard terms-of-trade externalities and by the desire to commit vis-a-vis domestic industrial lobbies. The model is rich in implications. In particular, it predicts that trade agreements result in deeper trade liberalization when governments are more politically motivated (provided capital mobility is sufficiently high) and when capital can move more freely across sectors. Also, governments tend to prefer a commitment in the form of <b>tariff</b> <b>ceilings</b> rather than exact tariff levels. In a fully dynamic specification of the model, trade liberalization occurs in two stages: an immediate slashing of tariffs and a subsequent gradual reduction of tariffs. The immediate tariff cut {{is a reflection of the}} terms-of-trade motive for the agreement, while the domestic-commitment motive is reflected in the gradual phase of trade liberalization. Finally, the speed of trade liberalization is higher when capital is more mobile across sectors. ...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have an important}} stake in products which have relatively high post-Tokyo MFN tariff rates in developed market economy countries (DMECs). On the whole, their market share is greater in higher tariff imports and, consequently, reductions which cut high tariffs more than lower ones, e. g. by applying <b>tariff</b> <b>ceilings</b> or harmonization formulae, are {{in the interest of}} developing countries. They would benefit from such MFN reductions despite erosions in their existing preference margins. This is due to relatively narrower product coverage of GSP schemes and smaller preference margins in higher tariff imports - other than the schemes for the least developed countries. Therefore, complementing MFN reductions with broadening the product coverage of GSP schemes in high tariff items and deepening the preference margins in certain markets would significantly enhance the exports of developing countries. Tariff liberalization and improved GSP product coverage and margins in higher tariff items would do very little to developing countries, however, if NTMs were not relaxed to accommodate the potential gains from tariffs. The frequency and trade coverage of NTMs in DMECs affecting high tariff items are significantly greater compared to their overall imports. Furthermore, NTMs substantially discriminate imports from developing countries in high tariff products. Therefore, tariff liberalization schemes which are confined to products not currently covered by NTMs would not yield any noteworthy results for developing countries. This is to say that unless some action is taken in the field of NTMs, no significant expansion of trade can be expected through tariff reductions, not even in the high tariff items. Furthermore, if the relaxation of NTMs is only limited to the accommodation of potential trade expansion through tariff liberalization, even complete elimination of tariffs would only yield meager results. This overall picture is especially bleak for certain sectors, notably labour intensive manufactures such as textiles and clothing and miscellaneous manufactures. In some sectors, particularly in food products, the observations are diluted due to the extreme restrictiveness of some DMECs' trade regimes. Hence, the conclusion to draw is that the importance of liberalization of high tariff products for developing countries can be grossly understated as these evaluations are based on trade which is significantly curtailed by NTMs.  Published in connection with a visit at the IIES...|$|R
40|$|A {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} aggregate indexes of trade protection is weighting <b>individual</b> <b>tariffs</b> in ways that (a) reflect their importance and (b) are not endogenous to the protection being measured. The most obvious basis for weights is actual imports; but these may be highly endogenous. Various authors have worked to correct this endogeneity. For example, in the Bou�t et al. (2004) 'MAcMap' data set, weights are based on imports of reference groups of countries. But eliminating the endogeneity is difficult in product areas where protection is high and widespread. I develop a new set of estimates of overall protection in rich countries with respect to developing ones that eschews import weights as much as possible in favour of weights based on the value of exporter's total production. The results are generally higher than those of Bou�t et al. Product areas in which protection is high and widespread seem systematically de-emphasised when using MAcMap weights, especially in agriculture. I also estimate tariff equivalents of trade-distorting subsidies by country and commodity. Agricultural tariffs dominate subsidies in trade-distorting effect, and agricultural protection in turn dominates goods protection generally. Japan is most protective, largely because of rice tariffs near 900 per cent, followed by Norway and Switzerland. Because of their greater reliance on agriculture, the poorest countries face the highest barriers, despite tariff preferences.

Binding tariffs at the WTO reduces the scope for their discretionary use. But, countries have bound <b>tariffs</b> at <b>ceiling</b> levels often substantially above the level of applied tariffs. Therefore, whether the ceiling rate at which countries have committed at the WTO is sufficient to diminish trade policy volatility is an empirical question. Using a recently built database on applied tariffs covering over 100 countries for the period 1996 to 2009, we find evidence that countries do vary tariffs. Most importantly, we find evidence that applied tariffs of tariff lines that are bound {{are more likely to be}} decreased and less likely to be increased, and that this taming effect of the binding decreases with the level of the water (i. e. the gap between bound and applied tariff).

40|$|The eight GATT Rounds of {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} have been very successful in reducing customs duties. Over 47 years, the average duty on industrial products imposed by developed countries has impressively decreased from about 40 per cent ad valorem to 3. 9 per cent ad valorem. A survey of the Post-Uruguay Round <b>individual</b> <b>tariff</b> structures shows, however, that tariffs are still an important barrier in international trade. Most developing countries have either bound their tariffs at relatively high rates, the average of which ranges between 25 and 50 per cent ad valorem for industrial products, or they have bound {{only a limited number}} of items. Developed countries have bound all or most of their non-agricultural tariff lines; their customs duties, which are low on average, show however significant peaks on “sensitive” products such as textiles, clothing and leather goods,which are of particular export interest to developing countries. Least developed countries (LDCs) benefit from preferences by developed countries, though a preferential treatment is similarly accorded to some developing countries and to other developed countries under the provisions of regional trade agreements. Therefore, it is not surprising that an important part of the Doha Round Agenda is still devoted to tariff negotiations. However, as in general the relevance of tariffs as trade barriers has considerably lowered, the interest of the Doha Round negotiators is largely revolving around the elimination or reduction of non-tariff measures and domestic regulatory policies. In this domain, the negotiating efforts made since the Kennedy Round have indeed produced less visible results than those reached through the tariff liberalisation proces...|$|R
40|$|MBA 2012 ABSTRACT Sustainability and „green‟ {{issues are}} {{becoming}} {{an integral part}} of business and management. There is a conscious shift that needs to be embraced by the business and management sector. Sustainable energy generation falls into this field. Large gird connected renewable energy (RE) facilities form a subset of sustainability and the clean technology sector. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) cannot compete with traditional fossil fuel generated electricity and hence support policies are required to encourage and protect these IPPs. Different policy mechanisms have been deployed with varying degrees of success in predominately developed countries. Countries like Denmark, Spain and The UK, to mention a few, have developed RE sectors, where spill over affects have taken place. From a business perspective, {{it is important to understand}} what policies are available and what factors (drivers) play a key role. This study identifies five main RE policy mechanisms (Feed-In Tariffs (FITs); Tradable Green Certificates; Renewable Portfolio Standards; Bidding/Tendering and Fiscal) of which the FIT has experienced the most success in establishing a RE sector. In addition twenty four key drivers are extracted that feed into a policy design. Using the qualitative method of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping, the study relates the policies to the drivers to identify which drivers are most effective within a RE sector. Finally the study reviewed the current developments of RE in South Africa and questions whether the current competitive bidding system with a <b>tariff</b> <b>ceiling</b> („REBID”) policy is set to create a sustainable local RE sector. This study has been based on an extensive literature review and the findings have formed the model. Model validation has used both country specific case studies and expert input, resulting in a model that can be applied universally. Modelling concluded that FITs deployed in isolation of the twenty four drivers are no better than a no-policy stance. In addition the model has identified Big Players, The Non-RE Sector, Cost Competitiveness and Risk as the most influential drivers and when managed properly, can lead to a more successful RE sector. Finally, this study could not conclude with certainty that SA‟s current policy framework is indeed sustainable, however, if Energy and Capital Costs are monitored and managed, REBID with South African Renewable Initiative (SARi) have the potential to create a solid RE sector in SA...|$|R

East Asian FTA might make economic sense, giving trade and investment linkages in East Asia through the involvement in global manufacturing supply chains. However, the most protected sector in the region, the agriculture sector seems to be a burden of East Asian FTA. In this paper, the effect of trade liberalization on agriculture sector in East Asian region is analyzed by using GTAP model. The GTAP model is a multi-regional, computable general equilibrium model accompanied with the database of world economy. The experiment in this study is based on the results of the complete removal of ad valorem import tariffs and non-tariff barriers on all the commodities among East Asian economies, while each member retains its <b>individual</b> <b>tariffs</b> with non-members. This paper also analyzes the impact of trade liberalization policy on East Asian region for selected commodity groups—rice, fruits and vegetables, fish and fish products, oilseeds and sugar. Implementation of trade liberalization in East Asia is expected to lead to a structural change in regional food markets whereby food production would shift from highly protected regions to low-protected regions or non-protected regions. The results of the simulation experiments indicate that the impact on the agriculture sector in East Asian countries is so high. As agricultural products remain sensitive, detailed treatments on agricultural trade like prolonged timetable for liberalization are required for the establishment of East Asian FTA. Greater degree of flexibility should be allowed for a low cost transition process...|$|R
40|$|<b>Individual</b> {{services}} and <b>tariffs</b> existed {{briefly in the}} beginning of telecommunications history 150 years ago but faded away over time. Service provisioning evolved into the current supplier-centric situation which has many limitations and disadvantages. This thesis re-embraces the user-centric service provisioning and tariffing philosophy and applies it to current mobile communication services setting, which differs significantly in scale and scope from the historical practices. A design methodology and tool for the determination of individualized mobile {{services and}} tariffs is provided, and benefits to both the user and the supplier are evaluated. The design has three aspects. The first involves the construction of a conceptual framework consisting of the behavioral models of the user and the supplier (firm) and a game theoretical negotiation mechanism to determine <b>individual</b> services and <b>tariffs.</b> Second is the operationalization of the conceptual framework in a computational design with methods, computational models, negotiation algorithms, risk metrics and a prototype implementation. Third is the extension of the <b>individual</b> services and <b>tariffs</b> concept to a community setting via a proposed community business model. Two evaluations are performed. First, for the firm-based design, a user survey is conducted and computational cases, that address value-added mobile services and generic mobile service bundles, are developed. The numerical analyses show that the users always achieve gains in utility. The benefits to the supplier include adjustable risk-profit equilibrium points, increased network traffic and reduced churn. Second, two case studies on communities are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed business model of community-based individual service provisioning and tariffing can meet the demands of their members precisely and address both affordability and sustainability issues. Last, a specific engineering implementation and integration of the individualized service and tariff design tools into the existing infrastructure of the communication services suppliers is proposed.

40|$|Includes bibliographySummary Following {{a period}} of {{economic}} growth, political stability and poverty reduction spanning two decades (1960 - 1979), Costa Rica experienced {{at the beginning of}} the 1980 ´s the worst recession in its most recent history. In 1981 and 1982 gross domestic product (GDP) fell by - 2. 3 % and - 7. 3 %. Analysts pinpoint to short term economic factors and long run structural problems as the main causes of the recession. Short term economic factors comprise the end of the coffee price bonanza and the second oil shock. Long run structural factors are rooted in the economic imbalances generated by the adoption of import substitution strategies. In 1985 the authorities undertook a change of regime which mixed free market with state intervention policies. Free market policies aimed at getting the prices right" by liberalizing trade through tariff and traditional export tax reduction, and by eliminating trade barriers. State intervention policies were encapsulated into non-traditional export promotion schemes and a target real exchange rate tending to favour export performance. These government policies were justified on the grounds of compensating the anti-export bias that guided the commercial policy of Costa Rica during the import substitution era. The implementation process was very gradual and began with export promotion policies followed by reduction of import and export barriers. From 1986 to 1994 trade liberalization policies were followed on a systematic basis. The <b>tariff</b> <b>ceiling</b> was substantially reduced, and tariff dispersion as well as effective protection diminished. Taxes levied on non traditional exports disappeared, while taxes on traditional exports were significantly lowered. Finally, most non tariff barriers were eliminated as quantitative import restrictions were replaced with tariffs in compliance with the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. During 1995 - 1996, the country experienced temporary interruptions in its tariff reduction and trade liberalization commitments in part due to a recession caused by internal contractionary policies and external factors (i. e., "the Tequila effect"). In 1997 as GDP growth overcame its trough, the authorities continued their outward oriented efforts. The policy centered mostly on a national tariff reduction schedule that would comply with the Central American Common External Tariff. The country plans to reach this tariff schedule in the year 2000. While trade liberalization has eliminated import surcharges and lowered, to great extent, the weight of export taxes in fiscal revenue, the same cannot be said about import duties. Export taxes represented 23. 3 % of total revenue in 1983. By 1994 - 1998, they represented 2. 1 %. The reduction of fiscal dependence on export taxes has shielded the fiscal accounts from the volatility of primary commodity price fluctuation. Import duties have, however, increased their weight in fiscal revenue. They accounted for 5. 6 % of total revenue in 1983 and for 13. 2 % for 1994 - 1998. The greater dependency of fiscal equilibrium on import duties is due both an increase in the import tax base as a consequence of liberalization and perhaps to a shift in the propensity to import. If trade reform has allowed a better allocation of resources by liberalizing import prices, it has also placed a restriction on output growth by increasing the possibilities of a balance-of-payments constraint scenario. Export promotion policies materialized into tax exemption schemes such as the CAT (tax redemption certificates). CATs were equivalent to an income tax deduction and represented 1. 9 % of total expenditure in 1985 and 4. 2 % by 1994 - 1998. The government has stopped the issue of new CATs and their fiscal impact will vanish by the year 2000. This will certainly be a source a fiscal respite and a basis on which to further reduce import duties without compromising internal equilibrium. ...|$|R

The effect of verbal opposition is substantially larger than that of both opponent and proponent spending, which implies that either verbal opposition conveys more information or that the government is biased in favor of opponents. Under reasonable assumptions, we find government preferences to be biased in favor of opponents. ...|$|R
40|$|Article XXVI: The {{text of the}} GATT signed at Geneva on October 30, 1947 {{was drafted}} as any {{self-sufficient}} international agreement, therefore specifying the modalities of its (definitive) acceptance by the contracting parties and of its (definitive) entry into force, notwithstanding the contextual signature of the Protocol of Provisional Application and the pending coming into existence of the ITO Charter which would {{have the effect of}} replace it. Indeed, the provisions of Art. XXVI were not strictly limited to the subject of the acceptance, entry into force and registration, as the title might suggest. Art. XXVI: 1 also provided an assessment of the “date of this agreement [i. e. GATT]” which affected the implementation of other GATT provisions. Art. XXVI: 5 (c) introduced a procedure of accession to the GATT which was alternative to the general one provided in Art. XXXIII, allowing customs territories having gained full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations to accede through sponsorship by an existing contracting party previously responsible for the territory. Art. XXVI was amended several times, with the hidden or declared purpose of encouraging the Contracting Parties to abide definitively by the GATT. During the 1949 Third Session of the CONTRACTING PARTIES at Annecy a Protocol of Terms of Accession was adopted, containing standard terms envisaging a right of acceding governments that were not entitled to accept the General Agreement under Art. XXVI: 2, to accede definitely to the GATT at any time after its entry into force following a procedure similar to the one for acceptance contained in Art. XXVI. The Annecy Protocol served as a model for all subsequent accession protocols. In the 1954 - 1955 Review Session, the CONTRACTING PARTIES agreed on the validity of reservations accompanying an act of acceptance pursuant to Art. XXVI to the effect that Part II of the GATT will be applied to the fullest extent not inconsistent with existing domestic legislation (the “grandfather clause”). The Review Session also resulted in the deletion of the Ad Note Art. XXVI included in the Geneva 1947 text. These amendments did not suffice to convince the Contracting Parties to accept GATT definitely for their concerns, especially those regarding existing legislation, never weakened. Art. XXVI has been superseded by Art. XIV of the Treaty establishing the WTO as far as the subject of acceptance, entry into force and deposit of the agreement is concerned. The provisions of Art. XXVI: 1 and of Art. XXVI: 5 (c) were not continued, and thus do not have a correspondent in the WTO Treaty. On the whole, Art. XXVI has had a limited application. The only provision of this Art. which has had a considerable impact on the asset and functioning of the General Agreement has been para 5 (c). Since entering GATT under Art. XXVI: 5 (c) had produced the undesirable result of making it possible to become Contracting Party without having undertaken significant obligations (for example, if the sponsoring State had previously made limited tariff concessions), Art. XI of the WTO Agreement on original membership, in requiring that all original Members have schedules, was designed to remove this inconvenience, i. e. to ensure that all WTO Members have made tariff and other commitments, even if they had not done so in GATT. Article XXVII: Art. XXVII GATT is self-explanatory. According to this provision, a concession listed in the relevant schedule annexed to the GATT can be withdrawn {{in whole or in part}} if the government with which such concession was initially negotiated has not definitely become or has ceased to be a GATT Member. Art. XXVII has so far been invoked with moderate frequency only. From time to time this practice has been engendered by problems of state succession. Article XXVIII: The eight GATT Rounds of multilateral trade negotiations have been very successful in reducing customs duties. Over 47 years, the average duty on industrial products imposed by developed countries has impressively decreased from about 40 per cent ad valorem to 3. 9 per cent ad valorem. A survey of the Post-Uruguay Round <b>individual</b> <b>tariff</b> structures shows, however, that tariffs are still an important barrier in international trade. Most developing countries have either bound their tariffs at relatively high rates, the average of which ranges between 25 and 50 per cent ad valorem for industrial products, or they have bound only a limited number of items. Developed countries have bound all or most of their non-agricultural tariff lines; their customs duties, which are low on average, show however significant peaks on “sensitive” products such as textiles, clothing and leather goods,which are of particular export interest to developing countries. Least developed countries (LDCs) benefit from preferences by developed countries, though a preferential treatment is similarly accorded to some developing countries and to other developed countries under the provisions of regional trade agreements. Therefore, it is not surprising that an important part of the Doha Round Agenda is still devoted to tariff negotiations. However, as in general the relevance of tariffs as trade barriers has considerably lowered, the interest of the Doha Round negotiators is largely revolving around the elimination or reduction of non-tariff measures and domestic regulatory policies. In this domain, the negotiating efforts made since the Kennedy Round have indeed produced less visible results than those reached through the tariff liberalisation process.

40|$|The recent {{growth of}} {{regional}} integration agreements (customs unions and free-trade areas) {{has been accompanied}} by a mounting concern for the health of the multilateral trading system. Much of this concern stems from the generally accepted view that the current WTO rules do not provide an adequate set of disciplines on regional arrangements. The EU {{has been one of the}} main driving forces behind the recent growth of regionalism, but its interests are increasingly affected by regional arrangements formed between other countries. This paper argues that the lack of clear WTO disciplines on regional arrangements may have already had adverse consequences for the EU. Given that the EU has declared its support for a clarification of the rules, the paper tries to identify where its priorities should lie. It is argued that there should be two such priorities. The first should be to define more precisely what is meant by an "applicable" tariff. It has never been clear whether this refers to applied tariff rates or to bound ceilings. Because of this ambiguity, Mexico was able to raise applied <b>tariffs</b> (within bound <b>ceilings)</b> on imports from the EU and other third countries in response to the peso crisis, whilst lowering tariffs on her NAFTA partners. Secondly, the EU and other major WTO players need to address the problem of different rules of origin emerging from the proliferation of regional arrangements. world trade organisation...|$|R
