This lecture will focuss on three periods in time: the beginning, the middle {{and the end of the}} 20 th century, three different kind of makers: a large manufacturer, a small studio and an independent textile designer, three methods: machine woven jacquard interior fabrics, simple handwoven household textiles and exclusive samples handwoven on a 24 shafts computerised loom, and three types of markets: the export market, the local Belgian market and both.

It started in 1922 but the roots it 2 Ì† 7 s roots go back to the turn of the century. Today they specialise in plain and jacquard flat woven fabrics and plain and jacquard <b>double</b> <b>velvet.</b> Recently the factory moved and expanded and wanted to get rid of masses of old samples. The Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels received 40 boxes of them. An important gift, since the museum did not have a lot of 20 th century textiles in its collection. The fact the samples derive from a Flemish weaving manufacturer, makes it even more important for the museum...|$|E
