5|$|In 1927, Macaulay took 130 wickets at {{an average}} of 18.26. However, he {{suffered}} a foot injury in 1928, and took time to recover his best form. His wicket tally fell to 120 and <b>his</b> <b>average</b> climbed to 24.37. His total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and <b>his</b> <b>average</b> remained above 20. Hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930, Macaulay failed to take 100 wickets {{for the first time since}} his debut season; <b>his</b> <b>average</b> of 25.12 was the highest of his career. In these seasons, he was only selected for one representative match, a Test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket. At the same time, his batting faded. In 1927, Macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs {{at an average}} of 25.11. He improved his batting average in 1928, accumulating 517 runs at 25.85 with four more fifties. However, after 1928, he never averaged more than 16.26 with the bat and only scored two more fifties in his career, both in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Abdur-Rahim was sent, {{along with}} Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau, to the Portland Trail Blazers on February 9, 2004 in {{exchange}} for Rasheed Wallace and Wesley Person. His impact in the two seasons with the Trail Blazers was considerably less than in previous seasons. <b>His</b> <b>average</b> was 16.3ppg/7.5rpg and 16.8/7.3rpg for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 campaigns respectively. At {{the end of the}} 2004–05 season, Abdur-Rahim became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|After Ottawa {{lost the}} Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906, McGee retired at just 23years old. His {{retirement}} {{is attributed to}} his government position not allowing him to travel. He had briefly retired after his brother Jim's death in 1904. McGee retired after scoring 135 goals in only 45games (both league and challenge). Only Russell Bowie rivals <b>his</b> <b>average</b> of 3 goals per game.|$|E
25|$|Green came to bat 398 {{times with}} the Diamondbacks before being traded in , and while <b>his</b> batting <b>average</b> and OBP were near <b>his</b> career <b>averages,</b> <b>his</b> {{slugging}} percentage (.425) was the lowest it had been since he broke into the Majors.|$|R
25|$|Klusener is an all-round cricketer {{known for}} his {{powerful}} left hand batting and right arm swing bowling. <b>His</b> batting <b>averages</b> are particularly notable for the peculiar fact that <b>his</b> ODI <b>average</b> is considerably higher than <b>his</b> Test <b>average.</b> This is a fair reflection of his aggressive temperament in shorter matches.|$|R
50|$|For {{his sophomore}} season he {{increased}} <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> to 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds, adding a team-best 0.8 blocks in 20.7 minutes per game.|$|R
5|$|During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, {{except in}} the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which {{resulted}} in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although <b>his</b> <b>average</b> of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Hewett {{played in}} a trial match at Oxford without success. He did, however, play in four of Somerset's six {{first-class}} matches that summer. In his {{first game of the}} season for Somerset, in mid-July, Hewett scored his maiden half-century; he remained 50 not out in the second-innings of a five-wicket victory over Hampshire. He passed 50 for Somerset on two more occasions during 1885, and finished the season with 247 runs at a batting average of 35.28, one of seven seasons in which <b>his</b> <b>average</b> was in excess of 30.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff had {{performed}} strongly in his debut first-class season, ending with 27 wickets {{at an average}} of 23.66. He was the ninth-highest wicket-taker for the Australian summer and <b>his</b> <b>average</b> was superior to all eight bowlers who took more wickets. At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.|$|E
50|$|Tinsley played 73 {{games for}} the Pacers in 2002-03, {{starting}} 69 of them, and <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> dipped to 7.8 points and 7.5 assists per contest.|$|R

25|$|Reid {{played in}} 19 Tests and 25 One Day Internationals between 1979 and 1986. <b>His</b> Test <b>average</b> was 46.28 and {{included}} six Test centuries. <b>His</b> ODI <b>average</b> was 27.52.|$|R
5|$|Metacritic later {{noted that}} Ebert tended {{to give more}} lenient ratings than most critics. <b>His</b> <b>average</b> film rating was 71% if {{translated}} into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. 75% of his reviews were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues. Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews, he {{had a reputation for}} writing memorable ones for the films he really disliked, such as North.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos {{described}} himself as a quick player with a good sense of position who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite <b>his</b> <b>average</b> height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few seasons Gilbert was not as {{successful}} with the bat; in 1877 he failed to exceed 47 in any innings, he scored about half the number of runs that he had during the previous year, and <b>his</b> <b>average</b> dropped to 15.70. <b>His</b> <b>average</b> remained below 20 {{in four of the}} next five seasons and never passed 23. In six seasons, he scored only six fifties. On the other hand, he took 56 wickets in both 1877 and 1878, averaging under 17 with the ball. He achieved some notable performances as a bowler, including bowling unchanged throughout a game in partnership with W. G. Grace. But from 1879 he bowled less frequently, and never passed 23 wickets in a season again. Even so, Gilbert represented the Gentlemen against the Players twice in 1877, his final appearances in the fixture; in four games, he scored just 43 runs and took 16 wickets.|$|E
2500|$|The closest he got {{to having}} <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> [...] "the right way round" [...] for an all-rounder was in 1967, when he {{averaged}} 26.20 with the bat and 27.90 with the ball.|$|R
50|$|As a sophomore, Maxey {{continued}} to play as a center and improved <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> to 9.9 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. He was third on the team in scoring and had four double-doubles.|$|R
50|$|Gray {{signed on}} to the French team Chorale Roanne for the 2008/2009 season where <b>his</b> <b>averaging</b> 22ppg 11.2rpg 3.2blks. One year later, he signed on CB Murcia, to play in the LEB Oro, the Spanish second league.|$|R
5|$|Pierce's {{average of}} 5.62 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched during the 1950s {{was the highest}} by any pitcher with at least 1,000 innings in the decade, with <b>his</b> <b>average</b> of 7.96 hits per nine innings ranking third (behind Ford and Wynn) and his 3.06 ERA also ranking third (behind Ford and Spahn). His final strikeout total ranked 15th among all {{pitchers}} when he retired; of the 24 pitchers who had at least 1,750 strikeouts at that time, Bobo Newsom and Tony Mullane are the only others {{who have not been}} elected to the Hall.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia <b>his</b> <b>average</b> is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|An illness {{during the}} winter of 1913–14 took its toll on Kilner {{at the start of the}} 1914 season. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his {{uncertain}} form, his aggregate of runs and <b>his</b> <b>average</b> both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages. His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship.|$|E
50|$|For Dandenong at TAC Cup {{level in}} 2010 he played seven matches with <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> again all elite, {{recording}} 30 disposals, 10 handball receives and 12 groundball gets per match. His 13 contested possessions per match also ranked {{number one in}} the competition.|$|R
5000|$|Oleksiy [...] "Alex" [...] Len {{would be}} named a Player of The Week {{candidate}} for the Western Conference from February 29-March 6, 2016 due to <b>his</b> <b>averaging</b> 20 points, 14 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, and 10 free throw attempts per game during that streak.|$|R
50|$|Reed saw an {{increase}} in playing time <b>his</b> sophomore season <b>averaging</b> 20.7 minutes per game and also started two games. Reed also increased <b>his</b> scoring <b>average</b> to 6.5 points per game.|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, McCabe {{was called}} up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden {{first-class}} century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. McCabe made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting his technique and he played in all five Tests, although he continued to have problems converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. McCabe managed to maintain his position {{over the next two}} home seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make a century, and after 15 Tests, <b>his</b> <b>average</b> was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|Before {{returning}} {{to play for}} Somerset, Mitchell-Innes once again featured for the Gentlemen at Lord's, though in a low-scoring match, he was dismissed for less than 20 runs in each innings. In six matches for Somerset in July and August, Mitchell-Innes scored 499 runs, and <b>his</b> <b>average</b> of 55.44 was the county's best that season. He scored 182, his best score for Somerset, in a County Championship match against Worcestershire, and followed it up with another century in the next match, against Lancashire. In all, 1936 was statistically Mitchell-Innes' best season; he scored 1,438 runs {{at an average of}} 44.93.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1884–85, Peel was {{included}} in the team which toured Australia under the management of Alfred Shaw, Arthur Shrewsbury and James Lillywhite. English teams that toured Australia at this time were not composed exclusively of the best cricketers in England. The 1884–85 English team, like most earlier tours, contained only professional cricketers; less usually, the team contained nine players who, critics judged, would likely have been in a full-strength England side. Much of the cricket was overshadowed by off-field clashes with the Australian team that had toured England in 1884; the disputes mainly concerned each team's share of match receipts. Peel was required to bowl a large number of overs; in minor matches, mainly played against the odds (where the opposition teams included more players than the English team), he took 321 wickets at an average of less than five. In first-class matches, he was the leading wicket-taker with 35 wickets, but <b>his</b> <b>average</b> of 19.22 was relatively high.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a starter}} for Cleveland between [...] and , <b>his</b> batting <b>averages</b> were {{consistently}} low [...] - [...] <b>his</b> highest batting <b>average</b> during that span was [...]253, while his lowest was [...]227.|$|R
50|$|As a sophomore, McCollum {{increased}} <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> to 21.8 {{points and}} 7.8 rebounds per game. However, his shooting percentages and Lehigh's record slipped and McCollum was beaten out for conference {{player of the}} year honors by Bucknell's Mike Muscala. He was named first team All-Conference.|$|R
50|$|Wingard's 2014 season saw <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> go {{down from}} 21 {{disposals}} per game to 16 per game, however he {{still managed to}} kick 43 goals in total. He won the 2014 Mark of the Year in round 12 by jumping high above Sean Dempster.|$|R
5|$|In 1933, {{he scored}} 834 runs but <b>his</b> <b>average</b> fell to 21.94 {{and he never}} again {{averaged}} over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, {{he was unable to}} produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Team-mates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected he was drinking in the pavilion.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the {{heaviest}} workload, bowling nearly 200 overs {{more than any}} other squad member. He was the leading wicket-taker in all first-class matches with 102 wickets at 16.42, and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on a tour of England. <b>His</b> <b>average</b> was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are borne out in his economy rate and strike rate. He was more economical than Miller and Lindwall, who took wickets more frequently.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, {{injuries}} limited Wade to a career-low {{scoring average}} of 15.9 points per game, but he upped <b>his</b> <b>average</b> to 19.6 {{points a game}} during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split {{the first two games}} in Miami, the Spurs blew out the Heat in game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. In game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat defeated the Spurs 109-93. The Spurs would bounce back in game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Campbell managed just fives games, but {{showed signs}} of improvement, {{increasing}} <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> for marks, kicks and goals.

50|$|Robson's biggest tournament win so far {{was at the}} World Darts Trophy in Utrecht, Netherlands. He beat Mervyn King 6-4 in the 2005 final, {{averaging}} 91.5 {{for three}} darts, which was a fair way below <b>his</b> <b>averages</b> during <b>his</b> aforementioned performances in the 2004 World Championship.|$|R
