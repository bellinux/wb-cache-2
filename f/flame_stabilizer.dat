Levels of unburned hydrocarbons were below 0. 50 gram per kilogram of fuel for both combustors and thus there was no detectable difference in the two methods of fuel injection. The contraswirl <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> did not produce the level of mixing obtained with a flat plate circular <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> It did produce higher levels of oxides of nitrogen, which peaked at a fuel air ratio of 0. 037.

The combustor was 76 mm in diameter and tested at a constant Mach number. High inlet temperature combustion was simulated using preheat air and variation in pressure loss across the <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was accomplished by testing different swirler configurations.

It may be interpreted as the square root of flame position variance, and must be accurately described if the flow properties and heat release characteristics of a premixed flame are to be captured. In this work the transport equation for the flame brush thickness is presented and new modeling approaches to the unclosed production and dissipation terms are suggested. To validate and test these approaches, a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent level set propagation are performed. These simulations provide the data needed to set the constants in the RANS-type production and dissipation closure models. The resulting transport equation for the flame brush thickness accurately describes transient cases and thus offers an improved means of predicting flame properties in non-equilibrium regions, e. g., near burner nozzles or <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> 1...|$|R

Combustor operating parameters, including inlet-air temperature, reference velocity, and fuel-air ratio, were set to simulate conditions in a 30 : 1 pressure ratio engine. Combustor inlet total pressure was held constant at 6 atm due to the facility limit. Combustor performance and gaseous pollutant levels were strongly affected by the geometry and resulting total pressure loss of the four <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> designs investigated. The addition of shrouds to two designs produced an 18 to 22 % decrease in the combustion chamber pressure loss and thus resulted in doubling the exit temperature pattern factor and up to 42 % higher levels of oxides of nitrogen.

A "kicked" oscillator model is utilized for deriving the appropriate dynamical system. The moment of burning and the corresponding vortex location are dependent on the chamber geometry, velocity field, and characteristic chemical and hydrodynamic times.

This experiment is the first known stable combusting flow studied for this device, and the data show a much faster and much more uniform combustion process than for flat-plate mixers. Several potential benefits may be realized from this study in future combustors, including a reduction in NO_x emissions because of the more uniform temperature distribution. The experiment was done in Lewis' Planar Reacting Shear Layer facility, which was adapted to accept a lobed mixer {{in addition to the}} original planar tip. A graduate student at MIT provided the mixer design concept, and Lewis provided the engineering, operations, and research expertise. The experiment used hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures to react with vitiated hot air at 920 K. A flow speed of about 120 m/sec and a speed ratio of 0. 5 were used. Flow diagnostics consisted of traversing fine-wire thermocouples and pitot probes for flow mapping. Supplementary fluorescence images were taken with a charged coupled device (CCD) camera to show the location and temporal behavior of the reaction zone. The data showed that the lobed mixer consumed the reactants between 3 to 10 times faster than a corresponding planar shear layer. The figure shows the dramatic difference in the measured temperature distribution with and without the lobed mixer. The increased mixing rate was due to a larger interfacial area {{as well as to the}} secondary flow from the streamwise vortices off the tips of the lobes. In addition, the fluorescence images showed that the lobes acted as <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizers...</b>|$|R

In this paper,flow field characters of dual-cavity scramjet combustor were analyzed in details without and with combustion. The results show that, under the interaction of cavity flow and fuel injection, two sizes of vortexes were formed in the upstream cavity after combustion. The bigger vortex provides a stable flame and the smaller one protects the upstream cavity back wall from heat in a certain extent. Additionally, the unburned fuel was blew away to the downstream cavity for a further combustion as soon as it meets high-speed main stream, which is helpful to improve combustion efficiency and to make the scramjet combustor shorter. And the mass of kerosene drifted into cavities was determined by fuel-jet velocity, whichwould have an indirect effect on the combustion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Pressure pulsations, or thermoacoustic instabilities, as {{they are}} called in the {{research}} community, can cause extensive damage in gas turbine combustion chambers. To understand the phenomena related to thermoacoustics, a simple Rijke-type tube combustor was built and studied. Extensive experimental results, as well as theoretical analyses related to the Rijke tube are presented in this thesis. The results, attributable to both the analyses and the experiments, help explain all the phenomena affecting the acoustic pressure in the combustor. The conclusion is that there are three separate yet related physical processes affecting the acoustic pressure in the tube. The three mechanisms are as follows: a main thermoacoustic instability in accordance to the Rayleigh Criterion; a vibrating flame instability where the flame sheet exhibits mode shapes; and a pulsating flame instability driven by heat losses to the <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> All these instabilities affect the heat released to the gas in the combustor. The energy from the oscillating heat couples with the acoustics of the volume bounded by the tube structure.

40|$|The team of TIAX LLC, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, and Callidus Technologies, LLC {{conducted}} a six-year program {{to develop an}} ultra-low emission process heater burner and an advanced high efficiency heater design. This project addresses the critical need of process heater operators for reliable, economical emission reduction technologies to comply with stringent emission regulations, and for heater design alternatives that reduce process heater energy requirements without significant cost increase. The key project targets were NOx emissions of 10 ppm (@ 3 % O 2), and a heater thermal efficiency of 95 percent. The ultra low NOx burner was developed {{through a series of}} pilot-scale and field tests combined with computational fluid dynamic modeling to arrive at simultaneous low emissions and suitable flame shape and stability. Pilot scale tests were run at TIAX, at the 2 MMBtu/hr scale, and at Callidus at 8 MMBtu/hr. The full scale burner was installed on a 14 burner atmospheric pipestill furnace at an ExxonMobil refinery. A variety of burner configurations, gas tips and <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were tested to determine the lowest emissions with acceptable flame shape and stability. The resulting NOx emissions were 22 ppm on average. Starting in 2001, Callidus commercialized the original ultra low NOx burner and made subsequent design improvements in a series of commercial burners evolving from the original concept and/or development. Emissions in the field with the ultra low-NOx burner over a broad spectrum of heater applications have varied from 5 ppm to 30 ppm depending on heater geometry, heater service, fuel and firing capacity. To date, 1550 of the original burners, and 2500 of subsequent generation burners have been sold by Callidus. The advanced heater design was developed by parametric evaluations of a variety of furnace and combustion air preheater configurations and technologies for enhancing convective and radiative heat transfer. The design evolution relied heavily on computational fluid dynamic predictions of design alternatives. The final design features modular separate radiant cells, each with one and two-side fired vertical tubes. The convection section configuration is vertical tube banks enclosed in the radiant channels. Commercial modular plate air preheaters are used. The predicted performance for the integrated advanced heater and Callidus burner is 95 percent efficiency with 9 ppm NOx emissions firing natural gas, and 12 ppm firing refinery gas.

40|$|This study {{takes place}} on a medium sized gas process plant called {{reference}} plant. In this thesis several escalation scenarios, as well as gas dispersion, is evaluated through Kameleon KFX and Vessfire. It has previously been conducted similar escalation studies. However, a normal approach to conduct these studies is to use reference values of a uniform property for heat flux both global and peak, and will only record/evaluate if rupture occurs. In this thesis uses every scenario transient curves for leak flow in KFX to represent the leak (jet fire). From these results individual values for heat flux, both peak and global, is found and used in Vessfire as heat flux exposure on process segment, to evaluate escalation and effect of blowdown. The effect of use of insulation, increased blowdown flow to vent stack and increased wall thickness is also evaluated in this thesis. How a jet fire develops could in some cases be dependent on the geometry of the process site. This is a factor that could get lost when using standardized values for exposure by fire (ref NORSOK S- 001). The results indicates that pressurized pipes with the given properties for carbon steel and utilization as used in reference plant (pipes {{in the range of}} 2 and 3 inch of diameter) is expected to rupture, when exposed to heat flux over 300 kW/m 2 over a time period of 2 to 3 minutes. With the restriction value for flow in the blowdown system today and an increase in flow of 50 %, blowdown alone will not prevent rupture of smaller pipe diameters when exposed as described above. However an increase in depressurization flow and a sequential blowdown philosophy, combined with early activation time for initiation of blowdown is proven to minimize the risk of escalation from one process train to another. When a jet fire passes objects the heat flux could increase on the other side as a result of increased turbulence. When a jet fire is directed into larger objects, the location of hot spots (peak flux values) on pipes and nearby equipment will not vary significantly, with time and strength in the release for the chosen scenarios. The values for global and peak flux will actually in some cases be almost constant. Objects can work as <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> However, when the jet is unaffected by objects the hot spots could move over larger distances as the release flow decreases...|$|R

Retainer was a <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> used to stabilize the flame, improve mixing between air and fuel and affect the formation of emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2).

The research presented below {{intends to}} investigate the role of Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) fuel thickness on the spread rate of a downward spreading flame, the thermal radiation being emitted by the flame, the CO 2 species field, and to compare results for both microgravity and normal gravity. To simplify the complex problem of flame spread over solid fuels, {{the concept of the}} thermal regime is used to find a constant spread rate for a given fuel thickness. In the thermal regime the opposed flow velocity is high enough to neglect losses due to radiation from the flame but still small enough to not affect the flame through finite rate kinetics. The microgravity results were performed on the International Space Station in the Bass-II Microgravity Science Glove box. This 7. 62 cm square duct allows the variation of opposed flow velocity while holding pressure, oxygen and nitrogen constant during each run. The runs are recorded using a digital video camera for spread rate analysis and thermal radiation is read using a radiometer. For normal gravity, SDSU???s <b>Flame</b> <b>Stabilizer</b> was used to acquire the downward spread rate from video analysis and thermal radiation is read by a radiometer developed here at SDSU. All readings for normal gravity are at atmospheric conditions. The <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> allows the analysis of temperature, radiation and species field measurements by fixing the flame in space with a fixed coordinate system. By using motors controlled with a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control system algorithm to move the sample up {{at the same rate as}} the flame is spreading downward the flame can be frozen in space for these measurements. For pure downward spreading flame a stationary sample holder is used to determine the spread rate and thermal radiation emitted by a moving flame. With the use of a Matlab image analysis code, the videos are analyzed to obtain the spread rate for each fuel thickness for both microgravity and normal gravity. When compared, these results show good experimental agreement for spread rate and thermal radiation. These results, along with known thermodynamic properties and scaling analysis are used to refine the de Ris-Delichatsios formula for the thermal regime. With very few examples of the de Ris-Delichatsios formula being matched to experimental results it is hard to define where the thin regime ends and where the thick regime starts. The refined formula is applied to both the thin and thick regimes to show approximately where the transition lies between the two and compared to experimental results. This transition zone in both microgravity and normal gravity is of great interest for researchers trying to predict the behavior of flame spread both here on earth and in space aboard the International Space Station...|$|E

The (sub) monomolecular layers of Irganox 1010 are prepared by spin coating process.

The selection of suitable polymeric additives considers technical importance and applications such as <b>stabilizers,</b> <b>flame</b> retardants, lubricants, anti-nlock agents and antistatica. An electron bombardement with low energy leads to a destruction of organic surface structures. The destruction areas depends on the electron energy. The operation voltage influences the detection sensibility of molecular secondary ions. The value of the subsequent acceleration voltage is very important to the sensitive detection of heavy secondary ions. At a constant primary ion energy, the yield of secondary ions can be increased by increasing the primary ion mass and by increasing the number of atoms in the primary ion. In comparison to the efficiency of the primary ion species, the influence of the primary ion energy on the yield of secondary ions is relative low. The variation of primary ion parameters influence the efficiency by variation of the yield of secondary ions, primarily. The fragmentation being determined by experimental yield of secondary ion has the opposite behavior in comparison to the efficiency. In order to identify, quantify and localize additives, the author uses two libraries of spectra, an commercial one and a self-developed data base program. Both programs enable the computer-aided administration of substance specific spectral specimen which facilitates the determination of unknown substances. A freshly prepared polymer surface allows the quantitative determination of a medium concentration of additives by means of TOF-SIMS.

The strong interaction between the aerodynamics-combustion-acoustic oscillations (ACA), and under specific conditions the aerodynamics-combustion-structural vibrations (ACS), is studied by a careful selection of experiments and numerical simulations performed using commercially available computational models. It is shown predominantly that the convective time scales due to the aerodynamics at the <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and the time period related to acoustic propagation have {{to be of the}} same order in magnitude to be able to drive the system into LCO. The measurements indicated that the frequency spectrum of the oscillations of the LCO has a distinct peak close to the natural mode of the combustor along with higher order “harmonics” due to non-linear effects. Some non-harmonic higher order peaks are observed that are associated with the structural (liner) natural frequencies of vibration. A numerical simulation has been performed using the commercial code (ANSYS V 13. 0) that includes the effects of fluid-structure interaction by means of pressure load transfer on to the structure and vice-versa. The fluid domain is modeled using CFX and the structural domain is represented by ANSYS. The information is exchanged between the two domains dynamically at every time step computed.

This investigated the gaseous and particulate emissions using kerosene as a base fuel for comparison with several second generation biofuels, which covered a range of H/C and showed that emissions were correlated with the H/C. The third phase of the work was concerned with renewable or clean coal derived hydrogen combustion using a low NOx <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> for industrial power generation applications. For the industrial low NOx combustor work a radial swirler flame stabiliser was used. However, the high boiling point of B 100 made operation in a premixed vane passage fuel injection mode impossible as ignition could not be achieved. The pilot fuel injector in the centre was the only fuel injection location that B 100 would stabilise a flame, due to the central recirculation of burnt gases. A central 8 hole radially outward fuel injector was used as WME (B 100) would not operate with radial vane passage fuel injection that is conventionally used for low NOx radial swirlers with natural gas.

40|$|Colorless {{distributed}} combustion (CDC) {{has been}} demonstrated to provide ultra-low emission of NOx and CO, improved pattern factor and reduced combustion noise in high intensity gas turbine combustors. The key feature to achieve CDC is the controlled flow distribution, reduce ignition delay, and high speed injection of air and fuel jets and their controlled mixing to promote distributed reaction zone in the entire combustion volume without any <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> Large gas recirculation and high turbulent mixing rates are desirable to achieve distributed reactions thus avoiding hot spot zones in the flame. The high temperature air combustion (HiTAC) technology has been successfully demonstrated in industrial furnaces which inherently possess low heat release intensity. However, gas turbine combustors operate at high heat release intensity and this result in many challenges for combustor design, which include lower residence time, high flow velocity and difficulty to contain the flame within a given volume. The focus here is on colorless distributed combustion for stationary gas turbine applications. In {{the first part of}} investigation effect of fuel injection diameter and air injection diameter is investigated in detail to elucidate the effect fuel/air mixing and gas recirculation on characteristics of CDC at relatively lower heat release intensity of 5 Â MW/m 3 Â atm. Based on favorable conditions at lower heat release intensity the effect of confinement size (reduction in combustor volume at same heat load) is investigated to examine heat release intensity up to 40 Â MW/m 3 Â atm. Three confinement sizes with same length and different diameters resulting in heat release intensity of 20 Â MW/m 3 Â atm, 30 Â MW/m 3 Â atm and 40 Â MW/m 3 Â atm have been investigated. Both non-premixed and premixed modes were examined for the range of heat release intensities. The heat load for the combustor was 25 Â kW with methane fuel. The air and fuel injection temperature was at normal 300 Â K. The combustor was operated at 1 Â atm pressure. The results were evaluated for flow field, fuel/air mixing and gas recirculation from numerical simulations and global flame images, and emissions of NO, CO from experiments. It was observed that the larger air injection diameter resulted in significantly higher levels of NO and CO whereas increase in fuel injection diameter had minimal effect on the NO and resulted in small increase of CO emissions.

A large part of the work concerned the development and construction of a new detection system, one combining SAXS and WAXS and designed for flame measurements in particular. The detection system arrived at included a new SAXS detector, implemented together with an already existing WAXS detector, as well as specially designed software. The SAXS and WAXS detectors were characterized by several test measurements conducted at different beamlines at the synchrotron facility MAX-lab in Lund, Sweden. The SAXS/WAXS detection system was used initially at beamline D 611 at MAX-lab for studying the particle formation process from the gas phase to the condensed phase in a diffusion ethylene flame just below a metal plate that was inserted into the flames there. The metal plate served as a <b>flame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and as a cooling support for particles to condense on. A large number of particles smaller than 100 Å were found to be produced when the flame temperature was lowered. To study these nanoparticles at a higher level of resolution, use was made of another SAXS and WAXS detection system at beamline ID 02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), for conducting measurements close to the metal plate. This study enabled five main size groups of ≤ 8 Å, 15 – 30 Å, 30 – 100 Å, 100 – 200 Å, and fractal aggregates of 1000 – 2000 Å, to be identified. The concentrations for each of the size groups were determined quantitatively, the concentrations of particles below 50 Å in size being found to be very high {{at the end of the}} experiment. The new SAXS/WAXS detection system was also used at beamline ID 12 at the ESRF for measurements of the gas-phase nanoparticles in different ethylene-rich, both sooting and non-sooting, flames at lower heights above the burner. Here vertically polarized X-ray radiation was employed, this extending the region involved in the case of WAXS and providing a more direct comparison of the chemical codes involved in evaluating the chemical composition of small species in different flame regions. The fitting of theoretical curves to the experimental data showed high concentrations of particles 1 – 2 nm in size...|$|E
40|$|Gas turbine reheat thrust augmenters {{known as}} afterburners {{are used to}} provide {{additional}} thrust during emergencies, take oﬀ, combat, and in supersonic ﬂight of high-performance aircrafts. During the course of reheat development, the most persistent trouble has been the onset of high frequency combustion instability, also known as screech, invariably followed by rapid mechanical failure. The coupling of acoustic pressure upstream of the <b>ﬂame</b> <b>stabilizer</b> with in-phase heat-release downstream, results in combustion instability by which the amplitude at various resonant modes — longitudinal (buzz — low frequency), tangential or radial (screech — high frequency) – ampliﬁes leading to deterioration of the afterburner components. Various researchers in early 1950 s have performed extensive testing on straight jet afterburners, to identify screech frequencies. Theoretical and experimental work at test rig level {{has been reported in}} the case of buzz to validate the heat release combustion models. In this work, focus is given to study the high frequency tangential combustion instability by vibro-acoustic software and the tests are conducted on the scaled bypass ﬂow afterburner for conﬁrmation of predicted screech frequencies. The wave equation for the afterburner is solved taking the appropriate geometry of the afterburner and taking into account the factors aﬀecting the stability. Nozzle of the afterburner is taken into account by using the nozzle admittance condition derived for a choked nozzle. Screech liner admittance boundary condition is imposed and the eﬀect on acoustic attenuation is studied. A new combustion model has been proposed for obtaining the heat release rate response function to acoustic oscillations. Acoustic wave – ﬂame interactions involve unsteady kinetic, ﬂuid mechanic and acoustic processes over a large range of time scales. Three types of ﬂow disturbances exist such as : vortical, entropy, and acoustic. In a homogeneous, uniform ﬂow, these three disturbance modes propagate independently in the linear approximation. Unsteady heat release also generates entropy and vorticity disturbances. Since ﬂow is not accelerated in the region of uniform area duct, vortical and entropy disturbances are treated as in signiﬁcant, as these disturbances are convected out into atmosphere like an open-ended tube, but these are considered in deriving the nozzle admittance condition. Heat release ﬂuctuations that arise due to ﬂuctuating pressure and temperature are taken into consideration. The aim is to provide results on how ﬂames respond to pressure disturbances of diﬀerent amplitudes and characterised by diﬀerent length scales. The development of the theory is based on large activation energy asymptotics. One-dimensional conservation equations are used for obtaining the response function for the heat release rate assuming the laminar ﬂamelet model to be valid. The estimates are compared with the published data and deviations are discussed. The normalized acoustic pressure variation in the afterburner is predicted using the models discussed earlier to provide an indication of the resonant modes of the pressure oscillations and the ampliﬁcation and attenuation of oscillations caused by the various processes. Similar frequency spectrum is also obtained experimentally using a test rig for a range of inlet mean pressures and temperatures with combustion and core and bypass ﬂows simulated, for conﬁrmation of predicted results. Without the heat source only longitudinal acoustic modes are found to be excited in the afterburner test section. With heat release, three additional tangential modes are excited. By the use of eight probes in the circumferential cross section of afterburner it was possible to identify the tangential modes by their respective phase shift in the experiments. Comparison of normalized acoustic pressure and phase with and without the incorporation of perforate liner is made to study the eﬀectiveness of the screech liner in attenuating the amplitude of screech modes. By the analysis, conclusion is drawn about modes that get eﬀectively attenuated with the presence of perforate liner. Parametric study of screech liner porosity factor of 1. 5 % has not shown appreciable attenuation. Whereas with 2. 5 % porosity signiﬁcant attenuation is noticed, but with 4 % porosity, the gain is very minimal. Hence, the perforate screech liner with the porosity of 2. 5 % is ﬁnalized. From the rig runs, ﬁrst pure screech tangential mode and second screech coupled tangential modes are captured. The theoretical frequencies for ﬁrst and second tangential modes with their phases are comparable with experimental results. Though third tangential mode is predicted, it was not excited in the experiments. There was certain level of deviation in the prediction of these frequencies, when compared to the experimentally obtained values. For this test section of length to diameter ratio of 5, no radial modes are encountered both in the analysis and experiments in the frequency range of interest. In summary, an acoustic model has been developed for the afterburner combustor, taking into account the combustion response, the screech liner and the nozzle to study the acoustic instability of the afterburner. The model has been validated experimentally for screech frequencies using a model test rig and the results have given suﬃcient conﬁdence to apply the model for full scale afterburners as a predictive design tool...|$|E
