2500|$|Another {{theory that}} can be tested using cued recall is {{symmetry}} of <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall. <b>Forward</b> recall is generally assumed to be easier than <b>backward</b> recall, i.e. <b>forward</b> recall is stronger than backward recall. This is generally true for long sequences of word or letters such as the alphabet. In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall are hypothesized to be independent of each other. To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. George Wolford tested participants' <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall and found that <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall are independent of each other. The probability of correct forward recall was [...]47 for word pair associations and the probability of correct backward recall of word pair associations was [...]25. However, in another view, the associative symmetry hypothesis, the strengths of <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall are about equal and highly correlated. In S.E Asch from Swathmore College and S. M Ebenholtz's experiment, participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables by anticipation recall. After reaching a certain threshold of learning, the participants were tested by free recall to determine all pairs and single items they could remember. These researchers found that backward association was greatly weaker than forward association. However, when the availability of <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall were basically the same, there was little difference between <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall. Some scientists including Asch and Ebenholtz believe in the independent association hypothesis think that the equal strengths of <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall are compatible with their hypothesis because <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> recall could be independent but with equal strengths. However associative symmetry theorists interpreted the data to mean that the results fit their hypothesis.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{approach}} is proposed for retrieving the <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> wave impedances of lossless and lossy bianisotropic metamaterials.

It has been validated for both lossless and lossy bianisotropic metamaterials by performing a numerical analysis. The proposed approach can be applied for checking whether the metamaterial structure shows the bianisotropic property by monitoring <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> wave impedances, since the <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> wave impedances of a metamaterial structure depend on different polarizations of the incident wave.

Stride length and stride frequency values were determined during <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> treadmill run under each experimental condition (with a brace and without a brace). An ANOVA indicated no significant knee brace effect for either <b>forward</b> or <b>backward</b> treadmill running stride length or stride frequency. In the second phase of this study, ground reaction forces were determined for each experimental condition. The ground reaction peak forces under each experimental condition were not significantly different during either <b>forward</b> or <b>backward</b> running. Other statistical analysis of other dependent variables of <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> running indicated no significant bracing effect for ankle, knee and hip angular acceleration, angular displacement and angular velocity.

25|$|While in battle, {{characters}} {{status is}} displayed in special {{windows on the}} battle screen: their window shows their current health, their Blast gauge (an energy bar linked to special abilities), and Spirit Chain (SC) gauge, which fuels the ability to link characters and perform special attacks. A high level of SC points grants conditional boons to characters, such as dealing higher damage and faster recovery of SC. Characters {{have the option to}} side-step (dodge <b>forward,</b> <b>backward</b> or to the side), and precisely timed dodges can allow characters to stagger enemies and fill the SC gauge. The Blast gauge allows characters to trigger a blast of energy which knocks enemies back and heals injuries. The SC gauge allows for a maximum of four linked attacks, and any remaining points in the gauge can be used for later linked attacks. The order of activation for linked attacks cannot be changed. At the end of battles, if certain requirements are fulfilled, characters can learn skills called Battle Acts, abilities that grant the characters advantages in battle, such as being able to run around the field freely.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Nihon Falcom's Brandish was {{an early}} {{overhead}} action RPG to use mouse controls, where the player could move <b>forward,</b> <b>backward,</b> turn, strafe and attack by clicking on boxes surrounding the player character. The 1991 Dragon Slayer title Lord Monarch departed from the action RPG gameplay of its predecessors, instead using an early form of real-time strategy gameplay. The erotic adult RPG Dragon Knight III, released in 1991 for the PC-8801 and as Knights of Xentar for MS-DOS, introduced a unique pausable real-time battle system, where characters automatically attack based {{on a list of}} different AI scripts, though this meant the player had no control over the characters during battle other than to give commands for spells, item use, and AI routines. That same year, Arcus Odyssey by Wolf Team (now Namco Tales Studio) was an action RPG that featured an isometric perspective and co-operative multiplayer gameplay. The sequel to the first-person shooter role-playing game Star Cruiser, simply called Star Cruiser 2, was released in 1992, for the PC-9821 and FM Towns computers. T Soft released the PC-98 game Sword World PC in 1992 and a console version Sword World SFC for the Super Famicom in 1993. It was officially based on Sword World RPG, a popular Japanese table-top role-playing game. The video game versions were multiplayer titles and early attempts at recreating an open-ended, table-top role-playing experience on video game platforms, being set in the same world as Sword World and implementing the same rules and scenarios. Wolf Team's Dark Kingdom, released for the PC-98 in 1992 and ported to the SNES console in 1994, featured a unique storyline that revolved around the players conquering the world as a villain instead of saving the world.|$|E

The player's mission is to fly an attack helicopter from an offshore aircraft carrier and retrieve the captives by landing on a helipad on the island. This rescue mission stands out from the normal courses in that the player does more than maneuver a craft. As the player flies over the island, they must successfully dodge anti-aircraft fire from ground-based turrets, and, although the helicopter is able to fire missiles to destroy the artillery, a single hit to the craft causes the game to end.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} for functional asymmetries in <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> connections that define hierarchical architectures in the brain. We exploit the fact that modulatory or nonlinear influences of one neuronal system on another (i. e., effective connectivity) entail coupling between different frequencies. Functional asymmetry in <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> connections was addressed by comparing dynamic causal models of MEG responses induced by visual processing of normal and scrambled faces. We compared models with and without nonlinear (between-frequency) coupling in both <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> connections. Bayesian model comparison indicated that the best model had nonlinear <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> connections. Using the best model we then quantified frequency-specific causal influences mediating observed spectral responses. We found a striking asymmetry between <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> connections; in which high (gamma) frequencies in higher cortical areas suppressed low (alpha) frequencies in lower areas. This suppression was significantly greater than the homologous coupling in the forward connections. Furthermore, exactly the asymmetry was observed when we examined face-selective coupling (i. e., coupling under faces minus scrambled faces). These results highlight the importance of nonlinear coupling among brain regions and point to a functional asymmetry between <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> connections in the human brain {{that is consistent with}} anatomical and physiological evidence from animal studies. This asymmetry is also consistent with functional architectures implied by theories of perceptual inference in the brain, based on hierarchical generative models...|$|R
