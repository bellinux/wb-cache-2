40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. <b>Export</b> <b>processing</b> zones (EPZs) are policy {{instruments}} that {{are aimed at}} achieving the goal of economic development through boosting the manufacturing industry {{in a bid to}} increase and promote export. This is achieved by setting up or designating various areas or warehouses as <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> in which an environment that is friendly to manufacturing for exports, is established. Incentives such as tax exemptions for the import of required raw materials are given in these zones. EPZs are also known by other names but the most commonly used are <b>free</b> trade <b>zones,</b> industrial <b>free</b> <b>zones,</b> maquiladoras, <b>export</b> <b>free</b> <b>zones,</b> duty-free <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> <b>zones,</b> <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and privileged zones, to mention a few. Similar to many other developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Zambia has a bias towards export orientation as a tool of economic development. This culminated in the formulation of EPZ legislation in 2001. The EPZ act was similar to EPZ legislation in various other countries and provided for the development of an industrial park in which manufacturing for export purposes would take place for both the public and the private sector. After awarding a few companies EPZ status, the government abandoned the act and embarked on more research, resulting {{in the development of the}} multi-facility economic zone (MFEZ) in 2007. Recognition of the role of non-traditional exports (NTEs) in increasing export earnings has been important in the justification for EPZ’s development in the country. There has been a drive to attract investment into this sector by means of export-promoting policies. However, and notwithstanding the fact that numerous cost benefit studies have been undertaken to determine actual benefits of zone erection, Zambia has not yet undertaken a comprehensive synopsis of the country’s specific policies which would need to be established in order for the zone to be successful...|$|R
40|$|A Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a {{geographical}} region that has economic {{laws that are}} more liberal than a country's typical economic laws. The category 'SEZ' covers {{a broad range of}} more specific <b>zone</b> types, including <b>Free</b> Trade <b>Zones</b> (FTZ), <b>Export</b> <b>processing</b> <b>zones</b> (EPZ), <b>Free</b> <b>Zones</b> (FZ), Industrial Estates (IE), Free ports, Urban Enterprise Zones and others. Usually the goal of a structure is to increase foreign direct investment by foreign investors; typically an international business or a Multi National Corporation (MNC). The total physical exports from SEZs in India as on 31 st December, 2012 i. e. in the first three quarters of the current financial year, has been to the tune of Rs. 3, 53, 195 crore approximately registering a growth of 35. 34 % over the exports of corresponding period of the previous financial year.

30|$|Understanding {{what the}} term free port covers {{is the first}} step to {{approach}} the structure of free ports. The Atlas of the <b>Free</b> <b>Zones</b> in the World (Bost, 2010), compiled more than forty-five different names that have been used related to the concept of <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> According to the author, these terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes they are simply marketing terms from the promoters of a zone. Therefore, there is confusion about both definitions and concepts. From this taxonomy, it is considered that <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> is a concept that can be divided into two categories: <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> zones that are manufacturing-oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and <b>free</b> trade <b>zones</b> that are trade-oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> The World Bank (2008; Farole, 2011) has the same dual approach by using the term special economic zone while referring to a <b>free</b> <b>zone.</b> This term makes sense if the status of such zones is considered although it creates confusion because there is a specific Chinese model of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> named Special Economic Zones and this model covers only a part of the concept. Free port, however, is the long-standing terminology of such zones and refers to the logistic function of the concept (Lavissière et al., 2014). It is argued that the term free port is a transversal concept of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and a <b>free</b> port can either be an <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> <b>zone</b> or a <b>free</b> trade <b>zone.</b> It is therefore the term that has been retained.|$|R

Our main findings are that an increase in foreign capital investment leaves social welfare intact and reduces unemployment if foreign capital is specific to foreign firms, and it may increase social welfare and reduce unemployment if foreign capital is also used in the domestic manufacturing sector.

In the United States, FTZs provide Customs-related advantages as well as exemptions from state and local inventory taxes. In other countries, they have been called [...] "duty <b>free</b> <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> zones," [...] "export free zones," [...] "export processing zones," [...] "free export zones," [...] "free zones," [...] "industrial free zones," [...] "investment promotion zones," [...] "maquiladoras," [...] and [...] "special economic zones." [...] Some were previously called [...] "free ports". <b>Free</b> <b>zones</b> range from specific-purpose manufacturing facilities to areas where legal systems and economic regulation vary from the normal provisions of the country concerned. <b>Free</b> <b>zones</b> may reduce taxes, customs duties, and regulatory requirements for registration of business. Zones around the world often provide special exemptions from normal immigration procedures and foreign investment restrictions as well as other features. <b>Free</b> <b>zones</b> are intended to foster economic activity and employment that could occur elsewhere.|$|R
3000|$|In addition, it {{is crucial}} to avoid {{confusion}} on what a free port is. Free ports are different from <b>free</b> trade <b>zones,</b> special economic zones and <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> zones, because they are logistic oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> whatever their <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> status or name. Free ports are also different from the concepts of sea ports and port terminal; they are special logistics zones next to ports. The definition of free port from Lavissière et al. (2014) was retained. It states that ‘A free port is an international logistic interface that is free from border frictions and designed to bring more value in the global supply chains of its operators. This definition states that the free port is not the port, but the logistics facility ‘often next to a sea port but also next to or within an airport, a river port, or a dry port.’ [...]...|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} with <b>free</b> trade <b>zones</b> or <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> zones now exempt from corporate income taxation {{the income of}} firms exporting from these areas. The WTO has attempted to eliminate this exemption through its rules to promote the non-discrimination of fiscal systems with respect to export production. In particular, these rules do not allow countries to exempt the income of firms exporting from <b>Free</b> Trade <b>Zones</b> from corporate income taxation. This paper examines both theoretically as well as empirically the incidence of removing this corporate income tax exemption. The empirical analysis is carried out for {{the case of the}} Dominican Republic.

30|$|It is {{a common}} {{knowledge}} that landscape fragmentation is a direct outcome of land use and land cover change. This process affects landscape functions, services and sustainability when the quality of landscape services diminishes. In highlighting the implications of fragmentation, Alberti (2008) notes that converting natural landscapes into urban land use affects hydrological system, nutrient cycles, energy flow, and species composition. However, such threats are not restricted to natural landscapes; cultural landscapes with their outstanding aesthetic, social, economic, heritage and ecological values are also at risk (Vos and Meekes 1999; Wrbka et al. 2004). More pressures on landscapes are anticipated in the developing countries which presently experience {{the highest rate of}} population growth and urbanisation, and seemingly, the trend is expected to continue in the future (Wu 2008). In the case of Asia, {{it is not only the}} most populous continent in the world but it also has the highest concentration of medium and large cities (United Nations, 2012). Since the 1980 s, the Asian city-regions have been identified with proliferation of special economic zones (SEZs) of different sizes and economic development targets (Farole and Akinci 2011). The SEZs are mostly private- and foreign investment-driven geographic expressions such as <b>export</b> <b>processing</b> <b>zones</b> (EPZs), <b>free</b> trade <b>zones</b> (FTZs), economic cities and technology and industrial parks. The proliferation of the SEZs in Asia largely follows policies and aspirations of various countries to attract foreign investments to induce national growth and development (Wan et al. 2014). Thus, SEZs constitute a new layer of urban and peri-urban spatial systems that could have significant spatial, ecological, and socio-economic implications. Invariably, one cannot simply ignore the socio-ecological and spatial implications of the SEZs.|$|R
