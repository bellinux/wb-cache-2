5|$|Downey {{was able}} to return to the big screen only after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's {{insurance}} bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective. Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40 percent of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then. Silver, who was <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin, also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

5|$|For further {{elements}} up to 124, {{given that}} increasing the neutron number allows for <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 that would confer stability, {{the use of}} weakly radioactive iron-60 instead of stable iron-58 as a projectile has been considered. 60Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years. The isotopes 299Ubu, 300Ubu, and 301Ubu that could be produced in these reactions via the 3n and 4n channels {{are expected to be}} the only reachable unbiunium isotopes with half-lives long enough for detection; the cross-sections would nevertheless push the limits of what can currently be detected. They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which will be tried at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of tennessine and moscovium synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. The multiplicity of excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc. Heavier isotopes are expected to be more stable; 320Ubu is predicted to be the most stable unbiunium isotope, but {{there is no way to}} synthesise it with current technology as no combination of usable target and projectile could provide enough neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> completion, Capcom started making more substantial {{changes in the}} game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E

25|$|Bishara Khader {{argues that}} this ambitious European project towards its Mediterranean {{neighbours}} {{has to be}} understood {{in a context of}} optimism.

On the other, the Arab–Israeli conflict appeared to be <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> achieving peace after the Madrid Conference (1991) and the Oslo Accords (1992). As well, Khader states that the Gulf War of 1991, the Algerian crisis (from 1992 onwards) and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Arab world are also important factors in Europe's new relations with the Mediterranean countries based on security concerns.|$|E

25|$|North of Nunda, NY408 roughly {{parallels}} {{the eastern edge}} of Letchworth State Park, gradually <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the park as it proceeds onward. Eventually, the route connects to the park at its northeast entrance, but subsequently curves to the northeast to enter the village of Mount Morris on Chapel Street. In the village's business district, NY408 joins the village's main street, NY36, for one wide block north to State Street. Here, NY408 breaks from NY36 and leaves Mount Morris in a more easterly direction. A slight descent starts a straight route across the low-lying wetlands next to the Genesee River, and I-390 is visible in the distance. There is almost no development on this portion due to the wetlands; however, there is a grade crossing with the Genesee and Wyoming Railroad subdivision of the Rochester and Southern Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in EOD waveforms and frequencies also imposes {{an influence}} on active space size. Using Sternopygus marucus as example, males and emit frequencies almost half those of females (80Hz cf. 150Hz). However, since most electroreceptors are tuned to signal frequencies that are closer to the receivers' own frequency, the difference in EOD frequency results in a different ability of electric fishes to sense signals from either sex, which further leads to different active space sizes. As measured in Sternopygus marucus by Hagedorn, male fish can only detect females {{in a range of}} 6 cm, while female fish can detect a male fish in a much bigger range of 39 cm. This active space size difference is hypothesized to give female fish a better probability of <b>getting</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> potential mates and select an individual to mate with.|$|E
