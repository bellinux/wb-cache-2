5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys. At the Ramones' request, Ed Stasium {{helped with the}} album's engineering. During the studio work, Spector's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget, with a relatively low production value. With <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Century,</b> the band experienced Spector's infamous perfectionism, and a budget of $200,000 to fully record and produce the album. This is significant because the band's debut album cost $6,400 total, and their second album cost $10,000. <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Century</b> {{is the most expensive}} album in the Ramones' career.|$|E

5|$|A {{police station}} was {{established}} at No.21 Great Marlborough Street in 1793.

5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians.

Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E

5|$|Brownsea Castle, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Branksea Castle, was originally a Device Fort constructed by Henry VIII between 1545 and 1547 to protect Poole Harbour in Dorset, England, {{from the threat}} of French attack. Located on Brownsea Island, it comprised a stone blockhouse with a hexagonal gun platform. It was garrisoned by the local town with six soldiers and armed with eight artillery pieces. The castle remained in use after the original invasion scare had passed and was occupied by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 1640s. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> however, it had fallen into disuse.|$|E

Today, Bangladeshis form the largest minority population in Tower Hamlets, constituting 33.5% of the borough's population at the 2001 census; the Bangladeshi community there is the largest such community in Britain. The 2006 estimates show a decline in this group to 29.8% of {{the population}}, reflecting a movement to better economic circumstances and the larger houses available in the eastern suburbs. In this, the latest group of migrants are following a pattern established for over three centuries.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact.

By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few tracts of wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E

5|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction {{had left a}} patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints.

In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work.
