5000|$|The {{terminal}} interface provided by Seventh Edition Unix and UNIX/32V, and also presented by BSD version 4 {{as the old}} terminal driver, was a simple one, largely geared towards teletypewriters as terminals.

A buffer was maintained by the kernel in which editing took place. Applications reading terminal input would receive {{the contents of the}} buffer only when the [...] key was pressed on the terminal to end line editing. The [...] key sent from the terminal to the system would erase ("kill") the entire current contents of the editing buffer, and would be normally displayed as an '@' symbol followed by a newline sequence to move the print position to a fresh blank line. The [...] key sent from the terminal to the system would <b>erase</b> the last <b>character</b> {{from the end of the}} editing buffer, and would be normally displayed as an '#' symbol, which users would have to recognize as denoting a [...] "rubout" [...] of the preceding character (teletypewriters not being physically capable of <b>erasing</b> <b>characters</b> once they have been printed on the paper).|$|R

40|$|In {{this essay}} {{we will take}} Roland Barthes’ {{definition}} of Myth {{as the starting point}} for the analysis of several classical and contemporary versions of the myth of Pygmalion. According to Barthes, myth is not eternal, it is transient and human history can subvert and deconstruct it. This is what happens with the contemporary versions of this myth. Opposed to the classical versions that insist on the gender construction, contemporary examples subvert the pygmalonian <b>character,</b> <b>erasing</b> him from the scene or the screen so that the oppressed characters become owners of their lives, articulated and empowered. En este estudio se tomará como punto de partida a Roland Barthes y su definición de mito en el análisis de versiones clásicas y contemporáneas del mito de Pigmalión. Para Barthes, un mito no es eterno, sino transitorio ya que el curso de la historia de los pueblos puede subvertirlo y deconstruirlo. Así ocurre en las representaciones contemporáneas de Pigmalión. Al contrario de las versiones clásicas, que perpetúan la construcción de género, las obras más contemporáneas subvierten al personaje pigmalioniano, le restan importancia hasta hacerlo casi desaparecer, y son los personajes, en principio, subordinados quienes se forjan su educación hasta conseguir su articulación personal...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{information}} technology {{is set to}} transform critical network security using quantum cryptography, and complex scientific and engineering simulations with quantum computing. Quantum computer nodes may {{be based on a}} variety of systems, such as linear optics, ions, or solid state architectures such as NV-centers in diamond, semiconductor quantum dots or spins in silicon. Interfacing any of these platforms with photonic qubits in secure quantum networks will require quantum teleportation protocols to transfer the information, and matter-light teleportation has for some of these systems been demonstrated. However, although it is conceivable that the input photon originates from a dissimilar source to that supplying the entangled resources, every demonstration so far of teleportation using linear optics use the same or identical sources for the input and entangled photons, often accompanied by a fourth heralding photon. Here we show that photons from fundamentally different sources can be used in the optical quantum teleportation protocol. Input photons are generated by a laser, and teleported using polarisation-entangled photon pairs electrically generated by an entangled-light-emitting diode (ELED). The sources have bandwidth differing by a factor 1000, different photon statistics and need not be precisely degenerate- but we still observe a teleportation fidelity of 0. 77, beating the quantum limit by 10 standard deviations. This is a significant leap towards practical applications, such as extending the range of existing QKD systems using quantum relays and repeaters, which usually use weak coherent laser pulses for quantum information transport. The use of an ELED offers practical advantages of electrical control, and as we show <b>erases</b> the multi-photon <b>character</b> of the laser input field, thus eliminating errors if used in a quantum optics circuit.

40|$|As Child in Time’ {{stands at}} the {{intersection}} of literary-historical studies of the 19 th century U. S., political theory, and childhood studies. Limning the child’s contested position in cultural imaginings of democracy—at once embodying its ideals and marking its limits—I describe how the child offers a site upon which to demythologize U. S. democracy, yet also offers a vehicle that can meaningfully engage some of the irresolvable tensions fundamental to democratic thought. In particular, this project focuses on the child’s role in conceptualizing what we might call dilemmas of democratic time. Chapter One examines how Catharine Maria Sedgwick’s The Linwoods stages the anxieties elicited by the desire to perceive democracy as guided by timeless truths, while also recognizing that the democratic process necessarily entails the negotiation of ephemeral opinions, in order to draw out the novel’s self-conscious engagements with democracy at a theoretical level. Chapter Two examines Ralph Waldo Emerson’s abolitionist thought, following the figure of the child into an exploration of the relationship between transformative political acts and the quality that Emerson calls “newness,” revealing how the child reinvigorates questions about the political value of his transcendentalism. Chapter Three illuminates how Herman Melville’s Israel Potter uses the title <b>character’s</b> <b>erased</b> youth and foreclosed future to deconstruct exceptionalist narratives emblematized by the rhetoric of the Young America movement, while also locating democratic potentiality in humble moments of the unwritten now. Chapter Four considers how Frederick Douglass’s insistence that the time for politics is “the ever-living now” inflects his representation of childhood. Where children in abolitionist literature are typically read as rhetorical devices for higher law ideals, this chapter argues that Douglass’s writing resists the displacement of anti-slavery claims from the subjectivities that speak them and from the historical moment in which they are spoken, instead submitting these claims to the actionable now. The Coda reflects upon our critical moment and the status of “the child” in contemporary political dialogue, suggesting how the exchange between literary study, political theory, and the study of the child might supplement dominant modes of ideological critique with a form of critical “hopefulness. ...|$|R

The landscape architect acts as a reader and as a writer of stories that other actors play, with the task grasping the Genius loci, discovering the exceptional, but also describing the common. The contemporary history of Manarola, one of the 5 Terre, is to be told: it presents the risk of a rise of an economy based only on tourism and the need to preserve the historic landscape made up of dry stone walls, the majority being abandoned, that without the revenue of the tourism can not survive. The people of Manarola have a strong sense of collective identity and after the flood in 2011 spontaneously formed a foundation, imposing a minimum cost of registration, with the aim of defending the local landscape through constructive interaction between agriculture, nature and tourism. The Foundation now has over 200 members, the project area is about 10 hectares, of which the majority is at the west side called the '"amphitheater", with over 55. 000 square meters of dry stone walls to safeguard. The aims of the Foundation are to redevelop the historic layered landscape, declared a World Heritage Site because it is testimony to the ancient relationship between man and landscape, {{but at the same time}} to generate innovative processes that allow this cultural landscape to adapt to the contemporary, without <b>erasing</b> the original <b>character</b> of the place. Among the traditional measures promoted by the Foundation include: - the census of cultivated and abandoned land, - the drafting of a reference map, - the reconstruction of the millennial uneven stone walls, - the cleaning of streams and historic trails. There are also innovative initiatives including the organization of courses on the implementation of the traditional walls for terraces and drafting 30 -year agreements between landowners, members of the Foundation and farmers, who in exchange for the land being landscaped, profit from the cultivation of vines and olive trees, which have always been present, the production of wine and oil for small local wineries and for the sale of a quality product locally produced, improving the attraction for tourists. This type of activity is an innovation because it is a project of private initiative. Similar actions have also existed for a long time abroad, for example in France.
