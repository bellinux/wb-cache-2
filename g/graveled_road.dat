25|$|From northwestern Chesterfield County, coal {{from the}} Midlothian area 13 miles west was {{transported to the}} docks at Manchester, first on the Manchester Turnpike, a toll road and Virginia's first <b>graveled</b> <b>road</b> of any length {{completed}} in 1807. Later, beginning in 1831, the congested turnpike was supplemented by the gravity and mule-powered Chesterfield Railroad, the first railroad in Virginia, partially engineered and funded by the Virginia Board of Public Works. For its final several miles, the line followed present-day Maury Street, which was the southern border of Manchester for many years. It crossed over the steam-powered Richmond and Petersburg Railroad (later Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) tracks (now abandoned) on a high trestle between what is now Clopton Street and Jefferson Davis Highway. When the new Richmond and Danville Railroad (R) was completed between Manchester and Coalfield Station (now Midlothian) in 1851, the older Chesterfield Railroad was unable to compete and portions were acquired by the R, with the remainder dismantled before the Civil War took place.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the State Route 140 {{alignment}} can {{be traced}} to the early years of Nevada's state highway system. A road roughly following about [...] of the southern end of the current alignment was in place by 1919. However, instead of entering Oregon en route to Adel, the road veered westward through Washoe County towards Vya and Cedarville, California. By 1929, this alignment had been established as State Route 8A. The highway remained mostly unimproved for many years after designation by the state. The portion of highway from US 95 to Denio became a gravel road by 1940 and was not fully paved until 1953. The route was realigned near Denio Junction by 1949 (eliminating backtracking through Denio) and the portion between Denio and the California state line had been improved to a fully <b>graveled</b> <b>road</b> by 1952.|$|E

Were any other members of your family involved in baseball as much as your grandfather? How were they involved? Did your grandfather ever tell any interesting stories of famous players that played for the Eau Claire Bears? And {{what were some of the}} best stories he ever told you? Did your grandfather ever mention any controversies on the signing of black players to the Eau Claire Bears? Do you know how your grandfather reacted to the folding of the Northern League? Some of the responses that Mr. White had included were the conditions of travel during the prime years of the Northern League. He had spoken about how the Eau Claire team had traveled in hearses that were remodeled for the baseball team to use to travel throughout the North. Those travels had included as well constant repair of the vehicles, especially changing flat tires due to the travel on poorly <b>graveled</b> <b>roads</b> that were common during that time. Another aspect that Mr. White had focused on was of how baseball has always been an essential aspect of Eau Claire. This is because he strongly believes that baseball has always been a pasttime that families could enjoy together, from being part of the team to watching a baseball game underneath the lights at Carson Park Stadium. At this point, he does talk about some of the feelings he does have about the University not having a baseball team...|$|R
