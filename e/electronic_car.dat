50|$|Typical bicycle speedometers {{measure the}} time between each wheel revolution, and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display. The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is {{analogous}} to an <b>electronic</b> <b>car</b> speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution - typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2-3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (2.07m circumference, without tire) wheel. However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference {{in order to make}} distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge. However these devices carry some minor disadvantage in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (AND sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal being carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.|$|E

40|$|Selective 2 -photon {{excitation}} (TPE) of carotenoid dark states, Car S 1, {{shows that}} in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII), the extent of electronic interactions between carotenoid dark states (Car S 1) and chlorophyll (Chl) states, φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl, correlates linearly with chlorophyll fluorescence quenching under different experimental conditions. Simultaneously, a linear correlation between both Chl fluorescence quenching and φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl with the intensity of red-shifted bands in the Chl Qy and carotenoid absorption was also observed. These results suggest quenching excitonic Car S 1 −Chl states as origin for the observed effects. Furthermore, real time measurements of the light-dependent down- and up-regulation of the photosynthetic activity and φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl in wild-type and mutant (npq 1, npq 2, npq 4, lut 2 and WT+PsbS) Arabidopsis thaliana plants reveal that also in vivo the quenching parameter NPQ correlates always linearly with the extent of <b>electronic</b> <b>Car</b> S 1 –Chl interactions in any adaptation status. Our in vivo measurements with Arabidopsis variants show that during high light illumination, φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl depends {{on the presence of}} PsbS and zeaxanthin (Zea) in an almost identical way as NPQ. In summary, these results provide clear evidence for a very close link between <b>electronic</b> <b>Car</b> S 1 –Chl interactions and the regulation of photosynthesis. These findings support a photophysical mechanism in which short-living, low excitonic carotenoid–chlorophyll states serve as traps and dissipation valves for excess excitation energy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} combining “off-the-shelf ” SAT and constraint solvers for building an efficient Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver {{for a wide range}} of theories. Our method follows the abstraction/refinement approach to simplify the implementation of custom SMT solvers. The expected performance penalty by not using an interweaved combination of SAT and theory solvers is reduced by generalising a Boolean solution of an SMT problem first via assigning don’t care to as many variables as possible. We then use the generalised solution to determine a thereby smaller constraint set to be handed over to the constraint solver for a background theory. We show that for many benchmarks and real-world problems, this optimisation results in considerably smaller and less complex constraint problems. The presented approach is particularly useful for assembling a practically viable SMT solver quickly, when neither a suitable SMT solver nor a corresponding incremental theory solver is available. We have implemented our approach in the ABSOLVER framework and applied the resulting solver successfully to an industrial case-study: The verification problems arising in verifying an <b>electronic</b> <b>car</b> steering control system impose non-linear arithmetic constraints, which do not fall into the domain of any other available solver. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{aggregation}} of isolated light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) in solution results in high fluorescence quenching, reduced chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime, and increased electronic coupling of carotenoid (Car) S- 1 and chlorophyll (Chl) Q(y) states, as determined by two-photon studies. It {{has been suggested that}} this behavior of aggregated LHCII mimics aspects of non-photochemical quenching processes of higher plants and algae. However, several studies proposed that the minor photosystem II proteins CP 24 and CP 29 also {{play a significant role in}} regulation of photosynthesis. Therefore, we use a simple protocol that allows gradual aggregation also of CP 24 and CP 29. Similarly, as observed for LHCII, aggregation of CP 24 and CP 29 also leads to increasing fluorescence quenching and increasing <b>electronic</b> <b>Car</b> S- 1 -Chl Q(y) coupling. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the three proteins revealed a significant higher electronic coupling in the two minor proteins already in the absence of any aggregation. These differences become even more prominent upon aggregation. A red-shift of the Q(y) absorption band known from LHCII aggregation was also observed for CP 29 but not for CP 24. We discuss possible implications of these results for the role of CP 24 and CP 29 as potential valves for excess excitation energy in the regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting...|$|E

40|$|The {{observation}} that people already carry lots of personal devices (e. g., a smart phone, an electronic identity card, an access badge, an <b>electronic</b> <b>car</b> key, a laptop, [...] .), serves as {{starting point for}} this thesis. Furthermore, {{with the arrival of}} smart objects, the number of things that think one carries is expected to grow. Sensors will be built into clothing and attached to the body to monitor our health. It is clear that these devices need to be protected. However, due to the vast amount of devices involved, the traditional approach of protecting each device on its own, results in a usability nightmare. We investigate how to tap into the potential that arises from cooperation between these devices. This is done by deploying threshold cryptography on personal devices. Threshold cryptography has the benefit of increased overall security, since an adversary can compromise a number (up to the threshold number) of devices without gaining any advantage towards breaking the overall security. Furthermore, the end-user does not need to carry all his personal devices, any subset of size at least the threshold number is sufficient {{to make use of the}} threshold security system. We propose technical solutions to tackle some of the practical issues related to this approach, paving the road for real world implementations. First, we show how one can include devices that do not have the necessary (secure) storage capabilities needed to store shares (e. g., car keys) in our threshold scheme. Second, we investigate how the end-user can add or remove devices from his set of personal devices used in this threshold scheme. Finally, in order to get user acceptance, the (location) privacy of consumers should not be disregarded. Towards this goal we examine how to achieve private and secure device authentication over an open channel. This is done specifically for RFID tags, which are the least powerful devices that can be included in our threshold system. Hence, the location of the end-user can be kept private, while all communication between his personal devices, that arises from our threshold solution, goes over an open channel. nrpages: 148 + 20 status: publishe...|$|E
