500|$|He has {{admitted}} that he is his [...] "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she {{was never able to}} get close to him: [...] "Julian and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." [...] Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{race was}} bitter. Miller called McEwen [...] "Pinocchio," [...] and McEwen said of Miller, [...] "His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{his best friend}} in the delegation. I am deeply {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't live in our district and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

500|$|Jesse Eisenberg's {{breakthrough}} {{starring role}} was in Zombieland. The horror-comedy, which saw him with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin on a roadtrip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, was a sleeper hit. In 2010, he portrayed Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg {{in the film}} The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and nominations for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards. According to the film's director, David Fincher, both he and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin knew Eisenberg was the one for the role {{as soon as they}} watched his audition tape, despite Eisenberg's own anxieties about his audition. On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle, and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit the children of the Chernobyl disaster. Steven Spielberg is Chair of the event each year. On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Zuckerberg himself appeared. Eisenberg said that meeting the man he portrayed on-screen was [...] "an overwhelming experience," [...] and was happy that [...] "we were both able to have fun at the situation." [...] Zuckerberg, who has been a vocal disser on the artistic licenses taken by The Social Network, would later say that he thought Eisenberg [...] "was a little afraid to meet me after his portrayal, but <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Olbermann has {{addressed}} the assertions of liberal bias {{by stating that}} he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: [...] "I mean, no one in 1998, no one accused me of being a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same thing. And {{now all of a sudden}} I’m a screaming liberal." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the tour}} of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{early on in the}} season. He finished the year with 63wickets at an average of 30.85, although he did manage career best figures of 8/53 against Hampshire in May 1939. Talking about why he thought he hadn't matched his success from the previous year, Wilkinson said [...] "I don't know why but nothing really went right. The only thing I can think of is that <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too perfect, particularly with the googly. I had an England cap and as an England player I had to be good".|$|E

2500|$|In late 1995, {{he became}} suicidal after {{deciding}} he had [...] "had enough". He stated, [...] "I just felt {{more people were}} against me. When <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friendly toward them, they just walked away". Although he had previously been {{little more than a}} social drinker, his alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on that day, had especially escalated in the six months prior to the massacre. Bryant's average daily consumption was estimated at half a bottle of Sambuca and a bottle of Baileys Irish Cream supplemented with Port wine and other sweet alcoholic drinks. According to Bryant, he thought the plan for Port Arthur may have first occurred to him four to twelve weeks before the event.|$|E
