5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only acknowledged on that of their marital families. Women who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E
5|$|ILC <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> apparel {{for adults}} until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E

5|$|In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa was {{not just}} {{critical}} of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in one aspect – she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any surviving children.|$|E

5|$|Up to 1970, Nelson had {{no major}} success. His {{royalties}} were invested in tours that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> significant profits. In {{addition to the}} problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near Bandera, Texas and married Connie Koepke.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E

5|$|Around 1997, {{a number}} of Rare {{employees}} left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios.|$|E
5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|During 1836–37, Otto visited Germany, {{marrying a}} {{beautiful}} and talented 17-year-old, Duchess Amalia (Amelie) of Oldenburg (21 December 1818 to 20 May 1875). The wedding took place not in Greece, but in Oldenburg, on 22 November 1836; the marriage <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> an heir, and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government and maintaining her Lutheran faith. Otto was unfaithful to his wife, and had a liaison with Jane Digby, a notorious woman his father had previously taken as a lover.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to {{the failure of}} the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{achieved}} {{success as}} an author of children's books (using the pen name Susie Sunbeam), beginning in 1849 with A Trap to Catch a Sunbeam, which subsequently went through 42 editions. She married the Rev. Henry Mackarness in 1852, and with him had eleven children, four of whom did not survive infancy. Taking after her father {{in terms of writing}} output, Matilda Mackarness produced an average of one book a year until her death, most of them under her married name. Her husband's death in 1868 left her with little means of supporting her family, as the books <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> much income. She and her children moved in with her father.|$|E
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, {{the first was a}} scholarly look at the methodology and scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E
