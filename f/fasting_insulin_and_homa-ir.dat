This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the effects of metformin and repaglinide on the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in China. Methods. A total of 107 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (46 women and 61 men) participated in the study. All patients received 3 -month treatment of metformin or repaglinide. Fasting blood glucose and HbA 1 c were determined at baseline {{and at the end of}} the 3 -month of treatment. Results. FPG and HbA 1 c decreased in both metformin and repaglinide groups after 3 months treatment (P< 0. 01). The reduction of HbA 1 c was significantly greater in the repaglinide group (P< 0. 01). Metformin decreases <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> concentration <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> (P< 0. 01), and repaglinide improves HOMA-β[*][*](P< 0. 01). Triglycerides (TG) were reduced in both groups (P< 0. 01 in metformin group; P< 0. 05 in repaglinide group), but total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were decreased only after metformin treatment (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. Both repaglinide and metformin were effective in glycaemic control in new onset patients with type 2 diabetes in China. Repaglinide had no effect on insulin sensitivity, but it improved β-cell function...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In adults, {{depressive}} symptoms are {{positively associated with}} insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an association exists between {{depressive symptoms}} and markers of insulin resistance in youth. METHODS: This study used a retrospective review of data from an obesity clinic. We evaluated the association between depressive symptoms (Children's Depression Inventory, CDI) and fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese youth (n[*]=[*] 207, age 10 - 18 years). Individuals with lower vs. higher CDI T-scores (< 65 vs. ≥ 65) were compared; this cut-point is accepted as indicating the possibility of clinical depression. Multiple linear regression {{was used to evaluate}} relationships between CDI T-scores and insulin resistance. RESULTS: <b>Fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> values were 40 % higher in patients with higher CDI T-scores (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). After accounting for gender, race, age and body mass index, CDI T-score remained associated with HOMA-IR, although the strength of the association was small (b[*]=[*] 0. 007, P[*]=[*] 0. 049). CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between depressive symptoms and insulin resistance should be considered when evaluating obese youth...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the role of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) in the pathogenesis of inflammation in metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: Our study included 100 patients with MetS and 100 age and gender matched control patients who attended a tertiary care laboratory in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Anthropometric data was obtained including height and weight to calculate body mass index. A record of patient’s blood pressure (BP), waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) was made. Biochemical analysis included measurements of fasting glucose, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), insulin, and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP). IR {{was determined by the}} homeostasis mode assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method. Results: The levels of hs-CRP were found to be elevated in all patients with MetS where it correlated significantly with all its components including measures of obesity, fasting insulin and glucose levels, IR, TG and HDL-c. However, on linear regression analysis only WC, <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> remained significantly correlated with hs-CRP. Conclusion: MetS is a condition characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which arises because of increased abdominal adiposity and IR. Large multicenter studies are needed to gain insight into its pathogenesis and derive treatment strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objectives—Several {{studies have}} linked dietary {{patterns}} to insulin sensitivity and systemic inflammation, which affect risk of multiple chronic diseases. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the dietary patterns of a cohort of older adults, and examine relationships of dietary patterns with markers of insulin sensitivity and systemic inflammation. Subjects/Methods—The Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study is a prospective cohort study of 3075 older adults. In Health ABC, multiple indicators of glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation were assessed. Food intake was estimated with a modified Block food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In this study, dietary patterns of 1751 participants with complete data were derived by cluster analysis. Results—Six clusters were identified, including a ‘Healthy foods ’ cluster, characterized by higher intake of lowfat dairy products, fruit, whole grains, poultry, fish and vegetables. In the main analysis, the ‘Healthy foods ’ cluster had significantly lower <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> than the ‘Breakfast cereal ’ and ‘High-fat dairy products ’ clusters, and lower fasting glucose than the ‘High-fat dairy products ’ cluster (P ≤ 0. 05).

We performed a 48 -week study to assess the effects of switching from d 4 T to raltegravir (RAL) on metabolic and fat molecular parameters of patients with HALS. Forty-two patients with HALS and a median exposure to d 4 T > 7 years were switched to RAL and followed for 48 weeks. Fasting metabolic tests, HIV RNA, CD 4 cell count, and fat measured by DEXA were obtained at baseline and week 48. mtDNA and gene transcripts for PPAR gamma, adiponectin, cytochrome b, Cox IV, TNF alpha, MCP- 1 and CD 68 were assessed in paired subcutaneous fat tissue biopsies. Lipid parameters, <b>fasting</b> glucose, <b>insulin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> did not change significantly. Whole body fat (P =  0. 0027) and limb fat mass (P< 0. 0001) increased from baseline.

40|$|Background It is {{difficult}} to predict the hypoglycemic effect of pioglitazone (a thiazolidinedione) as an insulin sensitizer. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate whether insulin resistance index, homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) is a useful predictor of hypoglycemic effect of pioglitazone in comparison with body mass index (BM!). Methods Thirty-four type 2 diabetic patients (14 men and 20 women, mean age 60 ± 14 years) were treated with pioglitazone, 15 mg per day for 3 months. Eighteen subjects showed a decrease of 0. 5 % or more in HbA 1 C after treatment and were considered responders while 16 subjects were non-responders. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine <b>HOMA-IR</b> <b>and</b> BMI sensitivity and the false positive rate (l-specificity) for discriminating responders from non-responders. Results Although there was no significant difference in age, sex, fasting plasma glucose, HbA 1 C and BMI between responders <b>and</b> non-responders, <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> levels <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> prior to treatment were significantly higher in the responders than in the non-responders. In ROC analysis, the sensitivity, false positive rate, <b>and</b> efficiency for <b>HOMA-IR</b> at the cut-off value, 4. 6, with the highest efficiency were 81. 2 %, 22. 2 %, and 79. 4 %, respectively, and those for BMI at the cut-off value, 29. 1, were 87. 5 %, 53. 3 %, and 67. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between GHRH-induced GH secretion in obese premenopausal women and cardiovascular risk markers or insulin resistance. Premenopausal obese women, aged 35 – 52 years, were studied. GH secretion, IGF-I, serum cardiovascular risk markers, insulin, leptin, mid-waist and hip circumference, total body fat, and truncal fat were measured. Subjects were classified as meeting the criteria for GH deficiency (GHD) when peak GH after stimulation with GHRH was ≤ 3 [*]μg/L. Mean total and LDL cholesterol, <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin,</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> were all higher, in subjects who would have been classified as GH-deficient compared with GH-sufficient. Peak GH secretion after stimulation was inversely associated with fasting insulin (R = − 0. 650, P =. 012), HOMA-IR (R = − 0. 846, P =. 001), total cholesterol (R = − 0. 532, P =. 034), and LDL cholesterol (R = − 0. 692, P =. 006) and positively associated with HDL cholesterol (R = 0. 561, P =. 037). These data strongly suggest a role for insulin resistance in the decreased GH secretion of obesity and that the blunted GH secretion of central obesity could be the pituitary expression of the metabolic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Insulin {{resistance}} and oxidative stress {{have been reported}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the molecular basis of insulin resistance in RA is not clearly understood. Recent studies have documented the role of redox sensitive serine kinase pathways in insulin resistance. The aim of the study is to investigate insulin resistance, oxidative stress andlymphocyte redox sensitive - nuclear factor - kB (NF-kB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK) pathways in RA subjects. Methods: Twenty newly diagnosed RA patients and 20 healthy volunteers in the age group of 30 - 50 years were included in this study. Overnight fasting blood was collected from the subjects, red blood cells, lymphocytes and plasma were separated using Ficoll hypaque. Blood oxidative stress parameters, fasting glucose and insulin were estimated. Redox sensitive serine kinase pathways in lymphocytes also studied. Results: The <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> were significantly (p lymphocytes of RA subjects.

40|$|Objective. We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between FGF 21 and obesity-related acanthosis nigricans (AN). Methods. 40 obese patients without AN (OB group), 40 obese patients with AN (AN group), and 40 healthy volunteers (control group, CON) were included in this study. Weight, BMI, lipid profile, FFA, UA, and CRP were measured in all participants. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed and serum glucose and plasma insulin were measured. Serum FGF 21 was measured by ELISA. Results. Compared with OB group, AN group had higher levels of fasting insulin and homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P< 0. 05), but lower serum levels of blood glucose. The difference of FGF 21 among three groups was significant and AN group showed the highest serum level of FGF 21 (P< 0. 05). Serum FGF 21 was most positively correlated with <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR.</b> Multiple logistic analysis showed that FGF 21 was the independent risk factor for AN (OR 4. 550; 95 % CI 1. 054 – 19. 635; P= 0. 042). Conclusion. AN patients had more serious hyperinsulinemia but better serum levels of blood glucose than OB. Increased FGF 21 is associated with AN in obese patients and may be considered as compensatory response to the decreased insulin sensitivity...|$|E

Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{may present}} important comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, {{which are often}} preceded by changes in cardiac autonomic modulation. Different types of physical exercises are frequently indicated for the prevention and treatment of PCOS. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of strength training on the metabolic, hormonal, and cardiac autonomic parameters. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects of strength training on the autonomic modulation of heart rate variability (HRV) and its relation to endocrine-metabolic parameters in women with PCOS. Fifty-three women were divided into two groups: CONTROL (n= 26) and PCOS (n= 27). The strength training lasted 4 months, which was divided into mesocycles of 4 weeks each. The training load started with 70 % of one repetition maximum (1 RM). Blood samples were collected before and after intervention for analysis of <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> glucose, <b>HOMA-IR,</b> testosterone, androstenedione <b>and</b> testosterone/androstenedione (T/A) ratio. Spectral analysis of HRV was performed to assess cardiac autonomic modulation indexes. The PCOS group presented higher <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> testosterone levels, T/A ratio, along with increased sympathetic cardiac autonomic modulation before intervention. The training protocol used did not cause any change of endocrine-metabolic parameters in the CONTROL group. Interestingly, in the PCOS group, reduced testosterone levels and T/A ratio. Additionally, strength training did not have an effect on the spectral parameter values of HRV obtained in both groups. Strength training was not able to alter HRV autonomic modulation in women with PCOS, however may reduce testosterone levels and T/A ratio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWeight loss (5 – 10 %) {{improves}} obesity-associated cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of {{this work}} was to study the effect of 2 commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures; laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and laparoscopic gastric band (BAND), on the cardiovascular risk profile in morbidly obese patients and its correlation with the plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV level. Patient and methodThis study was carried prospectively on 34 patients scheduled for bariatric surgery. They were randomly assigned into two groups; group 1 =BAND (18 cases), group 2 =gastric bypass RYGBP (16 cases). Both groups were studied preoperatively and twelve months after surgery. Data collected included changes of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, <b>fasting</b> serum <b>insulin,</b> <b>insulin</b> resistance (<b>HOMA-IR)</b> <b>and</b> lipid profile. In addition, apo A-IV {{was determined by the}} Western blot technique. ResultsThe results demonstrated a highly significant reduction in body weight as determined by reduction in the BMI in both groups I & II compared to preoperative measurements. Moreover, both groups had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBG), <b>fasting</b> serum <b>insulin</b> <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> twelve months after operation. The changes in BMI, systolic blood pressure; FBG <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> were significantly more in group II than in group I. The lipid profiles in group I & II before surgery were similar. The HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher in both groups I & II 12 months after surgery. In addition, apo A-IV levels increased after surgery in both groups. ConclusionBoth gastric band and gastric bypass are associated with significant improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile, although it is more pronounced after gastric bypass. The improvement correlates well with the increase of apo A-IV in both groups. Thus Apo A-IV may play a positive role in improving the cardiovascular risk profile after bariatric surgery...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} implicated {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) as an {{independent}} comorbid factor in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It is postulated that recurrent episodes of occlusion of upper airways during sleep result in pathophysiological changes that may predispose to vascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, and we postulate that OSA represents a stress that promotes insulin resistance, hence atherogenesis. This study investigated the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing <b>and</b> <b>insulin</b> resistance, indicated by <b>fasting</b> serum <b>insulin</b> level <b>and</b> <b>insulin</b> resistance index based on the homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA-IR). A total of 270 consecutive subjects (197 male) who were referred for polysomnography and {{who did not have}} known diabetes mellitus were included, and 185 were documented to have OSA defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5. OSA subjects were more insulin resistant, as indicated by higher levels of <b>fasting</b> serum <b>insulin</b> (p = 0. 001) <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> (p < 0. 001); they were also older and more obese. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that obesity was the major determinant of insulin resistance but sleep-disordered breathing parameters (AHI and minimum oxygen saturation) were also independent determinants of <b>insulin</b> resistance (<b>fasting</b> insulin: AHI, p = 0. 02, minimum O 2, p = 0. 041; HOMA-IR: AHI, p = 0. 044, minimum O 2, p = 0. 022); this association between OSA <b>and</b> <b>insulin</b> resistance was seen in both obese and nonobese subjects. Each additional apnea or hypopnea per sleep hour increased the <b>fasting</b> <b>insulin</b> level <b>and</b> <b>HOMA-IR</b> by about 0. 5 %. Further analysis of the relationship of <b>insulin</b> resistance <b>and</b> hypertension confirmed that insulin resistance was a significant factor for hypertension in this cohort. Our findings suggest that OSA is independently associated with <b>insulin</b> resistance, <b>and</b> its role in the atherogenic potential of sleep disordered breathing is worthy of further exploration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
