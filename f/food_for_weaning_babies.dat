Unfortunately maize (corn) has two significant flaws; it lacks {{the full range of}} amino acids, namely lysine and tryptophan, needed to produce proteins, and has its niacin (vitamin B3) bound in an indigestible complex. The Mayans and Aztecs used to boil maize in the alkaline limewater which broke down the complex so that the Niacin became available. However, in the main this practice did not transfer to the Old World or settlers in the [...] "New World" [...] which resulted in epidemics of Pellagra from the 16th century onwards.

40|$|The current {{interest}} {{in the use of}} traditional fermented and malted <b>foods</b> <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> is their potential to reduce the transmission of bacterial enteric pathogens through contaminated weaning foods as well as improving the nutritional value of the foods. This study was carried out to investigate the potential use of traditional fermented and malted <b>foods</b> <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> in rural areas. Information was obtained by interviewing randomly selected 150 rural women with children under five years old. Ninety seven percent of the women had knowledge of some traditional fermented foods. The commonest fermented foods known by the women were mahewu (traditional fermented and malted sour, non-alcoholic cereal gruel), sour milk and sour porridge. Most of the women indicated that mahewu (94 %), sour milk (87 %) and sour porridge (71 %) were consumed by all family members. The majority of the women gave the fermented foods to infants from the age of four months. Although most of the infants were introduced to the fermented and malted foods from the age of four months, the foods were not given to infants very often, with the exception of mahewu. The storage period of the fermented foods ranged from one to three days. The results of this study show that mahewu, sour milk and sour porridge have a potential <b>for</b> use as <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> if they are promoted. fermented foods weaning diarrhoea nutrition Zimbabwe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although premastication of <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> infants {{might have}} {{nutritional}} benefit, {{it is also}} associated with transmission of pathogens. We investigated premastication practices in Cape Town, South Africa, in lower socioeconomic status caregivers of infants below 2 years of age. METHODS: A previously reported questionnaire was adapted for South African conditions. A convenience sample of infant caregivers was captured at public maternal/pediatric and HIV outpatient clinics and home visits. RESULTS: We interviewed 154 caregivers, 92 % of whom were the biological mothers (median age: 29). Of these, 70 % were black, and 29 % were colored. There were 106 (69 %) caregivers who practiced premastication. The median age of infants who received premasticated food was 6 (interquartile range: 4 - 6) months. Forty-six (43 %) infants were teething, and 44 (42 %) had oral mucosal lesions while receiving premasticated food. Fifty-five (52 %) caregivers reported an oral condition, mostly bleeding gums, mouth sores, and thrush, and 41 (39 %) caregivers reported blood in the food. Premasticating caregivers had a significantly lower educational level than those caregivers who did not engage in this practice. Premastication practices were cultural (40 %), habit (20 %), and on mother's advice (75 %). Reasons for premastication were to pretaste (68 %), encourage eating (61 %), estimate food temperature (85 %), and homogenize food (60 %). CONCLUSIONS: Counselors and caregivers {{should be aware of the}} adverse effects of premastication. Education should include advice to avoid premastication and to seek health advice for oral conditions in the caregiver and child. More studies are needed to better define the extent and risks of premastication, including its possible role in increasing HIV- 1 transmission. Copyright © 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

40|$|The {{general lack}} of well-preserved {{juvenile}} skeletal remains from Caribbean archaeological sites has, in the past, prevented evaluations of juvenile dietary changes. Canímar Abajo (Cuba), {{with a large number}} of well-preserved juvenile and adult skeletal remains, provided a unique opportunity to fully assess juvenile paleodiets from an ancient Caribbean population. Ages for the start and the end of weaning and possible <b>food</b> sources used <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> were inferred by combining the results of two Bayesian probability models that help to reduce some of the uncertainties inherent to bone collagen isotope based paleodiet reconstructions. Bone collagen (31 juveniles, 18 adult females) was used for carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. The isotope results were assessed using two Bayesian probability models: Weaning Ages Reconstruction with Nitrogen isotopes and Stable Isotope Analyses in R. Breast milk seems to have been the most important protein source until two years of age with some supplementary food such as tropical fruits and root cultigens likely introduced earlier. After two, juvenile diets were likely continuously supplemented by starch rich foods such as root cultigens and legumes. By the age of three, the model results suggest that the weaning process was completed. Additional indications suggest that animal marine/riverine protein and maize, while part of the Canímar Abajo female diets, were likely not used to supplement juvenile diets. The combined use of both models here provided a more complete assessment of the <b>weaning</b> process <b>for</b> an ancient Caribbean population, indicating not only the start and end ages of weaning but also the relative importance of different <b>food</b> sources <b>for</b> different age juveniles...|$|R

METODOLOGIA: Adotou-se os preceitos metodol??gicos da pesquisa qualitativa em sa??de, utilizando como referencial te??rico a teoria das representa????es sociais. Ao todo, entrevistou-se 24 mulheres que se encontravam em processo de desmame antes do 4 ?? m??s de vida do beb??. RESULTADOS: A an??lise compreensiva permitiu revelar que a tomada de decis??es que leva as mulheres ao desmame se d?? de maneira complexa e carregada de culpa. Dentre os motivos alegados, figuraram leite fraco ou pouco, intercorr??ncias de mama puerperal, falta de experi??ncia, inadequa????o entre as suas necessidades e as do beb??, interfer??ncias externas, trabalho, ambig??idade entre o querer/poder amamentar e entre o fardo/desejo. CONCLUS??ES: A solid??o/isolamento da mulher-m??e e a necessidade de obter apoio para a consecu????o dessa pr??tica, n??o s?? por parte do servi??o de sa??de como tamb??m dos outros segmentos da sociedade, se fizeram presentes de forma uniforme nas entrevistas.

We briefly highlight treatment strategies that may enhance the chance of weaning success. RECENT FINDINGS: Impaired respiratory mechanics, respiratory muscle dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and metabolic disorders are recognized causes <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> failure. In addition, iatrogenic factors may be at play. Most {{studies have focused on}} respiratory muscle dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction. Recent studies demonstrate that both ultrasound and electromyography are valuable tools to evaluate respiratory muscle function in ventilated patients. Sophisticated ultrasound techniques and biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide, are valuable tools to identify cardiac dysfunction as a cause <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> failure. Once a cause <b>for</b> <b>weaning</b> failure has been identified specific treatment should be instituted. Concerning treatment, both strength training and endurance training should be considered for patients with respiratory muscle weakness. Inotropes and vasodilators should be considered in case of heart failure. SUMMARY: Understanding the complex pathophysiology of weaning failure in combination with a systematic diagnostic approach allows identification of the primary cause of weaning failure. This will help the clinician to choose a specific treatment strategy and therefore may fasten liberation from mechanical ventilation...|$|R
