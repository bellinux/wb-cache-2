40|$|Minimization of HLW {{inventories}} and U consumption are {{key elements}} guaranteeing nuclear energy expansion. The integration of complex nuclear systems into a viable cycle yet constitutes a challenging multi-parametric optimization problem. The reactors and fuel cycle performance parameters may be strongly dependent on minor {{variations in the}} system's input data. Proven discrepancies in nuclear data evaluations could affect {{the validity of the}} system optimization metrics. This study first analyzes various advanced AP 1000 -VHTR fuel cycle scenarios by assessing their TRU destruction and their U consumption minimization capabilities, and by computing reactor performance parameters such as the time evolution of the effective multiplication factor keff, the reactors' energy spectrum or the isotopic composition/activity at EOL. The performance metrics dependence to prompt neutron <b>fission</b> <b>spectrum</b> discrepancies is then quantified to assess the viability of one strategy. <b>Fission</b> <b>spectrum</b> evaluations are indeed intensively used in reactors' calculations. Discrepancies higher than 10 % have been computed among nuclear data libraries for energies above 8 MeV for 235 U. TRU arising from a 3 wt% 235 U-enriched UO 2 -fueled AP 1000 were incinerated in a VHTR. Fuels consisting of 20 %, 40 % and 100 % of TRU completed by UO 2 were examined. MCNPX results indicate that up to 88. 9 % of the TRU initially present in a VHTR fueled with 20 % of TRU and 80 % of ThO 2 were transmuted. Additionally, the use of WgPu instead of RgPu should reduce the daily consumption of 235 U by 1. 3 and augment core lifetime. To estimate the system metrics dependence to <b>fission</b> <b>spectrum</b> discrepancies and validate optimization studies outputs, the VTHR 235 U <b>fission</b> <b>spectrum</b> distribution was altered successively in three manners. keff is at worst lowered by 1. 7 % of the reference value and the energy spectrum by 5 % between 50 meV and 2 MeV when a significantly distorted <b>fission</b> <b>spectrum</b> tail is used. 233 U, 236 Pu and 237 Pu inventories and activities are multiplied by 263, 523 and 34 but are still negligible compared to 239 Pu mass or the total activity.

The thermal neutron spectrum is this matrix describes the newest data of JRC IRMM by Hambsch et al. (2009). The longstanding problem of inconsistency of integral thermal data testing and differential prompt <b>fission</b> neutron <b>spectra</b> data (PFNS) {{seems to be}} solved. It was mostly due to rather poor fits of differential PFNS data in major data libraries. The older measured database is updated here using modern standards like spontaneous <b>fission</b> neutron <b>spectra</b> of 252 Cf(sf). That largely removes the inconsistency of older thermal neutron-induced PFNS data with the newest data. A phenomenological approach, developed by Kornilov et al. (1999), for the first-chance fission and extended for the emissive fission domain by Maslov et al. (2005) is normalized at Eth to predict both the PFNS average energy E and PFNS shape up to 20 MeV. In the first-chance and emissive fission domain evaluated PFNS {{are consistent with the}} E data by Ethvignot et al. (2005). A compiled ENDF/B-formatted file of the 235 U(n,F) PFNS largely removes the inconsistencies of the evaluated differential PFNS with integral data benchmarks.

That reveals a rather delicate compensation effect, since present and previous PFNS shapes are drastically different from each other.

These measurements are important for criticality safety studies in that, frequently, difficulties have arisen in predicting the reactivity of individually subcritical components assembled in a critical array.

In these NIST measurements, an accurate determination of the leakage from a <b>fission</b> <b>spectrum,</b> modified by water scattering, is available. Previously, results for 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -in. diam. water-filled spheres, both with and without cadmium covers over the fission chambers, were presented for four fissionable materials: {sup 235 }U, {sup 238 }U, {sup 237 }Np, and {sup 239 }Pu. Results were also given for ''dry'' systems, in which the water spheres were drained of water, with the results corresponding to essentially measurements of unmoderated {sup 252 }Cf spontaneous-fission neutrons. The calculated-to-experimental (C/E) values ranged from 0. 94 to 1. 01 for the dry systems and 0. 93 to 1. 05 for the wet systems, with experimental uncertainties ranging from 1. 5 to 1. 9 %.
