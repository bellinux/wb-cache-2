25|$|On April 16, 2017, Tesla {{removed the}} model 60 and 60D options, since most {{customers}} pick the larger 75-kwh battery option. This made the Model S 75 the <b>entry-level</b> <b>Model</b> S.|$|E
25|$|Few {{changes were}} made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years {{included}} the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.|$|E

50|$|While Apple {{dropped the}} 604ev in 1998 in favor for the PowerPC 750, IBM kept {{using it in}} <b>entry-level</b> <b>models</b> of its RS/6000 {{computers}} for several years.|$|R
25|$|The 405 saloon was {{launched}} in 1987 {{to compete with the}} likes of the Ford Sierra, and was voted European Car of the Year. This, too, was a very popular car across Europe, and continued to be available in Africa and Asia after it was replaced by the 406 nearly a decade later. Production of the 405 in Europe was divided between Britain and France, although its 406 successor was only produced in France. The 106, Peugeot's <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> from 1991, was also produced solely in France.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{announced}} the iPhone5C, {{along with the}} iPhone5S during a media event at its Cupertino headquarters on September 10, 2013. Thus, the iPhone 5S became the new flagship of the iPhone range, while the iPhone5C {{was designed as a}} mid-range model, and the iPhone 4S continued production becoming the <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> of the series. The iPhone5S 16GB retailed in the US for $199 on contract or $649 off-contract, the iPhone5C 16GB retailed for $99 on contract or $549 off-contract, and the iPhone4S 8GB had dropped to $0 on contract or $449 off-contract.|$|E
25|$|The Riga Minox camera, {{along with}} the luxury finish postwar cameras, are now collector's items. Newer {{electronic}} versions, such as the Minox TLX, remain in production, essentially unchanged in features from the LX model since the late 1970s. With {{the introduction of the}} LX came significant redesign of the camera's basic controls. There is also the fully electronic <b>entry-level</b> <b>model,</b> the EC, which has a very different internal design and has a fixed-focus lens. The production rate for these cameras is considerably slower than in former years, however, as Minox devotes more time to the design and marketing of OEM cameras under the Minox brand.|$|E
50|$|During {{the time}} Ford {{occupied}} the Piquette Avenue Plant (1904-1910), the company assembled Ford upscale Models B and K; and Ford <b>entry-level</b> <b>Models</b> C, F, N, R, S, and T. Ford's first model, the original Ford Model A, was built at Ford's previous facility: the Ford Mack Avenue Plant (1903-1904).|$|R

25|$|The Nintendo 2DS (abbreviated to 2DS) was {{announced}} on August 28, 2013, {{as a new}} <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> of the Nintendo 3DS family. While its hardware and software are relatively similar to the Nintendo 3DS (and still offers compatibility with Nintendo DS and 3DS games), it lacks the 3DS's signature 3D screen, does not have internal stereo speakers (only using a mono speaker), and uses a slate-like form factor {{as opposed to the}} clamshell design used by its Nintendo DS and 3DS predecessors. The Nintendo 2DS was released in North America and Europe on October 12, 2013, coinciding with the launch of Pokémon X & Y and is being sold alongside the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL at a relatively lower price point.|$|E
25|$|For 1992, the Taurus was {{available}} in three models; L, GL, and LX. As with the first generation, the L was the basic model, the GL was the mid-priced value model, and the LX was the luxury model. Due to disappointing sales, the L was dropped after 1992, leaving the GL as the <b>entry-level</b> <b>model.</b> For the 1995 model year, a new SE model was added, {{intended to be a}} budget version of the SHO. It was a step above the entry-level GL, a step below the top of the line LX, and came standard with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor-mounted shifter, as well as a rear spoiler borrowed from the SHO. The SE was never available as a wagon.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2014, an 8GB {{version of}} the device was {{released}} in UK, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Sweden and China. On September 9, 2014, Apple discontinued the iPhone 4S {{as part of its}} annual refresh of the iPhone lineup – in which time the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were introduced – thus making the iPhone 5C the <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> complimentary when a two-year contract is signed with a US carrier or $349 off-contract. The 16 & 32GB versions of the iPhone 5C were also discontinued globally, replaced by the 8GB model. However, some carriers in the US like AT kept the 16GB and 32GB models instead of having the 8GB model, thus the 16GB model was $0 (on-contract) and the 32GB was priced between $50–$100 (on-contract). The 8 GB iPhone 5C succeeded the discontinued iPhone 4S as Apple's entry-level smartphone.|$|E
50|$|The Palm Zire and Palm Zire 21 were {{inexpensive}} and are differentiated {{from the rest}} of Palm's line by having monochrome screens without backlighting, having only two quickbuttons instead of four, and a traditional up/down navigation button instead of a 5-Way Navigator, though both of these <b>entry-level</b> <b>models</b> are lightweight (3.8oz or 108g), sporting a white front with a matte gray plastic back.|$|R
50|$|The D50 is {{the only}} {{entry-level}} Nikon DSLR to have the autofocus motor ('screw drive') built into the camera body, making the camera backwards-compatible with mechanical-drive autofocus lenses (Nikkor AF series) dating back to 1989. This feature has been eliminated on later <b>entry-level</b> <b>models</b> and is currently only available on mid-range and advanced models. This makes the D50 the lightest Nikon DSLR to have the autofocus motor.|$|R

25|$|The 160 and 165 are {{the current}} entry level {{offering}} from Caterham; the 160 {{is for the}} United Kingdom while the 165 is intended {{for sale in the}} European Union. It is only available with the S3 chassis, doors and windscreen as standard. There is a list of optional extras such as carpets, spare wheel, weather package and heater. It is powered by a turbocharged Suzuki 660cc kei car K6A engine producing 80 horsepower. Price starts at £14,999 in semi-kit form. This model, with its skinnier tyres and Suzuki driveshafts, is actually compact enough to be classified as a kei car in Japan, except for its power which is above the 64PS limit enforced for the class. The car's gearbox and live rear axle is also supplied by Suzuki; this is the first Caterham with a live rear axle since the supply of Morris Marina rears dried up after the Seven Beaulieu ended production in 2003. The car received a large amount of publicity for a low-powered <b>entry-level</b> <b>model,</b> with Suzuki even displaying it at the 2014 Frankfurt Motor Show. Production had to be adjusted upwards by 50%, with a third of the first year's production of 150 cars shipped to Japan.|$|E
25|$|Lexus {{unveiled}} the fifth-generation ES in February 2006 at the Chicago Auto Show for the 2007 model year. The line initially {{consisted of the}} ES 350 sedan, which as per previous models, featured front-wheel drive and a V6 engine—now displacing 3.5 liters. The line was refreshed in 2009, during which more features were added, and a four-cylinder variant, the ES 240, was introduced for Asian markets. The fifth-generation ES remained Lexus' top-selling sedan model in the North American and Asian markets, anchoring the marque's <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> lineup. Like previous generations, the fifth-generation Lexus ES was geared towards the comfort luxury segment, favoring a soft ride over sporty performance. It continued the previous generation's direction of moving the ES more upscale in its design and features; Lexus touted the ES 350 as faster, more powerful, more aerodynamic, and more quiet than the original LS 400 flagship. Like its predecessors, the fifth-generation ES continued {{to be made in}} Japan, at the Kyushu plant in Fukuoka, Japan. Despite being built in the country, the XV40 is left-hand drive only and was not sold in the Japanese market, {{as well as the other}} regions with right-hand drive, although the country allows both RHD and LHD vehicles on their roads.|$|E
2500|$|The 2013 Leaf has {{a larger}} trunk, with its volume {{increased}} from [...] The extra space was freed by moving a downsized charger {{from the back}} of the car to the front. Other improvements include a new gauge that tells the driver how much battery capacity is remaining by percentage, and a long-life battery mode is now available in any charging mode, which charges the battery to 80% to improve pack life. Also, Nissan will introduce in the Japanese market a lower price <b>entry-level</b> <b>model</b> with less equipment, called the S trim. This model will be priced at just under [...] (around [...] ), almost half a million yen (approximately [...] ) cheaper than the previous year’s entry price.|$|E

2500|$|The Regal {{has sold}} {{well in the}} Chinese market as a large, {{relatively}} luxurious model, despite it's high price, costing more than the North American version. The Chinese market Regal has slightly different frontal sheetmetal compared to the North American version and different engines including a 2.0L dual overhead cam 16 valve four-cylinder, the 2.5L LB8 V6 [...] and the 3.0L LW9 V6. Gearbox choices were a 4 speed automatic for V6 models while four cylinder variants are paired with a 5 speed manual gearbox.

WeaKnees also began selling TiVo DVRs with the increased capacity already installed for customers not interested in performing the assembly themselves.|$|R
50|$|This updated Wrangler {{featured}} a coil-spring suspension (based on {{that of the}} Jeep Grand Cherokee) for better ride and handling, {{and a return to}} the classic CJ's round headlamps. The engine is the same 4.0 L AMC 242 Straight-6 used in the Cherokee and Grand Cherokee. A 2.5 L AMC 150 Inline-4 engine was available on <b>entry-level</b> <b>models</b> until 2002 when the 2.4 L DOHC 4-cylinder engine previously used on the Chrysler PT Cruiser replaced it.|$|R
50|$|This was {{not enough}} for Ives to re-take its former place as market leader—by 1926, Lionel's revenue was twice that of Ives'--and, worse yet for the company, Ives was losing money by the mid-1920s. This was worsened by Ives' {{attempts}} to compete {{at the low end}} of the market, where, unlike its competition, it sold its <b>entry-level</b> <b>models</b> at a loss. If Ives' low-end products were higher quality than its competitors, it benefited its customers, not the company.|$|R

The 3110 is notable as the first Nokia handset to feature the 'Navi-Key' (a.k.a. D-Pad) menu navigation system. The Navi-Key was featured heavily on Nokia handsets, especially the <b>entry-level</b> <b>models</b> such as the Nokia 1100 in the following years.
