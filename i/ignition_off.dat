50|$|An idling engine {{will have}} a {{different}} impact on the spark plugs than one running at full throttle. Spark plug readings are only valid for the most recent engine operating conditions and running the engine under different conditions may erase or obscure characteristic marks previously left on the spark plugs. Thus, the most valuable information is gathered by running the engine at high speed and full load, immediately cutting the <b>ignition</b> <b>off</b> and stopping without idling or low speed operation and removing the plugs for reading.|$|E

50|$|Just as {{the water}} {{supplies}} are exhausted, the Phoenix is completed. The first four startup attempts are unsuccessful, and Dorfmann panics when Towns wants {{to use one of}} the remaining starter cartridges just to clear the engine's cylinders. Dorfmann objects, but Towns ignores him and fires one cartridge with the <b>ignition</b> <b>off.</b> The next startup is successful. The men pull the Phoenix to a nearby hilltop and climb onto the wings. When Towns guns the engine, the Phoenix slides down the hill and along a lake bed before taking off. After the Phoenix lands at an oasis with a manned oil rig, the men celebrate and Towns and Dorfmann are reconciled.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} aftermarket alarms are one-piece {{units with}} a siren and control module. The {{most common type}} of sensor is a shock sensor and two wires (12-volt constant power and ground) which are connected to the car's battery. This type of alarm is triggered by vibration transferred to the shock sensor, or by voltage changes on the input (the alarm assumes that a sudden change in voltage is due to a door or trunk being opened, or the ignition being turned on); however it is very prone to false triggers on late-model vehicles with many electronic control modules, which can draw current with the <b>ignition</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The South Side {{is home to}} Palo Alto College and {{the newly}} opened Texas A&M University-San Antonio. Before the {{beginning}} of this decade many of the city's young population would cruise [...] "Military". Many classic cars and lowriders would drive close to the 35 intersection and muscle cars and import street racers would hang out close to the 37 intersection along the main entrance of what was once the main gate of Brooks A.F.B. The south side is predominantly Hispanic especially in its inner city neighborhoods such as Harlandale, Palm Heights, Columbia Heights, Hot Wells, Highland Hills, Indian Creek, Valley Hi, and Palo Alto. Four out of five of the city's historic missions are located on the south side along the San Antonio River besides the Alamo. They are San Jose, Concepcion, San Juan Capistrano, and San Francisco de la Espada. The River Walk is also extending into the south side and can now be seen all the way into Concepcion Park and is continuing to grow further outwards towards Military Drive. San Antonio's famous [...] "Ghost Tracks" [...] is located in the cities McCreless Meadows neighborhood near the intersection of Villamain Rd. and Shane. An old tale that a school bus was in an accident many years ago and a group of children were supposedly all killed. A phenomenon is supposed to happen when your vehicle is put in neutral with the <b>ignition</b> <b>off,</b> the vehicle begins to roll up hill crossing the tracks all on its own. It is said that the children's ghosts are pushing your vehicle {{out of the way of}} a passing train. Many people put talcum powder all over their vehicle and fingerprints will begin to show up after the tracks are crossed. All the streets located in the neighboring neighborhood are named after what is supposedly named after all of the children that were killed there long ago. The southern part of the city does not extend as far outward towards Texas State Highway Loop 1604 like much of the far north side does. Much of the city's far south side (outside loop 410) remains unincorporated and rural, although new neighborhoods, such as Mission del Lago, are uprising. The suburb of Elmendorf, Texas sits along the south side's two main lakes, Victor Braunig Lake and Calaveras Lake (Texas).|$|E
5000|$|Comfort and {{performance}} options {{available for the}} Cougar included the [...] "Tilt-Away" [...] steering wheel that swung {{up and out of}} the way when the driver's door was opened, the transmission in [...] "park", and the <b>ignition</b> was <b>off,</b> and from 1971, a power driver's seat. The new option appeared in 1968: Ford's first factory-installed electric sunroof. It was available on any hardtop Cougar, but rarely ordered on early cars.|$|R
50|$|A strange {{phenomenon}} {{was observed}} at Kalo Dungar, when some visitors noticed that their vehicles were hurtling down the hill at speeds over 80 km/h even with the <b>ignition</b> switched <b>off.</b> The team of experts from the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), and Institute of Seismological Research, Gandhinagar and Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur studied the phenomenon. It is concluded that the vehicle hurtle down fast due to the more gradient of the slope.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{design and}} {{development}} of a ubiquitous tracking system is proposed, in which vehicles are tracked and controlled using the prevailing cellular technologies. The system contains a GPS receiver and a GSM modem interfaced with a microcontroller. To track any vehicle, the vehicle's owner has to send an SMS to the tracking system installed inside the vehicle. Upon receiving the SMS, the microcontroller takes the current location's longitude and latitude coordinates from GPS receiver, packs it into an SMS and sends it to the owner and on a web server using GSM modem. When the web server receives the SMS containing vehicles coordinates, it will show location of the vehicle on Google Maps. For android users, the location is also displayed on an android application. In case of vehicle theft, the owner is able {{to turn off the}} main ignition switch, check status and speed of the vehicle simply by sending an SMS. The system is also equipped with a special security button for parked vehicles. By turning the button ON, the system will come in ACTIVE mode and will keep a special check on the vehicle's movement meanwhile performing the normal tasks. If the system senses any movement of vehicle during the ACTIVE mode, it will turn the main <b>ignition</b> <b>OFF</b> and will inform the owner immediately be sending 5 SMSs. Record of the vehicle's movement will be continuously managed on the web server where each owner will have vehicle's account. We have used a wide number of technologies including, but not limited to, Global Positioning System (GPS), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Microcontroller...|$|E
25|$|In Germany, the StVZO (Road Traffic Licensing Regulations) {{calls for}} a {{different}} function also known as parking lamps: With the vehicle's <b>ignition</b> switched <b>off,</b> the operator may activate a low-intensity light at the front (white) and rear (red) on either the left or {{the right side of}} the car. This function is used when parking in narrow unlit streets to provide parked-vehicle conspicuity to approaching drivers. This function, which is optional under UN and US regulations, is served passively and without power consumption in the United States by the mandatory side marker retroreflectors.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} battery usage, a petrol driven heater is fully integrated to vehicle. It typically takes 5 to 10 minutes to warm and provides excellent cabin heating. It takes several {{minutes for the}} heater to run down and will therefore continue to operate after the <b>ignition</b> is turned <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{air intake}} shut down, two {{distinct}} types are commonly utilized, i.e. butterfly valves and swing gate or guillotine valves. Because diesel engines ignite fuel using compression {{instead of an}} electronic <b>ignition,</b> shutting <b>off</b> the fuel source to a diesel engine will not necessarily stop the engine from running. When an external hydrocarbon, such as methane gas, {{is present in the}} atmosphere, it can be sucked into a diesel engine causing overspeed or over revving, potentially leading to a catastrophic failure and explosion. When actuated, ESD valves stop the flow of air and prevent these failures.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} the {{immobiliser}} circuit will also start rapidly pulsing for 40 seconds, completely disabling the engine and eventually bringing the vehicle to a stop. If the thief switches the <b>ignition</b> to the <b>off</b> position {{and back to the}} on position again, the horn will restart and operate constantly and the hazard lights will flash for 60 seconds.|$|R

50|$|The FJR1300 has an {{electrically}} adjusted windshield {{controlled by}} a rocker switch on the handlebars. In Gen I and Gen II models, by default the shield returns to its lowest position when the key is off, however some riders choose to disable the 'return' function. In the Gen III model the windshield maintains its position until changed with the rocker switch, even when the <b>ignition</b> is turned <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|Power {{windows are}} usually {{inoperable}} {{when the car}} is not running. This is primarily a security feature. It would be a simple thing to allow electric power windows to be operable when the <b>ignition</b> is turned <b>off,</b> however it would also make the car much easier to steal. Some systems offer the compromise of leaving power applied to the windows until a passenger door is opened at which time the window power is removed.|$|R
5000|$|The 14CUX {{is capable}} of storing {{diagnostic}} trouble codes in a 32-byte segment of its internal memory that is maintained (even while vehicle <b>ignition</b> is <b>off)</b> by applying 5VDC (regulated down from 12VDC from the vehicle's battery.) Because of this maintainer voltage, the ECU is always drawing {{a small amount of}} current. Fault codes can be cleared by disconnecting the battery {{for a short period of}} time. Diagnostic trouble codes can be retrieved from the ECU via a small electronic display referred to as the [...] "Fault Code Display Unit". This unit contains two seven-segment displays that together show a single two-digit fault code. When connected to the 14CUX wiring harness, the ECU detects its presence and reconfigures the RDATA and TDATA lines to work as an I2C link to this device.|$|R
50|$|Dieseling is {{not nearly}} as common as it once was, because it most {{commonly}} occurs in engines equipped with carburetors. The vast majority of vehicles manufactured after 1987 are fuel-injected: the injectors and high-pressure fuel pump immediately cease supplying fuel to the cylinders when the <b>ignition</b> is switched <b>off.</b> If the injector is damaged or dirty, a small amount of fuel can enter the chamber and be ignited, causing a sputter or two after the engine is switched off.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{form of a}} [...] "memory" [...] {{seat was}} introduced by Ford Motor Company on two of its 1957 models: the Ford Thunderbird and the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser. The [...] "Dial-a-Matic" [...] seat used a letter-and-numerical dial that adjusted the height and either fore or aft of the front seat to the driver's tastes; when the <b>ignition</b> was switched <b>off,</b> it {{moved back to the}} rearmost, lowest position to allow easy exit and entry, then moved back to the last [...] "dialed" [...] position when the ignition was started again.

30|$|Dual-Vision XC cameras, {{manufactured}} by Rosco Vision Systems, were {{installed in the}} vehicles by a qualified technician. Cameras were mounted under the rear view mirror, providing {{a view of the}} forward roadway and of the driver’s face. An infrared illuminator was installed in each vehicle for nighttime video recording. The cameras also included an embedded GPS system. Cameras were set to automatically begin recording audio, video, and GPS data as soon as the vehicle ignition was turned on by the driver and to stop recording when the vehicle <b>ignition</b> was turned <b>off.</b> Video data were recorded at 3.5 frames per second at standard VGA resolution.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 season {{brought a}} new safety device to Top Fuel classes. Should the driver be {{rendered}} unable to perform the normal shutdown sequence {{at the conclusion of}} a run, a pair of redundant transmitters, placed 400 ft and 600 ft past the finish line, will signal an on-board receiver to automatically shut <b>off</b> <b>ignition</b> power and fuel to the engine and deploy the parachutes. The transmitters are designed and placed so as to avoid inadvertent triggering of the automated shutoffs. These transmitters and the receivers that are placed on all cars were designed by NHRA's Track Safety Committee and constructed by Electrimotion, and are a direct result of Kalitta's death.|$|R
50|$|When the {{ignition}} is first turned on, the ECU energizes a relay {{that runs the}} fuel pump {{for a short time}} to pressurize the fuel rail. Once the starter motor begins to turn the engine, the ECU gets a 12VDC signal that causes it to run the fuel pump again, and energize the fuel injectors. For the next several seconds, the injector pulse width is wider than normal to provide sufficient fuel for starting. Idle control is performed by adjusting a stepper-motor-driven bypass valve in the intake plenum. When the <b>ignition</b> is switched <b>off,</b> the ECU winds the bypass valve fully open to provide enough air the next time the engine is started.|$|R
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} is {{also referred to}} as 'after-run', or 'run-on' or sometimes dieseling, when it causes the engine to carry on running after the <b>ignition</b> is shut <b>off.</b> This effect is more readily achieved on carbureted gasoline engines, because the fuel supply to the carburetor is typically regulated by a passive mechanical float valve and fuel delivery can feasibly continue until fuel line pressure has been relieved, provided the fuel can be somehow drawn past the throttle plate. The occurrence is rare in modern engines with throttle-body or electronic fuel injection, because the injectors will not be permitted to continue delivering fuel after the engine is shut off, and any occurrence may indicate the presence of a leaking (failed) injector.|$|R

[...] Also, General Motors received a new grille for the final time in this generation of the Chevrolet Cavalier.1994 models were also carryovers, as a redesign of the Cavalier was in development. The VL trim was dropped on the wagon, while the 2.2 L OHV L4 was now converted to the SFI version found in the Corsica, which delivered an output of 120 horsepower. Additional changes included a slightly redesigned climate control interface and the power locking system being again redesigned: the doors would still lock automatically when put into gear, but they would also unlock automatically when the <b>ignition</b> was switched <b>off.</b>|$|R
5000|$|GPS tracking: The device {{fits into}} the vehicle and captures the GPS {{location}} information apart from other vehicle information at regular intervals to a central server. Other vehicle information can include fuel amount, engine temperature, altitude, reverse geocoding, door open/close, tire pressure, cut off fuel, turn <b>off</b> <b>ignition,</b> turn on headlight, turn on taillight, battery status, GSM area code/cell code decoded, number of GPS satellites in view, glass open/close, fuel amount, emergency button status, cumulative idling, computed odometer, engine RPM, throttle position, GPRS status and a lot more. Capability of these devices actually decide the final capability of the whole tracking system; most vehicle tracking systems, {{in addition to providing}} the vehicle's location data, feature a wide range of communication ports {{that can be used to}} integrate other on board systems, allowing to check their status and control or automate their operation.|$|R

50|$|An {{ignition}} interlock interrupts {{the signal}} from the ignition to the starter until a valid breath sample is provided that meets minimal alcohol guidelines in that state. At that point, the vehicle can be started as normal. At random times after the engine has been started, the IID will require another breath sample. The purpose {{of this is to}} prevent someone other than the driver from providing a breath sample. If the breath sample isn't provided, or the sample exceeds the ignition interlock's preset blood alcohol level, the device will log the event, warn the driver, and then start up an alarm (e.g., lights flashing, horn honking) until the <b>ignition</b> is turned <b>off,</b> or a clean breath sample has been provided. A common misconception is that interlock devices will simply turn off the engine if alcohol is detected; this would, however, create an unsafe driving situation and expose interlock manufacturers to considerable liability.|$|R
