40|$|The {{brominated}} {{flame retardant}} hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) was added to Annex A {{of the list of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of the Stockholm Convention. Thus, production and use of HBCDD will be banned, and the recycling of HBCDD-containing foam waste will be restricted. In reaction a special polymeric {{brominated flame retardant}} (PolyFR) was developed to replace HBCDD in <b>expanded</b> and extruded <b>polystyrene</b> foams for building and construction applications. A decision has to be made at some future time whether <b>expanded</b> and extruded <b>polystyrene</b> foam waste is to be subjected to incineration (with HBCDD) or to recycling (without HBCDD). Therefore, an appropriate and rapid field method is required to distinguish between foams containing HBCDD and foams free from HBCDD. Here we present a screening method for identifying HBCDD containing <b>expanded</b> and extruded <b>polystyrene</b> foams. The test principle is {{based on the fact that}} PolyFR (a brominated polymeric macromolecule) is not extractable whereas HBCDD (a low molecular weight substance) is extractable. Following rapid extraction of HBCDD the brominated flame retardant is identified and quantified via bromine analysis using a handheld X-ray fluorescence instrument. The method was applied successfully to 27 <b>expanded</b> and extruded <b>polystyrene</b> foam samples (foams and extruded polystyrene foam raw materials), which were provided without any information about the applied flame retardant. The presence of HBCDD was confirmed for all HBCDD-positive samples in the test. A robustness test revealed a high degree of correctness and a high repeatability for the test system: samples containing HBCDD and HBCDD-free samples were identified correctly with relative standard deviations of quantitative results below 14 %. Moreover, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy test results agree well with HBCDD determinations performed in a laboratory with a gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionisation detector...|$|R

Within 20 days after placing the panels into laboratory colonies, large numbers of adults moved from the media into the <b>polystyrene</b> <b>expanding</b> the tunnels. Concurrently, the number of late instar larvae recovered from the insulation declined. No oviposition occurred within the tunnels. Few middle instar larvae were present in the polystyrene. All lifestages of A. diaperinus invaded exposed fiberglass, but invading late instar larvae did not pupate successfully. Polystyrene seemed to be preferred by late instar larvae over polyurethane for pupation sites, but polyurethane was favored over polystyrene by ovipositing beetles. The insulative capacity of polystyrene was reduced as a result of lesser mealworm infestation. (Key words: Alphitobius diaperinus, darkling beetle, insulation, lesser mealworm...|$|R

Inorganic fibrous materials - stone and glass wool and organic foamy materials- <b>expanded</b> and extruded <b>polystyrene</b> are dominant on the European market. However, the EU priorities of creating products with improved ecological footprint have led towards research for developing new {{insulation materials}}. Evaluation {{of the performance of}} insulation materials is a multi-criteria problem, which has to be carried out with respect to: physical properties, health and environmental protection, applicability as building elements and their cost. Recycled textile waste has already found commercial application as insulation material but so far only waste that is easy to open down to fibers has been used. This paper proposes an alternative solution of a new textile structure that will be used for thermal insulation of buildings’ internal walls in order to prevent the loss of a valuable resource, pre-consumer apparel cutting waste. The designed textile structure is composed of polyester fabric apparel cutting waste which is shredded, rather than opened. Thermal conductivity - λ(W/mK) of the textile structure was measured with the Heat flow meter FOX 600 instrument. The main goal was to determine the thermal insulation of the structure compared to the standard insulation structures, as well as textile insulating structures in form of fibers. The results of the 10 samples showed thermal conductivity coefficient (λ= 0, 052 - 0, 060 W/mK), comparable to the values of standard insulation materials (λ= 0, 030 - 0, 045 W/mK) and the values of insulation materials made from recycled textile fibers (λ= 0, 039 - 0, 041 W/mK). In addition to the economic benefits, production of this kind of insulation material will have an ecologic benefit by decreasing environmental pollution arising from polyester apparel cutting waste. ...|$|R

Things that are {{difficult}} to put your finger on for very long are my focus. Sensations as obscure as the lump in the pit of your stomach or the itch {{in the back of your}} mind that turns sleep into a game, conditions that both stifle and propel an individual. These hazy passengers churn within, coating themselves with the residue of memories, concerns, desires and other intangible features of the body; waiting to be released from their internal home. 	Through the process and repetition of working, these arcane entities reveal themselves like overturned stones in a plowed field. I allow these unnamed sensations to influence my formal considerations and impact the psychological tone of my sculptures. In most instances, I reference forms of the natural world and ordinary objects, but then blur their identities causing them to flicker between something recognizable and something alien. This approach enables me to work with the essential qualities of that which is faceless and abstract residing within myself. 	Coupled with this direction is the motivation to employ conventional materials in an unconventional fashion. Materials that in their usual context are hidden from sight or intended to be ignored, are made visible and prominent. In this case, I am working exclusively with pink <b>polystyrene,</b> <b>expanding</b> foam, and white glue. Polystyrene foam is used as insulation in construction, lying buried, out of sight in the walls and ceilings of our homes. In most applications when operating in sculpture, it is covered with another material, creating mass and acting as an invisible core. Expanding foam has a similar existence, dwelling in cracks around industrial and domestic fixtures filling gaps and holes, not creating them. Likewise, white glue is commonly witnessed peering out from between the materials it holds in place and is rarely permitted to run and drip freely. Together these materials, which are typically relegated to the darkness of interior spaces, are utilized for their inherent aesthetic and structural qualities while establishing a metaphor. Just as these materials are most often found within something, so too is the situation of the content. The resulting objects become manifestations of a twofold honesty, being true to materials and to myself...|$|R

The developed fill material should of sufficiently low density and workable. Different mix proportions were tried out to get several suitable mixes. The developed material should be sufficiently incompressible and should possess adequate shear strength. Further detailed tests were conducted on selected mixes to establish their engineering characteristics in relation to strength and stiffness. The effectiveness of the use of lightweight fill material in the embankment construction was studied in detail by the finite element package CRISP. The set criterion was that the in-service settlement of the road should be less than 50 mm. This was achieved through the preloading process. In this study a comparison was done for two different approaches; one constructed with lateritic soil and the other incorporating the developed lightweight fills in the preloading process. The placement of the fill layers, the settlement of the peaty clay, the effect of the removal of the preload and the application of the pavement and traffic load was studied with a fully coupled Modified Cam clay constitutive model.

The second artefact was a patient customised medical radiation therapy head and neck support; the CAD model of which was created by scanning the back of the author's head and neck with a 3 D scanner. The sculpted support fitted the author perfectly. The implementation of the procedure in the two tests highlighted several points including the speed in which the whole process can be carried out. The time taken from the scanning of the authors head and neck with the 3 D scanner through to the physical sculpted artefact, was a mere 80 minutes; of which only 13 minutes was consumed in the actual setup and sculpting step! This is extremely quick when compared to conventional rapid prototyping systems and CNC milling.
