5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Compton scattering by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light {{was composed of}} photons, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and John C. Slater, an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory (BKS). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation {{on the basis of}} the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.|$|E

25|$|In one {{recorded}} {{fall from}} grace he succumbed to the temptation of a 'lady of the camellias'. The writer, Maximo Viola, a friend of Rizal's, was alluding to Dumas's 1848 novel, La dame aux camelias, {{about a man who}} {{fell in love with a}} courtesan. While the affair was on record, there was no account in Viola's letter whether it was more than one-night and if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> business transaction than an amorous affair.|$|E
25|$|Green dealt {{only with}} the plan for invasion, as no details on any subjugation of the {{population}} and eventual conquest of the entire island were included. Among the Irish population, however, there was an element of support for the Third Reich due to resentment of British rule. Sketchiness with regards to the plan has contributed to an assessment that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> diversionary attack than actual attempt to take over the island, although once committed it may have been hard for the German forces to withdraw.|$|E
50|$|Minn of the Mississippi is an {{illustrated}} children's book by Holling C. Holling. Though short, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> novel than a picture book. First published in 1951, it received the Newbery Honor award the next year.|$|R

25|$|One theory {{holds that}} the battle of Lochaber was a {{defining}} moment in {{the early history of}} the Clan Cameron, at that time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> confederation than a homogenous clan and the MacMartins' defection reflected this. In this view of history, the MacMartins were punished for their treachery by the Camerons of Lochiel, such that the MacMartin chiefs were driven into exile and the Lochiel faction took control of the clan. Donald Dubh appears to have supported James in his defeat at the Battle of Inverlochy in 1431 and the Cameron lands were ravaged afterwards. When Alexander was released, he took further vengeance on the clan he viewed as traitors, driving Donald Dubh into exile and giving the Cameron lands in Lochiel to John Garve Maclean of Coll.|$|E
25|$|Many other trails {{followed}} the Oregon Trail {{for much of}} its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of California; and the Bozeman Trail to Montana. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> network of trails than a single trail, there were numerous variations with other trails eventually established {{on both sides of}} the Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may be between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.|$|E
25|$|In August 2002, the General Assembly of the WPA {{was held}} during the WPA World Congress in Yokohama. The issue of Chinese {{political}} abuse of psychiatry {{was placed on}} the agenda of the General Assembly, and a decision was made to send an investigative mission to China. The visit was projected for the spring of 2003, in order to assure that a representative of the WPA could present a report during the Annual Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in May 2003, {{as well as at the}} annual meeting of the British Royal College of Psychiatrists in June and July of that year. The 2003 investigative mission never took place, and when the WPA did organize a visit to China, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> scientific exchange. In the meantime, the political abuse of psychiatry persists unabated.|$|E
50|$|Colbertism is an {{economic}} and political doctrine of the 17th century, created by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the French minister of finance under Louis XIV.

25|$|A {{number of}} other Christian churches also make a similar claim: the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Assyrian Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. In the Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years {{following}} the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431) and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451), respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils' Christological definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the East–West Schism, traditionally dated to the year 1054, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> gradual process than a sudden break. The Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church, not directly from the Orthodox Church, {{for the first time in}} the 1530s (and, after a brief reunion in 1555, again finally in 1558). Thus, though it was united to Orthodoxy when established through the work of Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the early 7th century, its separation from Orthodoxy came about indirectly through the See of Rome.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I just saw the man coming towards me and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> case of getting myself {{out of the way}} or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E

[...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E

500|$|The Bradmans {{lived in}} the same modest, {{suburban}} house in Holden Street, Kensington Park in Adelaide for all but {{the first three years of}} their married life. They experienced personal tragedy in raising their children: their first-born son died as an infant in 1936, their second son, John (born in 1939) contracted polio, and their daughter, Shirley, born in 1941, had cerebral palsy from birth. His family name proved a burden for John Bradman; he legally changed his last name to Bradsen in 1972. Although claims were made that he became estranged from his father, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> matter of [...] "the pair inhabit different worlds". After the cricketer's death, a collection of personal letters written by Bradman to his close friend Rohan Rivett between 1953 and 1977 was released and gave researchers new insights into Bradman's family life, including the strain between father and son.|$|E
500|$|Russell Lissack and Kele Okereke {{first met}} in 1998 in London. Lissack had {{attended}} Bancroft's School, while Okereke attended Ilford County High School, then Trinity Catholic High School, Woodford Green for sixth form. They bumped {{into each other}} again in 1999 at Reading Festival and decided to form a band. Bassist Gordon Moakes joined after answering an advert in NME, and drummer Matt Tong joined after an audition. After going {{through a variety of}} names, such as Union, The Angel Range, and Diet, the band settled on Bloc Party in September 2003, a play on block party. The band has said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Québécois. However, Moakes said on the group's official Internet forum that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> merging of the eastern [...] "Blocs" [...] and the western [...] "parties", in the political sense. He also notes that the name was not explicitly driven by politics, but rather it [...] "looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter {{was not a}} holy man, {{although}} he was, as John Gillingham, a historian and biographer of Richard I, says, [...] "one of the most outstanding government ministers in English History". Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later canonised, {{is said to have}} asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter as often as he probably should have. Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was {{the driving force behind the}} administrative changes during Richard's reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard's brother John, and it was during John's reign that a number of Walter's administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John's interest in government and administration.|$|E

500|$|When the {{painting}} was unveiled in 1953, most Chinese critics were enthusiastic. [...] Xu Beihong, the president of CAFA and a pioneer in using realism in oil painting, admired {{the manner in which}} the work fulfilled its political mission, but complained that because of the colors, it barely resembled an oil painting. [...] He and others, though, saw that {{the painting}} opened a new chapter in Chinese art development. [...] Zhu Dan, head of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which would reproduce the painting for the masses, argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> poster than an oil painting. [...] Other artists stated that Dong's earlier works, such as Kazakh Shepherdess (1947) and Liberation (1949), were better examples of the new national style of art. [...] The painting appeared on the front page of People's Daily in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration. [...] One English-language magazine published by the Chinese government for distribution abroad showed a model family in a modern apartment, with a large poster of The Founding of the Nation on the wall. [...] According to Chang-Tai Hung, the painting [...] "became a celebrated propaganda piece".|$|E
500|$|Kubica {{clinched}} the first pole position {{of his career}} {{with a time of}} 1:33.096. Massa qualified less than 0.03seconds behind the BMW and joined Kubica on the front row of the grid. Hamilton took third place, using his team's spare chassis; Räikkönen was next quickest, and despite being critical of his car's set-up was confident in its racing ability. Kovalainen would line up fifth on the grid alongside Heidfeld, who had trouble maximising performance from his tyres. Trulli took seventh place, ahead of Rosberg and Honda driver Jenson Button. Renault driver Fernando Alonso was the last driver to make the third session; Webber missed out on the top ten by 0.009seconds and would start the race in 11th position. Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello took 12th place after a gearbox problem interrupted his second session laps, ahead of Timo Glock of Toyota, Nelson Piquet of Renault and Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais. Nakajima was the slowest of the second session drivers, and took 16th. Coulthard qualified 17th, ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella of Force India. Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel took 19th, and blamed his set-up: [...] "I felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>a</b> case of the car driving me than me driving the car." [...] Fisichella's teammate Adrian Sutil qualified 20th, ahead of Anthony Davidson of Super Aguri. Davidson's teammate Takuma Sato spun out and crashed into the barriers. Sato's accident damaged his rear wing and suspension and left him unable to continue in the session.|$|E
