5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Law {{first came}} to Yonkers due to him {{marketing}} {{the products of the}} Alexander Smith & Sons Carpet Company in Yonkers for the manufacture of moquette carpets. Walter Law increased the business of Sloane's wholesale department by securing their account; he eventually became a stockholder and member of the Yonkers company's board of directors. Law and his wife moved to Hillcrest, at 354 Palisade Avenue in Yonkers, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> service the Smith account. He later became a vice president of W. & J. Sloane, and also joined its Board of Directors.|$|E

5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him {{not to make a}} decision until after this was over.|$|E
25|$|Reinhart played minor hockey in West Vancouver, British Columbia, {{where his}} father Paul, a former National Hockey League (NHL) player, settled {{following}} his career. Max viewed his father as the greatest influence on his development as a player, and found that being {{the son of a}} former NHL player made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be noticed by scouts. He was drafted into the Western Hockey League (WHL) by the Kootenay Ice with their fourth round selection, 86th overall, at the 2007 WHL Bantam Draft.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E

500|$|He {{was born}} in Lambeth, south London. Myrie-Williams and {{his family moved to}} Bristol at the age of 14 {{in order to make it}} <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play at Bristol City's Academy. He states that the biggest {{influence}} in his life is his mother, as well as saying that former Bristol City manager Gary Johnson [...] "really looked after him" [...] during his time at the club. He has always wanted to play professional football, and stated that he never considered any other career path. He supports Manchester United, and [...] "loves watching the way they play", in particular the club's treble winning team during the 1998–99 campaign. He has a daughter, born in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Simon the Sorcerer, was {{released}} on floppy disk in 1993 for the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles. It was re-released in 1994 for the Amiga CD32, featuring an enhanced soundtrack. It was also released on PC CD-ROM, featuring Chris Barrie {{as the voice of}} Simon. Simon Woodroffe stated that he had Barrie in mind when writing the scripts, and that it was <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so when thinking of an actor he knew speaking the lines. It cost around £3000 per day to hire Barrie. Woodroffe said that there was [...] "no hesitation" [...] in doing a talkie version, and that it was [...] "the next big thing". Simon the Sorcerer used the visual and interface designs from LucasArts' games, and Woodroffe stated that this was because they had set a standard, and that Adventure Soft's focus was humour and story-telling.|$|E
500|$|Kogen {{commented that}} Lisa and Marge episodes [...] "tend {{to be the}} better episodes", {{because they are more}} {{thought-out}} and have more emotional depth to them. However, they are harder to write than other episodes because they are [...] "less jokey." [...] The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge's role with Homer, who tends to be funnier than Marge. Jean commented that because he has a daughter, Homer–Lisa episodes are <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write and he [...] "always want to work on them." [...] Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct, because [...] "the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [...] That was always interesting." [...] In one scene, Homer makes Lisa sit {{on the end of the}} sofa so that she will not interrupt the game. Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa, recalls that many people at the table-read thought Homer was [...] "too harsh" [...] in the scene, but it ended up being included in the episode anyway.|$|E

500|$|Roberts joined Yeovil Town on loan, {{initially}} for {{a four-month}} spell, in August 2008. After impressing during his loan spell at Huish Park, Roberts completed a permanent transfer to Yeovil for a nominal fee on 31 October 2008, with the deal officially going through on 1 January 2009. Roberts played 34 games for Yeovil during the 2008–09 season, scoring two goals. In his final game for Yeovil against Cheltenham Town he was sent-off. His girlfriend {{left him in}} May 2009, and Roberts was forced to move back in with his parents in Chester. On 5 August 2009, Roberts was suspended by Yeovil Town for a breach of club discipline and was released by mutual consent after reported drink and gambling problems, the final straw coming when he [...] "turned up at a club-organised family fun day with the stench of alcohol on his breath". He later admitted his heart {{was not at the}} club, and that being alone in a hotel room away from his girlfriend and young son made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> turn to alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|That same year, he {{fell out}} of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him {{effectively}} ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as [...] "a fortunate event" [...] and cited it {{as a factor in}} making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure {{he was going to be}} promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get into college.|$|E
60|$|Charlie looked rather abashed for a moment, but {{his natural}} lightheartedness made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{get the better}} of his own brief fits of waywardness and put others in good humor with him and themselves.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} in December 2010 that Anderson wanted to adapt Inherent Vice; at the time, {{he had been}} writing a treatment and started on a script after The Master had been shelved indefinitely months prior. Anderson originally adapted the entire 384-page novel sentence by sentence which made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> cut down the script than the novel. By February 2011, Anderson had written a first draft and was more than halfway done with a second draft. The first draft was written without a narrator but the character of Sortilège was later turned into {{the voice of the}} narrator. In September 2012, Anderson stated that he was still writing the script but was hoping he could get [...] Inherent Vice into production and have a few years of being more productive.|$|E
2500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Rose design was that the turret was not fully enclosed. Previous designs had perspex around the gun position, but in the Rose turret there was no {{protective}} shielding immediately {{in front of the}} gunner. This feature reflected operational experience: many Lancaster gunners had cut away parts of their turret perspex in order to obtain a better view, a practice that had originated at RAF Gransden Lodge, and which was subsequently known as the [...] "Gransden Lodge modification". Testing of the Rose turret found that the open design reduced the temperature in the turret – which was typically very low – by only four degrees Celsius compared with a closed design. As well as improving the gunner's view, this feature also made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> bail out of the aircraft in an emergency.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 20, {{he joined}} David Lee Roth's band to work on Roth's album A Little Ain't Enough, {{replacing}} Steve Vai, who had joined Whitesnake. In 1990 Becker won the coveted Best New Guitarist award from Guitar Magazine. [...] While preparing for the album, Becker began to feel {{what he called a}} [...] "lazy limp" [...] in his left leg. He was soon diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's Disease) and was given three to five years to live. He finished the recording using lighter (thinner) gauge [...] guitar strings and other techniques, which made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play with his weakening hands. Although he managed to finish the album, which was released in 1991, he did not join the supporting tour due to his inability to perform on stage; former Lizzy Borden guitarist Joe Holmes took Becker's place on tour.|$|E
6000|$|My friends, we see God doing thus {{in these}} very days by great nations, by great {{branches}} of industry. Look at the American war, {{look at the}} Manchester cotton famine, and see how God can confound the strong and cunning, and blind their eyes to the ruin which is coming till it is come in all its might. And then think, If it be so <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> confound such as them, is it less <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> confound you and me, if we begin to fancy {{that we can do}} without him, and ask, 'Doth God perceive it? Or is there knowledge in the Most High? We are they that ought to speak. Who is Lord over us?' ...|$|R
60|$|A noose {{was made}} {{at the end of}} a rope, and this was thrown over the animal's neck. Then the horse got one foot through the noose, and in this fashion they towed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a spot where it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> wade out without assistance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "The man's {{not quite}} so bad as that. We've been useful <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> We've done exactly what he asked. The other matter's dead and buried. We don't want his money, but it is {{perfectly}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help us make a little." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} after his arrest, Moskvin explained {{that as an}} expert on Celtic culture, he had learned that the ancient Druids slept on graves in order to communicate with spirits of their dead. He also studied {{the culture of the}} peoples of Siberia, in particular, the culture of the ancient Yakuts, and discovered they had a similar practice for communicating with the dead. Moskvin began searching for obituaries of recently dead children. When he found an obituary that [...] "spoke" [...] to him, he would sleep on her grave in order to determine if the child's spirit wished to be brought back to life. Moskvin claimed he had been doing this for around twenty years and insisted that when he began, he never dug up a grave without the permission of the child within. As he grew older, it became physically painful for him to sleep on the graves, so he began bringing the bodies home where it would be more comfortable to sleep near them. He hoped the spirits would be more willing to speak in a safe, welcoming home and that they might be <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hear when they were no longer underground.|$|E
2500|$|One {{well known}} idea of his, expounded on in Michtav me-Eliyahu, is the Nekudas Habechira (point of free will). He states {{that a man}} has one point in his service to G-d where he has to fight his evil inclination, while at other points {{there will be no}} struggle, for the levels below his Nekudas Habechira have already been conquered, and he will easily win those battles of will; whereas levels higher than his Nekudas Habechira are not yet within his grasp. (For example, someone who adheres to Orthodox Judaism will have no problem keeping kosher, but may {{sometimes}} be tempted to rely on unreliable kosher supervision, while somebody farther away from religious practice will have to struggle with whether to eat a ham sandwich (which is non-kosher regardless of supervision).) Each time one defeats the evil inclination by choosing to do good over evil, his Nekudas Habechira is raised a bit higher, and that choice will be <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make in the future. [...] Consequently, Man's task in life is to consistently raise his Nekudas Habechira, thus growing ever greater in his service of God.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{the crew}} cannot {{get around the}} {{creation}} of a new set, or traveling to a remote location to film scenes for an episode. For instance, the Luthor mansion set was expanded this season. The production crew first began by expanding the second level in Lex’s office, and then exposed the staircase leading up to the second level – it had originally been hidden by a wall. They also added a skylight and inserted lights in the background, giving the room a larger appearance. For scenes in [...] "Legacy" [...] that involved Dr. Swann, the crew traveled with Christopher Reeve to the New York Public Library to film, which was <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> journey to. Reeve’s schedule forced the production crew to shoot his scenes a month before the script for the episode was finalized. In season two, the crew was able to use the set of NBC's Third Watch, courtesy of John Wells, to film Reeve’s scenes. The opening segment for [...] "Truth" [...] where Chloe questions a former co-worker of her father’s about why her father was blacklisted by Lionel Luthor, had to be filmed over two nights; the crew ran out of time the first night because of the weather, so they filmed Mack’s scenes in front of the studio.|$|E
5000|$|The song is a {{story of}} a son who finds a box his father kept full of {{memories}} of his family. As the son goes through the box, he is reminded that his father loved his family but it wasn't <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> say [...] "I love you".|$|R
60|$|Jonas, in this way, made {{a kind of}} {{a trench}} all along the side of Rollo’s ground; and he told Rollo to be careful to throw every spadeful well forward, so as to keep the trench open and free, and then it would be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dig.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon," [...] {{said the}} other, sententiously, [...] "for it's Johnson's {{knowledge}} {{of the country and}} the hoss-stealers that are in with Bob's gang of road agents that made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> buy up and win over Bob's friends here, so that they'd help to trap him." ...|$|R
