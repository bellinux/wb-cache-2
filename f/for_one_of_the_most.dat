5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E

Very destructive winds with gusts to 260km/h near the cyclone's centre were expected. Residents of coastal towns were warned to expect dangerous storm tides– local emergency officials said an 8metre (26ft) high tide was expected at that night. Tourists in the area were warned {{not to try to}} reach Broome. Chevron Australia said a tanker due to arrive on 18 April was asked to delay its arrival till 22 April because of the cyclone. Iron ore miners in Port Hedland and Dampier monitored Rosita's approach.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings {{and some of its}} estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon as he took over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.|$|E

Notably, Li not only qualified, but she won her qualifying event by seven strokes at Old Course at Half Moon Bay Golf Links. Thompson missed the cut in 2007 with a 36-hole 168 total. Li was the second-youngest to compete; nine years prior to the introduction of qualification in 1976, Beverly Klass played in the 1967 Open at age 10 years, 7 months, and 21 days. Although Li's qualification was largely heralded, some were befuddled at the state of the sport when a sixth grader could even qualify <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prestigious events of the year.

25|$|In the Bronze and Iron Ages, {{people used}} peat bogs for rituals to nature gods and spirits.

Peat wetlands also used to have a degree of metallurgical importance, being during the Dark Ages the primary source of bog iron that was used to create swords and armour for Vikings. Many peat swamps along the coast of Malaysia serve as a natural means of flood mitigation, with any overflow being absorbed by the peat, provided forests are still present to prevent peat fires.|$|E
