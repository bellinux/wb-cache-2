5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Sunday-morning deliveries.

40|$|The Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) {{problem on}} finite undirected graphs with vertex weights {{asks for a}} set of {{pairwise}} nonadjacent vertices of maximum weight sum. MWIS {{is one of the most}} investigated and most important algorithmic graph problems; it is well known to be NP-complete, and it remains NP-complete even under various strong restrictions such as for triangle-free graphs. Its complexity was an open problem for P_k-free graphs, k > 5. Recently, Lokshtanov, Vatshelle, and Villanger proved that MWIS can be solved <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>for</b> P_ 5 -free graphs, and Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, and van Leeuwen proved that MWIS can be solved <b>in</b> quasi-polynomial <b>time</b> <b>for</b> P_ 6 -free graphs. It still remains an open problem whether MWIS can be solved <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>for</b> P_k-free graphs, k ≥ 6 or <b>in</b> quasi-polynomial <b>time</b> <b>for</b> P_k-free graphs, k ≥ 7. Some characterizations of P_k-free graphs and some progress are known in the literature but so far did not solve the problem. In this paper, we show that MWIS can be solved <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>for</b> (P_ 7,triangle) -free graphs. This extends the corresponding result for (P_ 6,triangle) -free graphs and may provide some progress in the study of MWIS for P_ 7 -free graphs...|$|R
