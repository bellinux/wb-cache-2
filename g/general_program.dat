40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} unified view of logic programs, {{characterized}} by van Emden and Kowalski, {{in terms of}} semantics, syntactics, and fixpoints into the context of <b>general</b> <b>programs.</b> We first propose a general model semantics which is {{a natural extension of}} the Herbrand model semantics. We have shown that any program has a unique least model. Then we show that the least model of a program is precisely the set of all minimally derived disjunctive facts from the program and reveal the relationship between semantics and syntactics of <b>general</b> <b>programs.</b> Finally we show that the least model of a program can also be characterized by the least fixpoint of the natural operator associated with <b>general</b> <b>programs.</b> Our unified view of <b>general</b> <b>programs</b> enhances the theoretical foundation of logic programming and deductive databases. 1 Introduction There is currently considerable interest in knowledge and deductive database systems that are based on logic programming.

[...] Deng had studied Marxism in the Soviet Union, unlike Mao who never studied Marxism in depth before the 1930s, in the 1920s at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, enrolling in a course on historical materialism and Marxist economics. Like Mao, Deng never referenced Marxism when articulating new policies, however, the few times the pair did, Deng displayed a more advanced grasp of Marxism than Mao ever did.

2500|$|In 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, {{embarked}} on a <b>general</b> <b>program</b> of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic. Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew. However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine. His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky {{to the field of}} theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject. Chomsky's B.A. honors thesis was titled [...] "Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew", and involved his applying Harris's methods to the language. Chomsky revised this thesis for his M.A., which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book. He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher Nelson Goodman.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] {{was added}} to the <b>General</b> <b>Program</b> of the party's {{constitution}} at the 12th National Congress, without a definition of the term. At the 13th National Congress, held in 1987, Zhao Ziyang, the CPC General Secretary, claimed that socialism with Chinese characteristics was the [...] "integration of the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the modernization drive in China" [...] and was [...] "scientific socialism rooted in the realities of present-day China". By this time the CPC believed that China was in the primary stage of socialism, and therefore needed market relations to develop into a socialist society. Two years earlier, Su had tried to internationalize the term [...] "primary stage of socialism" [...] by claiming that socialism contained three different production phases. China was currently in the first phase, while the Soviet Union and the remaining Eastern Bloc countries were in the second phase. Because China was in the primary stage of socialism, Zhao argued that in [...] " [...] {{for a long time to}} come, we shall develop various sectors of the economy, always ensuring the dominant position of the public sector". Further, some individuals should be allowed to become rich [...] "before the objective of common prosperity [...] is achieved". Lastly, during the primary stage of socialism, planning would no longer be the primary means of organization of the economy. Upon hearing this remark, Chen Yun, a cautious reformer and the second-most powerful politician in China, walked out of the meeting.|$|E

For <b>general</b> logic <b>programs,</b> i. e. programs whose clauses may contain negative literals in their body, parallel semantics have been developed using three-valued logic and a new immediate consequence function Φ. However, over Herbrand models this semantics is not in general computable. A computable subclass is introduced in this paper, termed the canonical <b>general</b> <b>programs.</b> Our main result is to show, constructively, that thislatter class is in some sense representative of all <b>general</b> logic <b>programs,</b> thus extending to <b>general</b> logic <b>programs</b> a result proven recently by Jaffar and Stuckey {{for positive}} logic programs. The new result is obtained by providing a transformation which, given any <b>general</b> logic <b>program</b> GP, produces a canonical <b>general</b> logic <b>program</b> CGP “semantically equivalent” to GP {{in the sense that it}} has the same success set and finite failure set.
