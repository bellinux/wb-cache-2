50|$|In theory {{smartphones}} have {{an advantage}} over hard drives since the OS files are in ROM, and cannot be changed by malware. However, in some systems <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to circumvent this: in the Symbian OS <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to overwrite a file with a file of the same name. On the Windows OS, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to change a pointer from a general configuration file to an editable file.|$|R
60|$|Of the {{contention}} of feeling that ran high in Mr. Nicholson's starched bosom, no outward sign was visible; {{nor did he}} delay long {{to make a choice}} of conduct. Yet in that interval he had reviewed a great field of possibilities both past and future: whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> he had not been perfectly wise in his treatment of John; whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> that John <b>was</b> innocent; whether, if he turned John out a second time, as his outraged authority suggested, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to avoid a scandal; and whether, if he went to that extremity, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> that Alexander might rebel.|$|R

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|In this respect, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> {{to analyse}} Wagiman's vowel {{inventory}} as historically deriving from a three-vowel system common among the languages from further south, {{but with the}} phonetic influence of a typically northern five-vowel system.|$|E

In 2008 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to manipulate the Nokia firmware before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> installed, and in fact in some downloadable versions of <b>it,</b> this file <b>was</b> human readable, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to modify and change the image of the firmware.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that {{settlements}} {{have existed}} {{in the area around}} Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, scrapers and the remains of cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963–64. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence of a settlement here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names.|$|E
