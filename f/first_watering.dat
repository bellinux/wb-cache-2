5000|$|The {{name of this}} {{watering}} place on the eastern route of El Camino Viejo comes from the lone Cottonwood tree at that arid site that had its lower branches cut off to feed draft animals or provide wood for fires, sometime before the Americans came to California. Alamo Mocho was the <b>first</b> <b>watering</b> place beyond Alamo Solo Spring on the eastern route that then passed {{to the east and}} followed the shore of Tulare Lake, proceeding northward across the Kings River to settlements on the Fresno Slough and San Joaquin River before it turned back to rejoin the main route at Arroyo de Panoche Grande. When Frank F. Latta visited the site the early 1930s the cottonwood that had stood at the location was gone, the waterhole that was within 100 yards of the Hanford - Paso Robles Road was dried up, and a ranch had been established close by. [...] Its location appears on a 1914 USGS Topographic map of Lost Hills where the site of the ranch house is indicated near the old highway within the Avenal Gap.|$|E
30|$|Thirty-five {{days after}} <b>first</b> <b>{{watering}},</b> a second watering event took place. As shown in Fig.  4 a, {{a new set}} of temperature peaks was observed, but those peaks did not reach previous levels. This result might be a consequence of NH 4 + depletion because no new urine or manure was added in this experiment. That NH 4 + depletion might result in low nitrification activity in the manure, which would decrease denitrification; therefore, those small temperature peaks might be result of inhibited microorganism activity. Because the N inputs as urine and manure on a pen surface can be considered inexhaustible in an open-lot beef cattle feedlot, it might be suggested that large emission peaks of GHGs are emitted after each rainfall event on dry soil/manure surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{increases}} in nitrogen deposition impact ecosystems globally. Projected atmospheric warming allows rain to fall in larger events with longer dry periods in between, increasing rainfall variability in many regions. Concurrently, the combustion of fossil fuels and the heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers continue to increase the availability of nitrogen globally. However, not much is known about how these global change factors, increased rainfall variability and nitrogen deposition, {{interact with each other}} to affect ecosystem functions, particularly belowground where root production contributes to soil carbon pools- an important component in regulating climate. In order to study these factors, we used partial rainout shelters and a nitrogen fertilizer in a tallgrass prairie dominated by Schizachyrium scoparium, a C 4 grass, and Solidago canadensis, a rhizomatous C 3 forb. We simulated increased rainfall variability by equalizing cumulative rainfall across sheltered and unsheltered plots every 30 days. Slow-release urea was applied after the <b>first</b> <b>watering</b> event to experimentally increase nitrogen availability. Root density was determined by taking two 70 cm soil cores from each plot. We found increased precipitation variability shifted belowground biomass to shallower depths, while increasing nitrogen availabilit...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida are Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) {{that can}} produce growth hormone. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to know the effects of those two combined species of PGPR on seedling root growth of Jatropha curcas. The condition of the seedling root determines the success of dry land cultivation. The root which has wider coverage, is larger in number, and is bigger in diameter makes seedling more resistant to stress in dry land environment. In the experiment, two kinds of plant materials are used for seedling, the Jatropha seed and stem material, which are treated in a mixed culture of PGPR. For the Jatropha seed, this mixed culture of PGPR is given at the same time of cultivating the sprout on the seedling medium. For the stem cutting, the PGPR is poured in together during the <b>first</b> <b>watering</b> of the seedling cultivation medium. In the fourthweek, the observed growth parameters are root length, root diameter, primary and secondary lateral root numbers, Root Length Density (RLD), Frequency of Lateral Root (FLR), and Specific Root Length (SRL). These data are analyzed using analysis of variant with DMRT test at 0. 05 level of significance. The result of this study shows that PGPR tend to reduce FLR values on the seedling root made from seeds. On the seedling root made from stem cutting, PGPR increase the root length, primary and secondary lateral root numbers, root diameter, FLR and SRL values as well...|$|E
40|$|More severe summer {{droughts}} are predicted for mid-latitudes in Europe. To {{evaluate the}} impact on forest ecosystems and more specifically on forest regeneration, we studied the response to summer drought in oak seedlings (Quercus petraea). Acorns were collected from different mother trees in three stands in Belgium, sown in pots and grown in non-heated greenhouse conditions. We imposed drought on the seedlings in early summer by <b>first</b> <b>watering</b> the pots to saturation and then stopping any watering. Weight of the pots and stomatal conductance were regularly measured. Re-watering followed this drought period of 5 weeks. Height of the seedlings and apical bud development were observed. Stomatal resistance increased {{toward the end of}} the experiment in the drought-treated group and was restored after re-watering. The seedlings from the drought treatment displayed a higher probability to produce additional shoot growth after re-watering (p <= 0. 05). A higher competition for water (two plants per pot) increased this chance. Although this chance was also higher for smaller seedlings, the actual length of the extra growth after re-watering was higher for larger seedlings (p <= 0. 01). Both in the drought-treated and in the control group the autochthonous provenance growing on a xeric site produced less extra shoots compared to the two other provenances. Finally, stressed plants showed less developed apical buds compared to the control group after re-watering, suggesting a phenological effect on the growth cycle of oaks (p <= 0. 0001). The higher chance for an extra shoot growth after the drought period can be considered as a compensation for the induced growth arrest during the drought period...|$|E

40|$|Deficit {{irrigation}} scheduling is used {{to increase}} the efficiency with which water is used in many crops including tomato, however a water deficit is predicted to favour phloem feeding insects. We tested if and how different cultivars of tomato grown under water deficit conditions affect the population growth of the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. Three tomato cultivars (Scintilla, Beefmaster and Rio Grande) were used in the experiments. The results for three watering regimes were compared with those of a control, which was well watered every three days: stressed plants received one third of the water supplied to the control over each three-day interval (experiment 1); stressed plants received a gradually decreasing amount of water (100 % at the <b>first</b> <b>watering</b> and then 80 %, 60 %, 50 %, 40 % and 20 %) every three days (experiment 2); stressed plants received the same amount of water as the control but at longer intervals, that is when evident signs of wilting appeared (experiment 3). The results showed that water stress either enhanced, had an adverse effect or had no effect on aphid population growth, depending on the cultivar and watering regime. No difference was recorded in the population dynamics of M. euphorbiae feeding on Beefmaster tomato plants subjected to different levels of water stress. In the case of the cultivar Scintilla, live aphids were less abundant on stressed plants than on well watered ones in experiment 1 and 3 but not in experiment 2. The highest variability in aphid population dynamics on the plants grown under the different water stress protocols was recorded on the cultivar Rio Grande. In experiment 1, the initial peak in aphid numbers was higher on the water stressed plants than on the control and then decreased to lower numbers than on the control. In experiment 2, there were no differences in the numbers of aphids infesting stressed and control plants. In experiment 3, there were fewer aphids on stressed than on control plants after six days, as in experiment 1, but there was no initial peak in aphid numbers...|$|E
