5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E

40|$|Many {{theorists have}} {{proposed}} {{that we can use}} <b>the</b> principle of <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> defeat <b>the</b> inductive sceptic. But any such theorist must confront the objection that different ways of applying the principle of <b>indifference</b> lead <b>to</b> incompatible probability assign-ments. Huemer ([2009]) offers the explanatory priority proviso as a strategy for over-coming this objection. With this proposal, Huemer claims that we can defend induction {{in a way that is}} not question-begging against the sceptic. But in this article, I argue that the opposite is true: if anything, Huemer’s use of the principle of indifference supports the rationality of inductive scepticism...|$|R

Fearing that the agent will alert the world to their existence, he initiates plans for a war economy and decides to question Silvia in her hospital room. Their dialogue reveals the story of his escape during the collapse of governments and the establishment of the microstate. He was damaged and in transport for repairs when the anarchist revolution began 200 years prior, allowing him to survive in hiding. Enraged by his calm <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prospect of war, Silvia attacks him and attempts her escape, but is restrained by guards.|$|E
25|$|Misconduct means a wrongful, improper, or {{unlawful}} conduct motivated by premeditated or intentional purpose or by obstinate <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consequences of one's acts.

25|$|The <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{plight of}} another is however {{the focus of}} a late play Catastrophe, where a {{director}} and his assistant are rehearsing the final preparation of an icon of suffering, the icon in question being a man standing silently on a plinth before them. Krapp and Croker share some similarities: both have failed literary aspirations, failed love lives and suffer ill health. Both are alone and approaching death.|$|E

Also, they have been against the mandatory indoctrination in schools and universities, which have now been abolished in a piecemeal fashion beginning in the late 1990s. However, there is little fundamental hostility <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substantive principles themselves. In these circles, attitudes toward the Three Principles of the People span <b>the</b> spectrum from <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> reinterpreting <b>the</b> Three Principles of the People in a local Taiwanese context rather than in a pan-Chinese one.|$|R

The details of Fyodor's two marriages as well as his <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upbringing of his three children is chronicled. The narrator also establishes the widely varying personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led to their return to Fyodor's town. The first book concludes by describing the mysterious religious order of Elders to which Alyosha has become devoted.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} women in Juárez have {{attracted}} global attention since 1993 given suspected police and government inaction to prevent the murders and bring perpetrators to justice. There have been several international rulings against Mexico for its inadequate response to the increasing violence against women.

25|$|Powell's {{ambition}} to be Viceroy of India crumbled in February 1947, when Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that Indian independence was imminent. Powell was so {{shocked by the}} change of policy that he spent the whole night after it was announced walking the streets of London. He came {{to terms with it}} by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Suez crisis, his contempt for the Commonwealth and his urging that Britain should end any remaining pretence that it was a world power.|$|E

At the time, Sundays in rural areas were spent working in the fields, or dancing and drinking in taverns. Vianney spent time in the confessional and gave homilies against blasphemy and paganic dancing. If his parishioners did not give up this dancing, he refused them absolution.|$|R

25|$|Semenov was a Transbaikalian Cossack – {{dark and}} thickset, {{and of the}} rather alert Mongolian type. His {{intelligence}} was of a specifically Cossack calibre, {{and he was an}} exemplary soldier, especially courageous when under the eye of his superior. He knew how to make himself popular with Cossacks and officers alike, but he had his weaknesses in a love of intrigue and <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> means by which he achieved his ends. Though capable and ingenious, he had received no education, and his outlook was narrow. I {{have never been able to}} understand how he came to play a leading role.|$|E
25|$|While fascism {{accepted}} {{the importance of}} material wealth and power, it condemned materialism which identified as being present in both communism and capitalism and criticized materialism for lacking acknowledgement {{of the role of}} the spirit. In particular, fascists criticized capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor support of private property, which fascists supported—but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence and alleged <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation. Fascism denounced Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity, which fascists regarded as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of the nation and a threat to the achievement of genuine national solidarity.|$|E
25|$|The Pale of Settlement was the Western {{region of}} Imperial Russia to which Jews were {{restricted}} by the Tsarist Ukase of 1792. It {{consisted of the}} territories of former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, annexed with the existing numerous Jewish population, and the Crimea (which was later cut out from the Pale). During 1881-1884, 1903–1906 and 1914–1921, waves of antisemitic pogroms swept Russian Jewish communities. At least some pogroms {{are believed to have}} been organized or supported by the Russian Okhrana. Although there is no hard evidence for this, the Russian police and army generally displayed <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pogroms, for instance during the three-day First Kishinev pogrom of 1903.|$|E
40|$|This essay explores {{religious}} indifference as {{an example}} of that which stands beyond the scope of social scientific knowledge production. In turn, it uses religious <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> consider <b>the</b> social scientist’s role in constituting the religion-related field. The literary character Bartleby and the ethnographic character Gino provide two case studies for examining particular types of religious indifference that cannot be known <b>to</b> <b>the</b> researcher. As fictions, they offer a way to explore that which would otherwise remain illegible, and they serve as humbling reminders of the inescapable limits of inquiry. <b>To</b> better understand <b>the</b> role that researchers play in constituting the religion-related field, this essay relies on other ethnographic examples to compare differing notions of “entanglement” and their implications for the study of nonbelievers and the nonreligious. The essay concludes by offering researchers a choice: <b>to</b> pursue religious <b>indifference</b> or <b>to</b> leave it alone...|$|R

25|$|In 1993, Dinkins lost to Republican Rudy Giuliani in {{a rematch}} of the 1989 election. Dinkins earned 48.3 {{percent of the}} vote, down from 51 percent in 1989. One factor in his loss was his {{perceived}} <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plight of the Jewish community during the Crown Heights riot. Another was a strong turnout for Giuliani in Staten Island; a referendum on Staten Island's secession from New York {{was placed on the}} ballot that year by Governor Mario Cuomo and the New York State Legislature. Dinkins defeated Giuliani handily in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, but Giuliani's margin in the other two boroughs was large enough to win the election.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{abuse of}} WSLF and the government's <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> suffering of Isaaq civilians and nomads prompted many Isaaq army officers to desert the army {{with a view}} to creating their own armed movement to fight Ethiopia, one that would also intimidate the WSLF and discourage further violence against Isaaq civilians. Their new movement, supported and financed by Isaaqs, was named Afraad (the fourth unit) and became operational in 1979. The Isaaq movement of Afraad immediately came into conflict with the Ogaden clan's faction of WSLF {{in the form of a}} number of bloody encounters between the two groups. Afraad's objective was to push the WSLF out of their strongholds (Isaaq territory) whereas the WSLF responded by retaliating further against Isaaq civilians living in the border region.|$|E
25|$|When Fleury died in January 1743 {{at the age}} of 90, Louis XV {{took control}} of government. While Britain and France were not yet {{formally}} at war, they were funding different sides in the War of the Austrian Succession and open hostilities seemed imminent. This meant Louis was more open to Jacobite requests and in August sent James Butler, his Master of Horse to England to assess their prospects. Butler was provided lists of supporters, including one claiming 190 of the 236 members of the powerful trade body the Corporation of London as 'Jacobite.' When Louis asked why the English needed help if support was so widespread, his advisors attributed it to dislike of foreigners and government repression. In reality {{it was a combination of}} wishful thinking and confusing <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hanoverians with enthusiasm for the Jacobites.|$|E
40|$|<b>Indifference</b> <b>to</b> {{massacre}} is <b>the</b> {{discovery of}} the history of the 20 th century. A triad of “as ifs”, full of consequences, specifies that indifference: “as if one does not see”, “as if one does not hear”, “as if one does not exist”… This gives rise to an irrefutable judgment, “You are nothing!” which materializes in the “musselman” of the concentration camps. On the basis of some disturbing testimonies, the article outlines some of the subjective and discursive aspects that characterize this dark reality of our time. </p...|$|R

25|$|Northamptonshire County Cricket Club {{is one of}} {{eighteen}} first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Northamptonshire. Its limited overs team is called the Northants Steelbacks – {{a reference to the}} Northamptonshire Regiment which was formed in 1881. The name was supposedly a tribute to the soldiers' apparent <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harsh discipline imposed by their officers. Founded in 1878, Northamptonshire (Northants) held minor status at first but was a prominent member of the early Minor Counties Championship during the 1890s. In 1905, the club joined the County Championship and the team was elevated to senior status as an official first-class team. Northants has been classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963; and as a senior Twenty20 team since 2003.|$|E
25|$|Both William and Anne {{appointed}} {{and dismissed}} Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and {{followed up on}} actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was {{an essential part of}} evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although George I (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. George II (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, George III (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Grant often {{displayed}} laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, {{gambling and}} living {{off of his}} wits. He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed sociopathic tendencies at times — impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an <b>indifference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this {{was that he was}} one of the few people who offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.|$|E
