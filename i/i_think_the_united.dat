Do you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should have a military presence in your country?", Wurtzbach answered: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and <b>the</b> Philippines {{have always had a}} good relationship with each other. We were colonized by the Americans and we have their culture in our traditions even up to this day and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that we're very welcoming with the Americans and I don't see any problem with that at all.|$|R

5000|$|There was {{continued}} {{criticism of}} the memorial in the 1990s and 21st century. John F. Doyle, a retired judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, said Pike was responsible for Native American casualties during the Civil War and their subsequent loss of land. [...] Journalist and author Richard G. Zimmerman called Pike's statue a [...] "poor choice for a pedestal" [...] and said inscriptions on the memorial noting Pike's virtues should include [...] "bigot, indicted traitor, alleged barbarian, suspected plagiarist, jailbird." [...] C. Fred Kleinknecht, then {{chief executive officer of}} the Scottish Rite, defended Pike and said the statue was not in honor of his role as a Confederate general, but as an [...] "advocate for Native Americans and his role as a champion of educational and social reform and for his literary accomplishments and scholarship." [...] Scottish Rite Journal managing editor S. Brent Morris has also defended the memorial and Pike's role as a Confederate officer: [...] "We're not embarrassed in the least that he was a Confederate general...Even in 1901, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Congress would have approved honoring a Confederate general, so he was honored for all his other accomplishments." ...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{attacked}} by Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley for his close relationship with Republican Governor Bob Ehrlich, who noted, [...] "He works very hard to give the Ehrlich administration cover. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he probably prides himself at {{the degree to which}} he helps cover up the poor performance of the governor." [...] Schaefer added to his troubles when he announced, [...] "I don't want to adjust to another language. This is <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States should adjust to us," [...] {{at a meeting of the}} Maryland Board of Public Works, prompted by an experience he recently had at a McDonald's restaurant. He noted later that his remarks would cause him to [...] "likely lose all the Latin votes and all the other votes." [...] Another controversy arose in February 2006 when Schaefer made inappropriate remarks to an aide at another meeting of the Board of Public Works. As the aide brought him a cup of tea, he watched her walk away before requesting that she [...] "walk again." [...] Not long after the incident, Schaefer apologized to the aide, but opponent Peter Franchot remarked, [...] "He's apologizing for the negative publicity rather than his inappropriate behavior." ...|$|R
