5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an <b>established</b> <b>population</b> they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E

Californios is the term for the Spanish-speaking residents of modern-day California; they were the original Mexicans (regardless of race) and local Hispanicized Indians in the region (Alta California) before the United States acquired it as a territory.

25|$|Besides {{the ability}} to drive the {{predator}} away, mobbing also {{draws attention to the}} predator, making stealth attacks impossible. Mobbing plays a critical role in the identification of predators and inter-generational learning about predator identification. Reintroduction of species is often unsuccessful, because the <b>established</b> <b>population</b> lacks this cultural knowledge of how to identify local predators. Scientists are exploring ways to train populations to identify and respond to predators before releasing them into the wild.|$|E
25|$|This species became {{established}} in North America {{as the result}} of introductions into the United States in an attempt to control the spread of aphids. In the last three decades, this insect has spread throughout the US and Canada, and has been a prominent factor in controlling aphid populations. The first introductions into the US took place as far back as 1916. The species repeatedly failed to establish in the wild after successfully controlling aphid populations, but an <b>established</b> <b>population</b> of beetles was observed in the wild near New Orleans, Louisiana, in about 1988. In the following years, it quickly spread to other states, being occasionally observed in the Midwest within five to seven years and becoming common in the region by about 2000. The species was also {{established in}} the Northwest by 1991, and the Northeast by 1994, aided by additional introductions from the native range, rather than just reaching there from the Southeast. Reportedly, it has heavily fed on soybean aphids (which recently appeared in the US after coming from China), supposedly saving farmers vast sums of money in 2001.|$|E
25|$|From here, {{they crossed}} the strait and {{occupied}} Eysturoy during the years 1776 to 1779. In 1779, they reached Vagar. Whether the rats dispersed from the already <b>established</b> <b>population</b> in Suðuroy, or they {{were brought to the}} Faroe Islands with other ships, is unknown. The Northern islands were invaded by the brown rat more than 100 years later, after Norwegians built and operated a whaling station in the village of Hvannasund on Borðoy from 1898 to 1920. From there, the brown rat spread to the neighbouring islands of Viðoy and Kunoy. Today the brown rat is found on seven of the 18 Faroese islands, and is common in and around human habitations {{as well as in the}} wild. Although the brown rat is now common on all of the largest Faroese islands, only sparse information on the population is available in the literature. An investigation for infection with the spirochaete Leptospira interrogans did not find any infected animals, suggesting that Leptospira prevalence rates on the Faroe Islands may be among the lowest recorded worldwide.|$|E

500|$|In the 2nd and 1st century BC (late La Tène period) they {{followed}} {{the lead of the}} more advanced Celts, who had <b>established</b> <b>population</b> enclaves in southern and middle Poland. The Przeworsk culture developed {{as a result of the}} local populations' adoption of the La Tène culture models. The passage of the Bastarnae and Scirii and the associated unrest likely functioned as the outside catalyzing agent: Jastorf culture archeological material has been found in pre-Przeworsk artifact assemblages and in some of the early Przeworsk range. The Przeworsk people mastered and implemented the various achievements of the Celts, most importantly developing large scale production of iron. Local bog ores were used for that purpose. They sometimes formed mixed groups and cooperated within common settlements [...] with the Celts, of which the Tyniec group in the Kraków region and another one in Kujawy are the known examples. Arms, clothes and ornaments were patterned after the Celtic products. In the early stages the Przeworsk people displayed no social distinction, their graves were alike and flat, and ashes together with funeral gifts buried usually without urns. Religious practices of pagan Germanic people included offering ceremonies performed in swamp areas, involving man-made objects, produce, farm animals, or even human sacrifice, as was the case at a site near Słowikowo in Słupca County; another such investigated site is in Otalążka, Grójec County. Dog burials within or around a homestead were another form of protective offerings.|$|E
500|$|Seminal {{though this}} moment was, {{it was just}} a start. As his biographer, WK Hancock, noted: [...] "All the same, [...] knew that nations are not made by {{administrative}} arrangements alone". In The Conditions of Future South African Literature, his next essay of significance, he dealt with the other significant factor in nation-building - the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community. Within this essay, not at first sight written on an overtly political topic, Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born. The question then arose - what was hindering this development? Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer - particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population. The relations between these two groups were fraught; the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population. With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant economic unit of South Africa, but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest, with the <b>established</b> <b>population</b> decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers. These divisions, though strongest in the Transvaal, existed to one degree or another throughout South Africa. Smuts, though sympathising with the concerns of the old population, fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration, urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting. Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old, to consolidate the white population both {{for the sake of a}} future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population.|$|E
2500|$|Pair {{formation}} {{begins in}} fall, and nest building begins in spring. [...] The female builds a well-concealed nest {{on the ground}} below dense vegetation, especially Eragrostis variabilis bunchgrass. [...] The nest is a shallow bowl lined with dead grass and down feathers. [...] Egg-laying typically occurs from April to August. [...] Average clutch size on Laysan Island is approximately four eggs. [...] The newly <b>established</b> <b>population</b> on Midway lays larger clutches, presumably because of better availability of food. [...] Ducklings are precocious and feed on their own day two after hatching, but are guarded, brooded, and led to foraging sites by the hen for approximately 40 to 60 days.|$|E
