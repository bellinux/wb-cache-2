5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> with {{no change in}} development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come together two days later due {{to the influence of}} anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{attacked}} Haman daily <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Following the repelling of North Korean infiltration on September 7, the North Korean {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|Then <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> or two Mariah {{would call}} me and say, 'What {{do you think about}} this bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E

5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's line <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Battalions, companies, and platoons, {{cut off and}} isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces {{trying to reach the}} front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. In general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas.|$|E
5|$|Crossing Madagascar {{for a third}} time, Elita closely {{followed}} the trajectory of its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February3. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed {{under the influence of}} a strong upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1969, Hara-Kiris sister weekly {{magazine}} was banned [...] Cavanna {{came up with}} the idea of renaming <b>the</b> magazine <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>weeks</b> issue, and thus, Charlie Hebdo was born.|$|R

They meet in the school every Saturday for training where they go through reference books (on subjects, activities, child development etc.), and prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week's</b> activities.|$|R
5|$|Continued {{weakened}} led to {{the storm}} being downgraded to a severe tropical storm early on February11 as it tracked towards the southeast. After spending several hours over cold waters, most of the convection associated with Hondo dissipated {{due to the lack}} of energy and the storm was further downgraded to a moderate tropical storm. Later that day, no convection remained around the storm as it weakened to a tropical depression. The JTWC issued their final advisory on February12 as the storm showed no signs of convective activity. Hondo degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area as Météo-France issued their final advisory at 1200UTC. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwestward direction with little or no development. On February20, about 2,780km (1,725mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the low began to develop weak convection around the northern edge of the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the battle, Linois used overland messengers to request {{the assistance of}} the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral Jose de Mazzaredo. Linois and Saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as Trafalgar Cemetery. Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, Pompée and Caesar, be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in the Bay of Gibraltar when they were sent to aid Hannibal in the last stages of the battle. The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain Alexander Ball, naval commissioner at Gibraltar. Captain Jahleel Brenton of Caesar protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: Caesars crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout the night <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, Caesar sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days. Saumarez also sent a boat under a flag of truce in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under parole of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on Hannibal. Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on HMS Plymouth with despatches, to await the court-martial for the loss of his ship. He and his officers were completely exonerated.|$|E

After spending the next few days searching for survivors, the light cruiser steamed to Ulithi on the 24th and remained there <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{unexpected}} reprieve, however, led to {{a brutal}} death march: <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> the prisoners were forced by SS soldiers wielding wooden clubs and steel bars to march 21 miles a day at top speed. In the blazing July heat, the emaciated prisoners were deprived {{of food and water}} and allowed to rest only at night. Those who couldn't keep up were shot.|$|E
25|$|After {{securing}} the perimeter, 46, 47 and 48 Commandos {{were sent to}} support the Canadians and 6th Airborne division while 41 Commando stayed behind. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> the commandos harassed the strongpoint with occasional mortar fire, RAF rocket firing Hawker Typhoon strikes and volleys from two attached Royal Marine Armoured Support Group (RMASG) Centaur tanks. Although the site did not threaten Allied movements in the area, it provided radar-ranging information for Luftwaffe night fighters and constantly reported on British movements.|$|E

25|$|No.107 Squadron's patrols were {{intensified}} {{after the}} German submarine U-862 sank the American Liberty Ship Robert J. Walker off Moruya on 25December 1944. The squadron flew five sorties a day <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> {{in search of}} the submarine. On 29December one of the squadron's Kingfishers attacked what its pilot believed was a submarine periscope near the point at which Robert J. Walker had been sunk. However, by this time U-862 was in the Tasman Sea near New Zealand. This was the only deliberate attack made by a RAAF Kingfisher during the war.|$|E
25|$|The CIA's {{response}} was another distraction. To begin Operation Moonmark, the CIA {{arranged for the}} U.S. Air Force {{to use one of}} its C-130 Hercules to drop a BLU-82 bomb to blast a helicopter landing zone (HLZ). Several helicopters flew in, a team dropped into the HLZ long enough to scatter cigarette butts, old packing crates, and litter about to simulate an insertion, then were pulled out by the helicopters. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> Air America Twin Otters overflew the phony HLZ dropping bogus parachutes and broadcasting helicopter racket. Thus the 15,000 lb (6,800 kilo) bomb served as a second diversion to the diversion.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of people were {{stranded}} on the roads, lost their homes while many walked long distances back home from work that evening. The floods were caused by the eighth heaviest-ever recorded 24-hour rainfall figure of 944mm (37.17 inches) which lashed the metropolis on 26 July 2005, and intermittently continued for the next day. 644mm (25.35 inches) was received within the 12-hour period between 8am and 8pm. Torrential rainfall continued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> The highest 24-hour period in India was 1,168mm (46.0inches) in Aminidivi in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep on 6 May 2004 although some reports suggest that it was a new Indian record. The previous record high rainfall in a 24-hour period for Mumbai was 575mm (22.6inches) in 1974.|$|E
