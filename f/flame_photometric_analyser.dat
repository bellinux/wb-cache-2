40|$|The {{ability of}} flash pyrolysis-gas {{chromatography}} with dual flame ionization and <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detection, and flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to afford {{detailed information about}} the organic sulphur pyrolysis products of kerogens is exemplified through analysis of five different sulphur-rich, type II kerogens. The pyrolysates of these kerogens are extremely complex mixtures. The technique with <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detection yields a chromatogram that shows the distribution of only organic sulphur products in the pyrolysates. However, a considerable loss of sensitivity in <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detection was apparent for higher-molecular-weight compounds. The use of the mass spectrometer as a detector, using characteristic m/z values of organic sulphur compounds for appropriate mass chromatograms, was therefore preferable. Identification of the organic sulphur products was accomplished by sulphur-selective <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detection and comparison of their mass spectral and chromatographic data with those of standard reference compounds. Chromatographic retention time data for 48 standard sulphur compounds (alkylated thiophenes, thiolanes and benzo[b]thiophenes) were determined. Homologous series of 2 -alkylthiophenes, 2 -alkyl- 5 -methylthiophenes, 2 -alkyl- 5 -ethylthiophenes, 2 -alkylthiolanes, 2 -alkylthianes, 2 -alkyl- 5 -methylthiolanes, 2 -alkyl- 4 -methylbenzo[b]thiophenes, 4 -alkyl- 2 -methylbenzo[b]thiophenes and 2 -alkyl-benzo[b]thiophenes, through a total carbon number of 22, have been identified through linear Kováts plots and comparison of mass spectral and chromatographic data of the C 18 members of these series with those of standard compounds...|$|R

Investigated detectors include the sulfur chemiluminescnce, the <b>flame</b> <b>photometric,</b> the electron capture, the mass spectrometric, the thermal conductivity, and the flame ionization detector. The sulfur chemiluminescence detector was found to have the best overall performance, e. g., low picogram amounts of sulfur can be detected accurately and the linear dynamic range is more than five orders of magnitude.

40|$|International audienceThe high {{toxicity}} of the organotin species requires sensitive analytical methods {{in order to}} understand the origins of pollution and perform monitoring programs in the water cycle. The optimisation of a new detection method, pulsed <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detection (PFPD), is reported for the simultaneous determination of butyl-, phenyl- and octyltins. The methodology of the experimental designs at two levels was used. It allows the evaluation of the influence of the three gas flow-rates on the peak heights and resolution between the closest peaks obtained using two different wavelengths of detection (390 and 611 nm). The modelling of these two responses, according to second-order polynomials, leads to the precise adjustment of the operating conditions. PFPD has shown two significant improvements over conventional <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detection: increased sensitivity (absolute detection limits: 0. 07 to 2 pg as Sn) and greater selectivity, whatever the wavelength used. This new analytical process was validated by the analysis of certified reference material and spiked river water.

40|$|International audienceThe {{performances}} of four specific detectors {{used for the}} speciation of butyl- and phenyltin compounds after solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography (GC) separation are evaluated. A <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detector (FPD), a pulsed <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detector (PFPD), a microwave induced plasma atomic emission spectrometer (MIP-AES) and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) were used. The principle of PFPD, {{a new generation of}} FPD, is presented. The original transfer line used between GC and ICP-MS is detailed. The high SPME preconcentration allows very low limits of detection (LOD) to be reached (less than 500 pg 1 - 1 Sn for all the detectors). Sensitivity, linearity and selectivity of the different detectors are also discussed. As expected, ICP-MS is the most sensitive (LOD ranged from 0. 6 to 20 pg 1 - 1 Sn) but the cheapest PFPD is also of significant interest. The analytical procedure is applied to the determination of organotins in two different reference materials: a sediment (PACS 2) and a fish tissue (NIES 11).

During the durability test the author confirmed that, when using pre-reduced sorbent and a clean system, the prebreakthrough H{sub 2 }S concentration was less than 100 ppmv, the detection limit of the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Consequently, a more sensitive <b>flame</b> <b>photometric</b> detector (FPD) which permitted measurements of H{sub 2 }S concentrations of 1 ppmv or less was installed.
