The pioneer countries were the USA, where towers and skyscrapers were objects of special use of light since the thirties. In Europe, France that started with high symbolic elements like the Eiffel tower was the <b>forerunner</b> <b>country.</b> With the development of technologies and the growing supply of electricity, it was possible to enlarge the light mark on towns and urban areas; generally speaking, the use of light was planned to allow the use of public spaces even during the night; an effective milestone was the integration of the concept of using light into the landscape vision: the artificial light became one of the “material” component of buildings and open spaces. Lighting is nowadays a way to create night time sensations, something like an augmented reality able to take advantage of the dark pathos in order to improve the quality of the built environment...|$|R

40|$|Embedded in the Rostock {{research}} group of historical demography 'A History of Aging Societies', the authors examined the demographic transition of Mecklenburg in the 19 th century. On {{the basis of}} statistical population data from the Tate 18 th up to the early 20 th century, which survived {{in the form of}} statistics manuals and census listings, the increase of life expectancy and mortality decline was analysed for the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In an optimization procedure the mortality conditions were calculated with the 'Generalised Inverse Projection' (GIP), a mathematic and statistic method using the historical birth, death and population totals. The results gained from the study allowed an integration of this north German province into the European context and was used for the comparison with its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark and Sweden, which were the <b>forerunner</b> <b>countries</b> of historical mortality decline. The study showed that 19 th century Mecklenburg rather followed the Scandinavian scheme of low mortality, in contrast to other German regions.

40|$|Purpose – Activation {{policies}} in most Western countries {{have discovered the}} private tool of contract and {{in a short period}} of time the contract has penetrated the whole domain. Among the <b>forerunner</b> <b>countries</b> contracts in different forms, collective as well as individual, have become the central steering instrument. The purpose of this article is to shed some light on what this change can and does entail for the individual job seeker on benefit. Job seekers are no longer expected to passive undergo treatment but expected to contribute actively to one's own return into the labour market. The main rationale behind this shift is the idea that working with contracts increases the level of involvement and, therefore improves results over time: results in terms of better motivated clients, more focused policymakers, providers and frontline workers delivering client‐orientated services. Design/methodology/approach – Using qualitative research the article maps the different types of contracts using empirical material from eight countries. Findings – The findings are presented in the form of the practical potentials and pittfalls of contracts for the individual. Originality/value – A major added value is the multidisciplinary approach used by the authors; the phenomenon of contracts is analysed from a social science and a legal point of view...|$|E
40|$|Animal manure {{contributes}} considerably to ammonia (NH 3) and {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions in Europe. Various treatment technologies {{have been implemented}} to reduce emissions and to facilitate its use as fertilizer, but a systematic analysis of these technologies {{has not yet been}} carried out. This study presents an integrated assessment of manure treatment effects on NH 3, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) emissions from manure management chains in all countries of EU- 27 in 2010 using the MITERRA-Europe model. Effects of implementing 12 treatment technologies on emissions and nutrient recovery were further explored through scenario analyses; the level of implementation corresponded to levels currently achieved by <b>forerunner</b> <b>countries.</b> Manure treatment decreased GHG emissions from manures in EU countries by 0 - 17 % in 2010, with the largest contribution from anaerobic digestion; the effects on NH 3 emissions were small. Scenario analyses indicate that increased use of slurry acidification, thermal drying, incineration and pyrolysis may decrease NH 3 (9 - 11 %) and GHG (11 - 18 %) emissions; nitrification-denitrification treatment decreased NH 3 emissions, but increased GHG emissions. The nitrogen recovery (% of nitrogen excreted in housings that is applied to land) would increase from a mean of 57 % (in 2010) to 61 % by acidification, but would decrease to 48 % by incineration. Promoting optimized manure treatment technologies can greatly contribute to achieving NH 3 and GHG emission targets set in EU environmental policies. </p...|$|E

40|$|As the {{leadership}} of the European Union hands over the baton to a new management this autumn, will the winds of change blow also through the cobwebs of the EU’s enlargement agenda? Jean-Claude Juncker – the incoming President of the European Commission – has already promised to put the gearbox of further EU widening in neutral {{for the next five years}} of his mandate, and has designated the Austrian Johannes Hahn as Commissioner for the re-baptised portfolio of now European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, instructing him to focus on the Union’s political and economic ties with Southern and Eastern Europe, and in particular with the Balkans. Such an approach in the field of enlargement – once crowned the jewel of EU foreign policy – has all the appeal of a damp rag but does not necessarily depart from the festina lente strategy of the recent past. Inside the Union, political appetite and public support for expansion have been fizzling since Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, and were then severely curbed in the context of the on-going crisis by growing fears of importing organised crime and migrants from the Balkans. Juncker’s logic of consolidation sounds depressingly similar to what it supposedly replaces and incidentally, it also fits neatly with the unambitious and inward-looking mantra favoured at present in discussions at all levels on the future of European integration, more generally. With the 28 -member block determined to catch its breath in the immediate time period, and given that even the <b>forerunner</b> <b>countries</b> in the Balkans – that is, Montenegro and Serbia – will realistically need more than five years to complete their accession talks, what priorities should guide Commissioner Hahn, soon to be Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations – when they get down to business on 1 November...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a strong}} {{negative}} correlation between increasing life expectancy and decreasing lifespan variation, a measure of inequality. Previous research suggests that countries achieving {{a high level of}} life expectancy later in time generally do so with lower lifespan variation than <b>forerunner</b> <b>countries.</b> This may be because they are able to capitalise on lessons already learnt. However, a few countries achieve a high level of life expectancy later in time with higher inequality. Scotland appears to be such a country and presents an interesting case study because it previously experienced lower inequality when reaching the same level of life expectancy as its closest comparator England and Wales. We calculated life expectancy and lifespan variation for Scotland and England and Wales for the years 1950 to 2012, comparing Scotland to England and Wales when it reached the same level of life expectancy later on in time, and assessed the difference in the level of lifespan variation. The lifespan variation difference between the two countries was then decomposed into age-specific components. Analysis was carried out for males and females separately. Since the 1950 s Scotland has achieved the same level of life expectancy at least ten years later in time than England and Wales. Initially it did so with lower lifespan variation. Following the 1980 s Scotland has been achieving the same level of life expectancy later in time than England and Wales and with higher inequality, particularly for males. Decomposition revealed that higher inequality is partly explained by lower older age mortality rates but primarily by higher premature adult age mortality rates when life expectancy is the same. Existing studies suggest that premature adult mortality rates are strongly associated with the social determinants of health and may be amenable to social and economic policies. So addressing these policy areas may have benefits for both inequality and population health in Scotland...|$|E
40|$|In four {{case studies}} {{renewable}} energy policies in Germany and France {{in the fields}} of renewable electricity and biofuels are compared since the discussion about renewable energy started in the 1970 s. The development of the four policy networks shows how actors influence political decisions by fostering or hindering the development of renewable energies. Under the aspects of eco-efficiency and cost-efficiency biofuels perform considerably worse than electricity from renewable sources. From that point of view biofuels deserve no political support while renewable energy in the electricity sector has the potential to fully supply the electricity consumption in Germany and France. Some renewable electricity sources like wind and hydro have nearly reached the price level of conventional energy sources while a wide range of studies estimate the potential of biofuels from domestic sources to some 5, 75 % only. In addition no further cost reduction of local biomass production can be expected. However, both governments supported biofuels because the actors in the biofuel policy network rather advanced the view of agriculturers’ interests than environmental aspects. According to the case studies the introduction of feed-in tariffs was fostered by a network of anti-nuclear and environmental activists and researchers in both countries {{since the end of the}} 1980 s. In the past, the evidence has shown that a fixed market price is by far the best incentive to boost renewable energies. The actors in the policy network were mainly driven by environmental interests and in the years 1990 and 2001 they had achieved their objectives. The proportional representation in German parliament promoted the pro-active policy network. As smaller parties get a chance to attain seats according to their percentage of votes the green party managed to bring its position on energy policy into the parliamentary debate since 1980. On the other hand the French greens did not manage to establish permanent parliamentary influence as an anti-nuclear political party because in the French majority vote system only deputies achieving a majority of votes in their electoral ward enter the French parliament. This system makes the French national assembly much less open to new political concerns than the German Bundestag as the power of hitherto existing parties is not menaced by new parties picking up new concerns like the transformation of the electricity system. Hence the feed-in tariff in France was only introduced due to a process of policy diffusion while at the same time in <b>forerunner</b> <b>countries</b> like Denmark and Germany renewable electricity did not only provide a considerable share of the electricity supply but also represented an influential new industry. The biofuel policy network consisted of completely different actors that the renewable electricity network in both Germany and France: Biofuel support represented agricultural instead of environmental interests. The Blair-House-Agreement gave the reason to introduce a support system for biofuels in 1992. This treaty pushed by the USA limited the use of oil seeds for nutrition purposes in the European Union. Thus both Germany and France sought new opportunities for their farmers to market their products outside the nutrition sector. So both countries gradually introduced support systems for biofuels from 1992 on. Germany opted for a complete tax exemption for pure biofuels which in 2002 was extended to blended biofuels. In France, a limited amount of blended biofuels was supported by a partial tax reduction. In addition the French government introduced an ecotax for fuels untershooting a certain biofuel share while a sufficient share of biofuels led to a tax reduction. Thus the government shifted additional costs to all consumers instead of putting a strain on public finances. The German support system on the contrary exclusively stressed state finances with its tax exemption an thus induced a gradually rising tax deficit. So, stimulated by fiscal policy experts, the new government abolished the tax exemption in 2005 replacing it by a quota system. This development demonstrates that the financing of a support system is a crucial question for its continuance. While the state repels tax deficits via its financial experts consumers have less organizational power at their disposal as their interests are harder to organize and to accomplish. So, not surprisingly, the cost of renewable electricity support was discussed several times in Germany and Frances but never limited due to an initiative of consumer lobbyists...|$|E

40|$|The mobile {{communication}} {{technology has evolved}} from the first generation (1 G), when the first radiotelephone service {{was introduced in the}} US in late 1940 s, to the third generation (3 G). In each generation, different standards and technologies were promoted by technologically and economically advanced countries. For example, the major 1 G communication standards were: AMPS promoted by the US, NMT promoted by Nordic countries, and TACS promoted by the UK. The second generation (2 G) communication standards include GSM promoted by the European countries and CDMA (IS- 95) promoted by the US. Behind these different standards, there are entire industry chains and huge profits. To catch up with these <b>forerunners,</b> lagging <b>countries</b> usually need to go through different stages including duplicative imitation, creative imitation, and then real innovation. In the 1 G era, China did not have its own standard, but it adopted the British TACS systems. In the 2 G era, China did not have its own standard, and it adopted both the European GSM systems and the US CDMA systems. However, when the 3 G era was approaching, China decided to seize the opportunity and developed its own 3 G standard: TD-SCDMA. In January 2009, China issued three different 3 G licenses to three different operators who utilized TD-SCDMA, WCDMA, and CDMA 2000, respectively. The Chinese proposed 3 G standard began to be commercialized with this first licensee. China has been trying {{to catch up with the}} leading countries in the {{mobile communication}} industry. This thesis examines the question of whether this catching-up process was successful or not. The purpose of this thesis is to give readers insights into the Chinese 3 G market, and to help them to understand the catching-up process being undertaken by China’s mobile communication industry. The thesis first introduces some background information about 3 G, TD-SCDMA, and the Chinese telecom market. Then, it reviews theories of technological catching-up and leapfrogging. After that, it presents a case study of the TD-SCDMA Industry Alliance that examines six determinants measuring the catching-up process: Sources for Competitive Advantages, Strategies and Policies, R&D Efforts, R&D Outcome, and Market Success. The final part of the thesis gives answers to the research question and reveals the profound impact brought by the catching-up process of China’s mobile industry...|$|R
50|$|The 1916 Labor split {{occurred}} {{over the issue of}} World War I conscription in Australia which saw pro-conscription Labor members expelled from the party and running as National Labor candidates at the 1917 election. That election also saw the emergence of the Victorian Farmers' Union (the <b>forerunner</b> of the <b>Country</b> Party) as a party. There was also a split in the Nationalist party into rural and city factions and both factions fielded their own candidates. However, Victoria introduced compulsory preferential voting before this election, and most of the preferences resulting from multiple Nationalist candidates were kept within the party. At that election, of the 65 seats, the pro-Ministerial city faction of the Nationalists won 13 seats, while the rural faction won 27. Labor won 18 seats, National Labor won 3 and the VFU won 4. After the election the rural Nationalist faction took control of the party, ousting Premier Alexander Peacock. The Nationalists reunited under Bowser. Elmslie died in 1918 and Prendergast returned to the party's leadership. At the 1920 election Labor won 20 seats to the Nationalists' 30. VFU became a force, holding {{the balance of power in}} the Legislative Assembly with 13 seats, a position it held until 1952. In 1920, it supported the conservative Nationalist government. In 1921, the VFU voted with Labor against the Nationalist government when it abolished the compulsory wheat pool operating in the state, leading to a dissolution of Parliament and the 1921 election, which maintained the same balance of power.|$|R
40|$|Are the Nordic <b>countries</b> <b>forerunners</b> in Open Education? What is {{the state}} of the art, {{barriers}} and opportunities of Open Education in the Nordic countries? What are necessary actions on policy, institutional and individual levels? These are the main questions of this paper. Open Educational Resources are discussed widely on a global, European and even Nordic level. UNESCO, which has coined the term Open Educational Resources (OER) some 10 years ago, published in June 2012 a global agenda for OER, the Paris Declaration (adopted by OER World Congress). The Declaration shows the importance of Open Educational Resources and gives recommendations to governments and institutions around the globe. The European Union has started a large-scale initiative on “Opening Up Education” ([URL] The concept of OER seems promising, potentially leading to educational collaborations, having potential for stimulating innovation in education, reducing cost of education, and broadening access to education for all. However, the awareness on the opportunities of using OERs is still low in the Nordic countries. In contrast to Open Access (for publications) or Open Source (for software development), OER are not yet broadly known and accepted / adopted. It is highly necessary to combine the initiatives and ideas of open approaches. This is the case at a user level as well as on policy level (see also Clements & Pawlowski, 2012). Therefore, it is important to promote OER to governments at all levels as well as to institutions. The Nordic countries seem to be a good ground for openness and sharing: the Nordic countries share many values related to education and technology development; the political  and governmental institutions are quite similar – there is also a tradition for exchange of knowledge and solutions between the countries. In this paper, we briefly give an introduction to OER and reflect on the state if the art of Open Education in the Nordic countries. In expert workshops by the Nordic Open Education Alliance, barriers and possible interventions to overcome them were explored. Based on these, we formulate recommendations as well as propose implementation actions. This study is based on a position paper from the Nordic Open Education Alliance ([URL]...|$|R
