The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how early versus delayed repair of strabismus influences the development or maldevelopment of motion VEPs. METHODS. Optical strabismus was created in infant macaques by fitting them with prism goggles on day 1 of life. The Early Repair group wore the <b>goggles</b> <b>for</b> a period of 3 weeks (the equivalent of 3 months before surgical repair in humans), whereas the Delayed Repair group wore the <b>goggles</b> <b>for...</b>|$|R
