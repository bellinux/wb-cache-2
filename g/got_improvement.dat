This study is aimed to improve students’ language skill especially writing based on their literacy level. It also applied semantic mapping in the joint construction of the text. Students asked to write the report after they created semantic mapping of their own idea and group. The method {{of this study was}} action research which had four steps. The steps were planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. The data was collected from cognitive test, observation checklist, questionnaire, and interview. The result of this study based on cognitive test was high. It meant that the students’writing skill <b>got</b> <b>improvement</b> which was more than the standard level of writing. Based on the observation checklist, questionnaire and interview, we could see the result that the students’participation and interest of writing report text <b>got</b> <b>improvement.</b> Hopefully, the result of this study can be used by all teachers in their teaching learning process. In addition, choosing easy topic could make students’positive response to write report text.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{therapeutic}} effects of midnight-noon ebb-flow method of selecting acupoints (MNEFMSA) for acute ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (AICD) {{and its influence}} on hemorrheology and on the levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α (6 -keto-PGF 1 α). MethodsThe 90 cases were randomly divided into 3 groups, each consisting of 30 cases. The drug group was treated mainly by routine medication; in addition to medication, the affected-channel group was treated by acupuncture at points along {{the course of the}} affected channel, and the MNEFMSA group was treated by MNEFMSA. ResultsThe total effective rate of MNEFMSA group, affected-channel group and drug group was 96. 67 %, 90 % and 73. 33 % respectively. The total effective rate of MNEFMSA group was obviously superior to that of the drug group (P< 0. 01), and cure rate and marked improvement rate were obviously superior to those of the drug group and the affected-channel group (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01). After treatment, the three groups all <b>got</b> <b>improvements</b> in the hemorheological indexes, of which MNEFMSA group <b>got</b> marked <b>improvements</b> in the whole blood viscosity and erythrocyte deformability rate, significantly different from the other two groups (P< 0. 05). At the early stage of treatment and after treatment, the three groups all had IL- 6, TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α obviously improved (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01), of which MNEFMSA group <b>got</b> obvious <b>improvement</b> in 6 -keto-PGF 1 α and IL- 6 ever since the early stage of the treatment (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsIn the treatment of acute ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, MNEFMSA can markedly raise the clinical therapeutic effects by improving the hemorheological indexes, lowering the level of IL- 6, and restoring the dynamic equilibrium between TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, so as to promote the recovery of cerebral nervous function...|$|R

Caries risk varies between individuals according to each subject’s balance between factors exposing to and protecting from caries attack. It is important to assess the risk of caries for all patients on a routine basis. Caries risk is divided into three levels: high, moderate, and low. Thereby, the dental professional is better to make a specific prevention and treatment recommendations to reduce a child risk and improve overall oral health. The goal of caries-risk assessment and preventive treatment is to eliminate caries or at least to reduce the high-caries occurrence down {{to the level of the}} remaining part of the age group. Preventive treatment is divided into three parts: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. This paper describes the primary prevention in children with high caries risk by behavior modification and tooth protection. Behavior modification is about dental health education, oral hygiene, diet and sugar consumption, sugar-free chewing gum and sugar-free medicines.

The result of these research showed that before PNM's equity participation, 3 BPRS are in Excelent condition. Those are BPRS Al Masoem with the score 96, 60, BPRS Mentari with the score 95, 40 and BPRS Daya Atha Mentari with score 85, 85, and for BPRS Patuh Beramal is in Good condition with the score is 77, 77. The financial performa after equity participation until 2002 showed that 2 BPRS <b>got</b> <b>improvement</b> in performance. Those are BPRS Al Masoem with the score increased form 96. 60 to 98, 00 and BPRS Mentari incresed from 95, 40 to 97, 80. The other BPRS that is BPRS Daya Artha Mentari decresed from 90, 08 to 85, 85 and BPRS Patuh Beramal decreased from 77, 77 to 69, 44. The dominant factor that causes the deteoration of financial performance is the decreasing in management score, because management has two aspect that is general management and risk management. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{because of the lack}} of students 2 ̆ 7 ability at the 5 th year Elementary School 34 Pekanbaru in writing poetry. From 36 students, there are 13 students who had the strong skill, while the other 23 had a weak skill. This {{research was}} aimed to improve the ability to write free poetry of 5 th year students of SD Negeri 34 Pekanbaru by using estafet writing strategy. The result of this research showed the improvement in cycle I and II, that is 61, 81 improved as much as 74, 72 and improved again became 84, 17. For the ability in writing free poetry, the students also <b>got</b> the <b>improvement</b> as much as 20, 90...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present an {{alternative}} approach for music genre classification which converts the audio signal into spectrograms and then extracts features from this visual representation. The idea is that treating the time-frequency representation as a texture image we can extract features to build reliable music genre classification systems. The proposed approach also takes into account a zoning mechanism to perform local feature extraction, which has been proved to be quite efficient. On a very challenging dataset of 900 music pieces divided among 10 music genres, we have demonstrated that the classifier trained with texture compares similarly to the literature. Besides, when it was combined with other classifiers trained with short-term, low-level characteristics of the music audio signal we <b>got</b> an <b>improvement</b> of about 7 percentage points in the recognition rate.

40|$|Abstract- At present, many {{researches}} {{have been}} done on the handwriting using static or dynamic signals. And we have devised a force sensitive tablet named F-Tablet, which is capable of capturing both the dynamic handwriting information and the static trajectory of the writing pen. With the core part of the multi-dimension force/torque sensor, the tablet can capture the two torques and three forces directly. And with the specially designed structure, other dynamic and static information can be <b>got</b> indirectly. <b>Improvement</b> {{has been made to}} the original design to get better performance. Ordinary pens can be used to write on the tablet. The tablet can also be used as an input device for computers or as a development tool for children to improve handwriting skills.
