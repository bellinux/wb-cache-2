The next day, Wendy and Kevin try to save Lewis at the gym; he tells them that he does not believe them shortly before two weights from the weight {{training}} machine he is using swing down and decapitate him. Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet <b>engine</b> <b>fan.</b> Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E

25|$|The Su-57 will be {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft in Russian Air Force service to use stealth technology. Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the airframe incorporates planform edge alignment to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully aligned at several specific angles {{in order to reduce the}} number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. The IRST housing is turned backwards when not in use, and its rear is treated with radar-absorbent material (RAM) to reduce its radar return. To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the partial serpentine inlet obscures most, but not all, of the engine's fan and inlet guide-vanes (IGV). The production aircraft incorporates radar blockers similar in principle to those used on the F/A-18E/F in front of the <b>engine</b> <b>fan</b> to hide it from all angles. The aircraft uses RAM to absorb radar emissions and reduce their reflection back to the source, and the canopy is treated with a coating to minimize the radar return of the cockpit and pilot.|$|E

2500|$|The F135 {{originated}} with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with {{efforts to develop}} a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA program. Lockheed employee Paul Bevilaqua developed and patented a concept aircraft and propulsion system, {{and then turned to}} Pratt & Whitney (P) to build a demonstrator engine. The demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The <b>engine</b> <b>fan</b> and core from the F100-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the [...] "F100-229-Plus" [...] demonstrator engine.

2500|$|The XJ12 {{version was}} {{announced}} in July 1972, featuring simplified grille treatment, and powered by a 5.3L V12 engine (coupled to a Borg Warner Model 12).

Although it had been the manufacturer's intention from launch that the XJ would take the twelve-cylinder engine, its installation was nonetheless a tight fit, and providing adequate cooling had evidently been a challenge for the engineers designing the installation. [...] Bonnet/hood louvres such as those fitted on the recently introduced twelve-cylinder E Type were rejected, but the XJ12 featured a complex [...] "cross-flow" [...] radiator divided into two separated horizontal sections and supported with coolant feeder tanks at each end: [...] the <b>engine</b> <b>fan</b> was geared to rotate at 1¼ times the speed of the engine rpm, subject to a limiter which cut in at a (fan) speed of 1,700rpm. [...] The fuel system incorporated a relief valve that returned fuel to the tank when pressure in the leads to the carburetters exceeded 1.5 psi {{to reduce the risk of}} vapour locks occurring at the engine's high operating temperature, while the car's battery, unusually, benefited from its own thermostatically controlled cooling fan.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{example of}} the {{turboshaft}} principle is the Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-600 turbofan engine for the STOVL F-35B - in conventional mode it operates as a turbofan, but when powering the LiftFan, it switches partially to turboshaft mode to send 29,000 horsepower forward through a shaft (like a turboprop) and partially to turbofan mode to continue to send thrust to the main <b>engine's</b> <b>fan</b> and rear nozzle.|$|R
5000|$|The Fighter Teen Series (F-14, F-15, F-16, F/A-18) carried large {{external}} fuel tanks, but {{to avoid}} negating its stealth characteristics the F-35 must fly most missions without them.

The small bumps just forward of the engine air intakes form part of the diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) which is a simpler, lighter means to ensure high-quality airflow to the engine over a wide range of conditions.
