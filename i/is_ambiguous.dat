According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy <b>is</b> <b>ambiguous.</b> Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E

5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description <b>is</b> <b>ambiguous,</b> leaving much room for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence <b>is</b> <b>ambiguous.</b> SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers sought {{inspiration}} from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny {{to fill in}} gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which {{was inspired by a}} piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well which is to be simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon <b>is</b> <b>ambiguous</b> as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this {{is a result of the}} time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline. Abrams noted the continuity of the original series itself was inconsistent at times.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the {{ideology}} of kingship. In the Opet Festival, an extremely important ceremony during the New Kingdom, the image of Amun from Karnak visited the form of Amun worshipped at Luxor Temple, and both acted to reaffirm the king's divine rule. Still other celebrations had a funerary character, as in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley, when Amun of Karnak visited the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis to visit the kings commemorated there, while ordinary people visited the funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives. Some may have centered on ritual marriages between deities, or between deities and their human consorts, although the evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose <b>is</b> <b>ambiguous.</b> A prominent example is a festival in which an image of Hathor from Dendera Temple was brought annually to visit the Edfu, the temple of her mythological consort Horus. These varied ceremonies were united by the broad purpose of renewing life among the gods and in the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some way}} God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position <b>is</b> <b>ambiguous,</b> but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E
