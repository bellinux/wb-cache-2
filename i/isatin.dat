2500|$|Thiophene was {{discovered}} as a contaminant in benzene. [...] It was observed that <b>isatin</b> (an indole) forms a blue dye {{if it is}} mixed with sulfuric acid and crude benzene.

2500|$|In 1897, 19,000 tons of indigo were {{produced}} from plant sources. [...] Largely due to advances in organic chemistry, production by natural sources dropped to 1,000 tons by 1914 {{and continued to}} contract. [...] These advances {{can be traced to}} 1865 when the German chemist Adolf von Baeyer began working on the synthesis of indigo. He described his first synthesis of indigo in 1878 (from <b>isatin)</b> and a second synthesis in 1880 (from 2-nitrobenzaldehyde). [...] (It was not until 1883 that Baeyer finally determined the structure of indigo.) [...] The synthesis of indigo remained impractical, so the search for alternative starting materials at Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (BASF) and Hoechst continued. Johannes Pfleger and [...] eventually came up with industrial mass production synthesis. The synthesis of N-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine from the easy to obtain aniline provided a new and economically attractive route. [...] BASF developed a commercially feasible manufacturing process that was in use by 1897. In 2002, 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo {{were produced}} worldwide.|$|E
