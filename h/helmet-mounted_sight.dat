5|$|Significant {{changes were}} made both during and shortly after the war. Owing to {{obsolete}} navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, a recent technology at the time. Prior to 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina known as Operation Deliberate Force, a dozen Jaguars were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. Shortly afterwards, the RAF upgraded its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating TIALD {{and the ability to}} use new reconnaissance pods. The interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A introduced the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight,</b> improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved night vision goggles compatibility.|$|E
5|$|A <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E
25|$|BK 117 A-3M :Military version {{introduced}} in 1986. The A-3M is fitted with taller skids and can carry 11 troops. A Browning 12.7mm (0.5in) machine gun can be mounted under the fuselage in a Lucas turret with 450 rounds {{and controlled by}} a <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight.</b> The A-3M also has outrigger pylons which can hold up to eight HOT II or TOW antitank missiles or a variety of air-to-air missiles, rocket-pods, or forward-firing cannons. Provisions for a doorway gunner's position with a 12.7mm (0.5in) gun can also be installed.|$|E
5000|$|MiG-23MLGD: [...] "MLG" [...] and [...] "MLS" [...] {{were further}} fighter {{upgrades}} with new radar and EW equipment, partly {{the same as}} in MiG-29; these variants were also fitted with <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sights</b> and were basically MiG-23MLD subvariants. They were abandoned in favor of the then ongoing MiG-29 program.|$|R
50|$|Surviving Su-24M {{models have}} gone through a life-extension and {{updating}} program, with GLONASS, upgraded cockpit with multi-function displays (MFDs), HUD, digital moving-map generator, Shchel <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sights,</b> and provision for the latest guided weapons, including R-73 (AA-11 'Archer') air-to-air missiles. It is unclear if the Su-24MR and Su-24MP will receive the cockpit and navigation upgrades. The upgraded aircraft are designated Su-24M2.|$|R
50|$|Although {{only three}} stages had been {{originally}} planned, GD proposed an MSIP IV segment (marketed as 'Agile Falcon'), {{but this was}} rejected by the Air Force in 1989. However, most of its elements - such as extensive avionics upgrades, color displays, an electronic warfare management system (EWMS), reconnaissance pods, AIM-9X Sidewinder infrared air-to-air missile integration, and <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sights</b> - have been introduced since that time.|$|R
25|$|The F1AZ {{features}} an integrated ground-attack system, comprising two on-board computers that can identify targets {{at a distance}} of 5km. A laser range finder, situated below its conical nose, is connected to the computers to provide them with target info without emitting radar signals. After target identification and information gathering, bombs are automatically released at the right moment. While the range-finding ability of the EMD AIDA 2 radar permits the use of combat and visual interception missiles, the <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> element enables the pilot to make bore attacks, without waiting until achieving an optimum firing position. The F1AZ is equipped with two internal DEFA 30mm cannons with 125 rounds each, and carries a wide variety of external ordnance, including various types of bombs, cluster munitions, missiles, and rocket launchers.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Lynx's {{components}} {{had been}} derived from earlier Westland helicopters {{such as the}} Scout and Wasp. The Lynx has been substantially upgraded since originally entering service in the 1970s; improvements made to in-service aircraft have typically included strengthened airframes, new avionics and engines, improved rotor blades, additional surveillance and communications systems. Various subsystems from overseas suppliers have been incorporated into some Lynx variants; during a South Korean procurement, hulls produced in the United Kingdom were equipped with Korean-built systems, such as ISTAR, electro-optical, electronic warfare, fire-control systems, flight control actuators, and undercarriages. A glass cockpit was adopted on the Super Lynx 300, featuring fully integrated flight and mission display systems, a variety of integrated display units including head-up displays, and dual controls; AgustaWestland has commented that the new cockpit reduces aircrew workload and increases aircraft effectiveness. The head-up display installed could {{be replaced by a}} <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> system on customer demand.|$|E
25|$|The F-15I Ra'am {{is similar}} to the F-15E, but {{features}} several different avionic systems to meet Israeli requirements. To facilitate night-time strikes, the F-15Is were initially fitted with Sharpshooter targeting pods designed for Israeli F-16s. The Sharpshooter pod was less capable than the LANTIRN pods used on USAF F-15Es; Israel later purchased 30 LANTIRN pods. The F-15Is initially lacked Radar Warning Receivers, Israel installed its own electronic warfare equipment, the Elisra SPS-2110, as well as a new central computer and embedded GPS/INS system. All sensors can be slaved to the Display And Sight Helmet (DASH) <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight,</b> providing both crew members a means of targeting which the F-15E lacks. The F-15I uses the APG-70I radar; its terrain mapping capability can locate targets difficult to spot while under adverse weather conditions. The radar can detect large airliner-sized targets at , and fighter-sized targets at , it has a reduced resolution one-third below the standard USAF APG-70. In January 2016, Israel approved an upgrade of the F-15I fleet that includes structural changes, an AESA radar, updated avionics, and new (unspecified) weapon systems.|$|E
50|$|Norway {{joined the}} {{original}} NATO-USAF partnership to replace its ageing Lockheed F-104 Starfighter squadrons. In 1975, Norway placed {{an order for}} 72 F-16A/B aircraft, delivered between 1980 and 1984. Unlike the other partners, {{there have been no}} follow-up orders, except for a single order in 1989 for two F-16B-15OCU aircraft as replacements for crashed aircraft. All the aircraft have received the Mid-Life-Update (MLU), and they received the new, <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sighting</b> system.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the KingCobra {{was to be}} the new wire-guided BGM-71 TOW {{anti-tank}} missile, which had proven highly effective in combat test firings in Vietnam from Huey gunships. This weapon could be carried in a pack of four missiles, with one pack under each stub wing for a total of eight missiles. On launch, the TOW trailed out wires to communicate command guidance updates. The missile had two infrared flares on its tail to allow the SMS to track it. All the gunner had to do was keep the target in his sight, and the missile fire control system adjusted its flight appropriately. Both the gunner and the pilot had Sperry Univac <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sights</b> to allow them to acquire targets for the KingCobra's missiles and gun.|$|R
50|$|TADS {{contains}} stabilized electro-optical sensors, a {{laser rangefinder}} and laser target designator. The TADS assembly can rotate +/− 120 degrees in azimuth, +30/−80 degrees in elevation and can move {{independently of the}} PNVS. The movements of TADS can be 'slaved' to the head movements of the helicopter crew to point where they are looking. This allows images from TADS to be projected onto the crew <b>helmet-mounted</b> optical <b>sights,</b> overlaid upon {{their view of the}} cockpit and battle space.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pilot and}} copilot are {{equipped}} with the Thales [...] "Top Owl" [...] <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> and display system. The Top Owl has a 24-hour day/night capability and a binocular display with a 40° field of view. [...] Its visor projection provides forward looking infrared (FLIR) or video imagery. However, the Corps has decided to augment it with existing night vision devices.|$|E
2500|$|The crew are {{equipped}} with the Thales [...] "Top Owl" [...] <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> and display system. The Top Owl has a 24-hour day/night capability and a binocular display with a 40° field of view. [...] Its visor projection provides forward looking infrared (FLIR) or video imagery. [...] The AH-1Z has survivability equipment including the Hover Infrared Suppression System (HIRSS) to cover engine exhausts, countermeasure dispensers, radar warning, incoming/on-way missile warning, and on-fuselage laser spot warning systems.|$|E
2500|$|The Su-57 has a {{glass cockpit}} with two [...] main multi-functional LCD {{displays}} {{similar to the}} arrangement of the Su-35S. Positioned around the cockpit are three smaller control panel displays. The cockpit has a wide-angle (30° by 22°) head-up display (HUD), and Moscow-based Geofizika-NV provides a new NSTsI-V <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> and display for the ZSh-10 helmet. Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles. The aircraft uses a two-piece canopy, with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place. The canopy is treated with special coatings to increase the aircraft's stealth.|$|E
40|$|There are {{two primary}} {{purposes}} for head-mounted systems in aeronautical settings. One is for <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sights</b> and teleoperated (head-slaved) weapons systems. Bennett, Johnson, Perrone, and Phatak (1988) evaluated head tracking performance during passive and controlled flight. In that study, comparisons were also made of head tracking performance in sterile and relatively complex virtual worlds. That study confirmed the robustness of head tracking performance {{across a wide}} variety of visual scenes. A second use of virtual world displays is for aircraft control. Aircraft controllability using head-mounted, panel-mounted, or simulated out-the-window scenes has been systematically examined. Those studies reported the range of rotorcraft flight tasks in which head-mounted virtual worlds provided some advantages. Two studies will be reported that examine the perceptual/performance effects of virtual worlds. The first examines head tracking performance with roll-stabilized versus non-roll stabilized virtual worlds. The {{purpose of the study was}} to (1) examine display strategies used in current display systems and (2) study the adaptability of observers to estimated glide slope angles using head-slaved versus head-stabilized imagery. The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of wide field-of-regards during final approaches to a runway...|$|R
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} was ushered {{in by the}} Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor in late 2005. Currently {{the cutting edge of}} fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction AESA radars with high-bandwidth, low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The Infra-red search and track sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced avionics, glass cockpits, <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sights</b> (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor data fusion for vastly improved situational awareness while easing the pilot's workload. [...] Avionics suites rely on extensive use of very high-speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed data buses. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a [...] "first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability".|$|R
50|$|Out of a {{total of}} 35 major {{avionics}} components and line-replaceable units (LRUs), only three involve foreign systems. These are the multi-function displays (MFDs) by Sextant (France) and Elbit (Israel), the <b>helmet-mounted</b> display and <b>sight</b> (HMDS) cueing system by Elbit, and the laser pod supplied by Rafael (Israel). Production aircraft are expected to have MFDs from Indian suppliers. A few important items of equipment (such as the Martin-Baker ejection seat) have been imported. As a consequence of the embargo imposed on India after its nuclear weapons tests in May 1998, many items originally planned to be imported were instead developed locally; these sanctions contributed to the prolonged delays suffered by the LCA.|$|R
50|$|On 17 December 2009, the {{reconnaissance}} upgrade {{disappeared from}} the budget after the Democratic Party took power following the General Election in 2009, and priority was given instead to improvement of the F-15J and the Mitsubishi F-2. The number of F-15J upgrades was increased from 26 to 48, and the MoD purchased part of the modernization for 38 fighters. However, the full budget for modernization is incomplete. 48 F-15Js will get a Link 16 datalink and <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight.</b> The <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> will support the AAM-5 dogfighting missile, which will replace the AAM-3.|$|E
50|$|The {{fire control}} system on board {{integrates}} the radar, optronics, <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight,</b> electronic warfare gears including radar warning receivers, and data links. The system {{consists of two}} subsystems: the SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem and the SUV-P air-to-ground subsystem.|$|E
50|$|China {{has also}} {{developed}} a <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> (HMS) system for the PL-8. Elbit Systems DASH (Display And Sight Helmet) helmet mounted sight (HMS). However, it’s not clear that if {{this was part of}} the Python-3 deal or a separate deal instead.|$|E
500|$|JF-17 Block 3Projected {{to feature}} further {{avionics}} advancements such as <b>helmet-mounted</b> display and <b>sight</b> (HMD/S) system, a new single panel multi-functional display (MFD), an {{active electronically-scanned array}} (AESA) radar paired with an infrared search and track (IRST) system, and a cockpit with a flight-control stick on the side an NRIET KLJ-7A AESA radar, more use of composites, a new engine, and a two-seater cockpit option, with {{a top speed of}} 2.0+ Mach. Pakistani Air Force officials have described it as a [...] "fourth generation plus" [...] fighter jet. According to unconfirmed media reports the induction is expected to start around 2019. As of September 2016, the design of the JF-17 Block III has been finalized. The PAF is expected to place an order for 50 JF-17 Block-III fighter jets {{in the first half of}} 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The Tejas has a {{night vision}} goggles (NVG)-compatible [...] "glass cockpit", {{dominated}} by an CSIR-CSIO domestically-developed head-up display (HUD), three 5 in x 5 in multi-function displays, two Smart Standby Display Units (SSDU), and a [...] "get-you-home" [...] panel providing the pilot with essential flight information {{in case of}} an emergency. The displays provide information on key flight systems and controls on a need-to-know basis, along with basic flight and tactical data. The pilot interacts with onboard systems through a multifunctional keyboard and several selection panels. The CSIO-developed HUD, Elbit-furnished DASH <b>helmet-mounted</b> display and <b>sight</b> (HMDS), and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls reduce pilot workload and increase situation awareness by allowing access to navigation and weapon-aiming information with minimal need to spend time [...] "head down" [...] in the cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1980, General Dynamics began {{converting}} the sixth FSD F-16A {{to serve as}} the technology demonstrator aircraft for the joint Flight Dynamics Laboratory-NASA Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI) program. The AFTI F-16 built upon GD's experience with its YF-16 CCV program, and the AFTI F-16 even received the twin pivoting vertical ventral fins from the CCV aircraft, which were likewise installed under the air intake. The aircraft was also fitted with a narrow dorsal fairing along its spine to house additional electronics. Technologies introduced and tested on the AFTI F-16 include a full-authority triplex Digital Flight Control System (DFCS), a six-degree-of-freedom Automated Maneuvering Attack System (AMAS), a 256-word-capacity Voice-Controlled Interactive Device (VCID) to control the avionics suite, and a <b>helmet-mounted</b> target designation <b>sight</b> that permitted the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) device and the radar to be automatically [...] "slaved" [...] to the pilot's head movement. First flight of the AFTI F-16 occurred on 10 July 1982. The Air Force Association gave its 1987 Theodore von Karman Award for the most outstanding achievement in science and engineering to the AFTI F-16 team.|$|R
50|$|Proposed armed {{version with}} guided ZT3 Ingwe ATGM, FLIR and 20 mm GA-1 cannon with <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight.</b> Modification by Kentron (Denel) company in 1993 tested in South Africa. Some {{elements}} like hardpoint {{were used in}} serial W-3W/W-3WA variant. One built.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{with simple}} HMD devices appeared for experimental {{purpose in the}} mid-1970s to aid in targeting heat seeking missiles. These rudimentary devices were better described as Helmet-Mounted Sights. Mirage F1AZ of the SAAF (South African Air Force) used a locally developed <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight.</b> This enables the pilot to make bore attacks, without having to maneuver to the optimum firing position. South Africa subsequently {{emerged as one of}} the pioneers and leaders in <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> technology. The SAAF was also the first air force to fly the helmet sight operationally. The US Navy's Visual Target Acquisition System (VTAS), made by Honeywell Corporation was a simple mechanical [...] "ring and bead"-style sight fitted to the front of the pilot's helmet that was flown in the 1974-78 ACEVAL/AIMVAL on U.S. F-14 and F-15 fighters ...|$|E

50|$|The Cheetah C was {{the final}} {{development}} in the Cheetah series and was the only fighter aircraft in service with the SAAF until replaced by the Saab JAS 39 Gripen in 2008. In addition to the upgrades described above, the Cheetah C incorporated more sophisticated avionics and navigation suite and an improved pulse-doppler multi-mode radar (ELTA). The aircraft was also fitted with a data link and updated versions of the <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight,</b> HUD and improved HOTAS controls.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{a highly}} {{sophisticated}} avionics, radar, EW and self-protection suite was installed, necessitating a lengthening of the nose. This entailed the fitting of an EW suite which included missile and radar warning sensors. Other features included the aircraft's self-protection system, {{which consisted of}} electronic jammers and chaff/flare dispensers that engaged automatically; the integration of a South African <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> and an oversized head-up display (HUD); the installation of an advanced Pulse-Doppler radar and sophisticated cockpit instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|A helmet-mounted display (HMD) is {{a device}} {{used in some}} modern aircraft, {{especially}} combat aircraft. HMDs project information {{similar to that of}} head-up displays (HUD) on an aircrew's visor or reticle, thereby allowing them to obtain situation awareness and/or cue weapons systems to the direction his head is pointing. Applications which allow cuing of weapon systems are referred to as <b>helmet-mounted</b> <b>sight</b> and display (HMSD) or helmet-mounted sights (HMS).
