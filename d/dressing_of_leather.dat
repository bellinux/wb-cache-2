40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{representativeness}} {{study is}} to identify the respective national and supranational actors (i. e. trade unions and employer organisations) {{in the field of}} industrial relations. This study will, in particular, focus on their representational quality as well as on their role in collective bargaining. The tanning and <b>dressing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> subsector is a small and, during the last decade, declining sector in the Dutch economy. All of the companies in the sector except for one small enterprise are covered by a single, sector-wide, collective agreement. Of the employees in the sector, 95 % are covered by this agreement. The employer organisation and the two, national trade unions operating in the sector are accepted parties in consultation and in collective bargaining...|$|E

60|$|In {{process of}} time, Eustace was disencumbered of his heavy armour; {{but when he}} stood before him in his plain <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> chamois <b>leather,</b> old Ralph shook his head, {{disappointed}} {{that he had not}} attained the height or the breadth of the stalwart figures of his father and brother, but was still slight and delicate looking. The golden spurs and the sword of Du Guesclin, however, rejoiced the old man's heart, and touching them almost reverentially, he placed the large arm-chair {{at the head of the}} table, and began eagerly to invite him to eat.|$|R

The elder was broad-shouldered, sun-burnt, ruddy, and rather stern-looking; the younger, {{who was also}} the taller, was slightly made, and very active, with a bright keen grey eye, and merry smile. These were Dame Astrida's son, Sir Eric de Centeville, and her grandson, Osmond; and to their care Duke William of Normandy had committed his only child, Richard, to be fostered, or brought up. {1} ...|$|R

60|$|The Knight of the Leopard then {{disarmed}} {{himself of}} his heavy panoply, his Saracen companion kindly assisting him to undo his buckler and clasps, until {{he remained in}} the close <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> chamois <b>leather,</b> which knights and men-at-arms used to wear under their harness. The Saracen, if he had admired {{the strength of his}} adversary when sheathed in steel, was now no less struck with the accuracy of proportion displayed in his nervous and well-compacted figure. The knight, on the other hand, as, in exchange of courtesy, he assisted the Saracen to disrobe himself of his upper garments, that he might sleep with more convenience, was, on his side, at a loss to conceive how such slender proportions and slimness of figure could be reconciled with the vigour he had displayed in personal contest.|$|R
60|$|He {{then settled}} the reins in the child's hand, and walked beside {{him to meet}} the new-comers. They were about twenty in number, armed alike with {{corselets}} marked with the blue cross, steel headpieces, and long lances. In front rode two of higher rank. The first {{was a man of}} noble mien and lofty stature, his short dark curled hair and beard, and handsome though sunburnt countenance, displayed beneath his small blue velvet cap, his helmet being carried behind him by a man-at-arms, and his attire consisting <b>of</b> a close-fitting <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> chamois <b>leather,</b> a white mantle embroidered with the blue cross thrown over one shoulder, and his sword hanging by his side. His companion, who carried at his saddle-bow a shield blazoned with heraldic devices in scarlet and gold, was of still greater height, and very slight; his large keen eyes, hair and moustache, black as jet; and his complexion dark brown, with a well-formed aquiline nose, and a perfect and very white set of teeth.|$|R
6000|$|Girths.--A roll {{of spare}} webbing {{should be taken}} to patch up torn girths; but a good {{substitute}} for a girth is made by cutting a band of tanned, or even <b>of</b> <b>dressed,</b> <b>leather,</b> to within four inches of its end, into seven or nine bands, and plaiting these together. But it takes a beginner just ten times as long to plait a girth as to weave it, and, therefore, for making more than one girth, it is well worth while to set up a rude loom. Do this as though you were making a mat. (See [...] "Mat.") Girths need not be buckled; they may be laced.|$|R
6000|$|In {{regard to}} the diving-dress, we may say that it has grown out of the [...] "aquatic armour" [...] of the olden time, but no great advance in its {{improvement}} was made {{until the end of}} the eighteenth and beginning of the present centuries, when the names of Rowe, Halley, Spalding, Bushwell, and Colt, appear in connection with various clever contrivances to facilitate diving operations. Benjamin Martin, a London optician, made a <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> strong <b>leather</b> in 1778 which fitted his arms and legs as well as his trunk, and held half a hogshead of air. With this he could enter the hold of a sunk vessel, and he is said to have been very successful in the use of it. Mr Kleingert of Breslau, in 1798, designed a dress somewhat like the above, part of which, however, was made of tin-plate. The diving-dress was greatly improved by Mr Deane, and in the recovery of guns, etcetera, from the wreck of the Royal George, in 1834 to 1836, as well as in many other operations, this dress--much improved, and made by Mr Siebe, under Deane's directions--did signal service.|$|R
50|$|Hexham {{had been}} long famous for its {{manufacture}} <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> Wright (1823) gives some statistics — 77 men & boys employed as Leather dressers and Glove-cutters, 40 boys employed as Dusters and 1,111 women employed as Sewers. Skins dressed annually were 80,000, and 18,000 skins <b>of</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>leather</b> were imported. From these were made and exported annually 23,504 dozens of pairs of gloves. Dutch Oker {{was used in the}} processing, but local fell clay could be used if necessary. Tanning was a necessary allied industry and there were four tanneries, employing a score of men. In a year they dealt with 5,000 hides and 12,000 calf skins. They supplied local saddlers, bootmakers and cobblers.Hexham also had 16 master hatters, and the trade employed 40 persons. There were two woollen manufactories, worked by steam power, and two rope manufactories. There were corn water mills below the bridge. A windmill on the Sele was ruinous, but there was one still working on Tyne Green. It was, and still is a flourishing market, including a mart for cattle and other farm animals.|$|R

Borelli designed diving equipment that consisted of a metal helmet, a pipe to [...] "regenerate" [...] air, a leather suit, and a means of controlling the diver's buoyancy. In 1690, Thames Divers, a short lived London diving company, gave public demonstrations of a Vegetius type shallow water diving dress. Klingert designed a full diving dress in 1797. This design consisted of a large metal helmet and similarly large metal belt connected by leather jacket and pants.|$|R
60|$|He led the boy by {{the hand}} to {{a corner of the}} room, where hung upon the wall a {{portrait}} which Ned had often looked at. It seemed an old picture; but the Doctor had had it cleaned and varnished, so that it looked dim and dark, and yet it seemed to be the representation of a man of no mark; not at least of such mark as would naturally leave his features to be transmitted for the interest of another generation. For he was clad in a mean <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> old fashion,--a <b>leather</b> jerkin it appeared to be,--and round his neck, moreover, was a noose of rope, as if he might have been on the point of being hanged. But the face of the portrait, nevertheless, was beautiful, noble, though sad; with a great development of sensibility, a look of suffering and endurance amounting to triumph,--a peace through all.|$|R

60|$|The {{appearance}} of the conjuror was peculiar. He was {{not much more than}} five feet high, but so slightly formed that he reminded you rather of the boy than the dwarf. The upper part of his face was even delicately moulded; his sparkling black eyes became his round forehead, which was not too much covered by his short glossy black hair; his complexion was clear, but quite olive; his nose was very small and straight, and contrasted singularly with his enormous mouth, the thin bluish lips of which were seldom closed, and consequently did not conceal his large square teeth, which, though very white, were set apart, and were so solid that they looked almost like double teeth. This enormous mouth, which was supported by large jawbones, attracted the attention of the spectator so keenly that it was some time before you observed the prodigious size of the ears, which also adorned this extraordinary countenance. The costume of this being was not less remarkable than his natural appearance. He wore a complete under <b>dress</b> <b>of</b> pliant <b>leather,</b> which fitted close up to his throat and down to his wrists and ankles, where it was clasped with large fastenings, either of gold or some gilt material. This, {{with the addition of a}} species of hussar jacket of green cloth, which was quite unadorned with the exception of its vivid red lining, was the sole covering of the conjuror; who, with a light cap and feather in his hand, was now haranguing the spectators. The object of his discourse was a panegyric of himself and a satire on all other conjurors. He was the only conjuror, the real one, a worthy descendant of the magicians of old.|$|R
