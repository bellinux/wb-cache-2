40|$|This {{article will}} be {{concerned}} with the question whether the books of <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes {{can be viewed as}} (postmodern) wisdom in revolt or not. Three questions underlie this title: firstly, are the books of <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes wisdom books? Secondly, if so, is their wisdom revolutionary in nature? And thirdly, are there any similarities between the thoughts of <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes {{on the one hand and}} that of postmodern thinkers on the other hand? It will be argued that there are various similarities to be cited between the ideas of the ancient wisdom writers of <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes and more recent postmodern thinkers. This does not, however, necessarily justify a postmodern tag for the books of <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes, but points to a similarity in thought development between the ancient societies of <b>Job</b> <b>and</b> Ecclesiastes and the present-day societies. Such similarities are viewed as a clear indication of the meaningful role which Old Testament wisdom, or wisdom in revolt for that matter, can play in current intellectual and theological debates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>job</b> autonomy <b>and</b> work outcomes (<b>job</b> performance, <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>job</b> stress), self efficacy as a mediating variable. This research also investigated the impact of job satisfaction on <b>job</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>job</b> stress on job performance. Va-riables in this research were measured via a survey of 190 banking salespersons in D. I. Yogyakarta and Solo. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to examine the effects of job autonomy on work outcomes, job satisfaction on <b>job</b> performance, <b>and</b> <b>job</b> stress on job performance. Results showed that the estimated model in this research is acceptable based on its score of the goodness of fit index. The structural relationship showed that job autonomy significantly related to <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> performance, but not significant with job stress. It also showed that self efficacy partially mediated the relationship between <b>job</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>job</b> performance. In addition, this research found that self efficacy not mediated the relationship between <b>job</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>job</b> stress. There was no significant relationship between <b>job</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>job</b> performance but this research showed that job satisfaction significantly related to job performance.
