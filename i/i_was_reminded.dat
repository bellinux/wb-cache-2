2500|$|After {{the catastrophic}} 2010–2011 Queensland floods, Nalliah {{declared}} on his website [...] "at once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of Kevin Rudd speaking against Israel in Israel on 14thDecember 2010. It {{is very interesting}} that Kevin Rudd is from QLD. Is God trying to get our attention? Yes, I believe so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{was less}} {{enthusiastic}} in the Chicago Sun-Times, giving the film {{two out of}} four stars and claiming that it was [...] "hard to follow". He felt the film lacked a confident grasp on its characters' roles in a story [...] "awash in elaborate special effects, sensational sets, apocalyptic scenes of destruction and {{a general lack of}} discipline". Ebert wrote positively of certain scenes, especially one in which [...] "Sam moves into half an office and finds himself engaged in a tug-of-war over his desk with the man through the wall. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of a Chaplin film, Modern Times, and reminded, too, that in Chaplin economy and simplicity were virtues, not the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevenson {{did not use}} {{television}} as effectively as his Republican opponent, war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{and was unable to}} rally the New Deal voting coalition for one last hurrah. On election day, Eisenhower won the national popular vote by 55% to 45%. [...] Stevenson lost heavily outside the Solid South; he carried only nine states and lost the Electoral College vote 442 to 89. In his concession speech on election night, Stevenson said: [...] "Someone asked me...how I felt, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of a story that a fellow townsman of ours used to tell – Abraham Lincoln. He said he felt like the little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. He said that he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like the Clinton {{campaign}} in 1996, Obama avoided discussing McCain's age directly, instead preferring to simply call his ideas and message [...] "old" [...] and [...] "old hat". He {{also made a}} strong appeal to youth voters and back during his primary contest with Hillary Clinton, had stated [...] "When I watched the feud between the Clintons and [...] unfold during the 1990s, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of old quarrels started on college campuses long ago. It's {{time for a new}} generation to take over." [...] Obama's active use of a Blackberry and other modern technology also stood in contrast to the Arizona Senator's admission that he did not use a computer or a cell phone. McCain's service in Vietnam, while marketable to baby boomers, was referred to as [...] "unimportant" [...] to younger voters.|$|E

60|$|The dear {{girls have}} enjoyed {{themselves}} immensely, and their trip {{has been a}} great success. I hope I told you (but I forget whether I did or no) how splendidly Newcastle[4] came out. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of Newcastle at the moment because they joined me there.|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> in San Francisco for work. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of {{research}} by my colleagues Paul Cheshire and Christian Hilber that reports that commercial rents in Birmingham are twice those in San Francisco (mostly because Birmingham's planning restrictions are more restrictive than San Francisco - itself a highly regulated {{city for the}} US) ...|$|R

60|$|On {{my way to}} the town, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> by the staring of all {{the people}} I passed on the road, of one {{important}} consideration which I had hitherto most unaccountably overlooked--the necessity of making some radical change in my personal appearance.|$|E

40|$|Whenever I {{think of}} ‘teaching’ I {{always come back}} to one {{singular}} overarching thought—the power of the relational, and the values of empathy, diversity, and interdependency. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of this when I meet students for the first time, when I see them in ongoing mentorship roles, and when I go to schools and communities...|$|R
60|$|I dried my sobbing darling's {{eyes and}} {{sat beside her}} on the sofa, and Richard sat on my other side; and while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of that so {{different}} night when they had first taken me into their confidence and had gone on in their own wild happy way, they told me between them how it was.|$|E

"Talking {{about water}} gardens, miss," [...] he said, [...] "I {{wish you could}} have {{seen some of the}} {{beautiful}} ones that I have come across!--more beautiful and lovely than anything {{on the top of the}} earth; you may be sure of that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of them the moment you spoke to me about your goldfish and their plants." ...|$|E
6000|$|But it {{appeared}} that they were only going {{as far as the}} parlours for the present; for when they re-entered the hotel, they turned into them, and sat down there quite as if that had been the understanding.

60|$|Next I saw Miriam was the {{following}} day. I {{met her in}} the court of Pilate's palace. She seemed in a dream. Scarce her eyes saw me. Scarce her wits embraced my identity. So strange was she, so in daze and amaze and far-seeing were her eyes, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of the lepers I had seen healed in Samaria.|$|E
60|$|Watching the {{struggle}} to capture and subdue the section of bridge, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of Victor Hugo's splendid description of the sailor's battle with a ship's gun gone adrift in a night of storm.

60|$|When, as lately, {{events have}} {{happened}} that seem (to the fancy, at least) to test if not stagger {{the force of}} official government, it is amusing to ask oneself what is the real weakness of civilisation, ours especially, when it contends with the one lawless man. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of one weakness this morning in turning over an old drawerful of pictures.|$|E
50|$|It is humiliating for any {{author to}} have failed so signally {{in what he}} set out to do. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of Congreve's witticism that bad portraitists are obliged to write the name of their sitters at the bottom. So may I, likewise, ask LRB readers to accept that my view of Rowse is emphatically not that {{presented}} by Mary Beard.|$|R
40|$|It is {{challenging}} {{to lay out}} in 10 – 15 minutes {{what can be done}} to improve the current international financial and monetary system. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of the story of the woman who was drafting an obituary after her 80 -year-old husband passed away.

50|$|My parents {{got married}} about {{one year before}} {{the stock market crash}} of 1929, and yet they raised 15 {{children}} {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression. They had no money.

60|$|I {{looked at}} him with fresh interest, for the mention of that dear lad Mironsac brought back to my mind the night in Paris on which my ill-starred wager had been laid, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of how that high-minded youth had sought--when {{it was too late to}} reason me out of the {{undertaking}} by alluding to the dishonour with which in his honest eyes it must be fraught.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> of Jack because I {{came across}} a letter to-day which is over thirty years old that Jack wrote. Jack was doomed to consumption.

60|$|The gangster {{must have}} {{received}} the liquid fire {{in the face and}} eyes.

The thing was sickening. I prefer that men be killed cleanly and easily.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{admire the}} fierce attentiveness of Nadine Sabra Meyer’s poems: their formal elegance, their elegiac habit.

40|$|Thinking about Martin Stokhof as a friend, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of our {{pleasant}} get-togethers {{to discuss}} the meaning of life, {{and the art of}} living it, of our fruitful collaboration in writing a overview of dynamic logic, and of our times together at the Aikido club of Eric Louw. Thinking about Martin Stokhof as a philosopher and colleague, his formal analysis (together with Jeroen Groenendijk) of questions and question answering is the first thing that comes to mind. This work is part of a fruitful tradition that has recently spawned inquisitive semantics, and the focus on question answering in dynamic epistemic logic. The theme is still very much alive at ILLC today. Next, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reminded</b> of the dynamic turn in natural language semantics, of the way he and Jeroen Groenendijk criticized Hans Kamp’s ideas about discourse representation, and how this led to the invention of dynamic predicate logic. Later it became clear that dynamic predicate logic can be viewed as the action part of quantified dynamic logic, invented much earlier by David Harel. This led to a connection, a semanti...|$|R
