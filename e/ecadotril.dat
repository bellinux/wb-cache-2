5000|$|<b>Ecadotril</b> is {{a neutral}} endopeptidase {{inhibitor}} ((NEP) EC 3.4.24.11) and {{determined by the}} presence of peptidase family M13 as a neutral endopeptidase inhibited by phosphoramidon. <b>Ecadotril</b> is the (S)-enantiomer of racecadotril. NEP-like enzymes include the endothelin-converting enzymes. [...] The peptidase M13 family believed to activate or inactivate oligopeptide (pro)-hormones such as opioid peptides, neprilysin [...] is another member of this group, {{in the case of the}} metallopeptidases and aspartic, the nucleophiles clan or family for example MA, is an activated water molecule. The peptidase domain for members of this family also contains a bacterial member and resembles that of thermolysin the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH. Thermolysin complexed with the inhibitor (S)-thiorphan are isomeric thiol-containing inhibitors of endopeptidase EC 24-11 (also called [...] "enkephalinase").|$|E
40|$|Combined {{inhibition}} of neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP) and {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) is a candidate therapy for hypertension and cardiac failure. Given that NEP and ACE metabolize angiotensin (Ang) and bradykinin (BK) peptides, we investigated the effects of NEP inhibition and combined NEP and ACE inhibition on Ang and BK levels in rats with myocardial infarction. We administered the NEP inhibitor <b>ecadotril</b> (0, 0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg/day), either alone or together with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (0. 2 mg/kg/day) by 12 -hourly gavage from day 2 to 28 after infarction. <b>Ecadotril</b> increased urine cyclic GMP and BK-(1 – 9) excretion. Perindopril potentiated the effect of <b>ecadotril</b> on urine cyclic GMP excretion. Neither perindopril nor <b>ecadotril</b> reduced cardiac hypertrophy when administered separately, whereas the combination of perindopril and 10 or 100 mg/kg/day <b>ecadotril</b> reduced heart weight/body weight ratio by 10 %. Administration of <b>ecadotril</b> to perindopril-treated rats decreased plasma Ang-(1 – 7) levels, increased cardiac BK-(1 – 9) levels, and increased Ang II levels in plasma, kidney, aorta, and lung. These data demonstrate interactions between the effects of NEP and ACE inhibition on remodeling of the infarcted heart and on Ang and BK peptide levels. Whereas increased cardiac BK-(1 – 9) levels {{may contribute to the}} reduc-tion of cardiac hypertrophy, the reduction in plasma Ang-(1 – 7) levels and increase in Ang II levels in plasma and tissues may compromise the therapeutic effects of combined NEP/ACE inhibition. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3. 4. 25. 1, ACE) are clinically useful for the treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure, being able to attenuate ventricular re-modeling and reduce mortality in heart failure patients (Brown and Vaughan, 1998).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibro-proliferative disorder refractory to current therapy commonly {{complicated by the}} development of pulmonary hypertension (PH); the associated morbidity and mortality are substantial. Natriuretic peptides possess vasodilator and anti-fibrotic actions, and pharmacological augmentation of their bioactivity ameliorates renal and myocardial fibrosis. Here, we investigated whether natriuretic peptides possess an intrinsic cytoprotective function preventing the development of {{pulmonary fibrosis}} and associated PH, and whether therapeutics targeting natriuretic peptide signalling demonstrate efficacy in this life-threatening disorder. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Pulmonary haemodynamics, right ventricular function and markers of lung fibrosis were determined in wild-type (WT) and natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR) -A knockout (KO) mice exposed to bleomycin (1 mg·kg(- 1)). Human myofibroblast differentiation was studied in vitro. KEY RESULTS: Exacerbated cardiac, vascular and fibrotic pathology was observed in NPR-A KO animals, compared with WT mice, exposed to bleomycin. Treatment with a drug combination that raised circulating natriuretic peptide levels (<b>ecadotril)</b> and potentiated natriuretic peptide-dependent signalling (sildenafil) reduced indices of disease progression, whether administered prophylactically or to animals with established lung disease. This positive pharmacodynamic effect was diminished in NPR-A KO mice. Atrial natriuretic peptide and sildenafil synergistically reduced TGFβ-induced human myofibroblast differentiation, a key driver of remodelling in IPF patients. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data highlight an endogenous host-defence capacity of natriuretic peptides in lung fibrosis and PH. A combination of <b>ecadotril</b> and sildenafil reversed the pulmonary haemodynamic aberrations and remodelling that characterize the disease, advocating therapeutic manipulation of natriuretic peptide bioactivity in patients with IPF...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) {{inhibition}} on microvascular plasma leakage (extravasation) was evaluated in a rat model. Progressive inhibition of ACE using captopril caused increased extravasation when lung ACE was inhibited by 55 %. In contrast, the selective inhibition of renal NEP by 90 % using <b>ecadotril</b> {{did not increase}} extravasa-tion. In NEP-inhibited rats, extravasation produced by the ACE inhibitors captopril and lisinopril was markedly enhanced. The dual ACE and NEP inhibitor omapatrilat, at oral doses of 0. 03, 0. 1, and 0. 3 mg/kg, selectively inhibited lung ACE by 19, 61, and 76 %, respectively, and did not cause significant extravasation. Doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg omapatrilat, which produced 90 % inhibition of ACE and also inhibited renal NEP by 54 and 78 %, respectively, significantly increased extravasation. In this model, bradykini...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Heart-transplant {{recipients}} (Htx) generally {{present with}} body fluid and sodium handling abnormalities and hypertension. To investigate whether neutral endopeptidase inhibition (NEP-I) increases endogenous {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) and enhances natriuresis and diuresis after heart transplantation, <b>ecadotril</b> was given orally to 8 control subjects and 8 matched Htx, and levels of volume-regulating hormones and renal water, electrolyte, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) excretions were monitored for 210 minutes. Baseline plasma ANP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and cGMP were elevated in Htx, but renin and aldosterone, like urinary parameters, did not differ between groups. NEP-I increased plasma ANP (Htx, 20. 662. 3 to 33. 265. 9 pmol/L, P, 0. 01; controls, 7. 761. 2 to 10. 662. 6 pmol/L) and cGMP, but not BNP. Renin decreased similarly in both groups, whereas aldosterone decreased significantly only in Htx. Enhanced urinary sodium (16506370 % versus 4506150 %, P 50. 01), cGMP, and water excretions were observed in Htx and urinary cGMP positively correlated with natriuresis in 6 of the Htx subjects. Consistent with a normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure, without excluding a possible effect of NEP-I, mean systemic blood pressure increased similarly in both groups {{at the end of}} the study (6. 962. 0 % versus 7. 462. 8 % in controls and Htx). Thus, systemic hypertension, mild renal impairment, and raised plasma ANP levels are possible contributory factors in the enhanced natriuresis and diuresis with NEP-I in Htx. These results support a physiological role for the cardiac hormone after heart transplantation and suggest that long-term studies may be useful to determin...|$|E
