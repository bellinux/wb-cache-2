5|$|Between {{the time}} of the initial sales {{agreement}} in November 1988 and the <b>finalization</b> of the acquisition of Pillsbury in January 1989, Grand Metropolitan set about putting its own corporate stamp on Burger King; the stated goal of Grand Met CEO Allen Sheppard was to upgrade the overall performance of the chain and improve its standing as the second largest fast-food burger chain globally. To that end, he had the company initiate a three-prong strategy of evaluation of operations, personnel moves, and structural changes and improvements to fortify the company.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the USB Promoters Group {{announced}} the <b>finalization</b> of the USB Power Delivery (PD) Specification (USB PD rev. 1), an extension that specifies using certified PD aware USB cables with standard USB Type-A and Type-B connectors to deliver increased power (more than 7.5W) to devices with larger power demand. Devices can request higher currents and supply voltages from compliant hosts up to 2A at 5V (for a power consumption {{of up to}} 10W), and optionally up to 3A or 5A at either 12V (36W or 60W) or 20V (60W or 100W). In all cases, both host-to-device and device-to-host configurations are supported.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Ape Escape lasted approximately two-and-a-half years. Shortly after the development team began conceiving {{the design and}} concept for Ape Escape, they attended a meeting regarding the {{development of}} the DualShock. Intrigued by the potential of the controller, the team implemented its use in Ape Escape, making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay. Conceptualizing the controls for the controller's analog sticks was the greatest challenge for the team, and the controls underwent great testing prior to <b>finalization.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vince Gilligan and John August rewrote Ngo's script, and Jonathan Mostow was {{attached}} to direct the film. Under Mostow's supervision, a ten-page treatment was written to be pitched to Will Smith to portray the lead role in the film. Neither Mostow nor Smith was yet committed to make the project an active priority at the time. Several studios pursued the opportunity to finance the film, and Columbia Pictures succeeded in acquiring the prospect in February 2005. A second draft was scripted by Gilligan following the <b>finalization</b> of the deal with Columbia. The film was initially slated for a holiday 2006 release.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the <b>finalization</b> of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{appointed}} Abel P. Upshur, {{a popular}} Secretary of the Navy and close adviser, as his new Secretary of State, and nominated Gilmer to fill Upshur's former office. Tyler and Upshur began quiet {{negotiations with the}} Texas government, promising military protection from Mexico {{in exchange for a}} commitment to annexation. Secrecy was necessary, as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments. Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to garner support among Northern voters, who were wary of admitting a new pro-slavery state. By January 1844 Upshur told the Texas government that he had found a large majority of senators in favor of an annexation treaty. The republic remained skeptical, and <b>finalization</b> of the treaty took until the end of February.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. <b>Finalization</b> of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1955, deHavilland married Pierre Galante, an {{executive}} {{editor for the}} French journal Paris Match. Her marriage to Galante prompted her relocation to Paris. The couple separated in 1962, but continued {{to live in the}} same house for another six years to raise their daughter together. Galante moved across the street and the two remained close, even after the <b>finalization</b> of the divorce in 1979. She looked after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956. After studying law at the Université de Droit de Nanterre School of Law, she worked as a journalist in France and the United States. Since 1956, deHavilland has lived in the same three-story house near Bois de Boulogne park in the Rive Droite section of Paris.|$|E
5|$|The project's <b>finalization</b> {{lasted for}} two years due to the {{intention}} of the team behind it to improve it as much as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E
25|$|A {{partnership}} between AMD and Alpha Processor Inc. developed HyperTransport, a point-to-point interconnect standard which {{was turned over}} to an industry standards body for <b>finalization.</b> It is now used in modern motherboards that are compatible with AMD processors.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} conference, JCPS Representative Pat Todd {{emphasized that the}} current assignment plan would remain in effect for the 2007–2008 school year, citing the <b>finalization</b> of budgets, staffing, assignments and busing as prevailing reasons for no change being logistically possible.|$|E
25|$|On December 8 the Cardinals {{announced}} the <b>finalization</b> {{of a deal}} to sign Brad Penny, who spent 2009 as a starter for the Red Sox and Giants, to a one-year deal for $7.5 million with an additional $1.5 million in incentives.|$|E
25|$|The First Congress, {{and with}} it first impressions, {{concluded}} the following month in October, with <b>finalization</b> of a Petition to the King, which was signed by all delegates including Harrison, and requested the King's attention to the colonies' grievances and restoration of harmony with the crown.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} towards the <b>finalization</b> of Interlingua {{were taken in}} 1937, when a {{committee}} of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary. However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.|$|E
25|$|Ad hoc studies, {{performed}} in the U.S., however, suggest that between 10 and 25 percent of adoptions disrupt before they are legally finalized and from 1 to 10 percent are dissolved after legal <b>finalization.</b> The wide range of values reflects the paucity {{of information on the}} subject and demographic factors such as age; it is known that older children are more prone to having their adoptions disrupted.|$|E
25|$|Disruption {{refers to}} the {{termination}} of an adoption. This includes adoptions that end prior to legal <b>finalization</b> and those that end after that point (in U.S. law, the latter cases {{are referred to as}} having been dissolved). The Disruption process is usually initiated by adoptive parents via a court petition and is analogous to divorce proceedings. It is a legal avenue unique to adoptive parents as disruption/dissolution does not apply to biological kin.|$|E
25|$|Pre-production {{took about}} four months, which include <b>finalization</b> {{of the script}} (which {{included}} translation of the original English-language script into Indonesian) and the work on choreography for the fighting sequences, which were designed by Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. The actors {{that make up the}} key members of the police squad were sent to bootcamp military training with KOPASKA, where they learned how to use weapons, and how to perform strategic attack and defense techniques.|$|E
25|$|There are two African {{currency}} unions: the West African Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) and the Central African Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). Both use the CFA franc {{as their}} legal tender. The {{idea of a}} single currency union across Africa has been floated, and plans exist to have it established by 2020, though many issues, such as bringing continental inflation rates below 5 percent, remain hurdles in its <b>finalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>finalization</b> of {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} Marina and her sister ship, plus an option for a third, was reached on 18 June 2007. The Marina is a mid-sized ship, at 66,000tons and was designed by the Yran & Storbraaten (Y) architectural firm. The keel of Marina was laid on 10 March 2009 and included the welding of a U.S. silver dollar coin and a pre-Castro Cuban peso coin in the keel and is believed to bring fortune to the ship, its passengers and crew during their seagoing life.|$|E
25|$|A {{commission}} by the Teatro San Carlo in Naples {{in early}} 1857 led Verdi {{to begin to}} oversee the <b>finalization</b> of the libretto (also by Somma) for Re Lear {{with the aim of}} presenting the finished opera during the 1858 carnival season. When this proved to be impracticable, Verdi turned to the subject of King Gustav III's assassination as portrayed in Scribe and Auber's opera, albeit not an historically accurate narrative. That subject was well known and had been used by other composers, including Saverio Mercadante for his Il reggente in 1843.|$|E
25|$|Within days of its passage, United Aircraft and Transport Company (UATC) {{acquired}} the controlling interest of National Air Transport after a brisk but brief struggle between UATC and Clement M. Keys of NAT. The merger, begun in February 1930 {{to plug the}} only gap in UATC's cross-country network of airlines, had been amicable until three weeks before its <b>finalization,</b> when Keys reversed his initial approval. Ironically Brown was angered by the negotiations, worried that {{the specter of a}} potential monopoly would endanger the imminent passage of the Air Mail Act. The merger swiftly created the first transcontinental airline.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, American envoy Townsend Harris, {{while on}} his way to Japan, was delayed in Bangkok for a month by <b>finalization</b> of the Burney Treaty, but had only to {{negotiate}} a few minor points to convert it into the 1856 American Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Siam. The Bowring treaty in particular ensured that foreign powers would not intervene in Siam's internal affairs, and allowed for Siam to remain independent. The Bowring Treaty is now credited with having led to the economic development of Bangkok, as it created a framework in which multilateral trade could operate freely in Southeast Asia, notably between China, Singapore, and Siam.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 2010, Grammer {{announced}} {{that he was going to}} be a father for the fifth time with girlfriend Kayte Walsh, a British flight attendant 25 years his junior. However, in October, Grammer {{announced that}} Walsh had miscarried six weeks earlier. The couple announced their engagement in December 2010, and married at The Plaza Hotel in New York City on February 25, 2011, two weeks after the <b>finalization</b> of Grammer's third divorce. Grammer and Walsh have a daughter, Faith Evangeline Elisa (born July 13, 2012), and two sons, Kelsey Gabriel Elias (born July 22, 2014) and Auden James Ellis born (November 14, 2016).|$|E
25|$|By {{purchasing}} {{and developing}} upon Project Reality's graphics supercomputing platform, Nintendo and its Dream Team could begin prototyping their games according to SGI's estimated console performance profile, {{prior to the}} <b>finalization</b> of the console hardware specifications. When the Ultra 64 hardware was finalized, that supercomputer-based prototyping platform was later supplanted by a much cheaper and fully accurate console simulation board to be hosted within a low-end SGI Indy workstation in July 1995. SGI's early performance estimates based upon its supercomputing platform were ultimately reported to have been fairly accurate to the final Ultra 64 product, allowing LucasArts developers to port their Star Wars game prototype to console reference hardware in only three days.|$|E
25|$|Time {{was further}} {{dramatically}} reduced {{with the opening}} of the Gotthard Road Tunnel and the <b>finalization</b> of the northern part of A2 motorway through the Urner Reusstal, with many additional tunnels (then leading from Basel to the Gotthard Road Tunnel), in 1980. With the completion in 1986 of the A2 motorway in the Valle Leventina, the huge valley leading from Airolo down to Bellinzona, and the surmounting of the Monte Ceneri between Bellinzona and Lugano in 1983, finally a continuous motorway was established from the northern border of Switzerland in Basel to the southern border in Chiasso, or the shortest motorway route from North-German Hamburg as far as South-Italian Sicilly, bringing down the competitiveness of the railway line.|$|E
25|$|Notre Dame University–Louaize (NDU) {{was founded}} by the Maronite Order of The Holy Virgin Mary (OMM). Since its {{foundation}} in 1695 A.D. , the Order promoted education and improved {{the lives of people}} it serves in Lebanon. In 1978, the Order started a new project. Reverend Bechara Boutros Rahi (a former member of the Order and current Maronite Patriarch) founded, in cooperation with Beirut University College (BUC) now the Lebanese American University (LAU), the Louaize College for Higher Education (LCHE), the nucleus of today's NDU. The legal <b>finalization</b> of this project was the promulgation by the President of The Lebanese Republic of the decree number 4116 on August 14, 1987, granting the right to operate an independent university.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2006, Chelsea, Manchester United and Lyn {{reached a}} {{settlement}} {{to resolve the}} future of the player. Mikel's registration was to be transferred from Lyn to Chelsea; Manchester United agreed to terminate their option agreement with Mikel. Under the terms of this agreement, Chelsea agreed to pay United £12million, half paid upon the <b>finalization</b> of the contract and the other half in June 2007, and Lyn £4million, half payable immediately and half in June 2007. As a result of this settlement, all claims in this matter were withdrawn. On 19 July 2006, Chelsea were granted a work permit for the midfielder after they completed the £16million signing in June 2006.|$|E
25|$|Open {{adoption}} allows {{identifying information}} to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child. As of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements {{to be included in}} the adoption <b>finalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October, Loos and {{her brother}} Clifford checked Emerson into a very {{expensive}} sanatorium, where {{he was diagnosed with}} schizophrenia. Loos, who had always left the finances to Emerson, soon discovered that most of her money was no longer in joint accounts but in his own private accounts. Overworked at the studio and under stress from Emerson, she became more and more depressed. After 17 years of his nonsense, she finally asked Emerson for a divorce, and he agreed. Loos promptly bought herself out of her United Artists contract and re-signed with MGM, and bought a beach-front house in Santa Monica. Emerson would continue to find ways to stave off any talk of divorce plans, making <b>finalization</b> impossible. When Emerson was deemed well enough to leave the sanatorium, she paid for a nurse to care for him in an apartment of his own.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2012, the NTC {{released}} a 15-page draft {{law that would}} regulate {{the election of a}} national assembly charged with writing a new constitution and forming a second caretaker government. The proposed law laid out more than 20 classes of people who would be prohibited from standing as candidates in the elections, including Libyans who had ties to Muammar Gaddafi, former officials accused of torturing Libyans or embezzling public funds, active members of the Revolutionary Guard, opposition members who made peace with Gaddafi and academics who wrote about Gaddafi's The Green Book. The draft bill also stipulated that 10% of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly would be reserved for women. The <b>finalization</b> of the election law would be followed by the appointment of an election commission to divide the country into constituencies and oversee the poll, to be held in June.|$|E
25|$|The project's hour-long {{pilot was}} ordered {{concurrently}} with the <b>finalization</b> {{of the aforementioned}} development deal, and was written, directed, and produced by Ball. Cast members Paquin, Kwanten and Trammell were announced in February 2007 and Moyer later on in April. The pilot {{was shot in the}} early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August, at which point Ball had already written several more episodes. Production on the series began later that fall, with Brook Kerr, who portrayed Tara Thornton in the original pilot, replaced by Rutina Wesley. Two more episodes of the series had been filmed before the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike shut down production of the 12-episode first season until 2008. That September, after only the first two episodes of the series had aired, HBO placed an order for a second season of 12 episodes, with production scheduled to commence in January 2009 for a summer premiere.|$|E
25|$|Former President Joseph Estrada {{expressed}} condemnation {{towards the}} rebels {{saying that a}} peace talk with them would not work and believes a declaration of an all-out war against them is only {{the solution to the}} peace process in Mindanao. Former President Fidel V. Ramos remains supportive of the peace process even though he explains that the <b>finalization</b> of the peace process may be after President Benigno Aquino III's term. Despite his expression of support towards the peace process, Ramos still criticized Aquino saying “There should be no hesitation {{on the part of the}} commander in chief. Otherwise, it will be part of your legacy to be always hesitant, flip-flopping.” He criticized Aquino, who is also the commander-in-chief of the PNP and the AFP, for his apparent poor strategic direction and asserts that it is the soldier, the policeman, the law enforcer, the guardian of security that suffers because of his decisions. Ramos also insists that Aquino should have made consultation with retired police officers and soldiers before the security operation in Mamasapano.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, the Department of Administration {{branched}} {{out of the}} Faculty of Engineering and constituted the actual Faculty of Administration Sciences. In 1985, the Professorial Statute Committee was created to determine the procedures related to the professorial career. The same year, the first agreements {{for the development of}} joint research projects were signed with the Ministry of National Education, COLCIENCIAS, the UNESCO, and the OAS, among others. This agreements are the cornerstone for the development in the 1990s of the Doctoral degrees offered by the university. Also, in the 1980s, and thanks to the establishment of a revenue stamp by the Congress of the Republic, the University began the establishment of its satellite campuses. [...] At first, the courses presented in this campuses were only foundation courses, which required to the students its <b>finalization</b> in the main campus to obtain their degrees, until 1995, when all the satellite campuses allowed the <b>finalization</b> of the program.|$|E
