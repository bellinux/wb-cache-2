5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{strictly}} Protestant James I {{wished to}} end the practice, he found himself having to touch {{an increasing number of}} people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the growing public <b>demand.</b> <b>On</b> 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E
5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E

5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A320neo family {{aircraft}} {{ordered in}} 2011 {{were to be}} delivered starting 2015. However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft {{to cope with the}} <b>demand.</b> <b>On</b> 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo the flexibility to convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and fly on longer routes. The order of 250 jets was Airbus' single largest order by number of aircraft. Indigo received the first A320neo in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel frame {{was also a}} first for the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E

5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest employer, and nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} additional traffic and added to the <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> city services, it also generated $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and a half-million in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railroad}} in Indiana {{was built}} in Shelbyville in the late 1830s. The first major line was completed in 1847, connecting Madison with Indianapolis. By the 1850s, the railroad began to become popular in Indiana. The railroad brought major changes to Indiana and enhanced the state's economic growth. Although Indiana's natural waterways connected it to the South via cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans, the new rail lines ran East-West, and connected Indiana with the economies of the northern states. As late as mid-1859, no rail line yet bridged the Ohio or Mississippi rivers. Because of an increased <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the state's resources and the embargo against the Confederacy, the rail system was mostly completed {{by the end of}} the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{attempted to}} prohibit {{the use of}} copper currency in border regions and in seaports, but the Song-issued copper coin became common in the Liao, Western Xia, Japanese, and Southeast Asian economies. The Song government would turn to other types of material for its currency in order to ease the <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the government mint, including the issuing of iron coinage and paper banknotes. In the year 976, the percentage of issued currency using copper coinage was 65%; after 1135, this had dropped significantly to 54%, a government attempt to debase the copper currency.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for a heart}} with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the interrelationships between the School of Education and the rest of the {{university}} by means of the course demands placed by elementary education majors and graduate education students on other academic departments during the fall terms of 1972 and 1973. It also examined the course <b>demands</b> placed <b>on</b> the School of Education by other major groups for this period. The Induced Course Load Matrix (ICLM) was the vehicle used in this examination. The hypothesis tested were 1) that elementary education majors and graduate education students placed equal course <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> the other academic departments, 2) that other major groups place equal course <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> the School of Education, and 3), that course demands by these three groups were consistent over time. Results indicated that elementary education majors and graduate education students did not place equal <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> other academic departments. Elementary education majors place the greatest course demands, as might be expected, on departments where there are course requirements such as Psychology, English, General Science, Mathematics and Speech. However, this group also placed heavy course <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> the History Department even though there are no required courses. Graduate education students placed course <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> other academic departments similar to elementary education majors, especially in the Departments of Psychology, English and History...|$|R
