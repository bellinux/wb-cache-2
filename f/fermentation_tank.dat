A variety of heat exchanger designs are used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style.

It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures, and will start to die in temperatures above [...] After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> A type of yeast is selected and added, or [...] "pitched", to the <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> When the yeast is added to the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn into alcohol, carbon dioxide and other components.

[...] Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate. After conditioning for a week to several months, the beer may be filtered and force carbonated for bottling, or fined in the cask.|$|E

5000|$|Within 24 {{hours of}} picking, the cherry is {{run through a}} pulper. The beans are {{separated}} from the pulp and then placed overnight in a <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank.</b> The fermentation time is about 12 hours at low elevation or 24 at higher elevation. The beans are rinsed and spread to dry on a hoshidana or drying rack. Traditional hoshidanas have a rolling roof to cover the beans in rain. It takes seven to 14 days to dry beans to an optimal moisture level of between 10 and 13% (by Hawaii Department of Agriculture regulations: 9.0-12.0%). Too much moisture content in coffee allows the growth of ochratoxin A, a harmful mycotoxin, hazardous to human health. From here, the beans are stored as [...] "pergamino" [...] or parchment. The parchment is milled off the green bean prior to roasting or wholesale.|$|E

5000|$|Elynour is a {{character}} in the poem who runs a [...] "public house," [...] or pub. Many pubs in England did have {{the look of a}} home both inside and out. In the early 16th century, the male or female owner of the pub not only sold the ale, but also probably brewed it. Elynour easily acquires all her ingredients for quite acceptable ale from the local farmers in southern England where her pub was apparently located. Nevertheless, the kind of hard language which is found in the poem, is not uncommon as [...] "bar talk." [...] Today, much like in the 16th century, many brands of beer have been derisively referred to as [...] "pig piss" [...] perhaps because of beer's pale yellowish color and its bland and very slightly bitter taste. The poet says that chickens roost over Elynour's <b>fermentation</b> <b>tank</b> and drop their excrement into the froth. The yeast will sometimes form a white cap on the fermenting beer. Alcoholic beverages are also often associated with sex and indeed will sometimes reduce the inhibitions of men and women.
