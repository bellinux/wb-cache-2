25|$|Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) is the dim-witted, vain, and miserly anchorman of the Six O'Clock News. He {{frequently}} makes {{mistakes and}} is {{oblivious to the}} actual nature of the topics covered on the show, but considers himself to be the country's best news journalist. He is often criticized by others, especially Murray and Lou for his many shortcomings, but is never fired from his position. Initially a comic buffoon in the series, Ted's better nature is gradually revealed as the series unfolds, helped along by <b>his</b> <b>sweet</b> but sometimes perceptive girlfriend Georgette.|$|E

500|$|Priestley {{engaged in}} {{numerous}} {{political and religious}} pamphlet wars. According to Schofield, [...] "he entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was willfully and maliciously wrong. He was able, then, to contrast <b>his</b> <b>sweet</b> reasonableness to their personal rancor", but as Schofield points out Priestley rarely altered his opinion {{as a result of}} these debates. While at Leeds he wrote controversial pamphlets on the Lord's Supper and on Calvinist doctrine; thousands of copies were published, making them some of Priestley's most widely read works.|$|E

500|$|Money is an {{important}} motivator for the characters: both Wilton and Nola come from modest backgrounds and wish to enter the Hewett family using their sex appeal. That family's secure position is demonstrated by their large country estate, and, early on in their relationships, both prospective spouses are supported by Mr. Hewett, Wilton with a position on [...] "one of his companies" [...] and Nola reports being [...] "swept off her feet" [...] by Hewett's attention and presents. Roger Ebert posed the film's underlying question as [...] "To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness?

500|$|Robert Story, {{known as}} [...] "the Craven Poet", {{was born at}} Wark on Tweed in 1795. [...] His father was an {{agricultural}} labourer, and the family moved frequently around the Northumberland villages. [...] When just 10 years old, Story ran away to accompany a lame fiddler on an excursion through the Scottish Borders for a month, and {{about a year later}} the family moved to Howtel, where Story attended the local school. [...] He later claimed that this was where [...] "I learned nearly all that I ever learned from a Master—namely to read badly, to write worse, and to cipher a little farther, perhaps than to the Rule of Three." [...] There he was introduced to Divine Songs for Children, and discovered a love of poetry while reading on the hills, where he was employed as a shepherd. [...] By 1820 he had moved to Gargrave in North Yorkshire where he opened a school, and in 1825 published a volume of poetry, Craven Blossoms. [...] Algernon Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, became a patron in 1857 and financed an edition of his works. [...] In 1859 Story was invited to Ayr for the centenary celebrations of Robert Burns, where he recited his poem on Burns. [...] The Bradfordian considered that [...] "he stands high among the minor poets of Great Britain, and many of <b>his</b> <b>sweet</b> lyrics will most assuredly descend to and be highly admired by posterity, and by none more than Yorkshiremen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of <b>his</b> <b>sweet</b> and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E

500|$|Kenshin {{has been}} highly {{popular with the}} Rurouni Kenshin reader base, having ranked first in every Weekly Shōnen Jump {{popularity}} poll of the series, always with {{more than double the}} votes of the second place character. Two polls by the official Rurouni Kenshin anime featured Kenshin as one of the series' most popular characters. In the first, Kenshin was at the top, while in the second, he placed second. His Battōsai incarnation was also fifth in the latter poll. Kenshin has also been featured various times in the Animages Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking {{as one of the most}} popular male anime characters. In a Newtype poll in March 2010, Kenshin was voted the eighth most popular male anime character from the 1990s. An abundance of merchandise have been released in Kenshin's likeness including keychains, action figures, and plush dolls. Since the manga was published, non-functional and functional sakabatō have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans. In a poll by Anime News Network, Kenshin was voted as the second best male anime character with long hair, being surpassed by Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist. In 2014, IGN ranked him as the fifth greatest anime character of all time, saying that: [...] "Although Kenshin's momentary lapses make him a complete badass and set the stage for some of the most epic sword battles ever animated, Kenshin always goes back to <b>his</b> <b>sweet</b> persona once the danger is gone." [...] Kenshin was also fifth in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie describing him as: [...] "A classic example of a classic anime type, the peace-loving killing machine." [...] Kenshin's Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki technique has ranked third in a Japanese survey that featured the most popular moves in manga and anime. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the top [...] "guy".

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Léonce Rosenberg (September 1920) Jean Metzinger wrote {{of a return to}} nature that {{appeared}} to him both constructive and not at all a renunciation of Cubism. His exhibition at l'Effort Moderne at the outset of 1921 was exclusively of landscapes: his formal vocabulary remained rhythmic, linear perspective was avoided. There was a motivation to unite the pictorial and the natural. Christopher Green writes: [...] "The willingness to adapt Cubist language to the look of nature was quickly to affect his figure painting too. From that exhibition of 1921 Metzinger continued to cultivate a style that was not only less obscure, but clearly took subject-matter as its starting point far more than an abstract play with flat pictorial elements." [...] Green continues: Yet, style, in the sense of his own special way of handling form and color, remained for Metzinger the determining factor, something imposed on his subjects to give them their special pictorial character. <b>His</b> <b>sweet,</b> rich colour between 1921 and 1924 was unashamedly artificial, and is itself symptomatic of the fact that his return to lucid representation did not mean a return to nature approached naturalistically... Metzinger himself, writing in 1922 [...] could claim quite confidently that this was not at all a betrayal of Cubism but a development within it. 'I know works,' he said, 'whose thoroughly classical appearance conveys the most personal [...] the newest conceptions... Now that certain Cubists have pushed their constructions so far as to take in clearly objective appearances, it has been declared that Cubism is dead [...] it approaches realization.' ...|$|E
