5|$|Plante's {{first foray}} into {{organized}} hockey came at age 12. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play {{since there was no}} other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number one goaltender.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans invaded Wallachia and Moldavia {{at the end}} of 1474. Matthias sent {{reinforcements}} {{under the}} command of Blaise Magyar to Stephen the Great. Their united forces routed the invaders in the Battle of Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Fearing a new Ottoman invasion, the Prince of Moldavia swore fealty to Matthias on 15 August. Sultan Mehmed II proposed peace but Matthias refused him. Instead, he stormed into Ottoman territory and captured Šabac, an important fort on the river Száva, on 15 February 1476. During the siege, Matthias barely escaped capture while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the fortress from a boat.|$|E

5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from professional play, Thompson became {{the head coach}} of the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 1940–41 season. He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times. He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940–41 season. During World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942–43 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders brought him back onto the ice in March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8–4 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3–1 loss to Currie Army. After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He {{was one of the few}} scouts at the time who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability. Thompson often conversed with players as part of an effort to learn about the players <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching.</b>|$|E
5|$|Our Friends in the North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of Our Friends in the North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title Our Friends in the North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E

25|$|Charlie O'Brien, {{a former}} major league {{baseball}} catcher, after getting smashed in his mask by two consecutive foul-tip balls in a game, O'Brien had {{the idea for a}} new catcher's mask (a helmet, actually) while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> a hockey game. He worked with Van Velden Mask Inc., of Stoney Creek, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to develop his idea. The new design, called the All-Star MVP, was approved in 1996 by Major League Baseball. The company is a maker of hockey goalie masks and equipment and was named after the owner of the company, Gerry Van Velden.|$|E

Mainly <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> his partner take charge of the game, but of the 276 balls sent down during their time together Evans took 97 of them, and not only helped to save the team from certain defeat, but also enabled Compton to join the select band who have compiled a century in each innings of a Test.|$|E

25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> {{the television show}} called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not a science fiction story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son having {{to go out and get}} rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E

The show utilises a laugh track, which the Post-Gazette described as following [...] "an unwritten primetime rule: all half-hour shows, except animated comedies...must have a laugh track" [...] and Hollywood.com's Peter Hall calls a [...] "goof" [...] that [...] "crippled" [...] the first few episodes" [...] of the show.

500|$|Going {{into the}} 2008 season, there were {{questions}} surrounding Garko's ability to improve as a hitter. During {{the early part}} of the season, Michael Aubrey was playing more than Garko because Garko was having trouble hitting right-handed pitching. Garko was moved down the batting order because of his struggles. In August, Garko stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> videotape in an attempt to pick up his hitting. On August 6, he was benched for three games by manager Eric Wedge for failing to run on a ground ball he hit. On September 27, Garko hit two home runs, including a grand slam against the Chicago White Sox. At the end of the season, Garko hit [...]273 with 21 doubles, one triple, 14 home runs and 90 RBIs in 141 games. His 90 RBI tied Grady Sizemore for the team lead.|$|E
