500|$|Zinta's next {{release of}} 2006 was Shirish Kunder's romantic musical Jaan-E-Mann, a story {{set in the}} United States about two men, played by Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its {{eventual}} box office profit was poor. Zinta {{played the role of}} Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an [...] "ornament throughout," [...] but further stated that she [...] "comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, a moment that makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> instead of forcing her to sob copiously. She doesn't have much to do in Jaan-E-Mann, but looks appropriately attractive." [...] Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, as Jaan-E-Mann was [...] "easy, happy and much more simple".|$|E
