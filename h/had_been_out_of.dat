5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of 26 September, the Germans pressed home their attacks and finally linked up from both sides at the river. It was not until about noon that they {{realised}} the British had actually withdrawn. Later in the day, they rounded up about 600 men, mostly {{the men in the}} aid stations and those left on the north bank, as well as some pockets of resistance that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> radio contact with division Headquarters and did not know about the withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann's {{political}} efforts {{picked up}} speed, and on 10December 1914 {{he met with}} Herbert Samuel, a British Cabinet member and a secular Jew who had studied Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmann's demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, {{for the first time}} since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the Conservative Party in their role as Official Opposition.|$|E
5|$|Between February and June 1806, Emerald {{underwent}} repairs at Deptford dockyard and was recommissioned under Captain John Armour; Frederick Lewis Maitland assumed {{command in}} the first quarter of 1807. While in the Basque Roads in April, Emerald captured the 14-gun privateer Austerlitz, a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont. Emerald, while escorting a Spanish polacca that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase. Austerlitz <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship Prince of Asturias, which had sailed from La Guayra with a cargo of cocoa, bark and indigo. Emerald sent both prizes into Plymouth, where they arrived on 22 April. Emerald herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La Guayra.|$|E

5|$|Boycott {{has responded}} to these accusations by {{pointing}} out that Lillee <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cricket for 21 months suffering from a serious back complaint and that Thomson had not played in Tests for 23 months before the 1974–5 Ashes series, since an unsuccessful debut Test against Pakistan (Thomson's match figures were 0–110). Furthermore, he was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best 261 not out against a West Indies Board President's XI. All of these teams included Roberts, with a young Holding representing the Board XI.|$|E
5|$|Former Boston Bruins' coach Harry Sinden, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hockey {{since leaving}} the Bruins in 1970, was {{suggested}} by the media as {{a good candidate for}} the job of Team Canada's coach. Ron Brown, a sportswriter from Kingston, Ontario called Sinden and in the interview, Sinden admitted that he was available and willing to take the position. After a phone call from Sinden to Alan Eagleson, it was arranged for Sinden to have an interview with Hockey Canada's steering committee for the series in June. After the one interview, Hockey Canada selected Sinden for the position. Sinden selected former player John Ferguson as his assistant coach, after initially trying to recruit Ferguson as a player.|$|E
5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming {{directly involved in the}} patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Division {{began to}} move from Australia to the island of Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies, where the Borneo {{campaign}} would be staged, in March 1945. The division had seen extensive combat in North Africa and New Guinea, and its officers and enlisted men were well trained for amphibious operations and jungle warfare. However, the 9th Division <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action since early 1944, leading to poor morale among its combat units. A large number of support, logistics and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) units {{were assigned to the}} division for the operations at Brunei Bay, taking its strength to over 29,000 personnel (including 1,097 in United States and British units).|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of 5th Mounted Brigade decided to retire towards the Suez Canal, {{and the two}} squadrons from Romani joined him, abandoning much equipment to ride overnight to Bir el Nuss. Wiggin arrived at Dueidar at 09:00 on 24 April with two squadrons. The 5th Mounted Brigade had been completely surprised; its commander and his important reserve force <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position at a critical time following false intelligence, and could not support his regiments. The {{three and a half}} squadrons at Oghratina and Katia were decimated—almost all were killed, wounded or captured.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

5|$|In {{part due}} to the ongoing violent {{political}} confrontations in the Kansas, opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Frémont and William Dayton. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.|$|E
