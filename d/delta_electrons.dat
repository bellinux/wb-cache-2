High-energy <b>delta</b> <b>electrons</b> in cosmic data are studied which are produced by cosmic muons through ionisation of the inner detector material. A method of separating knock-on electrons from the large background of muon bremsstrahlung is presented accounting for the special nature of cosmic events and utilizing the ATLAS tools to identify electrons with their characteristic properties.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} simulation {{study of}} the feasibility of an earlier proposed tau-neutrino appearance experiment based on a RICH with liquid radiator (C// 6 F// 1 // 4) has been performed. Tau leptons, that are created in charged current interactions of incident tau neutrinos with the same momentum spectrum {{as that of the}} planned Gran Sasso beam (average 17 GeV/c), have an average track length of about 0. 5 mm. Cherenkov photons emitted in the liquid radiator from the short track of the tau lepton provide a characteristic pattern for tau- neutrino appearance. In the present report it is shown, on the basis of simulations performed with the GEANT 4 code, that Cherenkov radiation from <b>delta</b> <b>electrons,</b> originating from the interaction of the long-lived tau decay products with the Cherenkov radiator, constitutes a severe background that renders the detection of the millimeter-short tau track unfeasible. Increasing the incident neutrino beam momentum results in longer tau tracks and therefore more signal photons, but this does not solve the background problem since the kink angle between the tau track and the secondary decay particle decreases with increasing neutrino momentum, leading to an increased overlap between the Cherenkov rings of these two particles...|$|E

Their purpose is to extract keypoints from the data as input to higher level reconstruction algorithms, replacing the role of human operators in event selection and reconstruction guidance. Simulations of nu(mu) + Ar- 40 -> mu(-) + p events with a nu(mu) energy of 0. 7 GeV in a small liquid argon time projection chamber are used as a concrete example of a modern high granularity tracking detector. Data from the simulations are used to characterize the localization of interest points to physical features and the efficiency of finding interest points associated with the primary vertex and track ends is measured at the chosen beam energy. A high degree of localization is found, with 93 % of detected interest points found within 5 mm of a physical feature at the simulated energy of 0. 7 GeV. Working in two 2 D projections, the primary vertex and both track ends are found in both projections in 85 % of events at 0. 7 GeV.

The much shorter metal-metal distances in these complexes relative to M(2) Cl(10) (4 -) (M = Mo, W) are shown to arise solely from electronic differences between chlorine and phosphine donors. Due to inversion of the delta and delta orbitals, the complexes M(2) Cl(6) (PH(3)) (4) and M(2) Cl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) (M = Mo, W) are found to possess formal metal-metal double bonds. The periodic trends in metal-metal bonding in these systems are rationalized in terms of the energetic contributions of orbital overlap (DeltaE(ovlp)) and spin polarization (DeltaE(spe)). The reduction in DeltaE(spe) and increase in DeltaE(ovlp) on replacement of axial chlorides with phosphine both favor stronger metal-metal bonding in the phosphine-based complexes. The strong linear dependence observed between DeltaE(spe) and DeltaE(ovlp) enables the metal-metal bonding in these systems to be predicted simply from single-ion spin-polarization energies. The antiferromagnetic coupling in M(2) Cl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) (M = Mo, W) and MoWCl(6) (H(2) PCH(2) PH(2)) (2) is shown to be mostly due to coupling of the metal <b>delta</b> <b>electrons,</b> with a smaller contribution from the pi electrons, particularly for the dimolybdenum complex...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} work on {{adaptation of the}} Cellular Automaton (CA) track finder [1] to the realistic STS geometry with overlapping sensors allowed to recover the high tracks-finding efficiency [2] which it has had for the simplified STS description with sensors of each station arranged at the same Z position (the “same-Z ” geometry). Below we report on a detailed study of the behaviour of the track finder for the realistic STS geometry that addressed the problem of an increased number of clone and ghost tracks relative to the same-Z geometry. In the realistic STS geometry the sensors overlap, the hits within the same station have different Z coordinates, and also the detector contains more material. A larger number of hits (both true and fake) is produced in the sensor overlap regions giving more than 1 hit per track per station, additional hits also coming from the increased number of <b>delta</b> <b>electrons.</b> To reduce the combinatorics we optimized the X- and Y-windows used in the track candidate search based on the pull distributions, Fig. 1. The main component of the clones turned out to consist of short pieces of long MC tracks, broken due to hits, which did not fit into the Y-window at the step of the doublet creation. These broken tracks (∼ 4 %) become effectively lost for analysis, since one of the pieces has low spatial accuracy, and the other has bad momentum resolution.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on work done in two {{different}} experimental projects. The first project, the Tau RICH, is a previously proposed tau-neutrino appearance experiment for the CERN neutrino beam at the Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy. The proposed experimental concept {{is based on}} the use of focusing RICH detectors with liquid radiator (C 6 F 14). Simulations made with a Geant 4 code show that in the proposed experimental set-up, Cherenkov light from <b>delta</b> <b>electrons</b> will constitute a severe background that in practice would render the experiment unfeasible. The second project, ATLAS, is a general purpose detector at the CERN 14 TeV proton-proton collider LHC which will start operation in 2007. To make the reconstruction and selection of the events in ATLAS more accurate, complete and up-to-date information on the interaction of the produced particles with the detector is needed. A service program code, the Material Integration Service (MIS), has been developed which makes use of the detector descriptions already available in a Geant 4 code and which uses a novel algorithm, based on line integrals evaluated within small volume elements that build up the detector. This code is demonstrated to constitute a practically useful tool of satisfactory performance and accuracy. The charged Higgs boson production in the gluon-bottom quark mode, gb -> tH+, followed by charged Higgs decays into a chargino and a neutralino, is studied for a specific choice of values for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) parameters. It is shown, using a Monte Carlo code to simulate the ATLAS detector and the assumed MSSM physics model, that for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb- 1, in the intermediate region 4 < tanβ < 10 where H+ decays to SM particles cannot be used for H+ discovery, charged Higgs decays to non-SM particles can be used for Higgs discovery at the 5 sigma significance level...|$|E

40|$|Binding two quadruply bonded dimolybdenum units [Mo(2) (DAniF) (3) ](+) (DAniF=N,N'-di-p-anisylformamidinate) {{with two}} chalcogen atoms {{generated}} two molecules {{with a central}} core composed of a cyclic six-membered [Mo(2) ](2) (mu-EH) (2) species (E=S in 1 and O in 3, and [Mo(2) ] is a quadruple-bonded [Mo(2) (formamidinate) (3) ] unit). Aerobic oxidation of 1 and 3 followed by concomitant deprotonation {{gave rise to the}} corresponding [Mo(2) ](2) (mu-E) (2) compounds 2 and 4. The latter show a striking coplanarity and near-bond equalization of the Mo/E cluster. The oxidized species 2 and 4 are diamagnetic in the measured temperature range of 5 to 300 K, which is somewhat unexpected for molecules that have di-metal units with a sigma(2) pi(4) delta(1) electronic configuration. This suggests there are strong interactions between the dimolybdenum units through the E atoms. The large electronic delocalization of the <b>delta</b> <b>electrons</b> over the entire Mo/E core is supported by the exceptionally large potential separation for the two successive one-electron reductions of the linked Mo(2) (5 +) units from the oxidized species (Delta E(1 / 2) = 1. 7 V for the sulfur analogue). This large electronic delocalization has an important effect on the NMR spectroscopic signals for the two sets of methine (N-(CH) -N) protons from the DAniF ligands. Those essentially parallel to the core, H(parallel to), and those essentially perpendicular to the core, H(vertical bar), exhibit downfield and upfield chemical shifts, respectively, that are separated by delta= 1. 32 ppm. The structural, electronic, magnetic, and chemical behaviors for 2 and 4 are consistent with aromaticity, with the [Mo(2) E(2) Mo(2) ] cores that resemble the prototypical benzene molecule. Theoretical studies, including DFT calculations, natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses, and gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR spectroscopic calculations, are also consistent with the aromaticity of the [Mo(2) ](2) (m-E) (2) units being promoted by d(delta) (Mo(2)) -p(pi) (E) pi conjugation. The cyclic pi conjugation of the central moiety in 2 and 4 involves a total of six electrons with 2 e from delta(Mo(2)) and 4 e from p(pi) (E) orbitals, thereby conforming to Huckel's rule when electrons in the MOs with delta character are considered part of the delocalized system.

As being the closest mechanical device to the proton beam, {{it has to be}} operated very carefully and thus needs a secure and automatic control system, which additionally must be efficient and reliable to guarantee an efficient HERA-B data taking. The implementation of the target control system and its performance as well as dedicated studies of target-beam physics are presented. These include the measurement of the aperture limitation, usual target operational position, target efficiency, target independent proton loss in HERA and the scrape velocity of the target. The source of rate fluctuations is investigated in detail; among many dependencies environmental noise has a major impact on the rate fluctuations. Further studies include the analysis of beam position fluctuations and its correlation to the rate fluctuations; the rate changes about a factor of 2, if the beam is changing its position by 10 #mu#m. This rate sensitivity is also verified directly by means of step function measurements. Furthermore the step function measurements can be used to study target-beam dynamics on time scales as short as a second. Experiments to reduce the rate sensitivity - the so called beam tail shaping measurements - are presented as well. During target operation a current, which is proportional to the interaction rate, is measured and used to determine the rate of each single wire.

The thermal and plasma structure of a “prototype” arc is compared to the general features of observed SA arcs. We find that the general features of electron density, Ne, electron temperature, Te, and ion temperature, Ti, are determined by the distribution of the particle precipitation and E × B convection associated with the SA arc. The model results are extended to predict the possible variation of Ne, Te, and Ti due to such arcs at Defense Meteorological Satellite Program altitude. An important parameter in determining the overall density enhancement produced by a SA arc is the speed of plasma flow across the arc. This is demonstrated by calculating the <b>delta</b> total <b>electron</b> content, ΔTEC, enhancement for various values of cross flow.

In accordance with the experimental situation, Lambda {{is assumed to be}} much smaller than the sound wavelength 2 *pi/q. This restricts the absorption of surface phonons at a filling factor ν̅ approx 1 / 2 to electrons occupying extended trajectories of fractal structure. Both piezoelectric and deformation potential interactions of surface acoustic phonons with electrons are considered and the corresponding interaction vertices are derived. These vertices are found to differ from those valid for three-dimensional bulk phonon systems with respect to the phonon wave vector dependence. We derive the appropriate dielectric function varepsilon(omega,q) to describe the effect of screening on the electron-phonon coupling. In the low temperature, high frequency regime T << Delta (omega_q*Lambda /v_D) ^alpha/ 2 /nu, where omega_q is the SAW frequency and v_D is the electron drift velocity, both the attenuation coefficient Gamma and varepsilon(omega,q) are independent of temperature.

In addition, a diffuse basis set (6 - 311 ++G**) was used to calculate electron affinity and LUMO eigenvalues. The calculated electron affinity (EA) provides a classification of the donor/acceptor properties of the studied molecules. Coronene-hexaone shows a high EA, comparable to TCNQ which is a well-known classical acceptor.

Interestingly, only -NH 2 functionalized MWNTs (a-MWNTs) aided in the formation of beta-phase (trans-trans) crystals in PVDF, whereas both the neat blends and the blends with -COOH functionalized MWNTs (c-MWNTs) showed only alpha-phase (trans-gauche-trans-gauche') crystals as inferred from wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Furthermore, blends with only a-MWNTs facilitated in heterogeneous nucleation in the blends manifesting in an increase in the calorimetric crystallization temperature and hence, augmented the theologically determined crystallintion induced phase separation temperature. The dielectric relaxations associated with the crystalline phase of PVDF (alpha(c)) was completely absent in the blends with a-MWNTs in contrast to neat blends and the blends with c-MWNTs in the dielectric loss spectra. The relaxations in the blends investigated here appeared to follow Havriliak-Negami (HN) empirical equations, and, more interestingly, the dynamic heterogeneity in the system could be mapped by an extra relaxation at higher frequency at the crystallization-induced phase separation temperature. The mean relaxation time (tau(HN)) was evaluated and observed to be delayed {{in the presence of}} MWNTs in the blends, more prominently in the case of blends with a-MWNTs. The latter also showed {{a significant increase in the}} dielectric relaxation strength (<b>Delta</b> epsilon). <b>Electron</b> microscopy and selective etching was used to confirm the localization of MWNTs in the amorphous phases of the interspherulitic regions as observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The evolved crystalline morphology, during crystallization-induced phase separation, was observed to have a strong influence on the charge transport processes in the blends. These observations were further supported by the specific interactions (like dipole induced dipole interaction) between a-MWNTs and PVDF, as inferred from FTIR, and the differences in the crystalline morphology as observed from WXRD and polarized optical microscopy (POM) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{yield of}} {{n-butane}} in the fission recoil induced radiolysis of gaseous ethylene {{in the presence}} of small quantities of oxygen is interpreted in terms of competition between radical combination in the track, radical diffusion, and radical removal by oxygen. The differential equations describing these reactions are solved and fitted to experiment by adjusting the initial mean track radius, r(,i), until calculations and observations agree. r(,i) is found to be substantially larger than the radius for physical energy deposition by primary interaction of the recoiling fission fragment or the radius within which secondary <b>electrons</b> (<b>delta</b> rays) deposit their energy. It is proposed that this is largely the result of diffusive spread of precursors to ethyl radical formation. These must survive for approximately 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 9) seconds before competition for second order disappearance sets in. The observed dependence of r(,i) on the reciprocal square root of density is consistent with this postulate. The temperature of the fission recoil track is probed by utilizing the difference in the heats of formation of the isopropyl and normal propyl radicals (3. 6 kcal/mole, 15. 1 joule/mole). End products of the reactions of the isomeric propyl radicals are analyzed in the radiolysis of gaseous propane and a mixture of methane, ammonia and propane with gamma rays or fission recoils at the same density. The product distribution is independant of density in the gamma radiolysis while with fission recoil radiolysis the product distribution varies with density in a manner suggesting an increase in the temperature with density. The temperature measured or effective temperature of the medium is a time average of any initial increase in temperature until its decay to ambient. The effective temperature varies approximately linearly with density from ambient at 5 g/L to 40 (DEGREES) C above ambient at 100 g/L. This is interpreted by invoking diffusive migration of the initial species in the physico-chemical stage for a finite relaxation interval. The dependence of the apparent effective temperature on the density of the medium is consistant with this model and gives a relaxation interval of 2 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 10) seconds. ...|$|R
40|$|A precise {{measurement}} of the energy {{is essential for the}} study of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Basically, two types of detectors are used for this purpose: Surface arrays which sample the shower tail: this method records the lateral development of the shower of secondary particles using an array of particle detectors and Fluorescence detectors which record the longitudinal development of the shower and observe the atmospheric fluorescence induced by charged particles in the shower. The second method is currently the most precise one to estimate the energy of cosmic rays. Fluorescence detectors provide a measurement of primary cosmic ray energy which is relatively model independent, as the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the electromagnetic energy released by the shower into the atmosphere. The main source of systematic uncertainties for energy estimation comes from the limited accuracy in the {{measurement of the}} air-fluorescence yield. A new type of absolute measurement of the nitrogen fluorescence yield in the air will be performed at LAL using 3 items which will yield an very accurate precision in all conditions of pressure, temperature, and pollutants. A 5 MeV electron beam will be provided by the new electron accelerator PHIL at LAL.

40|$|Manned {{exploration}} of space exposes the explorers to a complex and novel radiation environment. The galactic cosmic ray and trapped belt radiation (predominantly proton) components of this environment are relatively constant, and the variations with the solar cycle are well understood and predictable. The level of radiation encountered in low earth orbits is determined by several factors, including altitude, inclination of orbit {{with respect to the}} equator, and spacecraft shielding. At higher altitudes, and on a Mars mission, the level of radiation exposure will increase significantly. A significant fraction of the dose may be delivered by solar particle events which vary dramatically in dose rate and incident particle spectrum. High-LET radiation is of particular concern. High-LET radiation, a component of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), is comprised of a variety of charged particles of various energies (10 MeV/n to 10 GeV/n), including about 87 % photons, 12 % helium ions, and heavy ions (including iron). These high energy particles can cause significant damage to target cells. The different particle types and energies result in different patterns of energy deposition at the molecular and cellular level in a primary target cell. They can also cause significant damage to other, nearby cells as a result of secondary particles. Protons, for instance produce secondaries that include photons, neutrons, pions, heavy particles, as well as gamma rays. Heavy ions deposit energy in a "track" in which the magnitude of the damage varies as the particle loses energy. Heavy ions produce secondary <b>delta</b> rays, or <b>electrons.</b> The distribution of damage through tissue is described by a Bragg curve which will be characteristic for different energies. Needless to say there are differences in the RBE of protons and a particles. High-LET heavy ions are particularly damaging to cells as they do continual damage throughout their track. Differences in these energy deposition patterns can significantly influence the nature of DNA damage and the ability of cellular systems to repair such damage. It has been suspected that these differences also affect the spatial distribution of damage within the DNA of the interphase cell nucleus and produce corresponding differences in endpoints related to health effects. The interaction of a single high-LET particle with chromatin has been suggested to cause multiple double strand breaks within a relatively short distance. In part {{this is due to the}} organization of DNA into chromatin fibers in which distant regions of the DNA helix can be physically juxtaposed by the various levels of coiling of the DNA. This prediction was confirmed by the detection of the generation of double strand DNA fragments of 100 - 2000 bp following exposure to high-LET ions (including iron) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} fully and predict accurately the behaviour of transferred electron devices in materials like GaAs an exact knowledge is required of both {{the structure of the}} conduction band and of the magnitude of the intervalley parameters. High pressure techniques provide a powerful tool for the study of these parameters and details of their application are described in this thesis. Under pressure different band edges move in energy at different rates giving rise to electron transfer between states which leads to information about the relative strengths of the various scattering processes. By extrapolation back to atmospheric pressure the normal position of the various states in energy and k-space may be obtained. The band structure of germanium at high pressures becomes similar to that of silicon at atmospheric pressure, making Delta 1 c minima accessible to direct electrical investigation. Here the temperature dependence of the electron mobility has been measured in both the L 1 c, and Delta 1 c, valleys of germanium. The L 1 c mobility was found to vary with the characteristic T- 1. 5 temperature dependence typical of acoustic deformation potential scattering. On the other hand the <b>Delta</b> 1 c <b>electron</b> mobility was found to vary from ≅ 800 cm 2 v- 1 s- 1 at room temperature to ≅ 6400 cm 2 v- 1 s- 1 at 120 K, corresponding to a temperature dependence of T- 2. 7, similar to that in silicon. The analysis of both the L 1 and Delta 1 c mobilities show that the L 1 c valley mobility is dominated by the acoustic deformation potential scattering whereas the Delta 1 c valley mobility is dominated by the intervalley scattering. Using the effective mass ratios mt = 0. 288, mt = 1. 353 and an acoustic deformation potential of 3. 61 eV gave Delta 1 c intervalley coupling constants as 3. 7 x 108 eV cm- 1 and 2. 9 X 10 8 eV cm- 1 for 430 K-LO and 320 K-LA phonons respectively. A negligible coupling constant was found for the low energy, 100 K-LA phonons in agreement with the already published results for silicon and GaP. To obtain good agreement with the high pressure results the electron effective mass in the Delta 1 c valleys of germanium was found to be about 50 % higher than the measured effective mass in silicon. Since the interpretation of the pressure dependence of the transport properties of semiconductors strongly dependent on the effective mass of electrons, attempts were made to measure this parameter by magneto-phonon technique using ultra-pure material. Although {{it was not possible to}} observe the magneto-phonon oscillations in germanium as a function of pressure, nevertheless pressure effects on ultra-pure material made it possible to determine with some accuracy the pressure coefficients for both the L 1 c and Delta 1 c valleys of germanium. The measured pressure coefficients are: dEL/dP= 4. 8 +/- 0. 2 X 10 - 6 eV bar- 1. dEDelta/dP = - 2. 4 +/- 0. 4 X 10 - 6 eV bar- 1. These values of pressure coefficients are independent of the density of states of the minima involved or their atmospheric pressure energy separation. However, taking the density of states effective mass ratios of mL= 0. 50, mDelta= 1. 58 and mV = 0. 4 for the L 1 c, Delta 1 c minima of the conduction band and the valence band respectively, best fits to the experimental resistivity were obtained giving the energy separation DeltaEL-Delta = 0. 21 +/- 0. 01 eV at atmospheric pressure and (L 1 c - Delta 1 c) band crossover at 29 +/- 2 k. bar. The study of GaAs under uniaxial stress has confirmed the T-L-X conduction band ordering. The resistance of a number of samples with (100) stress was measured up to 10 k- bar using four probe method. No exponential change beyond 5 k-bar was found in contradiction to the observations of previous workers. The analysis of the (100) stress results appear to resolve the discrepancies between the stress and electroreflectance data and suggest that the large value of the shear deformation potential Sigma(xu) = (21 +/- 9) eV, obtained by other workers must be revised downwards and should have a value closer to 8. 0 eV as observed for silicon. A possible explanation as to why those workers obtained such a large value of the deformation potential is also given. The measured electron effective mass in the T 1 c, minimum under uniaxial stress agrees well with the resistance-stress results. It was found that the effective mass is proportional to the applied stress with the constants of proportionality as Deltam* (100) = (0. 23 +/- 0. 06) % k bar- 1 Deltam* (111) = (0. 075 + 0. 015) % k bar- 1...|$|R
