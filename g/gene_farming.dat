40|$|Cloning is a {{scientific}} {{term used to}} describe the process of genetic duplication. The most commonly applied and recent technique is nuclear transfer from somatic cell, in which the nucleus from a body cell transferred to an egg cell to create an embryo that is virtually genetically identical to the donor nucleus. Cloning has started early in the development of biological science during the Theodor Schwann period of cell theory. The application of animal cloning are rapid multiplication of desired livestock, animal preservation, research models, human cell based therapies, xenotransplantation and <b>gene</b> <b>farming.</b> However, cloning of animals is restricted to highly advanced laboratories in developed countries. The problems associated with farm animal cloning has been reviewed and discussed in this paper which includes incomplete reprogramming, placental abnormalities, parturition difficulties, postnatal death, clone specific phenotype and lung emphysema as well as socio-cultural problems. Most of the problems were molecularly explained as the failure of genetic reprogramming. In Ethiopia this type of science is not yet conceived and concerned body should pay attention to such a valuable aspect of biotechnology...|$|E

Diarrheagenic E. coli strains are diverse food-borne pathogens and causes diarrhea with varying virulence in humans. We investigated the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in raw milk from two commercial dairy farms. Four hundred raw milk samples, 200 from each dairy farm, were screened for the presence of fliCH 7, eagR, ial, eagg, lt, and papC <b>genes.</b> In dairy <b>farm</b> A, 100 E. coli were identified based on culture, oxidase and Gram staining, while 88 isolates from dairy farm B were identified in the same manner.

40|$|Atlantic salmon {{breeding}} {{programs were}} first established in Norway {{in the late}} 1960 ´s. Since then, production of farm salmon has steadily increased, and represents the economically most important aquaculture industry in Norway today. Containment represents a major challenge in marine aquaculture, and each year, large numbers of farm salmon escape and enter Norwegian rivers. Experimental evidence suggests that genetic interaction between farm and wild salmon may weaken the viability of wild salmon, but the magnitude of gene flow and its consequences remain elusive. The latter {{have been difficult to}} quantify, partly due to a limited number of diagnostic genetic markers. In the present study, a total of 1309 samples, including 12 different farm strains (four year-classes from each of three breeding companies) and 13 wild populations were analyzed for genetic variation at 4 514 single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNP), included in the 16 k Atlantic salmon Illumina SNP-chip (CIGENE). A set of 105 SNPs were identified as being highly diagnostic in identifying individual fish as of farm or wild origin, regardless of population or strain. These genetic markers will prove useful for identification of farm escapees in wild populations and for monitoring <b>gene</b> flow from <b>farm</b> to wild salmon. The latter requires that hybrids, and ideally, their offspring, can be identified. The performance of the set of SNPs presented here, with regard to the latter, remains to be tested. Once estimates of <b>gene</b> flow from <b>farm</b> to wild salmon are obtained, {{it is also important to}} couple such genetic introgression to potential changes in population fitness in wild populations, i. e. changes in allele frequencies at genetic markers linked to important fitness traits. From the observation of common allele frequencies among farm salmon different from wild salmon we suggest that some of the genetic markers are likely to be affected by directional selection in the breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{questions}} concerning the sedentary settlement in central Norrland: its origins, function and development. This type of settlement appears {{at the start of}} our calendar. The material comprises an almost fully excavated farmstead from the Early Iron Age (1 - 600 A. D.), situated on Genesmon in the parish of Själevad, northern Ångermanland. Particular stress has been put on the description of the individual structures and on {{questions concerning the}} construction and room-division of the houses. The farm's resource utilization, handicrafts and development are also analysed and discussed. The basic material for the thesis has been obtained through archaeological excavations. To a limited degree a comparative method has been used with regard to the form and content of the farm settlement. In addition data has been extracted from the presence, distribution and species of carbonized seeds, which were collected from post-holes, hearths and other features in and around the nine house foundations found hitherto. Contrary to the views of previous research, the results show that even northern Ångermanland obtained sedentary settlement {{at about the same time}} as Hälsingland and Medelpad. With regard to the origin of this settlement a critical examination is made of previous research, which has largely been in agreement that it was a result of colonization from the Mälar Valley. Some circumstances are presented which can be interpreted rather as internal development under influence. The settlement on the excavated site at Gene consists of a farmstead, with a three-aisled long-house and smaller three-aisled houses nearby with special functions. The number of small houses increases with time. Only a few remnants of dividing walls have been encountered. Room analyses show that the long-house was probably divided into six rooms or sections, each with its own function. The general layout and this room-division corresponds well with other contemporary houses in, for example, S. W. Norway and on Jutland. There are however tendencies towards regional differences. During the Migration Period both iron-forging and bronze-casting have taken place on the farm. These handicrafts were probably not carried out by professional smiths. The remains of bronze working show that relief brooches, keys, rings and pins were cast. A preliminary going-through of the literature also shows that bronze-casting was considerably more common on the Migration Period farms in Norden than one generally assumed. The farm on Genesmon is suggested to have been relocated during the 6 th or 7 th century A. D. Since a similar restructuring or movement of settlement can be noted over large parts of Norden during this period, the explanations for the relocation of the <b>Gene</b> <b>farm</b> must be sought in changes in a long-established inter-regional structure. digitalisering@um...|$|R

To determine the reproductive ability of farmed Chinook salmon relative to wild, I compared sperm traits, {{as well as}} fertilization and reproductive success in competitive spawning channels. Farmed Chinook salmon males had greater sperm performance relative to wild males, and they were equally successful at competing for mates and fertilizing eggs. However, farm-sired offspring experienced lower survival to the fry stage, which could mediate any impact on the wild populations. Given that hybridization can lead to negative genetic effects via outbreeding, I also tested the theory of outbreeding depression in backcrossed hybrid (F 2) Chinook salmon using fitness related traits. I {{found no evidence of}} outbreeding depression in Chinook salmon, which further suggests that the introgression of <b>farmed</b> <b>genes</b> into the wild would not result in negative fitness consequences for wild salmon populations...|$|R

The frequency of recessive s <b>gene</b> on the <b>farms</b> was between 0, 58 and 1, 00. That was partly conditioned by simple estimate of the market demand and partly probably at random. The difference in penotypic expressions of the following parameters was investigated among te nereast relatives: mass, standard lenght, maximum height, number of soft spines in dorsal, anal and ventral fins and number of gill rakers. Statistically significant difference (p< 0, 05) was determined only in one case - the number of soft spines in anal fins of carps from Končanica farm. However, that probably occurred just by accident and low variation of this parameter for this difference was revised or didn't exist at all on other farms.

Selective microbiological media were used to isolate 126 E. coli isolates from slurry and faeces samples from different farm areas. Antibiotic resistance profiling for 17 antibiotics (seven antibiotic classes), showed 57. 9 % of the isolates were resistant to between 3 and 15 antibiotics. The highest frequency of resistance was to ampicillin (56. 3 %), and the lowest to imipenem (1. 6 %), which {{appeared to be an}} unstable phenotype and was subsequently lost. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase resistance (ESBL) was detected in 53 isolates and blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaOXA genes were detected by PCR in twelve, four and two strains, respectively. Phenotypically most isolates showing resistance to cephalosporins were AmpC rather than ESBL, a number of isolates having both activities. Phenotypic resistance patterns suggested co-acquisition of some resistance genes within subsets of the isolates. Genotyping using ERIC PCR demonstrated these were not clonal, and therefore co-resistance may be associated with mobile genetic elements. These data show a snapshot of diverse resistance genes present in the E. coli population reservoir, including resistance to historically used antibiotics as well as cephalosporins in contemporary use...|$|R

Of the 66 Tetr gram-negative strains, 29 were identified as carrying tetB only. Four carried tetY, and another four carried tetD. Three strains carried tetC, two strains carried tetB and tetY, and one strain carried tetC and tetG. Sequence analyses indicated the identity in Tetr genes between the fish farm bacteria and clinical bacteria: 99. 3 to 99. 9 % for tetB, 98. 2 to 100 % for tetC, 99. 7 to 100 % for tetD, 92. 0 to 96. 2 % for tetG, and 97. 1 to 100 % for tetY. Eleven of the Tetr strains transferred Tetr genes by conjugation to Escherichia coli HB- 101. All transconjugants were resistant to tetracycline, oxycycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. The donors included strains of Photobacterium, Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Alteromonas, Citrobacter, and Salmonella spp., and they transferred tetB, tetY, or tetD to the recipients. Because NaCl enhanced their growth, these Tetr strains, except for the Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, and Salmonella strains, were recognized as marine bacteria.

40|$|Microbiological {{contamination}} in commercial poultry production has caused concerns {{for human health}} because of both the presence of pathogenic microorganisms {{and the increase in}} antimicrobial resistance in bacterial strains that can cause treatment failure of human infections. The aim of our study was to analyze the profile of antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors of E. coli isolates from chicken carcasses obtained from different farming systems (conventional and free-range poultry). A total of 156 E. coli strains were isolated and characterized for genes encoding virulence factors described in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 15 antimicrobials, and strains were confirmed as extended spectrum of β-lactamases- (ESBLs-) producing E. coli by phenotypic and genotypic tests. The results indicated that strains from free-range poultry have fewer virulence factors than strains from conventional poultry. Strains from conventionally raised chickens had a higher frequency of antimicrobial resistance for all antibiotics tested and also exhibited genes encoding ESBL and AmpC, unlike free-range poultry isolates, which did not. Group 2 CTX-M and CIT were the most prevalent ESBL and AmpC <b>genes,</b> respectively.

Presence of ribosomal methylase genes (ermA, ermB, ermC) and efflux pump genes (mefA/E, msrA/C) {{was detected by}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Resistance to pirlimycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 8 μg/ml) was detected in 6 of 13 Enterococcus isolates that were identified as E. faecium by API 20 Strep typing. msrC was detected in 10 enterococcal isolates but the detection of msrC {{was not associated with}} phenotypic resistance. msrC negative isolates were reclassified as Enterococcus mundtii based on sequencing of housekeeping genes. Resistance to erythromycin and pirlimycin (MIC > 16 μg/ml) was detected in 4 of 4 Streptococcus dysgalactiae and 12 of 20 Streptococcus uberis isolates and was encoded by ermB. All Streptococcus isolates tested negative for ermA, ermC, mefA/E and msrA/C. Among ermB positive streptococci, three alleles were identified based on a 527 bp gene fragment.

40|$|Many local breeds are {{currently}} at risk because of replacement by {{a limited number}} of specialized commercial breeds. Concurrently, for many breeds, allelic diversity within breeds declines because of inbreeding. Gene banking of germplasm may serve to secure the breeds and the alleles for any future use, for instance to recover a lost breed, to address new breeding goals, to support breeding schemes in small populations to minimize inbreeding, and for conservation genetics and genomics research. Developments in cryobiology and reproductive technology have generated several possibilities for preserving germplasm in farm animals. Furthermore, in some mammalian and bird species, gene banking of material is difficult or impossible, requiring development of new alternative methods or improvement of existing methods. Depending on the species, there are interesting possibilities or research developments in the use of epididymal spermatozoa, oocytes and embryos, ovarian and testicular tissue, primordial germ cells, and somatic cells for the conservation of genetic diversity in farm- and other animal species. Rapid developments in genomics research also provide new opportunities to optimize conservation and sampling strategies and to characterize genome-wide genetic variation.

40|$|Gene flow in {{rapeseed}} is {{a process}} taking place both in space {{and over the years}} and cannot be studied exclusively by field trials. Consequently, the GENESYS model was developed to quantify the effects of cropping systems on transgene escape from rapeseed crops to rapeseed volunteers in neighbour plots and in the subsequent crops. In the present work, this model was used to evaluate the risk of rape harvest contamination by extraneous <b>genes</b> in various <b>farming</b> systems in case of co-existing GM, conventional and organic crops. When 50 % of the rape varieties in the region were transgenic, the rate of GM seeds in non-GM crop harvests on farms with large fields was lower than the 0. 9 % purity threshold proposed by the EC for rape crop production (food and feed) harvests, but on farms with smaller fields, the threshold was exceeded. Harvest impurity increased in organic farms, mainly because of their small field size. The model was then used to evaluate the consequences of changes in farming practices and to identify those changes reducing harvest contamination. The effects of these changes depended on the field pattern and farming system. The most efficient practices in limiting harvest impurity comprised improved set-aside management by sowing a cover crop in spring on all set-aside fields in the region, permanently banning rape crops and set-aside around seed production fields and (for non-GM farmers) clustering farm fields to reduce gene inflow from neighbour fields...|$|R
40|$|Genetic and {{physiological}} manipulations {{can be carried}} out easily in teleost fishes due to their external fertilization and embryogenesis. These procedures are performed {{in the early stages of}} ontogenesis to produce the required characteristic, which then leads to an altered phenotype. Two trends in effective modification of genotype of fishes have been developed: (a) manipulation of the genome by inducing gynogenetic and androgenetic reproduction and (b) manipulation of ploidy. In both of these modifications the sex ratio is modified by genome manipulation, allowing the establishment of monosex populations and inbred lines. Individuals of sterile populations produced by genome manipulation usually show better growing rate than their fertile mates. Moreover, sterilization substantially reduces the risk of acclimatization, when exogenous fish species are imported into different aquatic ecosystems. In the early stages of ontogenesis — before the sex-determining genes are switched on in the progenitors of germ cells — physiological processes can also be manipulated with remarkable effects on phenotype. Alteration of the sex of young fish populations by hormonal treatments is a well-known example. For some commercially important species this method can be applied very effectively and has become general in the practice of breeding, while there are still many unelucidated questions in other species, including common carp. Present methods could be rapidly improved by combination of certain genetic {{and physiological}} manipulations. The genetically identical individuals of fish clones have both experimental and practical importance. A large number of clones can be produced and sustained in carp using a combination of different manipulations. Insertion of recombinant DNA constructs into the genome of fish provides a new, efficient way of improving current stocks of farm fish. Methods of production, selection and characterization of transgenic individuals of fish, gene transfer experiments performed on and availability of presently cloned <b>genes</b> of <b>farmed</b> cyprinids with special emphasis on common carp as well as possible developments of the area in the future are discussed in this review. The experimental results produced by using these new techniques will increase our knowledge of the basic processes of fish biology. Together with traditional methods they will also hopefully contribute to the development of a more efficient and rapid carp breeding system in the future. Although application of these methods will obviously require efficient measures for protection of natural populations, overreaction resulting in regulations with prohibitive effects concerning the use of these procedures in laboratories should be avoided...|$|R

In Jumla (high-hill), the barley seed system is completely informal and is mainly from farmer to farmer. In the present study, the seed flows and the pattern of genetic diversity in barley were investigated to detect {{differences between the two}} varieties and test the divergence among populations of each variety These data suggested that Chawali, the more common variety, was less subject to homogenising <b>gene</b> flow between <b>farms</b> than was Lekali. A total of 128 farming households were surveyed for seed supply information and 128 populations for each landrace from two villages: Kartikswami and Talium were collected for SSR diversity analysis. Some 92 SSRs were screened in an initial sample of 20 barley populations of both landraces and 2 improved varieties (LG- 51 and Soluwa). Of the 81 SSRs that consistently amplified, only 15 SSRs (19 %) were polymorphic with gene diversity values ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 71.

Animals on farm A were not vaccinated against APV leading to an APV subtype B outbreak accompanying the first C. psittaci infection wave. Despite subtype A APV vaccination on farms B and C, the second C. psittaci infection waves were accompanied (farm B) or followed (farm Q by a subtype B APV infection. On all farms respiratory signs always appeared together with a proven C psittaci, APV and/or ORT infection. This study suggests an association between C. psittaci, APV and ORT, and indicates the multi-factorial aetiology of respiratory infections in commercial turkeys. All three pathogens should be considered when developing prevention strategies for respiratory disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{has made}} United States {{agriculture}} {{one of the}} most pro-ductive in the world. In so becoming, agriculture has gone through major technological eras. The mechanical era of 1920 - 1950 made the transition from horsepower to mechanical power and greatly increased the productive capacity of agriculture. The chemical era of 1950 - 1980 increased production by reducing the constraint on production caused by pests and disease. American agriculture is now entering a new major technological thrust- the biotechnology and information tech-nology era. The implications of this new era could be more profound than those of either the mechanical or chemical technological eras. The biotechnology and information technology era has been fostered by substantially expanded private sector investment in agricultural research complemented by increased public sector emphasis on basic research. The output of this new era is in its infancy today but can be expected to have a great impact over the next three decades. Manifes-tations of this technological era include growth hormones, growth reg-ulators, embryo transplants, <b>gene</b> insertion, computerized <b>farm</b> management decision models, and monitoring and controlling tech-nology. Biotechnology Biotechnology is defined as any technique that uses living organ-isms to make or modify products, to improve plants and animals, or to develop microorganisms for specific uses. It focuses on the use of recombinant DNA and cell fusion which are powerful techniques that allow a large amount of control over biological systems. A major thrust of biotechnology in animals is the mass production in microorganisms of proteinaceous pharmaceuticals, including a number of hormones, enzymes, amino acids, and feed supplements...|$|R
40|$|Background: Enteroaggregative (EAEC) and Shiga-toxin {{producing}} Escherichia coli (STEC) are a {{major cause}} of diarrhea worldwide. E. coli carrying both virulence factors characteristic for EAEC and STEC and producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase caused severe and protracted disease during an outbreak of E. coli O 104 :H 4 in Europe in 2011. We assessed the opportunities for E. coli carrying the aggR and stx genes to emerge in ‘backyard’ farms in south-east Asia. Results: Faecal samples collected from 204 chicken farms; 204 farmers and 306 age- and gender-matched individuals not exposed to poultry farming were plated on MacConkey agar plates with and without antimicrobials being supplemented. Sweep samples obtained from MacConkey agar plates without supplemented antimicrobials were screened by multiplex PCR for the detection of the stx 1, stx 2 and aggR <b>genes.</b> One chicken <b>farm</b> sample each (0. 5 %) contained the stx 1 and the aggR gene. Eleven (2. 4 %) human faecal samples contained the stx 1 gene, 2 samples (0. 4 %) contained stx 2 gene, and 31 (6. 8 %) contained the aggR gene. From 46 PCR-positive samples, 205 E. coli isolates were tested for the presence of stx 1, stx 2, aggR, wzx O 104 and fliC H 4 genes. None of the isolates simultaneously contained the four genetic markers associated with E. coli O 104 :H 4 epidemic strain (aggR, stx 2, wzx O 104 and fliC H 4). Of 34 EAEC, 64. 7 % were resistant to 3 rd-generation cephalosporins. Conclusion: These results indicate that in southern Vietnam, the human population is a more likely reservoir of aggR and stx gene carrying E. coli than the chicken population. However, conditions for transmission of isolates and/or genes between human and animal reservoirs resulting in the emergence of highly virulent E. coli strains are still favorable, given the nature of‘backyard’ farms in Vietnam...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{annotation}} {{of livestock}} genomes {{is a critical}} and obvious next step to derive maximum benefit for agriculture, animal science, animal welfare and human health. The aim of the Fr-AgENCODE project is to generate multi-species functional genome annotations by applying high-throughput molecular assays on three target tissues/cells relevant {{to the study of}} immune and metabolic traits. An extensive collection of stored samples from other tissues is available for further use (FAANG Biosamples ‘FR-AGENCODE’). From each of two males and two females per species (pig, cattle, goat, chicken), strand-oriented RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility ATAC-seq assays were performed on liver tissue and on two T-cell types (CD 3 +CD 4 +&CD 3 +CD 8 +) sorted from blood (mammals) or spleen (chicken). Chromosome Conformation Capture (in situ Hi-C) was also carried out on liver. Sequencing reads from the 3 assays were processed using standard processing pipelines. While most (50 – 70 %) RNA-seq reads mapped to annotated exons, thousands of novel transcripts and genes were found, including extensions of annotated protein-coding genes and new lncRNAs (see abstract # 69857). Consistency of ATAC-seq results was confirmed by the significant proportion of called peaks in promoter regions (36 – 66 %) and by the specific accumulation pattern of peaks around gene starts (TSS) v. gene ends (TTS). Principal Component Analyses for RNA-seq (based on quantified gene expression) and ATAC-seq (based on quantified chromatin accessibility) highlighted clusters characterised by cell type and sex in all species. From Hi-C data, we generated 40 kb-resolution interaction maps, profiled a genome-wide Directionality Index and identified from 4, 100 (chicken) to 12, 100 (pig) topologically-associating do- mains (TADs). Correlations were reported between RNA-seq and ATAC-seq results (see abstract # 71581). In summary, we present here an overview of the first multi-species and -tissue annotations of chromatin accessibility and genome architecture related to <b>gene</b> expression for <b>farm</b> animals...|$|R
40|$|The enterotoxigenic and porcine enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (ETEC and PEPEC) strains are agents {{associated}} with swine neonatal diarrhea, causing economic losses in swine production. The main {{goal of this}} study was to identify virulence genes of ETEC, verotoxigenic (VTEC) and PEPEC in intestinal strains responsible for swine diseases, by molecular typing using PCR in newborn piglets from an intensive farm system. Two hundred and sixty seven rectal swabbings from 7 - 15 days- old Landrace x Large White crossbred piglets were taken, and 123 randomly selected samples, biochemically compatible with E. coli, were tested for E. coli virulence genes by PCR. A frequency (%) compatible with: 68 ETEC, 24 VTEC, and 8 EPEc were found. Of all E. coli strains studied, 19. 51 % carried at least one virulence gene. These data showed conclusively that, in spite of the application of strict sanitary measures in the intensive <b>farm,</b> <b>genes</b> encoding virulence factors of intestinal pathogens compatible with ETEC are still dETECted; therefore these strains will probably keep circulating among animals. El objetivo del trabajo fue identificar genes de virulencia de cepas intestinales de Escherichia coli de los grupos enterotoxigénico (ETEC), verotoxigénico (VTEC) y enteropatogénico porcino (PEPEC), responsables de patologías en cerdos, mediante tipificación molecular por PCR. Para ello se trabajó en un criadero intensivo, donde se tomaron 267 hisopados rectales de lechones cruza Landrace por Large White de 7 - 15 días de edad. Del total de aislamientos obtenidos se seleccionaron al azar 123 de ellos, bioquímicamente compatibles con E. coli, los que fueron analizados por PCR. La frecuencia de genes compatibles con ETEC, VTEC y PEPEC fue de 68 %, 24 % y 8 %, respectivamente. De las cepas de E. coli seleccionadas, el 19, 51 % portaban al menos un gen codificante de un factor de virulencia. Estos hallazgos muestran de manera concluyente que la aplicación de estrictas medidas sanitarias en el criadero en estudio no logró evitar la presencia de genes que codifican factores de virulencia de patógenos intestinales compatibles con ETEC. Es probable que las cepas circulen entre los animales...|$|R
