In this thesis, we explore the concept of intelligent software decoys, which employ a form of software-based military deception. We developed a prototype of a high-level language for specifying intelligent software decoys. Our approach involves two stages. The specification language {{is intended to be}} part of a high-level user interface, making the implementation details of software decoys transparent to the <b>information</b> <b>warrior.</b> We provide a case study in which we demonstrate the utility of our specification language for specifying software decoys to counter a real-word attack program.

40|$|Information Technology ManagementAn <b>Information</b> <b>Warrior</b> faces {{a complex}} and dynamic {{operating}} environment. To conduct an accurate Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Analysis of the enemy force (or a friendly force), a multitude {{of cause and effect}} relationships must be examined. Many times the person at the battle scene conducting the assessment may lack experience and/or knowledge, precluding a time-sensitive and effective assessment The author proposes a framework for a global network of expert systems and decision support systems to conduct the Vulnerability Assessments and maintain Information Warfare readiness through realistic training. The author also presents a Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Analysis heuristic with the objective of expanding the knowledge base and decision speed at the on-scene commander level. In achieving and implementing this global network, numerous benefits can be realized, including increased speed and efficiency in the receipt of intelligence information, thereby allowing for improved decision making capabilities. Since the technology and know-bow are already available, this vision of the global network is attainable and can be successfully implemented and operated. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Navy Information Warfare Community (IWC) provides a vital, sophisticated capability to address increasingly dynamic and unpredictable threats around the world. The problem is, the same skills and capabilities that make IWC personnel so valuable to the Navy also make them valuable to myriad firms in industry and organizations elsewhere beyond the Services. Moreover, such skills and capabilities are directly transferrable to industry. As a result, many talented <b>information</b> <b>warriors</b> {{are leaving the}} service at the midpoints of their military careers. Further, unlike other Navy communities (e. g., Aviation, Nuclear), in which clear career guidance and well-established incentives (e. g., bonus and retention pay) are in place, the comparatively inchoate IWC {{does not appear to}} benefit similarly, and given the unique nature of the IWC, it’s not entirely clear what “talent” means in this community. Indeed, talent seems likely to be a highly situated and nuanced concept—far from general and monolithic—that is aligned with a person’s knowledge and capability within an organization setting. Understanding talent represents the first step toward identifying and retaining the best IWC people before they leave the Service. This qualitative study addresses the issue directly, building up a grounded understanding of IWC talent and identifying both positive and negative issues driving talented people’s decisions to leave or stay in the Navy. Results elucidate unique aspects of IWC talent and retention, in addition to attributes and issues that <b>information</b> <b>warriors</b> share with other Service members, and they highlight opportunities for Navy leaders to address talent and retention in the IWC and beyond.

40|$|As {{information}} technologies continually produce mobile, decentralized, data systems, measures {{must be in}} effect to shelter assets from exposure to <b>information</b> <b>warriors.</b> A fundamental countermeasure to shield organizational data assets from attacks and provide information assurance is the development, implementation, and maintenance of an information policy (IP). IP {{can be characterized as}} a combination of finite and deterministic rule-based and case-based algorithms that regulate informational flow among different components in a defined network. Formal, IP research and methodologies are not widespread. As a result, this paper proposes three drivers, six dimensions, and various models to guide the cognitive processes of IP designers. MAJOR POINTS The primary focus of this paper is a discussion of the main aspects of an IP—drivers and dimensions.

40|$|Information Warfare {{involves}} {{the attack and}} defense of information and information systems, both in time of armed conflict and in operations short of war. While information technology provides {{the promise of a}} new class of less lethal military instruments, it also presents vulnerabilities occasioned by widespread dependence on an increasingly complex and interconnected global information infrastructure. These vulnerabilities, when exploited by those who would target civilians in order to inspire widespread fear in hopes of accomplishing a political agenda, can be understood as cyber-terrorism. As information warfare techniques evolve, those employing them should look to several relevant sources for normative guidance. Relevant, internationally shared values can be found in international custom, the U. N. Charter, treaties dealing with the subject of "cybercrime," those governing the communication media likely to be utilized by <b>information</b> <b>warriors,</b> UNGA Resolutions and those treaties and customary norms that make up the Law of Armed Conflict...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere are numerous computer-aided tools to enable Computer Network Defense. However, their effectiveness in countering attacks {{is less than}} optimal when they are used independently of one another. Research has identified the requirements for an integrated command and control (C 2) system that is able to conduct full-spectrum operations in the cyberspace environment. The most notable of that research revolves around the development and experimentation with the prototype system known as Cyber Command, Control and Information Operations System (C 3 IOS). C 3 IOS provides for a loose confederation of the cooperating systems with interaction between systems going through C 2 interfaces. In this thesis, the authors introduce into C 3 IOS a means to support the commander's ability to take measured responses to coercive actions in a timely manner, specifically to facilitate the interaction between experts in the law of information conflict and <b>information</b> <b>warriors</b> responding to a cyber attack. The authors' research results {{in a set of}} use cases and requirements for the C 2 understanding, planning, and deciding activities involved in such a capability, using Schmitt's analysis as an example.

The goal of IT 21 is to rapidly implement a warfighting information network. To facilitate the engagement of information warfare, this thesis proposes that all officers be issued a laptop computer. This thesis discusses how a computer can be as valuable as a ifle or a tank, and possibly {{change the way the}} Department of Defense fights wars. With a laptop computer, officers can have 24 hrs access to critical information - turning all Naval officers into <b>Information</b> <b>Warriors!</b> When officers transfer, they will be immediately on line at their new duty station. This thesis uses the Technical Architecture for Information Management (TAFIM) model for strategic planning and evaluatesthree migration paths: a paycheck computer allowance; continuing buying desktop computers within individual command budgets; and leasing laptop computers. The alternatives are evaluated using an Information Technology Assessment Worksheet. This thesis recommends that the best alternative is to lease computers for all officers and have Naval Information Systems Management Center (NISMC) be the program manager. This thesis dearly shows that after a three-year period the cost of leasing a computer is more economical than purchasing a computer[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to explore the {{technical}} feasibility and institutional issues associated with applying software-based deception techniques as part of Homeland defense. At present, we refer to the embodiment of software-based deception as intelligent software decoys, although this name may change in {{the next phase of}} our research. The key idea that we are pursuing is that software-based deception can be used to harden software assets against attack. An important novel aspect of our research is that we introduce the concept of conducting counterintelligence and intelligently employing countermeasures in cyberspace via software-based deception. The owners of computing assets may have to deploy intelligent software decoys with such capabilities in order to counter attacks conducted by technology-savvy terrorists and criminals, in addition to <b>information</b> <b>warriors</b> from rogue or enemy nation-statesconventional countermeasures will likely be ineffective against the sophisticated arsenal of cyber weapons at the disposal of such attackers, and any countermeasure will be difficult to deploy without reliable counterintelligence, particularly if the users of countermeasures intend to avoid becoming cyber war criminals. In this report, we summarize our research and its relevance to Homeland security, and briefly discuss our plans for furthering our work under Phase II of the Naval Postgraduate School's Homeland Security Research and Technology Program. The initial results of our work indicate to us that software- based deception could play a pivotal role in protecting the U. S. critical information infrastructure and critical software applications that rely on that infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{study in}} {{specific}} areas of homeland security and cybersecurity with regards to nation-state cyberwarfare and terrorism. This course addresses the challenges involved in information warfare and information security {{as it pertains to}} domestic and international security challenges. This semester's course will focus on state-sponsored as well as transnational cyber-warfare and touch briefly on industrial espionage. Homeland Security encompasses a grouping of diverse missions and functions that are performed by a wide variety of organizations on the local, state, federal and international levels. Cyber Security is a very young and poorly understood realm within Homeland Security, and there are many definitions for what is and what is not cyber security. This niche is very rapidly evolving and it is likely that material presented in this semester will no longer be interesting in future semesters. Given our time allowance within fifteen weeks, what we will cover in this course are few key examples that best exemplifies the study of cyber security. The purpose of this class is NOT to train the student in "how to hack computers.

40|$|Information Operations (IO) {{has become}} a primary war {{fighting}} capability and is now considered a military core competency. The military Services are establishing IO as a military career field equivalent to other war fighting fields and they are developing supporting education and training programs to create a pipeline of trained and experienced <b>information</b> operations <b>warriors.</b> Transforming doctrine into an operational reality has, however, {{proven to be a}} challenge and the training programs and operational planning and assessment tools have been slow to materialize. Operations in the Balkan’s and Afghanistan have afforded the military the opportunity to conduct IO and to document experiences and lessons from these real world operations. A number of experiments and exercises also have explored new military concepts that included the use of non-kinetic IO means of national power to influence adversary behavior and actions. This paper explores some of the challenges of executing and assessing IO courses of action including some observations regarding integration of IO into EBO. The insights and observations offered are based on the authors multiple experiences.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{project is}} a preparation for development of a method for teaching traditional Ewe culture to people of Western or non-Ewe background, using dance ethnology as an approach to conducting research, and digital video recording {{as a means for}} documentation. The study focuses on one of the Ewe's oldest and most powerful religious dance and music ceremonies, Adzogbo, as it is performed by the Mawuli Kpli Mi Adzogbo Group from the village of Aflao in Ghana, West Africa. Adzogbo, originally from Dahomey (now Benin), was brought to Ghana in the late 19 th Century, and was formally performed for the Dahomeyan war gods to transmit pertinent <b>information</b> to <b>warriors</b> preparing for battle. It is still {{considered one of the most}} complex dance and music systems, having intricate polyrhythmic texture and specific relationship between the master drummer and the vigorous and articulated movements of the dancers, which are emphasized by their elaborate costume. Presently, the dance functions as a recreational ceremony and is performed during specific special occasions. It is used to display mental, physical and spiritual power and still carries some of its original war dance characteristics. This project consists of a written thesis document and one hour digital video documentary of the Adzogbo Dance Ceremony, outlining its background and importance, form and structure, and a comparative analyses of the organization and structure of both the dance and music. The text provides information on Ewe culture, including their historical, social, and geographical background, their dance, music and related activities and an exploration of Interactive multimedia technologies to in future develop electronic educational material...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the antecedents of turnover intention among <b>information</b> technology road <b>warriors.</b> Road warriors are IT professionals who {{spend most of}} their workweek away from home at a client site. Building on Moore’s (2000) work on turnover intention, this article develops and tests a model that is context-specific to the road warrior situation. The model highlights the effects of work-family conflict and job autonomy, factors especially applicable to the road warrior’s circumstances. Data were gathered from a company in the computer and software services industry. This study provides empirical evidence for the effects of work-family conflict, perceived work overload, fairness of rewards, and job autonomy on organizational commitment and work exhaustion for road warriors. The results suggest that work-family conflict is a key source of stress among IT road warriors because they have to juggle family and job duties as they work at distant client sites during the week. These findings suggest that the context of the IT worker matters to turnover intention, and that models that are adaptive to the work context will more effectively predict and explain turnover intention...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince {{the country has}} moved into the Information Age, the military forces have been moving towards network based operations. The rapid expansion {{of the internet and}} information technology (IT) has led to the emerging theory of Network- Centric Warfare (NCW). The Naval Services instantiation of NCW is FORCEnet. "FORCEnet is the "glue" that binds together Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing. It is the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the <b>Information</b> Age, integrating <b>warriors,</b> sensors, command and control, platforms, and weapons into a networked, distributed combat force. FORCEnet will provide the architecture to increase substantially combat capabilities through aligned and integrated systems, functions, and missions. Sea Power 21 is a comprehensive attempt to address the ramifications of the Information Age revolution. The framework of the Sea Power 21 vision is composed of the following elements: Sea Basing, Sea Shield and Sea Strike. The enabler of this vision or the "glue" that holds it all together is FORCEnet. FORCEnet is "the operational construct and architectural framework of naval warfare in the information age that integrates Warriors, sensors, networks, command and control, platforms, and weapons into a networked, distributed combat force that is scaleable across all levels of conflict from seabed to space and sea to land. " The Trident Warrior 03 exercise was then developed as a means to measure its success and to acquire data from which future exercises can be measured against. FORCEnet {{is still in its infancy}} and many people have different views on what exactly it is and how it should be implemented to achieve those goals. The intent of this thesis was not to answer those questions per se, but provide a realistic analysis of what worked during the TW 03 exercise and what did not. This should provide a baseline for further Trident Warrior exercises so as to avoid the same mistakes in the future. The military has a ways to go before it can fully realize a truly networked-centric armed forces, but TW 03 was the beginning and the lessons learned from it will pay dividends in realizing that fully networked goal.
