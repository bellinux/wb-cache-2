40|$|Abstract Background Mesoamerica {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} biodiversity hotspots in the world, yet we are far from understanding the geologic history and the processes driving population divergence and speciation for most endemic taxa. In species with highly differentiated populations selective and/or neutral factors can induce rapid changes to traits involved in mate choice, promoting reproductive isolation between allopatric populations that can eventually lead to speciation. We present the results of genetic differentiation, and <b>explore</b> <b>drift</b> and selection effects in promoting acoustic and morphological divergence among populations of Campylopterus curvipennis, a lekking hummingbird with an extraordinary vocal variability across Mesoamerica. Results Analyses of two mitochondrial genes and ten microsatellite loci genotyped for 160 individuals revealed the presence of three lineages with no contemporary gene flow: C. c. curvipennis, C. c. excellens, and C. c. pampa disjunctly distributed in the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Tuxtlas region and the Yucatan Peninsula, respectively. Sequence mtDNA and microsatellite data were congruent with two diversification events: an old vicariance event at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (c. 1. 4 Ma), and a more recent Pleistocene split, isolating populations in the Tuxtlas region. Hummingbirds of the excellens group were larger, and those of the pampa group had shorter bills, and lineages that have been isolated the longest shared fewer syllables and differed in spectral and temporal traits of a shared syllable. Coalescent simulations showed that fixation of song types has occurred faster than expected under neutrality but the null hypothesis that morphological divergence resulted from drift was not rejected. Conclusions Our phylogeographic analyses uncovered the presence of three Mesoamerican wedge-tailed sabrewing lineages, which diverged at different time scales. These results highlight the importance of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and more recent Pleistocene climatic events in driving isolation and population divergence. Coalescent analyses of the evolution of phenotypic traits suggest that selection is driving song evolution in wedge-tailed sabrewings but drift could not be rejected as a possibility for morphological divergence. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the career pathways taken by 47 young adults in Canada after they graduated from secondary school. Based on a grounded theory analysis, this thesis explored the way young adults made career decisions and how their resources (individual, family, social and environmental) and the messages that they heard from significant others influenced their career pathways. The majority {{of the young people}} in this study either did not know {{what they wanted to do}} when they graduated from secondary school or subsequently changed their minds. Most engaged in a process of identity exploration through experimentation with tertiary programmes and different types of work as they tried to ascertain what constituted satisfying work. As participants experimented with different career pathways, they obtained a better sense of who they were and what types of work they found satisfying. Findings indicated that participants engaged in a process of finding a career-related place, an activity that superficially involved selecting a career pathway but more substantively meant a search for identity and life purpose. Finding a career-related place was achieved through the interchangeable use of five strategies: navigating, <b>exploring,</b> <b>drifting,</b> settling, and committing. These strategies emerged as a host of internal and external factors impinged on a young person’s simultaneous search for a career and the identity that could potentially come with it. This contingent nature of finding a career-related place stood in sharp contrast to the discourse of what is referred to in this thesis as the “career myth”. This discourse related to the belief that young people should follow a linear, predictable route from secondary school to tertiary training, and then on to a permanent, full-time job. Based on these findings, an argument is made that developmental and chaos-oriented approaches to career development should be moved into the foreground when professionals assist young people in the immediate years after secondary school graduation. Accordingly, the trait and factor ethos, which continues to dominate the career counselling field, should be deemphasised. Six career design principles are identified that provide guidelines for how young people can engage in the process of finding a career-related place in a way that is proactive while at the same time accepting that career pathways and the identities that follow may be uncertain...|$|R

40|$|In {{boreal forest}} streams, woody debris is an {{important}} habitat component. Stream invertebrates and salmonids such as brown trout benefit from in-stream wood. The studies presented in this thesis <b>explore</b> how <b>drifting</b> stream invertebrates respond to addition of fine woody debris, and how young-of-the-year (0 +) brown trout behave in habitats with and without fine woody debris. The first paper reports results from a field experiment where fine woody debris was added to streams, and invertebrate drift was measured in order to detect impacts of the fine woody debris on drift density, biomass and taxon diversity. In {{the end of the}} season, the fine woody debris-affected drift samples showed higher density, biomass and taxon diversity than the control samples. In the second paper, I describe effects of fine woody debris on 0 + brown trout, studied in laboratory stream channels. Trout were tested in habitats without fine woody debris, with an intermediate fine woody debris density, and with a high fine woody debris density. Swimming activity and foraging time were significantly lower when fine woody debris was present than when it was absent. More time was spent sheltering at the high fine woody debris density than at the intermediate one. The increasing exploitation of fine woody debris for biofuel purposes should be considered in relation to the effects on brown trout and stream invertebrate habitat.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the DNA methylome changes with age. This epigenetic drift may have deep implications for cellular differentiation and disease development. However, it remains unclear how much of this drift is functional or caused by underlying changes in cell subtype composition. Moreover, no study has yet comprehensively <b>explored</b> epigenetic <b>drift</b> at different genomic length scales and in relation to regulatory elements. Here we conduct an in-depth analysis of epigenetic drift in blood tissue. We demonstrate that most of the age-associated drift is independent of the increase in the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio that accompanies aging and that enrichment of age-hypermethylated CpG islands increases upon adjustment for cellular composition. We further find that drift has only a minimal impact on in-cis gene expression, acting primarily to stabilize pre-existing baseline expression levels. By studying epigenetic drift at different genomic length scales, we demonstrate the existence of mega-base scale age-associated hypomethylated blocks, covering approximately 14 % of the human genome, and which exhibit preferential hypomethylation in age-matched cancer tissue. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Illumina 450 k DNA methylation with ENCODE data to identify transcription factors with key roles in cellular development and aging. Specifically, we identify REST and regulatory factors of the histone methyltransferase MLL complex, whose function may be disrupted in aging. In summary, most of the epigenetic drift seen in blood is independent of changes in blood cell type composition, and exhibits patterns at different genomic length scales reminiscent of those seen in cancer. Integration of Illumina 450 k with appropriate ENCODE data may represent a fruitful approach to identify transcription factors with key roles in aging and disease...|$|R
40|$|Because {{a chaotic}} zone {{can reduce the}} long {{timescale}} capture probabilities and cause catastrophic events such as close encounters with a planet or star during temporary capture, the dynamics of migrating planets {{is likely to be}} strongly dependent on the widths of the resonance chaotic zones. Previous theoretical work on the resonant capture of particles into mean-motion resonances by orbital migration has been restricted to the study of integrable models. By <b>exploring</b> toy <b>drifting</b> Hamiltonian models we illustrate how the structure in phase space of a resonance can be used to generalize this integrable capture theory to include the richer phenomenology of chaotic resonances. We show that particles are temporarily captured into the chaotic zone of a resonance with fixed shape for a time that is given by the width of the chaotic zone divided by the resonance drift rate. Particles can be permanently captured into a drifting chaotic resonance only if they are captured into a growing integrable region. Therefore resonances containing wide chaotic zones have lower permanent capture probabilities than those lacking chaotic zones. We expect large deviations from the predictions of integrable capture theories when the chaotic zone is large and the migration rate is sufficiently long that many Lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily captured in the resonance. The 2 : 1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune in the Kuiper Belt contains a chaotic zone, even when integrated on short timescales such as a million years. Capture probabilities are lower than estimated previously from drifting integrable models. This may offer an explanation for low eccentricity Kuiper Belt objects between 45 - 47 AU which should have been previously captured in the 2 : 1 resonance by Neptune's migration.

40|$|VSTx 1 is a {{tarantula}} venom toxin which binds to the archaebacterial voltage-gated {{potassium channel}} KvAP. VSTx 1 {{is thought to}} access the voltage sensor domain of the channel via the lipid bilayer phase. In order to understand {{its mode of action}} and implications for the mechanism of channel activation, it is important to characterize the interactions of VSTx 1 with lipid bilayers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (for a total simulation time in excess of 0. 2 micros) have been used to explore VSTx 1 localization and interactions with zwitterionic (POPC) and with anionic (POPE/POPG) lipid bilayers. In particular, three series of MD simulations have been used to <b>explore</b> the net <b>drift</b> of VSTx 1 relative to the center of a bilayer, starting from different locations of the toxin. The preferred location of the toxin is at the membrane/water interface. Although there are differences between POPC and POPE/POPG bilayers, in both cases the toxin forms favorable interactions at the interface, maximizing H-bonding to lipid headgroups and to water molecules while retaining interactions with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. A 30 ns unrestrained simulation reveals dynamic partitioning of VSTx 1 into the interface of a POPC bilayer. The preferential location of VSTx 1 at the interface is discussed in the context of Kv channel gating models and provides support for a mode of action in which the toxin interacts with the Kv voltage sensor "paddle" formed by the S 3 and S 4 helices...|$|R

Wind turbine support towers are often constructed as thin-walled metal shell structures, well known for their imperfection sensitivity, and are susceptible to sudden buckling failure under compressive axial loading. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the seismic response of a 1. 5 -MW wind turbine steel support tower modelled as a near-cylindrical shell structure with realistic axisymmetric weld depression imperfections. A selection of 20 representative earthquake ground motion records, 10 ‘near-fault’ and 10 ‘far-field’, was applied and the aggregate seismic response <b>explored</b> using lateral <b>drifts</b> and total plastic energy dissipation during the earthquake as structural demand parameters.

Realistic imperfections were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the intensities of ground accelerations at which damage initiates and on the failure location, but only a small effect on the vibration properties and the response prior to damage. Including vertical accelerations similarly had a limited effect on the elastic response, but potentially shifts the location of the plastic hinge to a more slender and, therefore, weaker part of the tower. The aggregate response was found to be significantly more damaging under near-fault earthquakes with pulse-like effects and large vertical accelerations than far-field earthquakes without these aspects...|$|R
40|$|With {{the threat}} of {{longevity}} risk to the insurance industry becoming increasingly apparent in recent years, insurers and reinsurers are concerned about how to better model and manage longevity risk. However, modeling and managing longevity risk is not trivial, {{due in part to}} its systematic nature and in part to the excessive amount of risk factors that constitute the risk. The theme of this thesis is modeling and managing longevity risk. In particular, this thesis focuses on four types of uncertainties among all possible risk factors. These four risk factors include 1) mortality jump risk; 2) longevity drift risk; 3) population basis risk; and 4) cohort mismatch risk. In the current literature, a number of stochastic mortality models with transitory jump effects have been proposed to capture mortality jump risk. Rather than modeling the age pattern of jump effects explicitly, most of the existing models assume that the distributions of jump effects and general mortality improvements across ages are identical. Nevertheless, this assumption {{does not appear to be}} in line with what can be observed from historical data. In this thesis, we addressed this disconnect by introducing a Lee-Carter variant that captures the age pattern of mortality jumps by a distinct collection of parameters. The model variant was then further generalized to permit the age pattern of jump effects to vary randomly. We illustrated the two proposed models with mortality data from the United States and English and Welsh populations, and further used these data to value hypothetical mortality bonds with similar specifications to the Atlas IX Capital Class B note that was launched in 2013. The features we considered were found to have a significant impact on the estimated prices. We then <b>explored</b> longevity <b>drift</b> risk, which is the uncertainty about the mortality trend itself. We tackled longevity drift risk by introducing the locally-linear CBD model in which the drifts that govern the expected mortality trend are allowed to follow a stochastic process. Compared to the original CBD model, this specification results in median forecasts that are more consistent with recent trends and more robust relative to changes in the data sample period. Furthermore, the proposed model also yields wider prediction intervals that may better reflect the possibilities of future trend changes. To mitigate the risk associated with changes in drifts, we proposed a new hedging method called the generalized state-space hedging method which demands less stringent assumptions. The proposed method allows hedgers to extract more hedge effectiveness out of a hedging instrument, and is therefore useful when there are only a few traded longevity securities in the market. To incorporate population basis risk, we further extended the proposed generalized state-space hedging method to a multi-population setting. In this extended hedging method, the hedging strategy is derived by first reformulating the assumed multi-population stochastic mortality model in a state-space representation, and then considering the sensitivities of the hedge portfolio and the liability being hedged to all relevant hidden states. Inter alia, this method allowed us to decompose the underlying longevity risk into components arising solely from the hidden states that are shared by all populations and components stemming exclusively from the hidden states that are population-specific. The latter components collectively represent an explicit measure of the population basis risk involved. Through this measure, a new metric called standardized basis risk profile was developed. This metric allowed us to assess the relative levels of population basis risk that q-forwards with different reference populations, reference ages, and times-to-maturity may lead to. The proposed methodologies were illustrated using real mortality data from various national populations. Similar to population basis risk, cohort mismatch risk is another risk that is related to population differences when conducting an index-based longevity hedge. It arises when the hedger chooses to link hedging instruments to different cohorts. Although existing index-based longevity hedging strategies mitigate the risk associated with period effects, they often overlook the risk associated with different cohorts. The negligence of cohort effects may lead to sub-optimal hedge effectiveness if the liability being hedged is a deferred pension or annuity which involves cohorts that are not covered by the data sample. We proposed a new hedging strategy that incorporates both period and cohort effects. The resulting longevity hedge is a value hedge which reduces the uncertainty surrounding the τ-year ahead value of the liability being hedged in terms variance or Value-at-Risk. We further developed a method to expedite the evaluation of a value longevity hedge. By utilizing the fact that the innovations of the stochastic processes for the period and cohort effects are not serially correlated, the proposed method avoids the need for nested simulations that are generally required when evaluating a value hedge...|$|R
