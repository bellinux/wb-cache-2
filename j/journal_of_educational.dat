500|$|Commenting on the book's survey study, Cowie (British <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Studies) [...] {{wrote that}} it was hard to {{ascertain}} Neill's true pedagogical influence when state schools, which constitute the majority of schools, had a poor response rate. He added that the progressive education topics reported to be most influenced by Neill continued to be controversial in 1973. Cowie asked whether challenges to authoritarian education were replaced by Neill's methods or by chaos. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said the sociological study was more descriptive of Neill's role than contributive to the evolution of his philosophy. Hopkins wrote that the book functioned best as a biography, and that its philosophy sections were [...] "piecemeal" [...] and [...] "sketchy" [...] rather than [...] "comprehensive and coherent". Indeed, he felt that the study and the philosophical portions were more illuminative of Neill's life than of [...] "any broader picture". Robert B. Nordberg (Best Sellers) appreciated some of the book's [...] "important points", such that many advocates for educational freedom, in practice, instead seek more insidious techniques for controlling children. While Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) felt that the book added little new content, she appreciated the book's detail, such as that Neill's A Dominie's Log was based in fact, not fiction.|$|E
500|$|Though Hemmings did {{not think}} of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E

500|$|Multiple reviewers {{highlighted}} Hemmings's {{association with}} the school. Cowie (British <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Studies) wrote that although Neill did not want disciples, Hemmings [...] "accepts generally the 'Summerhill idea and would fit the role. Nicholas Tucker (New Statesman) too noted the book as [...] "very one-sided, verging on the uncritical" [...] despite its readability and signs of thorough research. He said that a balanced account of Summerhill was elusive because of the [...] "sensationalized" [...] press and [...] "rosy" [...] recollections of Neill and his former pupils, similar to the memoirs of [...] "Old Boys' clubs elsewhere". He wrote, however, that Hemmings's position was understandable when considering the criticism that Summerhill and Neill withstood from [...] "conventional educational wisdom" [...] and [...] "horrified hearsay", which had turned the school into [...] "a type of scholastic folk myth" [...] to set straight. Still, Tucker saw less cause for Summerhill's defense {{by the time of}} publication as Neill had wider acceptance. He had become a powerful figure in education and his school a template for the American free school movement. Cowie wrote that Neill seemed to be enjoying greater acceptance in his later life as Summerhill was [...] "losing its uniqueness as 'that dreadful school. Nordberg (Best Sellers) said that while Hemmings has some criticism for Neill and [...] "open education", [...] "he is basically an enthusiast" [...] who wrote a [...] "sympathetic portrayal". Even from this sympathetic angle, Nordberg felt that Neill came across as [...] "the child of an overly strict and demanding father who has spent {{the rest of his life}} in a rather one-dimensional crusade, more visceral than rational, against authority in all forms." [...] Altogether, Nordberg wrote, Fifty Years succeeds in its [...] "systematic, scholarly look at the Summerhill idea" [...] but fails to provide [...] "a balanced, profound look" [...] at its counterpart: [...] "need for restraint, rationality, and responsibility in the world".|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} {{construction}} and reproduction of social identities (race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity) in educational policy and research. Framed through a Foucauldian genealogy of knowledge-making practices, I focus on the discourses of social identities embedded in the (re) production <b>of</b> data in <b>educational</b> research. Drawing from sociohistorical methods and bibliometrics, I examine three distinct, yet interrelated, domains. First, I explore the construction of datasets used in postsecondary research, including a federal dataset (the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) and a private nationally-representative survey of students (The Freshman Survey). Secondly, I consider the uses of data emerging from these databases by examining 21, 069 peer-reviewed articles published in eleven <b>journals</b> <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> research. Lastly, I examine the discursive practices of social identities {{in the context of}} a specific postsecondary institution (East University, a pseudonym), where I connect administrators’ perspectives on demographic data collection practices with emerging federal standards. Findings suggest that there is a need for increased critical data literacy to understand the points of convergence between the conceptual framing of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation/gender identity. I suggest a need for more coalitional politics in the production <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> research as a strategy to enhance how social identities are understood in contemporary educational research. ...|$|R
