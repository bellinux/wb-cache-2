2500|$|Ocular aberrations are distortions in the {{wavefront}} {{passing through}} the pupil of the eye. These optical aberrations diminish {{the quality of the}} image formed on the retina, sometimes necessitating the wearing of spectacles or contact lenses. In the case of retinal <b>imaging,</b> <b>light</b> passing out of the eye carries similar wavefront distortions, leading to an inability to resolve the microscopic structure (cells and capillaries) of the retina. Spectacles and contact lenses correct [...] "low-order aberrations", such as defocus and astigmatism, which tend to be stable in humans {{for long periods of time}} (months or years). While correction of these is sufficient for normal visual functioning, it is generally insufficient to achieve microscopic resolution. Additionally, [...] "high-order aberrations", such as coma, spherical aberration, and trefoil, must also be corrected in order to achieve microscopic resolution. High-order aberrations, unlike low-order, are not stable over time, and may change over time scales of 0.1s to 0.01s. The correction of these aberrations requires continuous, high-frequency measurement and compensation.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{resolution}} delivered by DLP technologies begins to taper {{off as the}} size of the final object grows, or the light source moves away from the part being built, EnvisionTEC later developed Scan, Spin and Selectively Photocure (3SP) technology, which launched in 2013 to 3D print larger objects while maintaining quality. With 3SP, a multi-cavity laser diode with an orthogonal mirror spinning at 20,000 rpm reflects the beam through a spinning drum, where the light passes through a series of optical elements, focusing the light onto the surface of the photopolymer across the Y direction. An <b>Imaging</b> <b>Light</b> Source (ILS) contains a multi-cavity laser diode, its driver, and all optics. The ILS travels in the X direction at 1-2 inches per second, depending on the material being cured, while the laser light scans the Y direction and selectively photo-cures liquid resin based on the data path.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{observation}} of phonon-polariton propagation {{was made possible}} by real-space imaging, in which the spatial and temporal profiles of phonon-polaritons are imaged onto a CCD camera using Talbot phase-to-amplitude conversion. This by itself was an extraordinary breakthrough. It {{was the first time that}} electromagnetic waves were imaged directly, appearing much like ripples in a pond when a rock plummets through the water's surface (see Fig. 3). Real-space imaging is the preferred detection technique in polaritonics, though other more conventional techniques like optical Kerr-gating, time resolved diffraction, interferometric probing, and terahertz field induced second harmonic generation are useful in some applications where real-space imaging is not easily employed. For example, patterned materials with feature sizes on the order of a few tens of micrometres cause parasitic scattering of the <b>imaging</b> <b>light.</b> Phonon-polariton detection is then only possible by focusing a more conventional probe, like those mentioned before, into an unblemished region of the crystal.|$|E

40|$|Absorption imaging of ultracold atoms is the {{foundation}} for quantitative extraction of information from experiments with ultracold atoms. Due to the limited exposure time available in these systems, the signal-to-noise ratio is largest for high intensity absorption imaging where {{the intensity of the}} <b>imaging</b> <b>light</b> is on the order of the saturation intensity. In this case, the absolute value of the intensity of the <b>imaging</b> <b>light</b> enters as an additional parameter making it more sensitive to systematic errors. Here, we present a novel and robust technique to determine the imaging intensity in units of the effective saturation intensity to better than 5 %. We do this by measuring the momentum transferred to the atoms by the <b>imaging</b> <b>light</b> while varying its intensity. We further utilize the method to quantify the purity of the polarization of the <b>imaging</b> <b>light</b> and to determine the correct imaging detuning. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures.

In {{contrast to the}} traditional intelligent lighting system, such as the photosensitive resistance sensor-based or the infrared sensor-based system, the imaging sensor can realize a finer perception of the environmental light; thus it can guide a more precise lighting control. Before this system works, first lots of typical <b>imaging</b> <b>lighting</b> data of the desk application are accumulated. Second, a series of subjective and objective Lighting Effect Evaluation Metrics (LEEMs) are defined and assessed for these datasets above. Then the cluster benchmarks of these objective LEEMs can be obtained. Third, both a single LEEM-based control and a multiple LEEMs-based control are developed to realize a kind of optimal luminance tuning. When this system works, first it captures the lighting image using a wearable camera. Then it computes the objective LEEMs of the captured image and compares them with the cluster benchmarks of the objective LEEMs. Finally, the single LEEM-based or the multiple LEEMs-based control can be implemented to get a kind of optimal lighting effect.
