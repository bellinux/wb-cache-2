5000|$|The extra tension {{placed on}} the {{instrument}} by the doubled strings is high, {{and because of this}} additional stress on their necks and soundboards, twelve-string guitars long had a reputation for warping after a few years of use. (This is less of a problem in modern instruments, built after 1970.) Until the invention of the truss rod in 1921, twelve-string guitars were frequently tuned lower than the traditional EADGBE to reduce the stresses on the <b>instrument.</b> <b>Lead</b> Belly often used a low C-tuning, but in some recordings his tunings can be recognized as low B and A-tunings. Some twelve-string guitars have non-traditional structural supports to prevent or postpone warping, at the expense of appearance and tone. For additional reduction of the stress of the added string tension, twelve-string guitars built prior to 1970 typically had shorter necks and fretboards than six-string guitars did, and their fretting scales were also shorter, which meant that the fret positions were more closely spaced as well. Their bridges, especially in acoustic guitars, had a larger reinforcement plate for the same reason. (See above.) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we find {{empirical}} evidence of bank lending channel for Colombia, using a balanced panel data of about four thousand non-financial firms. We find that {{increases in the}} interest rate, proxiing for the monetary policy <b>instrument,</b> <b>lead</b> {{to a reduction in}} the proportion of bank loans, out of total debt, of the. rms. This bank lending channel amplifies the effect of the traditional interest rate channel, which leads to a reduction in total debt and spending when monetary policy tightens.

40|$|This paper investigates {{upon the}} effects of {{taxation}} on firm investment behaviour in presence of alternative energy (oil) saving technologies and scarce resources in competitive markets. Socially optimal policies are compared to a decentralized regulatory framework: the paper shows that taxation affects the adoption of dif-ferent energy saving technologies hence the aggregate amount of energy saving. To our knowledge, there are few works that underline the relationship between environmental policies and firms ’ incentives to adopt oil saving technologies. For this reason, we follow the theoretical literature focusing on {{the effects of}} environ-mental policy applied to pollution and climate change by adapting it to the energy saving perspective. We perform a static comparison of environmental policies to show that different levels of the same <b>instrument</b> <b>lead</b> to different results {{in terms of the number}} of firms adopting energy saving technologies; multiple equi-librium are possible but there is only one which is socially optimal...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} the damage based tax mechanism to induce socially optimal outcomes in a controlled laboratory environment which incorporates important aspects of nonpoint pollution problems. Our experimental setting combines a strictly convex damage function with uncertainty in measuring the ambient level of pollution, indefinitely repeated interactions among heterogeneous polluters, limited information on the regulator's side about the polluters' profit functions, and, in half of the experimental conditions, limited information on the polluters' side about the strategic environment. We additionally investigate whether the relative position of the social optimum in the polluters’ emission space has an impact on the efficiency of the fiscal instrument. In almost all implemented conditions, the observed total pollution level is not significantly different from the socially optimal level but compliance at the individual level is rarely observed. Experimental conditions in which polluters have to dramatically reduce their emissions in order to comply with the fiscal <b>instrument</b> <b>lead</b> to higher efficiency levels than those where compliance implies less dramatic reductions. Our most striking result is that less information on the polluters' side is beneficial from a social point of view as the performance of the damage based tax mechanism is higher the less information polluters have about the strategic environment. ...|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} {{the precision of}} IKONOS stereo data for measuring forest canopy height. The high cost of airborne {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) data collection for large area studies and the present lack of a spaceborne <b>instrument</b> <b>lead</b> to the need to explore other low cost options. The US Government currently has access to a large archive of commercial high-resolution imagery, which could be quite valuable to forest structure studies. At 1 m resolution, we here compared canopy height models (CHMs) and height data derived from Goddard’s airborne LiDAR Hyper-spectral and Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) with three types of IKONOS stereo derived digital surface models (DSMs) that estimate CHMs by subtracting National Elevation Data (NED) digital terrain models (DTMs). We found the following in three different forested regions of the US after excluding heterogeneous and disturbed forest samples: (1) G-LiHT DTMs were highly correlated with NED DTMs with R 2 > 0. 98 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) 0. 84 and RMSEs of 2. 7 to 4. 1 m; and (3) one GCP CHMs for two study sites had R 2 > 0. 7 and RMSEs of 2. 6 to 3 m where data were collected less than four years apart. Our results suggest that IKONOS stereo data are a useful LiDAR alternative where high-quality DTMs are available...|$|E
40|$|Monetary policy {{affects the}} {{macroeconomy}} only indirectly. In the standard mechanism, {{changes in the}} federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s main policy <b>instrument,</b> <b>lead</b> to changes in longer-term interest rates, which in turn lead to changes in aggregate demand. But the links between the funds rate, long rates, and demand may be far from tight, and this potential slippage is a fundamental problem for monetary policymakers. In particular, long-term interest rates sometimes move for reasons unrelated to short-term rates, confounding the Federal Reserve’s ability to control these long-term rates and effect desired changes in aggregate demand. Has the link between long rates and short rates weakened over time, therefore {{making it more difficult}} for the Federal Reserve to achieve its macroeconomic policy objectives through changes in the federal funds rate? Such questions naturally arise when one observes the behavior of longterm interest rates. For example, Figure 1 plots year-to-year changes in ten-year Treasury bond yields from 1965 through 1998. (The volatile period of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s has been masked to highlight differences between the early and later periods.) The most striking feature of the plot is the increase in the variability of long-term rates in the recent period relative to the earlier period. Indeed, the standard deviation of long rates essentially doubled across the two time periods. What caused this increase in variability? Did a change i...|$|E
