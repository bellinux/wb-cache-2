40|$|Standard {{analytic}} {{linear model}} of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> usually comes from assumptions of identical action piston areas {{on both sides}} of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> (double piston rod) and suitable operation point, which is usually chosen in the middle of piston. By reason of that volumes inside of cylinder are than same. Moreover for control of that arrangement of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> usually controlled by 4 / 3 servovalve, the same mount of flows comes in and comes out to each of chambers of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Presented paper deal with development of extended form of analytic linear model of single piston rod <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> which respects different action piston areas and volumes inside of chambers of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and also two different input flows of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In extended model are also considered possibilities of different dead volumes in hoses and intake parts of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Dead volume has impact on damping of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Because the system of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is generally presented as a integrative system with inertia of second order: eq, we can than obtain time constants and damping of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> for each of analytic form model.

40|$|Surgical {{procedures}} are increasingly performed using minimally invasive techniques, since it offers many {{benefits for the}} patient, particularly faster recovery times from the minimised surgical trauma. This operative technique involves the surgeon inserting specialised instruments, together with an endoscope for viewing, through small incisions in the skin. Despite the increasing demand for minimally invasive interventions, {{the development of new}} tools for these procedures stagnates. New instruments incorporating several degrees of freedom at the tool tip have been developed, however they are seldom used due to the technical problems that arise in their application. A transition from the use of mechanical power transmission with cables, towards direct drives with powerful micro-actuators in the instrument tip promises to solve these problems. Thus the demand for a powerful, lightweight and compact drive is recognised, which should only use cables or tubes and be spatially independent within a patient’s body. Through a comparison of existing drive types it can be shown that hydraulic systems best meet the outlined requirements for micro-actuation. In the concept phase, a theoretical analysis of the modification and miniaturisation of hydraulic drives to meet the requirements of the surgical application was completed. Subsequently through practical trials the theoretical concepts were verified and evaluated. For the practical trials powerful <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> with <b>diameters</b> of a few millimetres were developed and used to operate sample surgical instruments. Through the use of biocompatible materials and fluids to construct whole designs suitable for sterilisation, hydraulically powered instruments were created which satisfy the fundamental requirements for devices in medical applications. The verifications of these tools demonstrated that they can reach the required forces and far exceed them.
