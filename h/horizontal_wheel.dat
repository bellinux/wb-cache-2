25|$|The {{origin of}} this device {{is most likely}} is the Greek Byzantium. Many {{credible}} references {{can be found in}} medieval texts. Philo of Byzantium describes in Pneumatica a structure with similar functions. Hero of Alexandria in the 1st century B.C. tried a to make a distinction between a bucket-chain and wheel for raising water. However, it must be kept in mind that the principle of axial flow was well known in the Islamic world since 9th century when it was attested by the Banu Musa brothers who, in their Kitab al-hiyal (Book of Ingenious Devices) written in Baghdad in about 850 CE described a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> placed in one of their fountains and driven from below by a number of vertical jets of water.|$|E

6000|$|... "Imagine {{an immense}} body of smoke {{rising from the}} sea, the surface of which was marked by the silvery {{rippling}} of the waves. In a quiescent state it had {{the appearance of a}} circular cloud revolving on the water, like a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel,</b> in various and irregular involutions, expanding itself gradually on the lee side; when, suddenly, a column of the blackest cinders, ashes, and stones, would shoot up {{in the form of a}} spire, at an angle of from ten to twenty degrees from a perpendicular line, the angle of inclination being universally to windward. This was rapidly succeeded by a second, third, and fourth shower, each acquiring greater velocity, and overtopping the other, till they had attained an altitude as much above the level of our eye as the sea was below it.|$|E

60|$|It {{is an old}} story, {{and perhaps}} only deserves the light tone in which the soaring {{of a young man}} into the empyrean, and his descent again, is always narrated. But as has often been said, the light and the truth may be {{on the side of the}} dreamer: a far wider view than the wise ones have may be his at that {{recalcitrant}} time, and his reduction to common measure be nothing less than a tragic event. The operation called lunging, in which a haltered colt is made to trot round and round a horsebreaker who holds the rope, till the beholder grows dizzy in looking at them, is a very unhappy one for the animal concerned. During its progress the colt springs upward, across the circle, stops, flies over the turf with the velocity of a bird, and indulges in all sorts of graceful antics; but he always ends in one way--thanks to the knotted whipcord--in a level trot round the lunger with the regularity of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel,</b> and in the loss for ever to his character of the bold contours which the fine hand of Nature gave it. Yet the process is considered to be the making of him.|$|E

25|$|Conversion to an AGT {{system was}} {{relatively}} straightforward. The steel wheels were replaced with rubber ones, which ran {{in a narrow}} concrete guideway structure instead of the I-beam rails. The guideway was roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pedestrian sidewalk, with short vertical extension on either side to form a U-shape. Small <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> at the front of the cars pressed against the vertical sections and guided the main wheels around corners. Power was provided via a third rail system attached to the top of the right vertical extension (as seen in the direction of travel).|$|R
50|$|Most water {{wheels in}} the United Kingdom and the United States are (or were) {{vertical}} wheels rotating about a horizontal axle, {{but in the}} Scottish highlands and parts of Southern Europe mills often had a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> (with a vertical axle).|$|E

50|$|A <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> or {{segment of}} a wheel called a fifth wheel {{sometimes}} forms an extended support {{to prevent the}} carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a headblock might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.|$|E
50|$|The waggons {{suspended}} from {{two pairs of}} wheels placed not under the body but {{at each end of}} it, the body of the wagon was thus brought down to about3 in above the carrying rails, and a very low centre of gravity is by this means obtained. They were suspended below the axles, by which arrangement the centre of gravity was brought very low, and they were furnished with <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> running against the guide rails, whereby the equilibrium of the carriage to leave was maintained and it was rendered almost impossible for it to leave the rails.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{reference to}} water wheels dates to about 400 BCE,and the earliest <b>horizontal</b> axis <b>wheels</b> date to about 200 BCE, so vertical axis mills pre-date horizontal axis mills by about two centuries.|$|R
50|$|A {{water wheel}} is a machine for {{converting}} {{the energy of}} flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), {{with a number of}} blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but can also be mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft, for example the tub or Norse. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> usually directly drive their load.|$|R
50|$|The Nendrum Monastery mill was a tide mill on {{an island}} in Strangford Lough now in Northern Ireland. It is the {{earliest}} excavated tide mill, dating from 787 AD. Its millstones are 830mm in diameter and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> is estimated to have developed 7/8HP at its peak. Remains of an earlier mill dated at 619 AD were also found.|$|E
50|$|The most {{primitive}} sakias {{are driven}} by donkeys, mules, or oxen. The animal turns a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is engaged with the vertical wheel and so causes it to turn. This causes the buckets of the first type to circulate and lift up water from a deeper well, or with the second type, it causes the vertical wheel to rotate and scoop up water from a less deep well.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle wheel (li lun) is {{attached}} to the left road-wheel; it has a diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) 2.3 inches apart. There is also a lower <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> (hsia phing lun), of diameter 4.14 ft and circumference 12.42 ft, with 54 cogs, the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel (2.3 inches).

50|$|Manning, Wardle & Co. of the Boyne Engine Works, Leeds {{designed}} and built a special locomotive for its operation. It had to meet military {{as well as other}} requirements. The general plan {{of the structure of the}} locomotive has been designed by J.B. Fell, but the working plans were prepared and the engine built by Manning, Wardle & Co, Leeds. The engine weighed 4½ tons, and the tender 3½ tons, with coal and water. There were three pairs of driving-wheels coupled, each 16 in in diameter. There were also four <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> running upon guide rails fixed on the lower edges of the beams.|$|R
50|$|Rotary wheels come in {{different}} variations, including both continuous motion and indexing wheels, and vertical or <b>horizontal</b> variations. <b>Wheel</b> machines are favored for their processing ease, due to having only single (or in some cases, two) parisons, and mechanical repeatability.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} technology, using rubber {{tires on}} narrow concrete or steel roll ways, was pioneered on certain {{lines of the}} Paris Métro, and the first completely new system to use it was in Montreal, Canada. On most of these networks, additional <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> are required for guidance, and a conventional track is often provided in case of flat tires and for switching. There are also some rubber-tired systems that use a central guide rail, such as the Sapporo Municipal Subway and the NeoVal system in Rennes, France. Advocates of this system note that it is much quieter than conventional steel-wheeled trains, and allows for greater inclines given the increased traction of the rubber tires.|$|R
5000|$|Upon a {{vertical}} shaft turning with this wheel, there is fixed a bronze [...] "turning-like-the-wind wheel" [...] (hsuan feng lun) which has (only) 3 cogs, {{the distance between}} these being 1.2 inches. (This turns the following one.) In the middle is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel,</b> 4 ft in diameter, and 12 ft circumference, with 100 cogs, the distance between these cogs being the same as on the [...] "turning-like-the-wind wheel" [...] (1.2 inches).|$|E
50|$|Tip-Top - a flat ride {{manufactured}} by Hrubetz featuring ten tub-like cars, each with two bench seats and a large, <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> in the center. The ride would spin and be propelled upward by compressed air. Each car would spin independently, and riders could influence {{the speed and}} direction of their spin by pulling or pushing against the wheel. In the 1980s this ride was located south of the Indian mound, between the Scrambler and the Spider. The Flying Scooters ride has occupied this location since 2006.|$|E
5000|$|From 1917 until Easter 1922 {{the line}} was inactive, {{following}} the mobilization of personnel for the First World War. In 1923, the funicular transported [...] passengers. But in 1932 the chronic losses of the line forced services to be cut to Sundays only. The line had only [...] passengers in 1934, and it was finally decided to abandon the line in 1938. After a period of rail adhesion trials with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheel</b> gripping a central rail, the infrastructure was totally dismantled after the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|The Meigs Elevated Railway was an {{experimental}} steam-powered monorail invented by Josiah V. Meigs (also known as Joe Vincent Meigs) of Lowell, Massachusetts. He wrote an extensive {{explanation of how}} the railway worked, complete with diagrams and statistics, {{which was published in}} 1887. The weight of the train was carried on a 22 inch gauge track. The train was balanced by an additional set of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> which operated against a second set of rails 42 inches above the load carrying rails. A fire, supposedly of an incendiary nature, broke out on the night of Feb. 4, 1887, and destroyed Meigs's car sheds along with the experimental coach and tender and severely damaged the locomotive.|$|R

50|$|The {{base of the}} {{spinning}} tunnel holds the guide wheels that the tunnel rings rest and roll on. The drive motor for the tunnel that has the drive motor driving the guide wheels will also be installed on this framework. The tunnels that have a drive motor above the tunnel will have a vertical framework that {{is attached to the}} base. The guide wheels can be bicycle rims or pulleys which also hold the tunnel in place as it spins. Tunnels that use the hard rubber wheels will have an extra set of <b>horizontal</b> <b>wheels</b> at both ends, attached to the bridge, to keep the tunnel from wandering off the guide wheels. The bridge is also mounted to the base.|$|R
