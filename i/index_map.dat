40|$|Reliability Based Optimization (RBO) {{is often}} {{computationally}} intensive because the coupling of reliability evaluation and cost minimization. The mean first order reliability method (MFORM) is efficient for reliability evaluation, {{but it may}} not accurate. Nevertheless, the accurate reliability index is often highly correlated with the MFORM reliability index. In this study, we suggest that one can determine the relationship between the MFORM reliability index and the accurate reliability index through a regression analysis, which is called the reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> function. Based on the reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> function, an equivalent MFORM target reliability index can be determined such thatMFORMcan be used for reliability evaluation inRBO. Since the computational work involved in MFORM is minimal, RBO based on reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> functions is efficient. The reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> function determined via a regression analysis may only reflect the approximate relationship between the accurate reliability index and the MFORM reliability index. How to consider uncertainties in reliability <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> functions in RBO is also described in this paper. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for online/inline data processing efficient Fourier analysis {{becomes more and more}} relevant. Due {{to the fact that the}} bit reversal process requires considerable processing time of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, it is vital to optimize the bit reversal algorithm (BRA). This paper is to introduce an efficient BRA with multiple memory structures. In 2009, Elster showed the relation between the first and the second halves of the bit reversal permutation (BRP) and stated that it may cause serious impact on cache performance of the computer, if implemented. We found exceptions, especially when the said <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> was implemented with multiple one-dimensional memory structures instead of multidimensional or one-dimensional memory structure. Also we found a new <b>index</b> <b>mapping,</b> even after the recursive splitting of BRP into equal sized slots. The four-array and the four-vector versions of BRA with new <b>index</b> <b>mapping</b> reported 34 % and 16 % improvement in performance in relation to similar versions of Linear BRA of Elster which uses single one-dimensional memory structure...|$|R

Fuzzy memberships were derived from the landslide frequency ratio values.
