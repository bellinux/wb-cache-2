5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose <b>inner</b> <b>state,</b> amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E

40|$|To {{account for}} the {{phenomenon}} of quantum decoherence of a macroscopic object, such as the localization and disappearance of interference, we invoke the adiabatic quantum entanglement between its collective states(such {{as that of the}} center-of-mass (C. M)) and its <b>inner</b> <b>states</b> based on our recent investigation. Under the adiabatic limit that motion of C. M dose not excite the transition of <b>inner</b> <b>states,</b> it is shown that the wave function of the macroscopic object can be written as an entangled state with correlation between adiabatic <b>inner</b> <b>states</b> and quasi-classical motion configurations of the C. M. Since the adiabatic <b>inner</b> <b>states</b> are factorized with respect to each parts composing the macroscopic object, this adiabatic separation can induce the quantum decoherence. This observation thus provides us with a possible solution to the Schroedinger cat paradox. PACS number: 05. 30. -d, 03. 65 -w, 32. 80 -t, 42. 50 -p 1 I...|$|R

25|$|In The Gestalt Theory of Motivation (1960), {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby {{people do not}} think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person {{is in the same}} position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her <b>inner</b> <b>state</b> of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.|$|E

2500|$|The expressiveness of Kathak is {{also found}} in other {{classical}} dances of India.

The Natya connects through abhinaya (literally, [...] "carrying to the spectators"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein asserts Natyashastra, the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music. Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.

40|$|Intention is {{considered}} as a key determinant of behaviour in goal theories and theories of attitude-behaviour relations (e. g., Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)). However, the intention-behavior relation is relatively weak, largely a consequence of people having good intentions but failing to act on them. A distinction must be made between forming an intention, a motivational process, and implementing it, a volitional one. Volition addresses the regulation of behavior after the intention has been formed. Problems of goal implementation involve action initiation or ongoing goal striving from getting derailed. Implementation Intentions (IMIs) are a specific volitional tool which consists of specifying an anticipated cue (‘If’ component) {{as a condition for}} initiating or protecting goal-directed responses (‘then’ component). These kinds of intentions lead to more frequent goal attainment compared to setting mere goal intentions. In the health domain, IMIs were specifically proved to increase the likelihood of realizing intentions when shielding ongoing goal pursuits from disruptive <b>inner</b> <b>states.</b> In the present field of research, it was investigated in the academic domain whether some <b>inner</b> <b>states,</b> which could impair study, could be specified in the ‘if’ component of IMIs and linked to an effective shielding response in the ‘then’ part. These intentions were also assumed to trigger not only motivational control actions, but also intentions of learning behaviours and to mediate the effects of the classical variables of the TPB on academic performance. 207 freshmen students completed longitudinal questionnaires and Structural Equation Modelling was employed (Lisrel; Robust Maximum Likelihood Method). IMIs geared at controlling interfering motivational <b>inner</b> <b>states</b> enhanced the rate of actions protecting goalstriving and triggered intentions of learning strategies, which were positive antecedents of study behaviors. IMIs totally mediated the effect of classical variables of TPB. The whole model increased the amount of explained variance of academic performance above the contribution of the constructs of the TPB (R 2 =. 35). In the academic domain, use of unwanted motivational <b>inner</b> <b>states</b> as initiators of goal-shielding responses through IMIs maximizes the effects of simple intentions to make good marks. IMIs are also a self-regulating tool capable of inducing intentions and behaviors of applying learning strategies, which are positive antecedents of academic performance. Peer reviewe...|$|R
