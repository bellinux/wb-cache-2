5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> a weak Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that brought torrential rains {{to much of}} the northern Caribbean in 2011. The fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season, Emily developed from a strong but poorly organized tropical wave that tracked the open Atlantic for several days in late July. On August1, it approached the Lesser Antilles and became better defined, producing inclement weather over much of the area. Two days later, the disturbance developed a closed wind circulation center, marking the formation of Tropical Storm Emily. The storm remained fairly disorganized as it proceeded into the Caribbean, though it generated strong thunderstorms and gusty winds along its path. On August4, <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}}, after the mountainous areas of Hispaniola disrupted its weak circulation. Upon exiting the northeastern Caribbean on August6, its remnants regenerated into a tropical storm, ultimately dissipating the next day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> {{the only}} major {{hurricane}} to develop during the below-average 1987 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming out of a tropical disturbance that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September20, the storm quickly attained hurricane status before undergoing rapid intensification. On September22, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). The storm weakened slightly to Category 2 status before making landfall in the Dominican Republic. After weakening to a tropical storm, Emily rapidly tracked northeastward through the Atlantic Ocean, undergoing a second phase of rapid intensification before passing directly over Bermuda on September25. The following day the final public advisory from the National Hurricane Center was issued on the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|The season had {{fourteen}} tropical depressions, {{of which}} seven intensified into tropical stormsan average season has ten tropical stormsthree became hurricanes and one, Emily, {{became a major}} hurricane. The inactivity throughout the basin was linked to persistent, strong vertical wind shear; most of the season's storms were unable to intensify due to the shear, resulting in a low number of named storms and hurricanes. The two most notable storms of the season were Hurricanes Arlene and Emily. Hurricane Arlene spent roughly 14.5 days as a tropical storm before intensifying into a hurricane, the longest span between these intensities on record. Hurricane <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> the only major hurricane of the season; its wind speeds peaked at 125mph (205km/h) before impacting the Dominican Republic.

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a hurricane, <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> centered roughly 1,000mi (1,600km) {{east of the}} Florida peninsula, passing well south of Bermuda. A ridge of high pressure began to mature to its north, forcing the hurricane westward on August27. Emily's winds vacillated between tropical storm and hurricane force {{over the course of}} the day, although the cyclone resumed its strengthening by August28 upon developing favorable upper-level outflow. Traversing warm sea surface temperatures, the hurricane continued to improve in appearance on satellite images, and the barometric pressure within its eye steadily decreased. Emily retraced toward the northwest on August29, when a shortwave trough eroded the southern periphery of the contiguous ridge. The NHC expressed uncertainty in forecasting Emily's track, stating that South Carolina, North Carolina, and Mid-Atlantic states were at risk of a direct hit from the hurricane. As high pressure re-established itself off the North Carolina coast, Emily briefly turned west-northwestward on August30 before initiating a prolonged curve toward the north. By that time, the NHC forecast Emily to remain offshore, though one tropical cyclone forecast model projected that the hurricane would move inland.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but coming down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensification}} trend {{picked up}} {{again the next}} day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea, a region typically unfavorable for intensification. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, briefly bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July15. During the day, the storm's strength fluctuated greatly, dropping to a Category2 storm and then rebuilding to Category4. On July16, Emily strengthened considerably, making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of July with peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), the earliest known Category 5 in the Atlantic basin. Initially at this point <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> thought to have peaked as a Category4 storm, but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a Category5 hurricane. The storm weakened slightly as it continued westward, and remained a Category4 while passing south of Jamaica and, on July17, the Cayman Islands. Hurricane Emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest, weakening somewhat but remaining at Category4 until striking Cozumel just before mainland landfall at Playa del Carmen at 06:30UTC on July18. Sustained winds were 135mph (215km/h), and the eyewall passed directly over Cozumel.|$|E

5|$|With a {{relatively}} dry environment along its projected path, <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> expected to strengthen only gradually until its predicted {{passage through the}} Greater Antilles. For several hours into August2, the cyclone fluctuated little in intensity and organization as it developed banding features. Emily's appearance later improved on satellite images, and it developed a ragged central dense overcast; the NHC estimated that the storm had reached its peak sustained winds of 50mph (80km/h) by 0000UTC on August3. Nevertheless, reconnaissance revealed that its circulation remained poorly organized, and at the time, several forecast models even supported dissipation prior to landfall in Hispaniola. An increase in upper wind shear removed the deepest convection from the circulation center, and it would remain so {{for the rest of}} the storm's duration. On August4, the cloud pattern and convective banding became better organized near the center as the upper outflow over the cyclone expanded. Emily proceeded to track just south of the Dominican Republic, where its weak circulation became increasingly disrupted due to the adjacent high terrain and increasing vertical wind shear. The cyclone accelerated over Hispaniola and degenerated into an open trough around 2100UTC that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{cyclogenesis}} of Tropical Storm <b>Emily</b> <b>was</b> complicated, extending {{over several}} days from late July into early August. An easterly tropical wave—an equatorward trough of low pressure—exited the west African coast {{in the fourth}} week of July, at which point it became largely embedded within the monsoon trough. Located {{to the south of}} a ride of high pressure, the wave moved west-northwestward across the open Atlantic; it retained a broad circulation with little to no precipitation for a day or two. Over time, clusters of convection increased around the broad system, and it developed two distinct centers of circulation on July30. During the morning of July 31, the large low markedly gained in organization, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted it was close to becoming a tropical depression. Later that day, however, the main circulation became increasingly elongated; its westernmost component soon detached to form a separate tropical wave. This new disturbance featured widely scattered convection and rainbands, which briefly affected the Lesser Antilles. The next day, a new area of deep convection with a dominant center formed as the circulation became better defined. It passed through the Leeward Islands with some improvement in its structure, and the surface winds rose to near tropical storm force. A reconnaissance flight into the system revealed the circulation center had become well defined near the deep convection. The system was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Emily at 0000UTC on August2, when it was located to the south of Dominica. During the initial stages of its existence, the storm accelerated toward the west-northwest in response to the strong high pressure to its north.|$|E
