500|$|By lap 39, Alonso {{had reduced}} the time deficit {{between himself and}} Massa as the latter was lapping the two Virgin cars. At the start of lap 40, Massa held a 1.2 second lead over Alonso, who in turn, was 5.2 seconds in front of Vettel. Hamilton in fourth place was 18.1 seconds behind the race, but was {{maintaining}} a steady gap to teammate Button in fifth. Webber was told by Red Bull over the radio {{to increase the gap}} to Button, because his car was suffering from an issue with its oil consumption, and was told that braking harder into the track's turns would possibly assist in moving some oil around the inside of his car. Petrov made an error which allowed Kobayashi to take advantage but Petrov held off the challenge. A radio transmission from Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was intercepted on lap 48, with Smedley telling Massa, [...] "OK, so, Fernando (Alonso) is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> you confirm you understood that message?" [...] Based on Smedley's tone, commentators surmised that it had been a coded message from engineer to driver telling Massa to move over and allow Alonso through.|$|E
500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2010 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Alonso became {{involved}} in a controversy with teammate Massa, as Ferrari were accused of using team orders during the race. The incident started when Massa was leading the race and defended his pole position when Alonso tried to overtake him. Alonso said [...] "This is ridiculous" [...] on the team radio, supposedly complaining about Massa. Ferrari engineer Rob Smedley then contacted Massa through radio to say [...] "Fernando is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> you confirm you understood that message?". Shortly after this, Massa slowed down and was overtaken by Alonso {{in what appeared to}} be team orders. Shortly after the race notable people of the senior personnel in Ferrari, Massa and Alonso were summoned to the stewards. The matter was then referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council and Ferrari were given a $100,000 fine but the result of the race was unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|On September 21, 1985, Holmes {{stepped in}} the ring looking to equal Rocky Marciano's 49-0 career record and to make his twentieth {{successful}} title defense. His opponent was looking to make history as well. After winning the undisputed championship at light heavyweight, Michael Spinks decided to move up in weight and try to become the second fighter after Bob Fitzsimmons to win titles at both light heavyweight and heavyweight. An elder statesman who had tried for these latter honors, Archie Moore, predicted an easy win for Holmes: [...] "I'm afraid Larry will chew him up. Michael may be <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> Larry, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only go so fast." [...] Despite the assessment, it indeed would be Spinks whose historical destiny would be fulfilled, albeit controversially, as he defeated Holmes via unanimous decision {{to become the first}} reigning light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight title. After the fight, a bitter Holmes said, [...] "Rocky Marciano couldn't carry my jockstrap." ...|$|R

5000|$|After the 2002 season, FIA {{announced}} that [...] "Team Orders that could influence {{the outcome of}} a race" [...] were banned, although they were sometimes still implemented discreetly. For example, this has sometimes been achieved as easily as a team getting on the radio to the slower driver and pointing out that his teammate is quicker. The slower driver then lets the quicker driver through without the need for an overt [...] "directive" [...] from the team. This happened, for example, at the 2010 Turkish Grand Prix, where Mark Webber was asked to slow down when his Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel was closing in. Webber disregarded the order, and the pair collided, each refusing to accept blame for the accident. Similarly, at the 2010 German Grand Prix, Felipe Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was heard to say to his driver [...] "Fernando (Alonso) is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Can</b> you confirm you understand that message?". Moments later, Massa eased back and allowed Alonso past.|$|E

[...] Nintendo's decision to exclude this feature from the XL version was also considered odd. Wired felt that the new locations for the power button, card slot, and stylus holder were [...] "inconvenient". Critics also felt the switch to MicroSD cards and the relocation of the SD card slot to the battery compartment would make manually transferring data from previous 3DS models trickier; GameSpot lamented on the difficulty of unscrewing the rear cover off the XL, citing [...] "stubborn screws and a panel that practically refuses to detach". Nintendo's decision to not bundle an AC adapter with the new models was criticized, particularly in the case of first-time 3DS owners.|$|E
5000|$|Social media adds an {{additional}} dimension, as the networks that users create can become echo chambers (possibly emphasised by the filter bubble) where one political viewpoint dominates and scrutiny of claims fails, allowing a parallel media ecosystem of websites, publishers and news channels to develop which can repeat post-truth claims without rebuttal. In this environment, post-truth campaigns can ignore fact checks or dismiss {{them as being}} motivated by bias. The Guardian editor-in-chief Katherine Viner laid {{some of the blame}} on the rise of clickbait - articles of dubious factual content with a misleading headline, designed to be widely shared - saying that [...] "chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity" [...] undermines the value of journalism and truth. David Mikkelson, co-founder of the fact checking and debunking site Snopes.com, described the introduction of social media and fake news sites as a turning point, saying [...] "I’m not sure I’d call it a post-truth age but … there’s been an opening of the sluice-gate and everything is pouring through.
