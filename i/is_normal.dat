Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH level <b>is</b> <b>normal</b> or low and serum free T4 {{levels are}} low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus).

There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E

30|$|A 45 -year-old {{multiparous}} woman {{presented in}} May 2006 with an abdominal lump of 6  months duration. Her cycles were regular {{and there was}} no menorrhagia. There were no other significant symptoms, including any history of weight loss. On examination, there was a large mass arising from the pelvis, corresponding to 32  weeks gestation. Internal examination revealed that the cervix was drawn up and the uterus could not be felt separate from the mass. Clinically an ovarian pathology could not be excluded. On rectal examination, the rectal mucosa <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> and there <b>were</b> no palpable nodules in the pouch of Douglas. Hematological and biochemical investigations <b>were</b> <b>normal.</b> Pap smear <b>was</b> <b>normal.</b> An ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass extending up to the epigastrium with solid and hyperechoic areas.

5|$|In pregnancy, {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{is defined}} as a TSH between 2.5 and 10mIU/l with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10mIU/l are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level <b>is</b> <b>normal.</b> Antibodies against TPO may be important in making decisions about treatment, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It <b>is</b> <b>normal</b> to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which <b>is</b> <b>normal</b> for non-eruptive events.|$|E

5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it <b>is</b> <b>normal</b> for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what <b>is</b> <b>normal,</b> and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
