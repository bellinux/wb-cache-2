And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E

500|$|Fincher {{stated that}} every main cast member {{was their first}} choice. In the first read through, he said [...] "I want {{everybody}} here {{to know that you}} represent our first choice— each actor here represents our first choice for these characters. So do not fuck this up." [...] Spacey, whose last regular television role was in the series Wiseguy, responded positively to the script. He then played Richard III, which Fincher said was [...] "great training". Spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once, believing that this type of release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows. He said, [...] "When I ask my friends what they did with their weekend, they say, 'Oh, I stayed in and watched three seasons of Breaking Bad or it's two seasons of Game of Thrones". He was officially cast on March 18, 2011. Robin Wright was approached by Fincher to star in the series when they worked together in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She was cast as Claire Underwood in June 2011. Kate Mara was cast as Zoe Barnes in early February 2012. Mara's sister, Rooney Mara, worked with Fincher in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and when Kate Mara read the part of Zoe, she [...] "fell in love with the character" [...] and asked her sister to [...] "put in a word <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> Fincher". The next month, she got a call for an audition.|$|E
500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>With</b> Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E
2500|$|Spencer Tracy was {{originally}} cast in April 1957 as Joseph Chapin. Because of Tracy's repeated teaming with Katharine Hepburn, the film's producer Charles Brackett {{announced he was}} enthusiastic about casting Hepburn as his wife. In May 1957, model-actress Suzy Parker told the press in an interview: [...] "If I'm good in Kiss Them <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>with</b> Cary Grant, Buddy Adler {{is going to give}} me a very good role in 10 North Frederick with Spencer Tracy. Parker was eventually cast, which, according to insiders, did not satisfy Tracy, who left the production in November 1957. Tracy dismissed these rumours, saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1993 Tench sang lead vocals with The Thin Lizzy band, which {{featured}} original Thin Lizzy drummer Brian Downey, former guitarist Brian Robertson, also Doish Nagle and bassist Dough Brookie. The band played a short tour of Ireland. Tench also played guitar and sang vocals with former Animals keyboardist Alan Price and The Electric Blues Company on Covers (1994). Later that year he recorded A Gigster's Life <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> <b>with</b> the same lineup. This album was recorded between July and August 1995 at Olympic Studios, London and released {{the next year}} as part of Sanctuary's Blues Masters Series. In his review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek hints at Tench's influence on the album and stated that [...] "the Peter Barden's and Bobby Tench song Good Times, Bad Woman with its slippery guitars and keyboards feels more like Peter Green's mid-period work and the killer read of Boz Scagg's Some Change, is more driven and funky than the original. Then there's the reggae-blues of the title trick, which swings out of a jazzy backbeat into a rootsier inner circle type groove".|$|E
