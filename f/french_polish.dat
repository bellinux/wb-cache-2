5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including <b>French,</b> <b>Polish</b> (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was convinced that {{the fortress}} would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E

50|$|<b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> became {{prominent}} in the 18th century. In the Victorian era, <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> was commonly used on mahogany and other expensive timbers. It was considered the best finish for fine furniture and string instruments such as pianos and guitars. The process was very labour-intensive, and many manufacturers abandoned the technique around 1930, preferring the cheaper and quicker techniques of spray finishing nitrocellulose lacquer and abrasive buffing. In Britain, instead of abrasive buffing, a fad of pullover is used {{in much the same}} way as traditional <b>French</b> <b>polishing.</b> This slightly melts the sprayed surface and has the effect of filling the grain and burnishing at the same time to leave a 'French polished' look.|$|R

5000|$|<b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> is a wood {{finishing}} {{technique that}} results in a very high gloss surface, with a deep colour and chatoyancy. <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> consists of applying many thin coats of shellac dissolved in denatured alcohol using a rubbing pad lubricated with one {{of a variety of}} oils (see below). The rubbing pad is made of absorbent cotton or wool cloth wadding inside of a piece of fabric (usually soft cotton cloth) and is commonly referred to as a fad, also called a rubber, tampon, or [...] (Spanish for [...] "rag doll").|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{variations}} to <b>French</b> <b>polishing</b> {{with regard to the}} use of pumice/ abrasives. In the original 'French Method', both shellac and abrasive are applied and worked together. In the 'British Method', shellac and abrasive are worked alternately.|$|R
50|$|Brasso can be {{successfully}} {{used to take}} minor (white) heat marks out of <b>French</b> <b>polished</b> wooden surfaces.

Following the evacuation of southern Norway Fleischer was embroiled in conflicts with the political and military leadership arriving from the abandoned southern parts of the country. The General's hard-headed and uncompromising style did not help in this regard.|$|E

25|$|The Cybersix {{animated}} series {{debuted in}} Canada and Argentina on 6 September 1999, and was subsequently dubbed for <b>French,</b> <b>Polish,</b> Japanese, Malaysian, and Taiwanese. It was animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsha and NOA; produced by Herve Bedard, Toshihiko Masuda, and Koji Takeuchi; with storyboards by Atsuko Tanaka, Hiroyuki Aoyama, Nabuo Tomizawa, and Kazuhide Tomonag; and written by Catherine Girczyc, Carlos Meglia, and Carlos Trillo. Original music was composed by Robbi Finkel, and character designs were overseen by Teiichi Takiguchi. The show {{was aimed at}} children by toning down the comics' darker themes. Two seasons of 13 episodes were originally supposed to be made but it was cancelled after the first season due to conflicts between production studios.|$|E
25|$|It {{took four}} major offensives between January and May 1944 before {{the line was}} {{eventually}} broken by a combined assault of the Fifth and Eighth Armies (including British, American, <b>French,</b> <b>Polish</b> and Canadian Corps) concentrated along a twenty-mile front between Monte Cassino and the western seaboard. In a concurrent action, American General Mark Clark was ordered {{to break out of}} the stagnant position at Anzio and cash-in on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the German 10th Army retreating from the Gustav Line between them and the Canadians. But this opportunity was lost on the brink of success, when Clark disobeyed his orders and sent his U.S. forces to enter the vacant Rome instead. Rome had been declared an open city by the German Army so no resistance was encountered.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, it was {{announced}} that the UK version was changing its format, reducing the number of questions in the game from fifteen to twelve. The new payout structure was as follows: first going from £500 to £2,000 with the prize values doubling for each new question, then from £5,000 to £20,000 with the prize values doubling for each new question, then to £50,000, £75,000 and £150,000, and finally from £250,000 to £1,000,000 with the prize value doubling for each new question. Whereas the first safe haven remained at £1,000, the second safe haven was moved to £50,000. The new rules debuted in an episode that aired on 18 August 2007. Within a period of four years following its introduction to the British Millionaire, the 12-question format was subsequently carried over to a number of international versions, including the Arab, Bulgarian, Dutch, <b>French,</b> <b>Polish,</b> Spanish, and Turkish versions.|$|E

500|$|According to the Nazis, in {{addition}} to the Germanic peoples, individuals of seemingly non-Germanic nationality such as <b>French,</b> <b>Polish,</b> Walloon, Czech and so on might actually possess valuable Germanic blood, especially if they were of aristocratic or peasant stock. In order to [...] "recover" [...] these [...] "missing" [...] Germanic elements, they had to be made conscious of their Germanic ancestry through the process of Germanization (the term used by the Nazis for this process was Umvolkung, [...] "restoration to the race"). If the [...] "recovery" [...] was impossible, these individuals had to be destroyed to deny the enemy of using their superior blood against the Aryan race. An example of this type of Nazi Germanization is the kidnapping of [...] "racially valuable" [...] Eastern European children. Curiously, those chosen for Germanization who rejected the Nazis were viewed as being racially more suitable than those who went along without objections, as according to Himmler [...] "it was in the nature of German blood to resist".|$|E

500|$|The {{troops were}} {{positioned}} thinly along the French coast, {{with an average}} of [...] per division. Generally, the troops of the German divisions were only second and third rate. This meant that {{over the course of the}} war, the divisions were thinned out and soldiers were replaced with wounded old veterans as well as Volksdeutsche from Poland and Czechoslovakia. Numerous units were also replaced by Ostlegionen and Ostbataillone. These units were volunteers from Eastern Europe, mainly the Soviet Union, and had a generally low fighting morale. The equipment of those troops was in poor shape, consisting of old weapons from various nations, with <b>French,</b> <b>Polish,</b> Soviet, Italian, and Czech guns, artillery, and mortars. Four of the German divisions were designated as [...] "static", which meant that they were stripped of all of their mobile capabilities and unable to move from their position. The only potent unit inside Army GroupG was the 11th Panzer Division, which was commanded by Wend von Wietersheim.|$|E
500|$|The {{workforce}} {{consisted of}} a mixture of German specialists and forcibly conscripted Frenchmen from the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO). They were supplemented by Belgian, Dutch, <b>French,</b> <b>Polish,</b> Czech and Soviet prisoners of war and civilian conscripts, who were used as slave labour. The labour force also included many French political prisoners and Spanish Republicans who had fled to France after General Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War but had then been interned by the invading Germans. The non-German workers lived in two camps officially known as Organisation Todt Watten Zwangsarbeitslager 62 (Forced Labour Camp 62) about [...] distant from the site, {{near the village of}} Éperlecques. The camps were guarded by the French civil police with the assistance of Belgian and Dutch Nazis and Russian POWs who had volunteered for guard duty. Although escape attempts were punished by immediate execution, there were up to three escapes daily with external assistance. The commandant of the camp is said to have complained {{that it would have been}} easier to [...] "guard a sack of fleas". Over 35,000 foreign workers passed through the camps during the period in which they were operational.|$|E
