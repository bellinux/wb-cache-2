5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
500|$|Townshend {{has taken}} an {{interest}} in licensing the Who's work to media and advertising, and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] has made several appearances on TV and film. A portion of the song {{has been used as}} the opening theme for the CBS series , while an edited version of the track was played on The Simpsons [...] "A Tale of Two Springfields" [...] which featured the Who as special guests. However, Townshend refused permission for director Michael Moore to play the song over the closing credits of Fahrenheit 9/11, as he was suspicious of Moore's journalistic credentials and did not want his work to be associated with a possibly inaccurate film. Townshend later said [...] "nce <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> what the film was about, I was 90% certain my song was not right for them." [...] In response Moore accused Townshend of supporting the Iraq War, which Townshend denied.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album were written {{at the same time}} as the songs on Body Talk Pt. 1. In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better." [...] While being interviewed by Billboard, Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper, stating, [...] "It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him, first because I always was a fan but also because he was really creative and we had so much of an exchange in being there together, both as vocalists. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> and he really got it and got into it, which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal". Robyn spoke of the duo, saying that [...] "these really young guys who are part of a scene that I probably would've gotten into if I wasn't away so much when I was younger." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Man {{received}} positive reviews – including 4 {{stars from}} Q Magazine; and 5 from Sounds Magazine {{who called the}} album a [...] "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement". Drummond intended to focus on writing books once The Man had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, [...] "That only lasted three months, until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a record and got dragged back into it all".|$|E
2500|$|The Runaways {{were formed}} in late 1975 by drummer Sandy West and rhythm guitarist Joan Jett {{after they had}} both {{introduced}} themselves to producer Kim Fowley, who gave Jett's phone number to West. The two met on their own at West's home and later called Fowley to let him hear the outcome. Fowley then helped the girls find other members. Two decades later he said, [...] "I didn't put the Runaways together, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> they had ideas, we all met, there was combustion and out of five different versions of that group came the five girls who {{were the ones that}} people liked." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the first}} time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had {{anything}} to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.|$|E

[...] "I love her [...] work and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> to do like a really girl power, fun Valley girl video," [...] Spears claimed of the video partnership, adding {{that it was the}} first video she had done in a long time where she came up with the concept, also stating [...] "there’s a lot of dancing. I got new choreographers to come in and kind of do hip-hop dancing, which I haven’t done in a really long time, so the feel of the video is really different and hi-energy." ...|$|E

[...] He also {{returned}} to Princeton during the fall of 1895 as an assistant coach for the Princeton football team. [...] While at Lawrenceville, he sought [...] "to impart into growing youth the mathematical idea, also the rudiments of foot-ball, and the truth of truths that there is no University in the country like Princeton." [...] He later wrote, [...] "Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, even before I left college <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I might be a doctor some day." [...] In another piece, he noted that he [...] "tried for a year to instill Princeton ideas, along with a little knowledge into the heads of the younger generation. [...] The work was pleasant and I was associated with some fine men; but medicine is to be my vocation." ...|$|E

Conwell auditioned for the role because her [...] "entire family watches the show", she explained [...] "the character was one that I really wanted to play. When I went to the audition, I just really felt it and I think it came off in the audition. I really enjoy working with the cast. They are such great actors which I don’t {{think a lot of people}} realize. The whole experience has been just great". Conwell prepared for the role by researching characteristics of lawyers. Additionally, she said, [...] "I also watched a lot of movies where actors or actresses I admire played lawyers. I then added my own spin on it which I think is very important.

60|$|He {{made this}} last remark in a mournful voice, {{but there was}} a gleam in his eye which belied its melancholy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> Sir Henry Curtis {{actually}} likes fighting.|$|R
60|$|I am used to {{thinking}} quickly, {{and by the}} time I had read this <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the point}} I want to fix. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> {{you may have}} found me wanting in good manners. I've never congratulated you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> she {{was getting}} angry with me. She did not say so. I {{gathered}} it. But I had to explain myself somehow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt {{a little}} shiver," [...] she confided. [...] "I don't know why. I loathe those two men father <b>has</b> here, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> somehow, that they don't like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say two pounds," [...] he replied. [...] "With {{my three}} we {{could set up}} an {{establishment}} of our own. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that is original. Shall we work it out together?" ...|$|R

6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of my own. I said, as if {{speaking}} to myself: [...] "I {{would give a}} five pound note {{to know what is}} going on upstairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that, by any chance, {{one of our}} missing guests, Captain Holderness?" [...] she inquired, turning towards him. [...] "I don't know why, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that it is your sister." ...|$|R
