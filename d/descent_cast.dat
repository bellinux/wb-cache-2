5000|$|Walter Lawrence Burke (August 25, 1908 [...] - [...] August 4, 1984) was an American {{character}} actor, of stage, film, {{and television}} of Irish <b>descent.</b> Usually <b>cast</b> as an Irishman or Englishman, his small stature, distinctive voice and face made him easily recognizable {{in even the}} most minor of roles.|$|R
50|$|In 1576 {{he formed}} the Catholic League {{to keep the}} new heir, Henry of Navarre, off the throne. The talent and dash of Guise contrasted favorably with the vacillation and {{weakness}} of Henry III. He {{was said to have}} claimed a Carolingian <b>descent</b> and <b>cast</b> eyes on the throne. This led to the stage of the Wars of Religion known as the War of the Three Henries (1584-1588).|$|R
25|$|Poitier {{began to}} be criticized for being typecast as over-idealized African American {{characters}} who were not permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Poitier was aware of this pattern himself, but was conflicted on the matter. He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged {{to set an example}} with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes as he was the only major actor of African <b>descent</b> being <b>cast</b> in leading roles in the American film industry, at that time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of Othello with that spirit in mind.|$|R
25|$|The {{lead role}} was {{originally}} written for someone of Caucasian <b>descent,</b> but upon <b>casting</b> African-American actor Duane Jones, Romero intentionally did {{not alter the}} script to reflect this. Asked in 2013, if he took inspiration from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. that same year, Romero responded in the negative noting that he only heard about the shooting {{when he was on}} his way to find distribution for the finished film.|$|R
50|$|Carole Ruggier is a British actress of Maltese, Italian and Irish <b>descent.</b> As a <b>casting</b> director, director, {{and voice}} actress, she {{is known for}} her work on video games. Notable voice roles include Athena in God of War and God of War II, and Auntie Dot in Halo: Reach. Ruggier's family left Egypt as {{refugees}} from the Suez Crisis and she was born just after their arrival in the UK. She grew up in London and moved to Los Angeles, California.|$|R
500|$|Maureen Teefy, an {{established}} actress of Irish <b>descent,</b> was <b>cast</b> as Doris Finsecker, a shy and uptight Jewish girl. De Silva disagreed with Teefy's casting, stating, [...] "...I'd envisioned [...] as a 16-or 17-year-old Barbra Streisand from Brooklyn, and when [...] cast this Irish actress {{that was a}} trouble... that was my only reservation; I really had envisioned {{she was a young}} Barbra Streisand, a Jewish girl." [...] Parker and the casting department had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Hilary Van Doren. Antonia Franceschi, who had previously acted as a background dancer in the musical Grease (1978), secured the role based on the strength of her audition. Meg Tilly appears in her acting debut as a principal dancer. In his first credited screen role, Peter Rafelson, son of Bob Rafelson, appears as a principal musician and vocalist.|$|R
25|$|While the British {{continued}} such expeditions against French {{colonies and}} islands {{beyond the reach}} of the French land forces, this was the last attempt by an amphibious expedition in force against the coast of France during the Seven Years' War. The fiasco of the <b>descent</b> on Saint <b>Cast</b> helped convince British Prime Minister Pitt to send military aid and troops to fight with Ferdinand and Frederick the Great on the continent of Europe. The potential for another disaster and overall expense of expeditions this size was considered to outweigh the temporary gain of the raids.|$|R
5000|$|Power Rangers Mystic Force is {{the first}} and only Disney-produced Power Rangers series to feature the main villain in its Super Sentai counterpart, and {{is the first}} of the Disney-produced Power Rangers series in which all the actors playing the five core Rangers are of Australian or New Zealander <b>descent</b> (the <b>casts</b> of the three Disney-produced Power Rangers series prior to Mystic Force had at least one Ranger actor of North American descent). It is also the only Power Rangers series in which the Rangers wear capes. This is the second Disney series that does not have a teamup with the {{previous}} season's rangers. The first was Power Rangers Ninja Storm. In Mystic Force's case, the missing crossover would have been with Power Rangers S.P.D. However, a character from that series, Piggy cameoed in the episode [...] "Ranger Down". It was also the last season to aired on ABC Family, when the channel dropped off Jetix on August 31, 2006.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a series}} of films in the 1930s and '40s, Chinese-American detective Charlie Chan was played by white actors Warner Oland, Sidney Toler and Roland Winters. The Swedish-born Oland, unlike his two successors in the Chan role, {{actually}} looked somewhat Asian, and according to his contemporaries, he did not use special makeup in the role. He also played Asians in other films, including Shanghai Express, The Painted Veil, and Werewolf of London. (Decades later, American TV actor Khigh Dhiegh, though of African and European <b>descent,</b> was generally <b>cast</b> as an East Asian because of his appearance, and he was often included on lists of Asian actors.) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of review: The {{prevalence}} of obesity across the world continues to climb, bringing with it otherwise preventable obesity-related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintain through lifestyle interventions alone, leading to intense efforts to develop adjunctive pharmacological approaches. Herein, we examine recent advances in this field and limitations of currently available and emerging agents. Recent findings: Liraglutide, lorcaserin and combination of phentermine–topiramate and bupropion–naltrexone have all {{been the subject of}} recent studies examining their efficacy as weight-loss agents. Although each effectively induces weight loss over and above placebo, significant concerns exist regarding side-effect profiles and safety, along with their ability to achieve sustained effects. Dropout rates in all examined studies were up to 50 % or more, usually a result of intolerable side-effects. Recruitment of a high proportion of women of European <b>descent</b> also <b>casts</b> doubt on the generalizability of trial data. Summary: Pharmacological interventions for weight loss remain limited, with side-effects often outweighing efficacy. Interestingly, substantial early weight loss was associated with sustained loss, suggesting a responsive phenotype and future trials might best be targeted in identifying responsive subpopulations.

40|$|The {{impact of}} three forms of {{intergroup}} contact (Mexican descent, other minority, and Anglo) {{on the social}} identities and political attitudes of a national sample of native-born persons of Mexican <b>descent</b> was examined. <b>Cast</b> within Tajfel's Social Identity theory, the various social contexts were expected to predict three distinct types of ethnic identity: Cultural Ethnicity (Ingroup contact), Politicized Ethnicity (Ingroup and Minority Outgroup contact), and Assimilationist Ethnicity (Anglo contact). Contrasting political orientations were also predicted for the types of contact, with group-conscious attitudes associated with Ingroup and Minority Outgroup contacts and conservative political attitudes with A nglo contact. Support is provided for the expected relationships between Ingroup and Minority Outgroup interactions and identity and political attitudes. Anglo contact was related to conservative political attitudes...|$|R
50|$|Simon Bae is a sorcerer of Korean and Swedish <b>descent</b> who can <b>cast</b> spells, such as {{levitation}} and mist projection. He is {{fifteen years}} old. His father, a lawyer named Kit Bae, {{worked for the}} Edison Group, eventually adopting Simon's foster brother, Derek, with whom he shares a close bond. Simon is actually Tori's brother, which is revealed in Enthralled. Simon is shown to be very easygoing, as opposed to Derek's tense nature, and is diabetic. He develops feelings for Chloe, agreeing to help her escape. He will do anything for his brother, which influences Derek's decision to stay after choosing to distract Davidoff for the girls to escape. He has not been diagnosed; he is at Lyle House because Derek was taken there and their father is missing.|$|R
40|$|Attitudes toward {{bilingualism}} among {{a national}} sample of per-sons'of Mexican <b>descent</b> are <b>cast</b> {{in a set}} of social psychological forces in which structural integration and childhood linguistic environment influence ethnic identity, which in turn influ-ences bilingualism attitudes through its impact on political consciousness. Support is provided by evidence that ethnic identity, specifically a politically-framed conception of self as ChicanalChicano and as part of In mza, fosters positive views of bilingualism both directly and indirectly through political consciousness. Ethnic identity also influences bilingualism at-titudes through a different and contradictory path. Traditional self-conceptions as Mexican and Spanish-speaking directly en-courage support of bilingualism but, at the same time, engage conservative political attitudes that discourage it. Language is an obvious differentiator among ethnic groups (Giles & Powesland, 1975), one which fosters the political, economic and cultural dominance of the majority group, and the solidarity of the minority group (Fishman, 1986). Its political significance is evident in current efforts by the dominant U. S. English-speaking majority, reacting against the new, larger immigration and es-pecially the growing size of the Spanish-speaking minority, to make English the official language of the land. The successful passage of California Proposition 63, declaring EngIish the officiaI language of the state, verifies the vehemence of reactions to lan-Requests for reprints should be sent to Aida Hurtado, Stevenson College...|$|R
5000|$|Found {{more than}} ten years before the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and eight years prior to the famous discovery in the Neander Valley, the significance of the find was not understood at the time, and the skull was simply labelled as [...] "an ancient human, died before the universal flood" [...] and lay forgotten inside a cupboard at the Garrison Library for many years. After the publication of Origin of Species, a renewed interest in the fossil human remains led to the skull being brought out of obscurity and presented at a meeting in the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1864. Darwin was not present, but the skull was later examined by both Darwin and Thomas Huxley, who concluded the skull was that of an extinct human species. Darwin did however only make fleeting reference to Gibraltar 1 in the 1871 <b>Descent</b> of Man.A <b>cast</b> of the skull can be viewed at the Gibraltar Museum - the original is kept by the Natural History Museum in London.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 28: In {{order that}} the reader who is not {{familiar}} with what is passing in New York may not suppose that exaggerated terms are here used, the writer will state a single expedient of the anti-renters in the Legislature to obtain their ends. It is generally known that the Constitution of the United States prevents the separate States from passing laws impairing the obligations of contracts. But for this provision of the Federal Constitution, it is probable, numbers would have succeeded, long ago, in obtaining {{the property of the}} few on their own terms, amid shouts in honor of liberty! This provision, however, has proved a stubborn obstacle, until the world, near {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, has been favored with the following notable scheme to effect the ends of those who [...] "want farms and must have them." [...] The State can regulate, by statute, the laws of descents. It has, accordingly, been solemnly proposed in the Legislature of New York, that the statute of descents should be so far altered, that when a landlord, holding lands subject to certain leasehold tenures, dies, or a <b>descent</b> is <b>cast,</b> that it shall be lawful for the tenants, on application to the chancellor, to convert these leasehold tenures into mortgages, and to obtain the fee-simple of the estates in payment of the debt! In other words, A leases a farm to B forever, reserving a ground-rent, with covenants of re-entry, etc., etc. B wishes a deed, but will not pay A's price. The United States says the contract shall not be impaired, and the Legislature of New York is illustrated by the expedient we have named, to get over the provision of the Constitution! ...|$|R
2500|$|On June 21, 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Lopez was in talks to play [...] "the female lead, a character named Leslie, who gets involved with Parker as he executes a heist". Lopez's casting was confirmed, along with Nick Nolte, who played Parker's mentor. Lopez and Nolte previously worked together on the film U Turn (1997). Hackford noted the role of Leslie as a departure from her other work, considering she has been acting in romantic comedies for the last several years. Leslie is a [...] "savvy insider" [...] who's [...] "short on cash, but big on looks, smarts and ambition." [...] Initially, she only partners with Parker for her own financial gain, but eventually becomes romantically involved with Parker. Owen Tonks of Daily Mail noted that [...] "The couple's relationship grows stronger and Leslie falls for Parker as the storyline develops". Additionally, Tonks noted that Leslie is [...] "likely to be completely different" [...] from Lopez's true personality. Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins Jr., Michael Chiklis, Patti LuPone, and Emma Booth also co-starred in Parker. In the novel Flashfire, Leslie wasn't of Cuban <b>descent.</b> However, Hackford <b>cast</b> Lopez in the role and decided to re-write her as Cuban, hiring Italian-American LuPone to play her [...] "domineering" [...] mother.|$|R
