According to the energy method and the superfolding element theory, the mean dynamic crushing loads of the aluminium foam-filled <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> and the interactive effect between the aluminium foam and <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> were theoretically predicted.

40|$|Empty <b>hat</b> <b>sections,</b> {{single and}} double, {{made of steel}} are {{frequently}} encountered in automotive body structural components such as front rails, B-Pillar, and rockers of unitized-body cars. These closed-section thin-walled components can {{play a significant role}} in terms of impact energy absorption during collisions thereby protecting occupants of vehicles from potential or severe injury. With the need for higher fuel economy and due to stringent emission norms, auto manufacturers are aggressively looking for means to reduce a vehicle's weight either by employing materials lighter than steel (such as aluminum, fiber-reinforced composites, etc.) or by substituting traditional mild steel-based body parts with those made with high strength steel of lower gages, or through a combination of both the strategies mentioned. Reducing gages, however, may lead to structural instability due to early inelastic buckling. This phenomenon of instability provides an opportunity for using polyurethane (PU) foam in structural members. Once a hollow structural member is filled with PU foam, it delays the local buckling mechanism and leads to higher strength of the structure. The current study explores the effect of PU foam-based reinforcement of tubular structures. Here, both empty and PU foam-filled single-hat and double-hat components are tested under quasi-static axial loading in a UTM. The resulting load displacement responses are compared. Higher energy absorption as well as mean load is observed for foam-filled <b>hat</b> <b>sections.</b> Moreover, for a given total folded length, more folds are observed in foam-filled <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> as compared to empty <b>hat</b> <b>sections.</b> Experimentally obtained half fold lengths for double-hat sections are compared with analytical predictions of the same for square tubes. Furthermore, quasi-static axial crush behaviors of single- and double-hat section components are predicted through finite element modeling and analysis using the explicit non-linear LS-DYNA code.

40|$|Long {{glass fibre}} {{compression}} mouldings {{are prone to}} significant variations in mechanical properties. Stiffness and strength tend to vary across an individual moulding and in addition there are also variations when different mouldings arc compared. Compression mouldings {{in the form of}} a top <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> were produced. This component was first modified to have ribs, then samples of both batches were reinforced with a thin thermoplastic composite plate with continuous fibres. In this way, four different batches were produced, which were tested under 3 -point-bending. Further, this work investigated the changes in mechanical properties across the manufactured top <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> mouldings. Tensile test results strongly indicate that the scatter of mechanical properties increases towards the edges of the compression moulding. When the mouldings were tested under 3 -point-bending, the experimental results were prone to a large scatter and it was not possible to predict the position of failure or the failure mode. However, this work successfully demonstrated that a targeted reinforcement of the moulding with continuous fibres can significantly reduce the performance variations, particular under loading with large strain. The findings of this work could lead to the development of new lightweight structural components, where there is a need for integrating functions into the moulding in order to reduce weight and costs for mass production...|$|E

The European design rules for stainless steels EN 1993 - 1 - 4 [1] refers to the standards for carbon steel cold-formed sections EN 1993 - 1 - 3 [2] to determine the web crippling ultimate capacity in which different expressions are presented according to the cross-sectional number of webs. For the fundamental case of <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> (cross-sections with two or more webs), a single expression is codified which is in essence an empirical equation based on curve fitting given different coefficients.

40|$|Copyright © 2011 SAE International In vehicle crash events {{there is}} the {{potential}} for fracture to occur at the processed edges of structural components. The ability to avoid these types of fractures is desired in order to minimize intrusion and optimize energy absorption. However, the prediction of edge cracking is {{complicated by the fact that}} conventional tensile testing can provide insufficient data in regards to the local fracture behavior of advanced high strength steels. Fracture prediction is also made difficult because there can be inadequate data on how the cutting processes used for hole piercing and blanking affect the edge condition. In order to address these challenges, research was undertaken to analyze edge fracture in simple test pieces configured with side notches and center holes. Test specimens were made from a number of advanced high strength steels including 590 R (C-Mn), 780 T (TRIP), 980 Y (dual phase) and hot stamp 1500 (martensitic). Edges were prepared by three different cutting processes: shearing, laser, and water jet ablation. The specimens were pulled to failure and local fracture strains were measured by digital image correlation. Component level tests were also done on simple <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> that featured a notch cut into the flange and side wall by either water jet or punching. These <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> were made from select steel grades and were deformed in a three-point bend crush mode to initiate failure at the notch.

40|$|Hat sections, {{single and}} double, {{made of steel}} are {{frequently}} encountered in automotive body structural components such as front rails, B-Pillar, and rockers of unitized-body cars. These thin-walled components can {{play a significant role}} in terms of crashworthiness and impact energy absorption, through a nonlinear phenomenon called as progressive dynamic buckling. As modern vehicle safety design relies heavily on computer-aided engineering, there is a great need for analysis-based predictions to yield close correlation with test results. Although hat sections subjected to axial loading have been studied widely in the past, there is scanty information in published literature on modeling procedures that can lead to robust prediction of test responses. In the current study, both single-hat and double-hat components made of mild steel are studied extensively experimentally and numerically to quantify statistical variations in test responses such as peak load, mean load and energy absorption, and formulate modeling conditions for capturing elasto-plastic material behavior, strain rate sensitivity, spot-welds, etc. that can lead to robust predictions of force-time and force-displacement histories as well as failure modes. In addition, keeping initial stages of vehicle design in mind, the effectiveness of soft computing techniques based on polynomial regression analysis, radial basis functions and artificial neural networks for quick assessment of the behaviors of steel hat sections has been demonstrated. The study is extended to double-hat sections subjected to eccentric impact loading which has not been previously reported.

40|$|Lightweighting is {{essential}} for the reduction of energy consumption in transportation. The most common approach is through the application of high specific strength and stiffness materials, such as composites and high performance aluminum alloys. One of the challenges {{associated with the use of}} advanced materials is the high cost. This paper explores the opportunities of using hybrid composites (glass and carbon, for example) with selective fiber placement to optimize the weight subject to price constraints for given components. Considering the example of a hat-section for hood reinforcement, different material configurations were modeled and developed. The required thickness of the <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> to meet the same bending stiffness as an all carbon composite beam was calculated. It was shown that selective placement of fiber around the highest moments results in a weight savings of around 14 % compared to a uniformly blended hybrid with the same total material configuration. From this it is possible to estimate the materials cost of the configurations as well as the weight of the component.
