5|$|<b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> born in Marylebone into {{a wealthy}} family who owned an {{extensive}} library. Her mother {{gave birth to}} her when she was close to forty years old. Her father, who had spent much of his life working in India, died shortly after her birth. Her mother soon gambled away much of the family fortune.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1553, Lady <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed queen by Dudley and his {{supporters}}, and on {{the same}} day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London. By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at Framlingham Castle, Suffolk. Dudley's support collapsed, and Mary's grew. <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> deposed on 19 July. She and Dudley were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen.|$|E

50|$|Consistency is the {{covariation}} {{of behavior}} across time. If <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> generous all the time, she shows high consistency. If <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> rarely generous or is generous only at specific times, perhaps around the holidays, she shows low consistency. High consistency {{is attributed to}} the person (<b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> a generous person), while low consistency is attributed to the circumstance (the holidays make people generous).|$|R
50|$|Jane Fairfax, {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age, is Miss Bates' niece. She is a beautiful, accomplished young woman, {{who represents}} everything that Emma should <b>be.</b> <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> the ideal companion for Emma. However Emma neglects her due to jealousy, yet claims it <b>is</b> because <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> 'cold'. Unbeknown to Emma, <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> secretly engaged to Frank, and therefore Emma's flirtation with Frank causes Jane great pain.|$|R
5|$|Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 {{before he}} could draw up his last will. Since his son Richard had predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys {{maintained}} that Guildford's daughter <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> the natural heir. They finally won the resulting court case {{with the assistance of}} Thomas Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|The Day-Lewises {{moved into}} Lemmons {{in the spring}} of 1972 when Tamasin's father, the poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, was dying of cancer. The {{families}} were close. Cecil and Jane had been lovers after her first divorce, and <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> Tamasin's godmother. Tamasin and Martin had also started dating.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15. His will swept {{aside the}} Succession to the Crown Act 1543, {{excluded}} both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France. Lady <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed queen by the Privy Council, but her support quickly crumbled, {{and she was}} deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{collection}} of criticism columns, David Langford commented that <b>Jane's</b> character <b>was</b> [...] "unnecessary to the main action" [...] of the story. In Sarah Kember's Cyberfeminism and Artificial Life, <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> compared to HAL from A Space Odyssey. Unlike HAL, which Kember described as artificial intelligence, <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> artificial life and capable of asking critical questions {{about the nature of}} her existence.|$|R

5|$|Following his discharge, Ingram re-settled in Melbourne {{and gained}} {{employment}} {{as a general}} foreman with E. A. & Frank Watts Pty Ltd, building contractors. In 1926, Ingram's marriage with his wife <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> dissolved upon his instigation {{on the grounds of}} desertion on her behalf. On 10 February the following year, he married Lillian Wakeling (née Hart), a widow, at the Methodist parsonage, Malvern; the pair were later to have one son.|$|E
5|$|Jane Dutton, Coke's wife, {{gave birth}} to their first child in 1777, a {{daughter}} named Jane. Two more daughters followed; Anne Margaret in 1779, and Elizabeth in 1795, before Jane's death in 1800. <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> married to Charles Nevison Howard, Viscount Andover, on 21 June 1796, but on 11 January 1800 Andover died in a shooting accident on the Holkham estate. Jane remarried to Henry Digby in 1806, and they had 11 children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> still legally married. Therefore, Hogg {{risked his}} family's wrath if he pursued a {{relationship}} with her. The couple were initially very discreet, and even denied to close friends that they were romantically involved. The situation was eased {{by the death of}} Hogg's father's in late 1823; the inheritance he received assured his financial security.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> divorced, {{trying to}} cope with the man she is dating, Robert (Fred Willard), her newly single father (Eddie Albert), who moves in with Jane after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her young children, who need dental work. <b>Jane</b> learns she <b>is</b> pregnant, which makes Robert unhappy since both he and <b>Jane</b> <b>are</b> nearly broke.|$|R

5|$|On November 19, 1834, Pierce married Jane Means Appleton (March 12, 1806– December 2, 1863), the {{daughter}} of Jesse Appleton, a Congregational minister {{and former president of}} Bowdoin College, and Elizabeth Means. The Appletons were prominent Whigs, in contrast with the Pierces' Democratic affiliation. <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> shy, devoutly religious, and pro-temperance, encouraging Pierce to abstain from alcohol. She was somewhat gaunt, and constantly ill from tuberculosis and psychological ailments. She abhorred politics and especially disliked Washington, D.C., creating a tension that would continue throughout Pierce's political ascent.|$|E
5|$|The Michelena Features studio {{facility}} in San Rafael sat empty through the 1920s with its solitary metal-clad brick vault housing all the company's nitrate films, including the earlier ones shot by CMPC. In 1931, boys {{playing with a}} firecracker at the deserted lot set the vault {{and all of its}} flammable contents spectacularly on fire. Every known copy of Michelena's movies was destroyed, a loss that Middleton estimated at $200,000; worth about $ million today. In 1996, an 82-year-old nitrate copy of Salomy <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> found in Australia; it was sent to the Library of Congress for preservation. Awareness of Michelena's contribution to early film, and her role as a groundbreaking Hispanic star, rose in 2002 with a proclamation made by President George W. Bush upon the occasion of National Hispanic Heritage Month in which he listed her as one of America's influential Latino actors. In 2008, a new print of Salomy <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> released for limited distribution.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching their allegiance. Becoming aware of his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E

After one of many ill-treatments she is accused of being bad blood and in an attempt to get rid of her, <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> sent to Lowood School by Mrs Reed. Like Gateshead Hall, Lowood School is a cold institution. Jane’s only friend at school, Helen Burns, dies and <b>Jane</b> <b>is</b> left alone once again. Resolving to become independent, she takes on the profession of a governess.|$|R
5000|$|A middleweight bout between promotional {{newcomers}} Adam Hunter and Ryan <b>Janes</b> <b>was</b> canceled {{after the}} weigh-ins, {{due to a}} potential USADA (U.S. Anti-Doping Agency) violation stemming from a Hunter's pre-fight out-of-competition drug test.

5|$|Jane Williams (née Jane Cleveland; 21 January 1798 8 November 1884) was a British woman {{best known}} for her {{association}} with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> raised in England and India, before marrying a naval officer and settling in London. She soon left him for another military officer, Edward Ellerker Williams. After Edward and she left England for Italy, they became acquainted with Percy and Mary Shelley. Though she never had a romantic relationship with Shelley, {{near the end of his}} life he became deeply infatuated with her and addressed several of his poems to her. After Shelley and Edward Williams perished in a boating accident, she lived with Thomas Jefferson Hogg, also a close friend of Shelley, and had two children with him. The rest of her life was spent as a housewife in London.|$|E
5|$|Jane and Edward {{decided to}} leave London in 1819 after {{listening}} to Edward's friend Thomas Medwin discuss his travels of Europe. They travelled to Geneva in September 1819 and stayed {{in a house that}} Medwin had found for them. By the time they arrived, <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> four months pregnant. In February 1820, she gave birth to their first child, Edward Medwin Williams. That summer, Jane became pregnant again. Medwin left Geneva in September 1820 to visit his cousin, Percy Shelley, in Pisa. Jane and Edward then travelled to France for several months, before joining Medwin and the Shelleys in Pisa in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|In July 1822, Edward Williams and Percy Shelley drowned {{when their}} boat sank during a storm while {{returning}} to Lerici from Pisa. Shortly before their deaths, Jane dreamed of floods {{and on one}} occasion thought {{that she had seen}} Shelley's ghost through a window. After hearing of their deaths, Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt over what to do with what they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes with her back to England.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe married Emily Ann Booth, the {{daughter}} of John Booth, a well-known shipbuilder and Balmain's first mayor (and formerly the member for East Macquarie in the colonial parliament). They lived for many years at Rockleigh in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been demolished. In 1884 their first daughter Rhoda <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> born, followed by a stillborn daughter in 1886, and then Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe bought land in Ashfield and designed a grand house called Amesbury. Described {{at the time as}} having “more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in the colony” including terracotta lyrebird reliefs by artist Lucien Henry on the front wall, and a tower purpose-built for Selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy. Built around 1888 to honour the centenary of the colony, Amesbury still stands at 78 Alt Street and was used by Brahma Kumaris from 1986 as its Australian headquarters until 2014 when it was auctioned for over $3.5 million. As children, Rhoda and Norma attended their Aunt Maybanke's school in Dulwich Hill. As adults, they trained in Italy with educator Maria Montessori and returned to Sydney to open a Montessori school of their own in the building known as Warwick on Bland Street, Ashfield.|$|E
5|$|One of Mary's first {{actions as}} queen was {{to order the}} release of the Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from {{imprisonment}} in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay. Mary understood that the young Lady <b>Jane</b> <b>was</b> essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|ZANLA {{had planned}} for four attacks {{to take place}} {{simultaneously}} but in the event only Nhongo's men did so. According to historian Elaine Windrich, Nhongo was a former employee of the tobacco farm's 37-year-old owner, Marc de Borchgrave, and held a grudge against him. The cadres shot up the farm house with AK-47 assault rifles and threw grenades through the windows, then retreated and hid amongst the local population. Nobody {{was killed in the}} attack but the farmer's eight-year-old daughter, <b>Jane,</b> <b>was</b> wounded in the foot. The isolated house had no telephone or any other means of contacting neighbours, and de Borchgrave was wary of being ambushed should he drive his car out, so after a short time comforting the children he set out across country on foot to seek help and alert the authorities. This done, he returned and took his wife and children to another farm nearby, Whistlefield, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family.|$|E
