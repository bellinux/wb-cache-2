Many compare his playing style, particularly his demeanor and work ethic, to that of former Phillies' teammate Chase Utley. As a hitter, he is better as a contact hitter than a power hitter; defensively, he has improved, which has drawn accolades from former Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg.|$|E
5|$|When Manchester City {{returned}} to the Premier League for the 2000–01 season, it appeared that Dickov's chances of playing would be limited as City signed former FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah and Costa Rican international Paulo Wanchope. However, Dickov earned {{a place in the}} team, his performances attracting the attention of Scotland manager Craig Brown, who called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scotland squad for the first time.|$|E

He led them to an Iraq Youth Centers' Championship, scoring a hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Al-Zawra'a youth team and catching the eye of Dawoud Al-Azzawi, {{the manager of the}} Iraq national under-17 football team and Iraq national varsity football team. Al-Azzawi called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> varsity team and, in his first competitive tournament with the team, he won the gold medal in the 1975 Arab Schools Games in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets {{caught in a}} rope that lifts <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fly space above the stage. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
5|$|After {{departing from}} the bus, Peter goes off as Spider-Man to an armored truck, which Sandman is robbing. In their struggle, the truck {{goes out of}} control and lands in a {{construction}} site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman can slip through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with girders. Meanwhile, at the soda shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of girders and gets the head on Sandman. He lures <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker.|$|E
5|$|Following the Draft, the 1994–95 NHL {{season was}} {{suspended}} for three-and-a-half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior {{for the beginning of}} the 1994–95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.|$|E

5|$|He {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Djurgården in May 2008. The club's initial plan for Josefson {{was to move}} <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> senior team when regular players {{were out of the}} lineup with illness or injuries, while his usual team would be the J20-team. He scored his first goal in Elitserien on 23 September in his third game, a 4–1 win against Brynäs IF. Ultimately, Josefson played almost every game of the regular season, and usually played along with Carl Gustafsson and Henrik Eriksson on the 4th line. At the end of the season, Josefson had scored 5 goals and 16 points, a record for players 18 or younger playing with the senior team. Josefson was ranked third in the midterm rankings among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected {{in the first round of}} the 2009 NHL draft by the New Jersey Devils, 20th overall. Josefson was also drafted in the third round, 61st overall, in the 2009 KHL Junior Draft by SKA Saint Petersburg. He participated at the Devils rookie camp in July 2009. He has been compared with centres Nicklas Bäckström and John Madden.|$|E
5|$|It took Đurić three {{personal}} attempts {{before he}} received his Singaporean citizenship on 27 September 2007 as he {{was not on the}} Football Association of Singapore's Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. Despite obtaining his Singapore passport for non-footballing reasons, coach Radojko Avramović called <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Singapore national team on 1 November 2007. He made his international debut at the age of 37 years and 89 days against Tajikistan in the first leg of {{the second round of the}} 2010 World Cup qualifiers on 9 November, contributing with an immediate impact by scoring both goals in a 2–0 victory. Đurić started the match following injuries to attacking midfielder Shi Jiayi and striker Indra Shahdan Daud. The result coupled with a 1–1 draw in the second leg meant that Singapore progressed to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. He continued his fine form on the international stage, scoring against Lebanon and Uzbekistan as Singapore finished third in Group 4.|$|E

25|$|Dalkowski {{was invited}} to major league spring {{training}} in 1963, and the Orioles expected to call <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majors. On March 23, Dalkowski {{was used as a}} relief pitcher during a game against the New York Yankees. Most sources say that while throwing a slider to Phil Linz, he felt something pop in his left elbow, {{which turned out to be}} a severe muscle strain. Some uncertainty over the cause of his injury exists, however, with other sources contending that he damaged his elbow while throwing to first after fielding a bunt from Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton. Either way, his arm never fully recovered.|$|E

He survives {{but he is}} severely crippled, and he vengefully enlists his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) to take revenge on Mark. Ashley steals Mark's motorbike and attempts to run him over but Nick had drained the brake fluid from the bike the night before. Ashley crashes into the launderette and is killed. Nick leaves the Square shortly afterwards and never sees Mark again.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with Middlesex for 2013, and things started brightly after he {{was included in the}} team for two Championship and three Yorkshire Bank 40 matches before the end of May. However, with Rayner making himself difficult to dislodge thanks to his batting and fielding ability and improving bowling performances, and Ravi Patel emerging, Smith was loaned to Gloucestershire in a deal that was ultimately extended {{until the end of the}} season. Highlights of his time there have included a YB40 hat-trick, and a maiden first-class 50. On 24 September 2013, as the 2013 season was finishing, Smith signed a three-year deal to take <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the 2016 season.|$|E

25|$|The archetypical {{selection}} process {{for entry into}} a collegiate secret society began at Yale University by a process called tapping. On a publicly announced evening, Yale undergraduates would assemble informally in the College Yard. Current members of Yale's secret societies would walk {{through the crowd and}} literally tap a prospective member on the shoulder and then walk with <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tapped man's dorm room. There, in private, they would ask him to become a member of their secret society; the inductee had the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer of membership. During this process, it was publicly known who was being tapped for the coming year. Today, the {{selection process}} is not quite as formal, but is still public. Formal tapping days used to exist at Berkeley, and still exist in a much more formal setting at Missouri.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{on the morning of}} the day before Yom Kippur, they placed the High Priest at the Eastern Gate and brought before him oxen, rams, and sheep, so that he could become {{familiar}} with the service. The rest of the seven days, they did not withhold food or drink from him, but near nightfall on the eve of Yom Kippur, they would not let him eat much, as food might make him sleep. The sages of the court took <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house of Avtinas and handed him over to the elders of the priesthood. As the sages of the court took their leave, they cautioned him that he was the messenger of the court, and adjured him in God's Name that he not change anything in the service from what they had told him. He and they turned aside and wept that they should have to suspect him of doing so.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they handed the {{scapegoat}} {{over to him}} who was to lead it away.

The escorts would not go with <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> precipice, but watched from a distance. The one leading the scapegoat divided the thread of crimson wool, and tied one half to the rock, the other half between the scapegoat horns, and pushed the scapegoat from behind. And it went rolling down and before it had reached half its way down the hill, it was dashed to pieces. He came back and sat down under the last booth until it grew dark. His garments unclean become unclean from the moment that he has gone outside the wall of Jerusalem, although Rabbi Simeon taught that they became unclean from the moment that he pushed it over the precipice.|$|E
