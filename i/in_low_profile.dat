In conjunction with Būshehr, this province was later developed into the province of “Būshehr and Banāder” (‘Bushehr and the ports’). Angāli was formerly a part of the Dashtestān province and later it was separated for administrative purposes.Although historically Angāli has always been one of the important and strategic centers of political activity (partly due to the conflict between the local khāns ‘chieftains’ and the central government, over matters such as independence and fire arms control, etc.), Angāli was never registered on maps of Iran. Even in the most current maps only occasionally it is included. One of the main reasons is rooted in the strategy of the Pahlavi regime (under Reza Shah, as well as his son and successor Mohammad-Reza, a.k.a. the Shah) who kept the regional powers (that is, the khāns, kalāntars, and their tribes and tribesmen) <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile,</b> in order to prevent any possible encouragement for others, who might follow their foot steps in dealing with the central government.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of claw removal and cage design in laying hens during the course of a normal egg production period. Claw removal and cage design had significant effects on various production parameters as well as gonadal and adrenal steroids in caged laying hens. Declawed hens showed a significantly greater intensity of early egg production. They tended to consume less feed, weighed significantly less, and had significantly better livabiltiy than the intact controls. Furthermore, declawed hens demonstrated lower plasma corticosterone and higher plasma estradiol levels during the latter phases of the laying period. However, during the latter stages of the egg production cycle, foot condition was significantly poorer in declawed hens. No significant treatment effects were noted for overall egg production, egg weight, specific gravity, antibody response, or feather condition. Hens <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> cages consumed significantly less feed than those in the high profile cages during the earlier stages of production, but this difference disappeared after 30 weeks of age. No significant cage effect was noted for overall egg production, egg weight, specific gravity, antibody response, or feather condition.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{heat flux}} densities from portable electronics are leading to new methodologies being implemented to provide thermal management within such devices. Many technologies are under development to transport heat within electronic equipment {{to allow it}} to be dissipated into the surroundings via conduction, natural convection and radiation.

This work addresses the potential of low profile integrated fan and heat sink solutions to electronics thermal management issues of the future, particularly focusing upon possible solutions <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> portable electronics. We investigate two heat sink designs with mini-channel features, applicable to low profile applications. The thermal performance of the integrated fan and heat sinks is seen to differ by approximately 40 % and highlights the importance of designing an integrated thermal management solution at this scale rather than fan or heat sink in isolation. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Final Report for S-K Project 93 -SEO- 049 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} during May-June 1995 comparing catch composition of a standard high profile skimmer trawl net (12 fi) and a <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> skimmer trawl net (3 fi) in the North and Newport Rivers, North Carolina. Each gear type was alternately rigged on the port and starboard sides of a commercial shrimping vessel and the catch was sampled according to criteria established by the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program The objective {{of the study was}} to determine if modifying skimmer trawl nets’ by decreasing the vertical height of the net would lower bycatch rates, yet maintain shrimp catch. Total shrimp catch <b>in</b> the <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> net was significantly lower than that in the control net (- 32. 9 %, p = 0. 0001), and significantly lower for brown shrimp (Penaeus aziecus) by - 39. 1 % (p = 0. 0001), but pink shrimp(P. duorarum) catches were not significantly different (- 17. 1 %, p 0. 1934). In the sample, weight of finfish biomass to total catch biomass excluding debris was similar (47. 5 % finfish <b>in</b> the <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> net and 44. 8 % finfish in the high <b>profile</b> net). The <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> net was not effective in reduction of bycatch under most conditions. Because of increased catch rates of brown shrimp by the high profile net, results suggest that shrimpers may find it advantageous to utilize a high profile skimmer net during the brown and pink shrimp seasons, rather than a <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> net. Also, the <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> net may be advantageous to fishermen under conditions of: (1) high wind, (2) shrimping in areas where tight turns are mandated, (3) presence of large amounts of floating debris, and (4) shallow water.

40|$|Reliable and {{efficient}} cooling solutions for {{portable electronic devices}} are now {{at the forefront of}} research due to consumer demand for manufacturers to downscale existing technologies. To achieve this, the power consumed has to be dissipated over smaller areas resulting in elevated heat fluxes. With regard to cooling such devices, the most popular choice is to integrate a fan driven heat sink, which for portable electronic devices must have a low profile. This paper presents an experimental investigation into such low profile cooling solutions, which incorporate one of the smallest commercially available fans in series with two different heat sink designs. The first of these is the conventionally used finned heat sink design, which was specifically optimized and custom manufactured in the current study to complement the driving fan. While the second design proposed is a novel "finless" type heat sink suitable for use <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> applications. Together the driving fan and heat sinks combined were constrained to have a total footprint area of 465 mm 2 and a profile height of only 5 mm, making them ideal for use in portable electronics. The objective was to evaluate the performance of the proposed finless heat sink design against a conventional finned heat sink, and this was achieved by means of thermal resistance and overall heat transfer coefficient measurements. It was found that the proposed finless design proved to be the superior cooling solution when operating at low fan speeds, while at the maximum fan speed tested of 8000 rpm both provided similar performance. Particle image velocimetry measurements were used to detail the flow structures within each heat sink and highlighted methods, which could further optimize their performance. Also, these measurements along with corresponding global volume flow rate measurements were used to elucidate the enhanced heat transfer characteristics observed for the finless design. Overall, it is shown that the proposed finless type heat sink can provide superior performance compared with conventional finned designs when used <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> applications. In addition a number of secondary benefits associated with such a design are highlighted including lower cost, lower mass, lower acoustics, and reduced fouling issues. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues that}} relate to downscaling the height of centrifugal fans for application <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> technologies, such as the cooling of portable power electronics. The parameters studied include flow rate, pressure rise, and power consumption characteristics. The former two of these are measured using a fan characterization rig and the latter by directly measuring the power supplied to the fan. These are studied for fan diameters ranging from 15 to 30 mm with numerous profile heights between 0. 3 mm and 15 mm. It is found {{that all of the}} phenomena encountered are best described in terms of fan aspect ratio. The results show that the conventional scaling laws cannot be accurately applied when blade profile alone is scaled. Indeed, the only parameter reasonably well predicted was the pressure rise attainable, but that was only accurate for fan aspect ratios greater than 0. 17. Below this, the pressure rise generated reduces logarithmically toward zero. The study also reveals that no advantage is gained by using fans of aspect ratio greater than 0. 3, as the maximum flow rate attainable decreases slightly above this. Overall, the scaling phenomena reported herein provide invaluable information for the future design of efficient low-profile cooling solutions that are to incorporate such fans...|$|E
