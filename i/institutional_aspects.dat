40|$|Evolutionary {{game theory}} {{is often used}} to analyze the {{evolution}} of moral preferences. A few studies also examine the coevolution of preferences and an <b>institutional</b> <b>aspect</b> of the decision environment. Allowing the adaptation of just one <b>institutional</b> <b>aspect</b> such as litigation or legal insurance to coevolve with morality, however, may be inadequate. If court rulings coevolve with morality the need for legal insurance may vary over time. Applying the indirect evolutionary approach, we therefore analyze the coevolution of morality in the sense of trustworthiness, court rulings (based on rational belief formation), and the population share which is legally insured. If type detection is not possible, the evolutionary interaction of the legal institutions may play a decisive role for the emergence of morality. ...|$|R

In the management, common pool resources are faced with triggered conflicts between stakeholders because the resource characteristics are freely used by everyone, but its useful will be decreased. The implication of this problem is emerging a phenomenon called commons dilemma. This phenomenon is happened when the management of common pool resources and its consequences is faced with the weakness of <b>institutional</b> <b>aspect.</b> This phenomenon also happened on the research object that is Kapilaler Irrigation Area. The problem is water conflict between farmers througt out that canals. The problem has the history and complexity management transformation that involve many stakeholders that are government, farmer as well as drink water business corporate. The lack of cooperation among stakeholders has an impact on the continuity problems. Based on this problem, the research is used a qualitative approach with case study strategy research. Analysis technique is used descriptive qualitative analysis. The research finds that commons dilemma in the management of Kapilaler Irrigation Area is a condition that water resources management was faced by the weakness of cooperation between stakeholders so it gives negative impact to the resources and finally ensued rivalry between the user. This research also shows that the sufficiency of resource condition is not assured all successfully of resource management while the <b>institutional</b> <b>aspect</b> is still weak...|$|R
