25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions.

40|$|We {{develop a}} novel {{methodology}} to infer {{the amount of}} capital allocated to quantitative <b>equity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> strategies. Using this methodology, which exploits time-variation in the cross section of short interest, we document {{that the amount of}} capital devoted to value and momentum strategies has grown significantly since the late 1980 s. We provide evidence that this increase in capital has resulted in lower strategy returns. However, consistent with theories of limited arbitrage, we show that strategy-level capital flows are influenced by past strategy returns, strategy return volatility, and that arbitrage capital is most limited during times when strategies perform best.

40|$|We {{develop a}} novel {{methodology}} to infer {{the amount of}} capital allocated to quantitative <b>equity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> strategies from stock-level short interest data. Using this technique, which exploits time-series variation in the cross-section of short interest, we document {{that the amount of}} capital devoted to quantitative equity strategies such as value and momentum has increased significantly since the early 1990 s. We find evidence suggesting that arbitrageurs have reacted to heightened competition by altering their strategies. Specifically, arbitrageurs increasingly favor stocks where the risk of over-crowding is lower such as small stocks and stocks with weaker mispricing signals. We then use these strategy-level capital measures to test theories about the limits of arbitrage. We find that strategy-level capital flows are influenced by past strategy returns, strategy return volatility, and past returns to other strategies in the directions predicted by these theories. Finally, we find that arbitrageurs have invested more capital in strategies prior to periods when those strategies perform poorly.

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{seeks to}} investigate the frequency and profitability of index arbitrage opportunities involving the SET 50 futures, SET 50 component stocks, and the ThaiDEX SET 50 ETF (ticker symbol: TDEX). In particular, the frequency and profit of arbitrage are measured in the following three arbitrage tests: (1) SET 50 futures vs. ThaiDEX SET 50 ETF, (2) SET 50 futures vs. SET 50 component stocks, and (3) ThaiDEX SET 50 ETF vs. SET 50 component stocks are investigated. For tests (2) and (3), the problems involve conic optimization and quadratic programming as subproblems. This research is first to apply conic optimization and quadratic programming techniques {{in the context of}} index arbitrage and is first to investigate such index arbitrage in the Thai equity and derivatives markets. Thus, the contribution of this study is twofold. First, its results would help understand the contribution of the derivatives securities to the efficiency of the Thai markets. Second, the methodology employed in this study can be applied to other geographical markets, with minor adjustments. Keywords—Conic optimization, <b>Equity</b> index <b>arbitrage,</b> Executio...|$|R

We categorize hedge fund strategies into directional and non-directional groups. We run multifactor regressions in order to find out whether hedge fund indices of different strategies are exposed to the direction of the market and which macroeconomic variables drive performance of non-directional hedge fund strategies such as fixed income arbitrage, convertible bond <b>arbitrage,</b> <b>equity</b> market neutral, and merger arbitrage. We conclude that non-directional indices are not significantly exposed to equity market except for merger arbitrage, meaning they are relatively well hedged against equity market as generally understood. Furthermore, we suggest important macroeconomic factors for non-directional strategies and rationales behind these factors...|$|R

We find that both total institutional ownership and ownership concentration (measured by the Herfindahl index, single largest holding and number of investors) are important determinants of equity lending supply and short sale constraints. More concentrated ownership structures increase short sale constraints (including loan fees, recall risk and arbitrage risk) and force arbitrageurs to decrease demand for equity borrowing and demand greater compensation for borrowing stock.

30|$|Even {{with all}} of the {{above-mentioned}} initiatives, the SGX has not been successful in attracting orders from HFT traders yet though. Two factors seem to explain this outcome. First, high trading costs keep HFT firms away from SGX. Fees for trading on the Singapore Exchange amount to about 20  bps of the value of shares traded, compared with Sydney-based ASX’s 15  bps (Burgos 2013). Also, Singapore does not have a fragmented financial market like the U.S. does: Singapore is too small a country, and has just one stock exchange. Thus, there is no arbitrage opportunity existing among different trading venues for <b>equities.</b> The only <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities that exist are mainly in the derivatives market, where about 30  % of the total volume of trades is attributable to high-frequency traders. With derivatives contracts, traders can exploit inefficiencies involving parallel products that trade elsewhere in the world.|$|R
40|$|A new {{modelling}} {{approach that}} directly prescribes dynamics {{to the term}} structure of VIX futures is proposed in this paper. The approach is motivated by the tractability enjoyed by models that directly prescribe dynamics to the VIX, practices observed in interest-rate modelling, {{and the desire to}} develop a platform to better understand VIX option implied volatilities. The main contribution of the paper is the derivation of necessary conditions for there to be no arbitrage between the joint market of VIX and <b>equity</b> derivatives. The <b>arbitrage</b> conditions are analogous to the well-known HJM drift restrictions in interest-rate modelling. The restrictions also address a fundamental open problem related to an existing modelling approach, in which the dynamics of the VIX are specified directly. The paper is concluded with an application of the main result, which demonstrates that when modelling VIX futures directly, the drift and diffusion of the corresponding stochastic volatility model must be restricted to preclude arbitrage...|$|R

40|$|The paper opens {{by showing}} how {{certain types of}} hedge funds can reduce the risk and {{increase}} the return on a traditional balanced managed fund. One of the key characteristics of such a hedge fund {{is that it has}} a low correlation with the balanced managed fund. The paper puts forward a new way of explaining correlation {{so that it can be}} more readily understood and suggests methods of analysis for dealing with the fact that correlation is unstable. Volatility correlation is also examined because of its importance in reducing the risk of a portfolio. An outline of the characteristics and risks of three types of hedge funds namely, long-short <b>equity,</b> convertible <b>arbitrage</b> and merger arbitrage, together with some questions investors might put to prospective hedge fund managers is given in Section 4 of the paper. Some of the very basic statistical analysis techniques used in assessing the past performance of hedge funds are given in Section 5 of the paper. Considerable emphasis is put on the need to examine daily return data as an insight into the quality of the manager’s IT systems, his risk management, evidence of smoothing of returns and to gain access to a higher number of data points for assessing the repeatability of performance. An entire section of the paper is devoted to gaining a clear understanding of a prospective hedge fund manager’s volatility management strategy because of its importance in the context of the fee structure of hedge funds and its importance for assessing the ability of a hedge fund to reduce the risk and increase the returns of a balanced managed fund. Funds of hedge funds are examined in the final section of the paper and the section concludes that large sophisticated institutional investors may wish to create a portfolio of hedge funds rather than invest in a fund of hedge funds...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} undertaken, firstly aims {{to identify}} {{the extent to which}} equities, their indexes and their derivatives priced in accordance with their fair value. Secondly, presuming that the traded values of the instruments do not in all instances equate to the fair value, the research aims to develop an effective means to identify and manage profitable opportunities arising from the mispricing. General concepts relating to profitability, trade identification, risk and continuous improvement of the processes are addressed. This includes recommendations on the management of the risks through a structured reporting process. The research looks at arbitrage trading in the South African market from the perspective of an empirical review into the market's participation in equity and <b>equity</b> derivative <b>arbitrage.</b> In addition to this empirical analysis, a time series analysis into various arbitrage strategies is conducted with the view to determining their relative profitability. The first component of the empirical research focuses on the arbitrage trading strategies adopted by a sample of 80 institutions. Where the institutions trade arbitrage strategies, the research undertook to establish what methods are used to identify, trade and manage the index arbitrage, single stock futures arbitrage, risk arbitrage, statistical arbitrage and volatility arbitrage trading opportunities that present themselves within the South African Market. Information gathered did not only focus on the actual trading strategies but also determined the relative cost structures, profitability and risk management processes that are employed to support these trading initiatives. The time series analysis focused on index futures, single stock futures, risk, dual listed and statistical arbitrage methods, and reflects the results before and after transaction costs. These arbitrage strategies were applied to the ALSI Top 40 index or its associated shares and generally spanned a period of about four years. Finally the research presents an arbitrage business model that is aimed at providing a blue print for arbitrage trading which covers: new arbitrage strategy, implementation, market risk, execution, profit, traders, cost Finally, the research provides a multiple regression method for application in identifying further arbitrage trading opportunities within the South African environment.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the seven valuation methods for unlisted direct investment equity {{included in the}} recently adopted IMF Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM 6). Based on publicly available Danish data, we test the three methods that are generally applicable and find that the choice of valuation method and estimation technique can have a highly {{significant impact on the}} international investment position, pointing to the need for further harmonization. The results show that the price-to-book value method generates more robust market value estimates than the price-to-earnings method. This finding suggests that the valuation basis for the forthcoming Coordinated Direct Investment Survey - own funds at book value -will provide useful information for compiling the international investment position.
