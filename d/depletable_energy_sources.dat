Policy implications obtained from this analysis are: (1) {{that the use of}} expendable energy cannot attain endogenous growth since the decrease of marginal productivity of energy will appear as a constraint, and (2) that social policy is indispensable to attain steady state...|$|R
40|$|Development {{and energy}} demand are synonymous. The rapid {{industrialisation}} of Latin America {{and the high}} ranking accorded to electrification projects by the region’s development planners in the post-war period have combined to ensure a growing demand for energy in the region. This has led, at times, to various supply constraints resulting in excess demand. The response to {{the problem has been}} varied. Some countries, such as Mexico and Colombia, have addressed the problem by developing domestic extraction capacity. Others, such as Brazil, have experimented with alternative <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> most notably, ethanol. In Central America, the absence of known <b>depletable</b> <b>energy</b> resources allied to a shortage of foreign exchange has ensured an almost exclusive dependency upon hydro-electric power sources for electricity generation. In the case of Honduras, the reliance on hydro-electricity proved costly. Environmental degradation allied to a lack of maintenance of the country’s principal plant resulted in serious energy shortages in 1994 / 5 with electricity being rationed for up to 12 hours each day. As a direct consequence, GDP growth declined, the import bill rose due to the switch to alternative fossil fuel sources and air pollution rose due to increased generator usage. This paper traces the evolution of energy supply and demand in Honduras, showing why the crisis of the 1990 s emerged. It then forecasts future energy demand and examines the way this demand might be met. A concluding section spells out the difficult decisions small developing countries have to face in their desire to achieve economic growth without sacrificing environmental capital. ...|$|R

40|$|Generating a good {{execution}} {{plan for a}} declarative query {{has long been a}} central problem in data management research. With the rise in interest in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as query processing platforms, it was quickly noticed that the corresponding optimization problem is even more challenging than the classical one, since, in comparison to classical platforms, a WSN is a very constrained computational infrastructure (in terms of memory, processing, and communication capabilities, and, crucially, <b>depletable</b> <b>energy</b> stocks). Optimizing a declarative query for execution in WSNs is thereby made both more important and more challenging. One of the requirements for effective query optimization is the availability of effective models for estimating the cost of alternative {{execution plan}}s. This paper describes how query cost models for space, time and energy were methodically derived and validated for an expressive algebra for continuous queries over sensor streams...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for energy throughout the world, the environment around us is getting severely affected. The conventional <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (coal, oil and gas) are unfortunately the biggest polluters of the environment. The aforementioned <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which are responsible for global warming and ozone layer depletion. The only feasible answer to this problem {{is to reduce the}} use of the conventional <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and focus more on other <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> The renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> (solar, wind and hydro) have been present in nature, but the technology to harvest these energies have always been relatively expensive until recently. The biggest advantage of using renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> is the fact that these <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> will never run out and they also do not pollute the environment as their more conventional counterparts. With more research being conducted into better ways of storing the power trapped from the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and the relative difficulty of obtaining the ever-depleting conventional <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> the future for renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> definitely looks better {{than at any time in}} the pastM.

30|$|The {{results in}} Theorem 1 state {{that there is}} an {{asymptotic}} equivalence between stochastic <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> and deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> as time goes to infinity, if and only if the average harvested energy in one sample period is no less than the energy required for one sensing operation. This means that the performance of the best-effort sensing policy with stochastic <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> has the potential to match that of the uniform sensing policy with deterministic <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> as time becomes large enough and P ≥E_s/T_s. The results hold for a quite general category of energy harvesting processes.

40|$|In urban areas, the {{transportation}} sector {{is one of}} the principal <b>sources</b> of substantial <b>energy</b> consumption and carbon emission. Although diesel and gasoline are still the main <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> used in urban transportation, alternative and transitional <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> have been introduced.
