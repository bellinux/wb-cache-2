5|$|An {{intermediate}} interchange with US50 provides {{access to}} southern Jackson County, and to Raytown to the north via Route 350, a former alignment of US50 before the construction of I-470. Plans for a southern <b>freeway</b> were first published in 1955, and the first portions of I-470 were completed in 1970. By 1983 the entire <b>freeway</b> was open to traffic. Since construction two new interchanges have been constructed, along with {{the expansion of the}} US50 cloverleaf. In 2010, part of the <b>freeway</b> was closed by the Grandview Triangle due to a landslide underneath the <b>freeway.</b> Between about 38,000 and 75,000vehicles use the <b>freeway</b> on an average day.|$|E
5|$|At Durango Street, in {{the segment}} of <b>freeway</b> {{known as the}} Durango Curve, the highway turns eastward, {{becoming}} the western leg of the Maricopa <b>Freeway,</b> and provides a southerly bypass of downtown before meeting I-10 again near Sky Harbor and terminating (the Maricopa <b>Freeway,</b> though, continues eastward with the I-10 designation). Interstate 17 was the Valley's first <b>freeway,</b> with maps showing a road built to Interstate Highway standards (of the era) by 1961, in some segments.|$|E
5|$|At {{the northeastern}} terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend {{southeast}} along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south {{to cross the}} river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast <b>Freeway</b> (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned {{to be part of}} it. The first was the Windlass <b>Freeway</b> (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other <b>freeway</b> that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco <b>Freeway,</b> a short connector from the Windlass <b>Freeway</b> southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the Windlass <b>Freeway</b> between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco <b>Freeway</b> south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973.|$|E
50|$|In some US jurisdictions, {{especially}} where <b>freeways</b> replace existing roads, non-motorized access on <b>freeways</b> is the rule. Different {{states of the}} United States have different laws. Cycling on <b>freeways</b> in Arizona may be prohibited only where {{there is an alternative}} route judged equal or better for cycling. Wyoming, the least populated state, allows cycling on all <b>freeways.</b> Oregon allows bicycles except on specific urban <b>freeways</b> in Portland and Medford.|$|R

50|$|Johannesburg {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} upon <b>freeways</b> for transport {{around the city}} due to its location 1,500 metres above sea level, far from the coast or any major bodies of water. There are 10 <b>freeways</b> in the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area: the N1, N3, N12, N14, N17, R21, R24, R59, M1 and M2. In addition, three new <b>freeways</b> are planned: the G5, G9 and G14. <b>Freeways</b> are sometimes called highways or motorways colloquially.|$|R
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, various <b>freeway</b> {{projects}} in the Detroit area were cancelled or scaled back in scope. The route of I-96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled in response to <b>freeway</b> revolts in the city, and a new routing along the C Railroad right-of-way in Livonia was used instead. Plans to transfer the Davison <b>Freeway</b> in the 1970s to state control and extend it west to I-96 (Jeffries <b>Freeway)</b> and east to a Van Dyke <b>Freeway</b> (extended M-53) were dropped. Another <b>freeway</b> project near Lansing, the Van Atta Connector, was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern <b>freeway</b> beltway around East Lansing, but by 1981 the highway's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project's cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth <b>freeway</b> {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway (Harbor <b>Freeway)</b> and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena <b>Freeway)</b> and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial <b>Freeway</b> replaced the Terminal Island <b>Freeway</b> and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica <b>Freeway)</b> and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale <b>Freeway</b> and Golden State <b>Freeway</b> (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial <b>Freeway</b> south of the Santa Monica <b>Freeway</b> became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Freeway</b> {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1960s. By the end of 1963, the southern section of <b>freeway</b> was extended to Schoolcraft. The following year, a business loop in Kalamazoo was created. The new loop used a <b>freeway</b> stub on the north and M-43 on the south to connect the main highway to the former routing of US131 along Westnedge and Park avenues downtown. A discontinuous segment of <b>freeway,</b> south of Cadillac into Osceola County, opened in September 1966. The <b>freeway</b> was extended north from the Grand Rapids area through the Comstock Park area in 1966. That year, the former Grand Rapids Speedrome, a local race car track was closed. Located on North Park Street between the North Park Bridge and West River Drive, the track was in operation from 1950 until it was closed for the <b>freeway</b> construction in 1966. The <b>freeway</b> was extended further to M-57 (14Mile Road) near Cedar Springs in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Johannesburg has {{the most}} <b>freeways</b> {{connected}} to it. It has the N1, N3, N12, N14, N17, R21, R24 and the R59, all leading to Johannesburg. The M1 and M2 <b>freeways</b> were built to direct traffic towards the city centre. These two <b>freeways</b> are congested due to mass urbanisation.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{correspondence}} of coloring for elevated urban <b>freeways</b> {{is discussed}} in this research. An image processing system was used to create color simulation models of elevated <b>freeways</b> in urban settings, and landscape rations based on these models were made in order to explore future color schemes for elevated <b>freeways.</b> Results showed that landscape comprised primarily of greyish man-made materials look better when elevated <b>freeways</b> also have a monochromatic grey or cool color scheme and are contrasted with their surroundings by means of differing value (brightness). Landscape in which neutral colors predominate look better when elevated <b>freeways</b> have the same hue as their surroundings and are contrasted by means of differing chroma...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} countries, some of Australia's <b>freeways</b> are being opened to cyclists.

5|$|Highways in {{the state}} {{maintained}} by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane freeways. In addition to the Interstates, other trunklines are built to <b>freeway</b> standards. Sections of US10, US23, US31, US127 and US131 have been upgraded to <b>freeway</b> standards. All or part of several state trunklines are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, M-5, M-8 (Davison <b>Freeway),</b> M-10 (Lodge <b>Freeway),</b> M-14, M-39 (Southfield <b>Freeway),</b> M-53 (Van Dyke <b>Freeway),</b> and M-59 have such sections. In {{the rest of the}} state, M-6 near Grand Rapids, Conn. M-13 near Bay City, M-47 near Midland, M-60 near Jackson, and Bus. US131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways, for all or part of their respective lengths. Sections of US12, M-20, M-37, M-46, M-55, M-66 and US223 have been routed to run concurrently with other freeways as well.|$|E
5|$|I-375 and the Chrysler <b>Freeway</b> {{begin at}} Jefferson Avenue and St. Antoine Street in {{downtown}} Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just {{about a mile}} (1.6km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets the Fisher <b>Freeway</b> which carries I-75 north of downtown. At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher <b>Freeway</b> and use the Chrysler <b>Freeway,</b> replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane <b>freeway</b> south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{that are important to}} the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

In 1996, Transurban was awarded the contract to augment two existing <b>freeways</b> and construct two new toll roads - labelled the Western and Southern Links - directly linking a number of existing <b>freeways</b> to provide a continuous, high-capacity road route to, and around, the central business district. CityLink uses a free-flow tolling electronic toll collection system, called e-TAG.|$|R
5|$|I-94 {{traverses}} Detroit in an east–west direction well inland of, {{and parallel}} to, the Detroit River. The <b>freeway</b> intersects I-96 (Jeffries <b>Freeway)</b> and M-10 (Lodge <b>Freeway)</b> on the West Side, passing the main campus of Wayne State University {{before entering the}} East Side at M-1 (Woodward Avenue). Immediately east of the interchange with I-75 (Chrysler <b>Freeway),</b> I-94 forms the southern border of the Milwaukee Junction district. The Edsel Ford <b>Freeway</b> continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit's East Side. The Interstate turns more northerly, mimicking the shoreline of Lake St. Clair, and exits Detroit for Harper Woods. Just north of the interchange for M-102 (Vernier Road), the <b>freeway</b> crosses 8Mile Road and enters Macomb County.|$|E
5|$|I-94/US25 ran northeasterly through {{rural areas}} of Macomb County, {{intersecting}} {{the southern end of}} M-19 near New Haven. The <b>freeway</b> crossed into rural southern St. Clair County south of Richmond and continued northeastward to Marysville, where it turned northward, crossing Gratiot Avenue. A business loop, Business US25 (Bus. US25) ran northeasterly from the <b>freeway</b> along Gratiot Avenue to run parallel to the St. Clair River. From Marysville, the <b>freeway</b> skirted the western side of the Port Huron area, intersecting the M-21 <b>freeway</b> immediately east of the city before turning eastward to curve around the north side of town. After the <b>freeway</b> crossed the Black River, US25 turned northward to separate from I-94.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, the {{northern}} and eastern <b>freeway</b> bypass of Ann Arbor was completed. At that time, the former routing of US23 through downtown and a section of <b>freeway</b> north of the Huron River was redesignated as Bus. US23. Two years later, M-14 was rerouted to follow the US23 <b>freeway</b> around {{the north side of}} Ann Arbor. It overlapped the business loop from {{the northern}} end of its <b>freeway</b> segment to Main Street and along Main Street into downtown. The next year, in 1965, this overlap was shortened {{when the rest of the}} M-14 <b>freeway</b> westward from Main Street to I-94 was completed.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, the <b>freeway</b> was {{extended}} eastward {{a few blocks}} through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler <b>Freeway</b> (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the <b>freeway</b> to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another <b>freeway</b> in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke <b>Freeway</b> (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained <b>freeway,</b> the Davison <b>Freeway</b> was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed {{for a year and}} a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed <b>freeway</b> was reopened on October 8, 1997 by Governor John Engler.|$|E
5|$|M-66 was {{extended}} southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M-78 in 1965. The US127 <b>freeway</b> was completed from Mason north to Lansing in 1966, adding the US127 designation along the I-496/M-78 <b>freeway.</b> The next year, M-78's <b>freeway</b> {{was extended}} eastward to I-75/US10/US23 in Flint. The US127/M-78 <b>freeway</b> was extended north of I-496 in 1969, and a discontinuous section of M-78 <b>freeway</b> east of Flint was completed {{around the same}} time frame. In 1970, the I-496 <b>freeway</b> was completed and the Bus. M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. In 1972, the highway was rerouted to run east of Bellevue to Olivet instead of northeast to Charlotte. The next year, all of M-78 northeast of Olivet was removed when I-69 between Charlotte and I-96 southwest of Lansing was completed; this truncation produced the modern routing of M-78 in the state.|$|E

5|$|The NorthSouth <b>Freeway</b> {{portion of}} Route 42 was {{originally}} planned as a parkway in 1932 that would {{run from the}} Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized. In the late 1940s, the NorthSouth <b>Freeway</b> was proposed by the New Jersey State Highway Department to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the <b>freeway</b> was acquired and actual construction of the <b>freeway</b> followed. The Route 42 <b>freeway</b> opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958. It opened between the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959. With {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth <b>Freeway</b> portion of Route 42, the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E

5|$|The {{first piece}} of the Jeffries <b>Freeway</b> {{connected}} the Fisher <b>Freeway</b> (I-75) with the Ford <b>Freeway</b> (I-94) in 1970. It was extended northwest to Livernois Avenue (exit188A) in July 1971, and then to Grand River Avenue at Schaefer Highway (exit185) in 1973. In 1976, the <b>freeway</b> was extended west to the Southfield <b>Freeway</b> (exit 183), and the entire I-275 concurrent section was opened. The final piece was completed on November 21, 1977, connecting the Detroit section to I-275. The I-96 designation was assigned along the I-275 <b>freeway</b> south to the Jeffries <b>Freeway,</b> and eastward along the new <b>freeway</b> to the M-39 interchange; the remaining stub of I-96 around Farmington was redesignated {{as an extension of}} M-102 (now M-5).|$|E
