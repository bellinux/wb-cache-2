Then, {{in an effort to}} give the ground forces close air support, American Eighth Air Force bombers {{attacked}} the German lines on July 24, 1944, which caused much damage and many casualties. Nonetheless, the operation was further delayed because bombs which fell short resulted in friendly fire casualties (25 killed and 131 wounded) and required forward units to pull back to avoid more casualties. Further bombing by the Eighth Air Force devastated the forward German positions on July 25, killing at least 1,000 German soldiers, but bombs that fell short also killed 111 American soldiers and wounded 490. After several hours, quick action by the 9th Infantry Division (United States) got the drive under way by noon on July 25. By this time, the German forces were alert for an attack, especially after the second friendly fire tragedy. Initial German resistance was heavy. By late afternoon, the VII Corps assault force had made sufficient progress so Lieutenant General Collins ordered the 1st Infantry Division to follow up the advance by moving south toward St. Gilles and Marigny.|$|E

40|$|Scheduling {{techniques}} {{are used in}} high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Traditional scheduling techniques assume fixed execution <b>delays</b> for the <b>operations.</b> For the synthesis of ASIC designs that interface with external signals and events, timing constraints and <b>operations</b> with unbounded <b>delays,</b> i. e. delays unknown at compile time, must also be considered. We present a relative scheduling formulation that supports operations with fixed and unbounded delays. In this formulation, the start time of an operation is specified in terms of offsets from the set of unbounded <b>delay</b> <b>operations</b> called anchors. We analyze first a novel property called well-posedness of timing constraints {{that is used to}} identify consistency of constraints in the presence of unbounded <b>delay</b> <b>operations.</b> We present an algorithm that will transform an ill-posed constraint graph into a minimally serialized well-posed constraint graph, if one exists. The anchors are then checked for redundancy, and we identify the minimum set of anchors that are required in computing the start time. We present an algorithm that schedules the operations relative to the anchors, which yields a minimum schedule that satisfies the timing constraints, or detects if no schedule exists, in polynomial time. Finally, we describe the generation of control logic from the resulting relative schedule. Analysis of the optimality and complexity of the algorithm is presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – To avoid {{undesirable}} disconnection {{of healthy}} wind generators (WGs) or a wind power plant, a WG protection relay should discriminate among faults, {{so that it}} can operate instantaneously for WG, connected feeder or connection bus faults, it can operate after a delay for inter-tie or grid faults, and it can avoid operating for parallel WG or adjacent feeder faults. A WG protection relay based on the positive- and negative-sequence fault components is proposed in the paper. At stage 1, the proposed relay uses the magnitude of the positive-sequence component in the fault current to distinguish faults requiring non-operation response from those requiring instantaneous or <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> responses. At stage 2, the fault type is first determined using the relationships between the positive- and negative-sequence fault components. Then, the relay differentiates between instantaneous operation and <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> based on the magnitude of the positive-sequence fault component. Various fault scenarios involving changes in position and type of fault and faulted phases are used to verify the performance of the relay. This paper concludes by implementing the relay on a hardware platform based on a digital signal processor. Results indicate that the relay can successfully distinguish the need for instantaneous, delayed, or non-operation...|$|E

Postoperatively both showed no improvement of neurologic symptom, and on follow-up of 12 months, one showed no neurologic improvement and the other showed a insignificant improvement of lower extremity muscle power (trace knee extensor/ankle dorsiflexor). We thought that this poor outcome was due to <b>delayed</b> <b>operation,</b> which was done more than 24 hr after the symptom onset.

30|$|We {{note that}} if the server is active in each time slot t∈{ 1,…,N}, each packet will be served {{immediately}} after its arrival. In this case, there is no queue formed in the buffer and consequently, each packet experiences an overall delay of one time slot, {{which is due to}} the time spent in the server. Accordingly, the packets will arrive in the destination at the beginning of time slots t∈{ 2,…,N+ 1 }. However, if the server is inactive in the first time slot, the first packet has to wait in the buffer until time slot 2, to get served. Then, in time slot 2, when the second packet arrives, the server is busy with serving the first packet. Therefore, the second packet also experiences one slot delay in the queue and one slot delay in the server. In a similar manner, all the following packets incur the same queueing and service delays. In other words, the <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> of the server causes the nonzero queueing delay for the first packet, which is transferred to the subsequent packets as well.|$|E
40|$|During a 29 -month trial, 65 {{patients}} with acute gallstone pancreatitis {{were randomly selected}} for biliary tract explorations either within 73 hours of admission (36 patients) or at three months following remission with nonoperative measures (29 patients, with five others awaiting elective operation). The details of surgery were identical, i. e., cholecystectomy, transduodenal sphincteroplasty, and pancreatic duct septotomy. Major bile ducts were cleared of stones by Fogarty catheter passage up the sphincteroplasty. At early operation, pancreatitis was in the acute edematous form in 29 patients, necrotizing in six, and hemorrhagic in one. Acute inflammatory changes were also noticed in three patients who underwent late operation. The locations of the gallstones in patients undergoing early versus delayed operations were, respectively: 97 % and 100 % in gallbladder, 75 % and 28 % within common or hepatic ducts (p < 0. 02), and 31 % and 0 % free in duodenum (p < 0. 01). The distal choledochus and ampulla were inflamed in 89 % of the patients who underwent early operations, but in merely 17 % operated upon electively (p < 0. 01). Concomitant acute cholecystitis was present in 31 % of the patients if surgery was performed during the initial admission, but in only 3 % of the patients at <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> (p < 0. 05). Most striking was the sudden “gush” of pancreatic juice when the ampullary sphincter was first stretched or cut during sphincteroplasty at early operation. Precipitous falls in serum amylase levels then followed over the next 24 hours. No significant differences were noticed in the mortality rate (one death after early operation, two after a delayed procedure), major morbidity rate (in four and three patients, respectively), or in duration of the initial hospitalization period (early operation: 13. 5 days, delayed operation: 16. 7 days). However, a second admission {{to the hospital for}} the <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> (12. 1 days) was avoided by early operation. These data support the concept that biliary pancreatitis is probably initiated by gallstone passage through, or lodgement at, the ampulla of Vater. The resultant ampullary edema with or without gallstone impaction appears to be the anatomic cause for major pancreatic duct obstruction and the consequent pancreatitis. Early and appropriate surgical relief of the biliary tract pathology via a transduodenal sphincteroplasty can obviate the need for a second admission to the hospital without increasing, significantly, the attendant morbidity and mortality rates...|$|E

Methods The data of 953 cases of ocular injury attended in 21 regimental hospitals from 2002 - 01 - 01 to 2008 - 12 - 31,were retrospectively analyzed. The course of diagnasis and trcatment of ocular injuries was investigated,including the interval between injury and the first surgery,the reason leading to delay of surgery,variety misdiagnosis,and the causes leading to misdiagnosis,etc. The collected data were then statistically analyzed by SPSS 13. 0 software.
