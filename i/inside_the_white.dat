5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

25|$|NY100 leaves NY119 just <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Plains {{city limits}} at Central Avenue; however, NY119 {{continues}} on, paralleling the Bronx River for four blocks to a partial interchange with the Bronx River Parkway.

NY119 connects to I-287 and NY127 at its eastern terminus via the , unsigned CR71 (known locally as Westchester Avenue).

25|$|In African-American music, gospel quartets {{developed}} an a cappella style following the earlier {{success of the}} Fisk Jubilee Singers. The 1930s saw the Fairfield Four, the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, The Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Charioteers, and the Golden Gate Quartet. Racism divided the nation, and this division did not skip the church. If during slavery blacks were treated as inferior <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> churches, after emancipation they formed their own separate churches. The gospel groups which were very popular within the black community, were virtually unknown to the white community, though some in the white community began to follow them. In addition to these high-profile quartets, there were many black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s, usually playing the guitar and singing {{in the streets of}} Southern cities. Famous among them were Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Joe Taggart and others.|$|E

25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E
500|$|During the episode, a {{contestant}} named Weng {{participated in}} the Wilyonaryo segment of the show. [...] In the earlier rounds, she had won ₱37,000.

Weng now {{had to choose between}} two big prizes: the ₱100,000 that the host Willie Revillame was offering her, or whatever was <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> wheel, which, according to the rules, could be a jackpot prize of ₱2,000,000 (US$45,000), a jackpot prize of ₱1,000,000 (US$22,500), a jackpot prize of ₱500,000 (US$11,250), a house and lot, or nothing at all (which would be signified by the numeral zero).|$|E

After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in the wheel to reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero. [...] This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.|$|E

At {{the end of}} one of the Lucite runways, a piano was hidden beneath enormous stalagmite-like structures reminiscent of Superman's Fortress of Solitude in the comics. There was also a bar overlooking the piano area, where the audience could order drinks while watching the show. Carl Williot from Idolator website compared the stage with that of ArtRave, and felt that it looked like an [...] "insect" [...] with the extended runway and smaller stages. Following the reveal of the image, the hashtag #LadyGagaTourStage started trending globally in Twitter. According to Stacy Lambe from Out magazine, the stage took over 21,000 hours to construct, including the catwalks. There are 15 inflatable trees which are air hosed on the stage to re-create a garden during one of the segments. The whole set up took three hours to dismantle and 21 trucks to carry it from one venue to another.

Instead, during the September 11 attacks, Bush was taken to <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House and placed in an underground bunker, later being met by her husband, who had returned to Washington from Florida. Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush inaugurated a music concert at the Kennedy Center, organized to fundraise for families of the victims. Though she received applause, she returned the compliment {{to members of the}} audience and added that although the event was tragic, Americans had deepened their appreciation [...] "of life itself, how fragile it can be, what a gift it is and how much we need each other." [...] Senator Ted Kennedy, who introduced Bush at the event, praised her and said he knew his deceased sibling, the late President John F. Kennedy, would also be proud of her. Bush believes the September 11 attacks ignited the interest in the way Afghanistan women were treated, who were not allowed to leave their homes and of which composed a high number of widows due to terrorist attacks in Afghanistan prior to the attacks.|$|E

[...] Such problems were explained away as [...] "bad magic" [...] in the game's manual. The player's goal is to find objects to help defeat the dragons and recover the Chalice.

Only one object can be carried at a time. The player can be eaten by a dragon if it is caught in its [...] "bite" [...] cycle, at which point the avatar is stuck in the dragon's stomach.
