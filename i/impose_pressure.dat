In literature models were proposed to handle fractures in a porous medium as objects of codimension 1. In this work we consider the case of a network of intersecting fractures, with the aim of deriving physically consistent and effective interface conditions to impose at the intersection between fractures. This new model accounts for the angle between fractures at the intersections and allows for jumps of pressure across intersections. This fact permits to describe the flow when fractures are characterized by different properties more accurately with respect to other models that <b>impose</b> <b>pressure</b> continuity. The main mathematical properties of the model, derived in the two-dimensional setting, are analyzed. As concerns the numerical discretization we allow the grids of the fractures to be independent, thus in general non-matching at the intersection, by means of the extended finite element method (XFEM). This increases the flexibility of the method in the case of complex geometries characterized by a high number of fractures...|$|E

We study how cooperation emerge in multiplex complex topologies by analyzing a particular bidirectionally-coupled dynamics on top of a two-layers multiplex network (duplex). The coupled dynamics appears between the Prisoner's Dilemma game in a network, and a threshold cascade model in the other. The threshold model is intended to abstract the behavior of a network of vigilant nodes, that <b>impose</b> <b>pressure</b> of being observed altering hence the temptation to defect of the dilemma. Cooperation or defection in the game also affects the state of a node of being vigilant. We analyze these processes on different duplex networks structures and assess the influence of the topology, average degree and correlated multiplexity, on the outcome of cooperation. Interestingly, we find that the social pressure of vigilance may impact cooperation positively or negatively, depending on the duplex structure, specifically the degree correlations between layers is determinant. Our results give further quantitative insights in the promotion of cooperation under social pressure. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

It examines the organization as an arena in which underlying cultural processes maintain gender distinctions and barriers, thereby limiting the efficacy of policies specifically designed to increase the number of women at senior levels. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on the findings of a qualitative case study of the perceptions of women's career trajectories in an Australian financial services organization. by examining the gender subtexts of organizational documentation we analyse the impact of gender culture, specifically the gender structure of the organization, gender identities of women managers and gender symbolism in organizational texts. Findings – The findings highlight the way an organization's gender culture legitimate continuing gender distinctions and <b>impose</b> <b>pressure</b> on women to comply with masculine behavioral norms, while accepting gender distinctions and arrangements that reproduce inequalities. Research limitations/implications – The findings illustrate that despite the case study organization being awarded for “best practice” in gender equity, the masculine gender culture of the organization indicates that systemic change to support the advancement of women is still strongly needed. Given that this case study is used as an illustrative example, future research should be mindful of the uniqueness of this particular context.

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth and urbanization in China {{have led to a}} substantial change in consumption patterns and diet structure of Chinese consumers over the past few decades. A growing demand for feed, fuel and fiber also places intense pressure on land resources. With continuing growth of China’s economy and migration from rural to urban, the increase in food consumption and change in diet structure will likely continue, which will not only <b>impose</b> <b>pressure</b> on domestic land resources but also exert impact on land resources in other countries through import. This article applies a global multi-region input-output (MRIO) model to trace agricultural land use along global supply chains and examines the impact of China’s future food consumption on global land use in 2030 against different socio-economic and technological scenarios. Our result shows that by 2030, China would need an additional 21 % of cropland to support its increasing food demand driven by population growth, urbanization and income growth and the associated diet structure change. Almost a third of cropland associated with household consumption (34 Mha) will be “outsourced” to foreign countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, United States and Thailand, for the consumption of cereal grains, soybeans and paddy rice. China also consumes 2. 4 Mha cropland from Africa for its consumption of cereal grains and oil seeds. The dependence of domestic consumption on significant amounts of foreign cropland shows that China would face serious challenges to meet its grain self-sufficiency policy in the future, {{and at the same time}} this dependence would contribute to environmental and food security problems elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|With the {{acceleration}} of the urbanization and industrialization in China, {{it is inevitable that}} arable land converts to built-up areas for industrial and residential uses. The urbanization rate has increased form 17 percent in the late 1970 s to 39 percent in 2002. As we all know, during the end of 1980 s and the beginning of 1990 s, China has experienced a rapid urban growth, which was the so-called "great mass fever" on real estate development and establishment of Development Zones. However, compared with the developed countries whose urbanization rate exceeded 70 percent in general, China {{has a long way to}} go toward urbanization according to the theory of urban development. Thus there will be more arable land conversion in the future, which would <b>impose</b> <b>pressure</b> both on food security and on the sustainability of urbanization itself. In view of this, the spatial-temporal characteristics of arable land conversion and its driving forces of the large-scale cities in China in the 1990 s are of importance to be analyzed. Based on the three-time Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital images and statistic data of Beijing, it analyses the arable land conversion and its driving forces in this paper. Some conclusions were drawn as follows: During the early- 1990 s to mid- 1990 s, the rate of arable land converting to built-up area in Beijing is 14. 4 %. Of all the converted arable land, 45. 7 % was converted to built-up area and 90. 6 % was converted from arable land in all the new built-up land. Accordingly, the figure is 4. 60 / 9, 52. 1 % and 80. 7 % respectively in the latter period. Arable land conversion to built-up land played an important role in cultivated land losing.

40|$|Thomas P Vacek, Natia Qipshidze, Suresh C Tyagi Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA Background: Bone {{microvascular}} remodeling is {{the primary}} predictor of bone structure and function. Remodeling {{by its very nature}} implies synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Normally, 50 % of total protein in the vessel wall is elastin. During remodeling, elastin is degraded by specialized matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because the turnover of elastin is 1000 -fold slower than that of collagen, most of the elastin is replaced by stiffer collagen. Stiffer vessels <b>impose</b> <b>pressure</b> on the aortic valve, causing regurgitation and increased pulse pressure. On the other hand, high MMP activity will cause vascular dilatation, leading to aneurysm. Therefore, balanced constitutive remodeling is necessary for adequate bone structure and function. Interestingly, collagen-degrading MMPs are involved in various pathological conditions, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and cardiovascular disease. Sodium nitroprusside is a nitric oxide donor that could potentially alter MMP activity via vasodilation in vivo, but can also produce peroxynitrite, which activates MMPs by combining with superoxide. Moreover, hydrogen sulfide is a known antioxidant as well as a vasodilator, and is also speculated to contribute directly to MMP activity. We hypothesized that hydrogen sulfide reduced activity of MMP in ex vivo bone tissue homogenates and that sodium nitroprusside would increase MMP activity in vitro. Methods: We surgically removed the tibia and femur from anesthetized mice, and prepared bone tissue homogenates using a mortar and pestle, measured the protein concentration with a spectrophotometer, and detected MMP activity using gelatin gel zymography. Results: Our data showed increased MMP activity at a sodium nitroprusside concentration of 1 &micro;M, and MMP activity increased exponentially. There was a decrease in MMP activity with increasing hydrogen sulfide, beginning at 16 &micro;M (P &lt; 0. 01) and continuing to 40 &micro;M. Moreover, sodium nitroprusside 3 &micro;M was able to overcome the decrease in MMP activity that occurred with hydrogen sulfide 40 &micro;M; this resulted in a more pronounced exponential increase in MMP activity. Conclusion: There are several substances that can potentially be used to decrease MMP activity and to alleviate pathological remodeling by MMPs.
