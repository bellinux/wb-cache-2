40|$|AbstractConstitutive {{equations}} {{are derived}} for the elastic response of swollen elastomers and hydrogels under an arbitrary deformation with finite strains. An expression is {{developed for the}} free energy density of a polymer network based on the Flory concept of flexible chains with constrained junctions and solvent-dependent reference configuration. The importance of introduction of a reference configuration evolving under swelling is confirmed by the analysis of experimental data on nanocomposite hydrogels subjected to swelling and drying. Adjustable parameters in the stress–strain relations are found by fitting observations on swollen elastomers, chemical gels (linked by covalent bonds and sliding cross-links), and physical gels under uniaxial stretching, equi-biaxial tension, and pure shear. Good agreement is demonstrated between the observations and results of numerical simulation. A pronounced difference is revealed between the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>content</b> on elastic moduli of chemical and physical gels...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} galleries, museums and {{archives}} are including ink jet printed materials into their collections, and therefore displays. There {{is evidence that}} the instability of these prints is such that images can suffer deterioration in print quality or in extreme cases, a loss of information {{over an extended period of}} time. This is shorter than the period typically required for perceptible deterioration to occur in many other paper-based artworks. The image stability of prints is affected by a number of factors some of which have already been studied. However the role played by the ink solvent in the loss of image quality has yet to be explored.

40|$|ABSTRACT: pH-sensitive hydrogels are {{suitable}} candidates for oral drug delivery of peptides {{due to their}} ability to respond to their environment. We have developed new hydrogels composed of poly-(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (P(MAA-g-EG)) which can be used as drug delivery carriers for salmon calcitonin. P(MAA-g-EG) hydrogels were prepared by free radical solution polymerization. The monomer mixture was diluted using a 50 % w/w solution of ethanol and water. The percentage of monomer in solution was varied from 84 % to 45 % v/v. Swelling studies were conducted to investigate the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> <b>content</b> used during polymer preparation in the swelling behavior. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> dilution on the swelling behavior were not observed until the monomer mixture was diluted to approximately 50 %. Salmon calcitonin was successfully incorporated and released in vitro from the system. Solutions of approximately 0. 1 mg/mL of salmon calcitonin were used to load the protein into the gels at pH) 7 and constant ionic strength of 0. 1 M. The loading efficiency was affected by the amount <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> used during hydrogel preparation. In vitro release studies were performed at pH) 7 and 37 °C, while keeping an ionic strength of 0. 1 M. The release behavior was found to be not very much affected by the amount of diluent used during polymer preparation. The transport mechanism was found to be relaxation controlled for all cases, and the diffusion coefficient was estimated using a heuristic Fickian/relaxational model...|$|R

Simple topical gels, based on ketoprofen, PEG 400 and either Cabosil M- 5 or hydroxypropylcellulose were formulated and applied to freshly excised pig ear skin in vitro. Receptor phase samples were taken to determine permeation and depth profiles of ketoprofen were constructed, following tape stripping and membrane separation. Reduction <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> from the Cabosil-thickened gels resulted in a rank order reduction in the permeation and distribution of ketoprofen. Reduced amounts of ketoprofen were distributed through the skin, particularly the dermis, with decreasing solvent. Two gels sharing the same macroviscosity exhibited significantly different skin permeation and distribution characteristics. The rank order reduction in both permeation and distribution of ketoprofen was attributed to the physiochemical properties of the formulation and how they may change after application, in particular the increased adsorptivity of ketoprofen to the Cabosil relative to the amount <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> present in the system. This effect appeared to be predominant over any interactions occurring between the formulation and the skin. The data provided further evidence that adsorption to the thickener, rather than changes in viscosity, were primarily responsible for reduced permeation and distribution in the system examined...|$|R

30|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCM) {{have gained}} extensive attention in {{thermal energy storage}} applications. In this work, microencapsulation of vegetable-derived palmitic acid (PA) in bio-based polylactic acid (PLA) shell by solvent evaporation and oil-in-water emulsification was investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were conducted to confirm the successful encapsulation of PA in PLA shells. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed to evaluate the thermal properties, thermal reliability, and core content of the fabricated PCM microcapsules (microPCM). Through a series of parametric studies, the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> PCM and <b>solvent</b> <b>content,</b> oil phase-to-aqueous phase ratio, as well as surfactant type and content on the morphology, particle size, and thermal properties of the PCM microcapsules were investigated. Experimental results showed that PVA was a superior emulsifier to SDS in the emulsion systems being studied. There also existed an optimal PVA concentration to reduce the average size of microPCM. When the PVA concentration was above this optimal level, the emulsifier molecules tend to form micelles among themselves. This led to the adhesion of tiny microspheres {{on the surface of}} microPCM as well as larger microPCM. In short, this work has demonstrated the possibility <b>of</b> using the <b>solvent</b> evaporation method to fabricate 100 % bio-based PCM-polymer microcapsules for thermal energy storage applications.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThiswork {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of composite materials, catalytic or not, by an innovating technique named dry impregnation in a fluidized bed. This process permits the obtainment, in only one apparatus, of composite materials which, by the traditional way, must successively undergo the stages of impregnation, filtration, drying and calcination/activation. Its principle consists in the spraying of a solution containing a metallic precursor into a hot fluidized bed of porous particles as a chosen support. After the impregnation step, the decomposition of metallic precursor and metal activation can be operated in the same reactor. It is found that the competition between two phenomena (drying and capillary) controls the deposit location. This paper presents experimental results obtained during the dry impregnation of coarse and fine porous particles using different types of precursors: inorganic precursors (metallic salts), metal organic complexes and a colloidal suspension containing preformed metallic nanoparticles (rhodium). The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> drying parameters (<b>solvent</b> <b>content</b> in gas phase and temperature) on deposit distribution within the support grains at the local scale is examined. It appeared that a fast drying leads to a deposit located only at the external particle surface (similar to a surface coating), whereas a uniform deposit on thewhole particle volume is obtained with slow drying conditions. It indicates that dry impregnation in fluidized beds is very flexible and, by a simple modification of the operating conditions, we can fix the deposit location...|$|R
30|$|A {{hydrated}} perovskite specimen {{may contain}} both mono- and di-hydrated phases, {{as well as}} some decomposed parts that contain PbI 2 [38, 39]. It has been shown that the irreversible perovskite decomposition to PbI 2 can only happen by water condensation on perovskite surface, resulted from a temperature difference between the film surface and the humid air [38]. In the current work, the substrate temperature is much higher than the ambient temperature. It is therefore assumed that condensation never occurs during deposition, but partial condensation may take place during the sample analysis. The H 2 O produced in di-hydration reaction (R 1) may transform the remaining perovskite phase. Irreversible decomposition can also occur without the requirement for the excess water when (CH_ 3 NH_ 3)_ 4 PbI_ 6 - 2 xCl_ 2 x. 2 H_ 2 O is exposed to light [38, 39]. On the basis of this simple theory, we can recognize that the thin film made at run 1 has undergone a complete hydration path based on reactions R 1 and R 2, leaving different (rod-like, grainy, and amorphous) regions on the surface, while in thin films formed at runs 2 – 3, the monohydrated phase occupies a bigger part. This interesting evolution resulted from the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> different TISs. We reiterate that in our sequential method, the PbCl 2 precursor solution is sprayed in the first step and the MAI solution is sprayed in the second step. Contribution of TIS to the hydration process can be elucidated as follows: a longer TIS allows more depletion of DMSO/DMF from PbCl 2 precursor solution. Both DMSO and DMF are strongly polar, increasing the surface activity and tendency for water absorption. On the other hand, a different feature and trend is observed when the substrate is kept at 120  °C (runs 4 – 6). The films are seemingly composed of grainy or spiky crystallites, whose size and density significantly changes by the TIS. We assume that the thin films deposited on high temperature substrates have experienced a reversible hydration, but the absorbed H 2 O is removed instantly, due to the very high substrate temperature (120  °C). On the other hand, the hydration is an exothermic (thermo-phobic) reaction which can be suppressed in high temperature conditions. It is, therefore, proposed that the perovskite thin films deposited on a hot substrate are relatively stable against hydration during the deposition process. The change in density and crystal size due to a change in the TIS can be again due to the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the <b>solvent</b> <b>content.</b> As mentioned above, a longer TIS (especially with high temperature substrate) results in less DMSO/DMF and more IPA in the wet precursors on the substrate and therefore a decrease in the normal boiling point and an increase in wettability [36]. Reduction of the normal boiling point <b>of</b> the <b>solvents</b> causes faster and more uniform crystallization, while better wettability favors droplet spreading and coalescence and surface coverage, consequently [22, 40]. It is worth mentioning that unlike the literature reports, we recognized that no crystal sintering occurs at high temperature deposition. We ascribe this advantage to the imposed ultrasonic vibration prohibiting crystals aggregation [32, 35].|$|R
