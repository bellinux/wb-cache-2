By using such a conceptual multi-hierarchy, the system provides more flexibility in retrieving stored emails. The paper presents the underlying mathematical structures, discusses requirements for their maintenance and presents their implementation. 1 Motivation The way standard email management systems store mails is directly derived from the tree structure of file management systems. This has the advantage that trees have a simple structure which can easily be explained to novice users. The disadvantage is that at the moment of storing an email the user already has to <b>foresee</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she is going to retrieve the mail later. The tree structure forces her to decide at that moment which criteria to consider as primary and which as secondary. For instance, when storing an email regarding the organization of a conference, one has to decide whether to organize one' [...] ...|$|E

The literature starts using a new concept, a new form of association – artificial intelligence society – foreseen to be established in the next time frame. All these developments of human society and translations or leaps (most of the times apparently timeless) were, are and will be possible only due to the advancing information and communications technologies. The leap to Democracy 3. 0, based on information and communication technologies prompts to a radical change in the majority of the classical concepts targeting society structure and the way it is guided and controlled. Thus, concepts become electronic concepts (or e-concepts) through the use of new technologies. E-concepts keep the essence of the classical principles of liberty and democracy, adding a major aspect of the new way of communication and spreading ideas between people. The main problem is to quantify, analyze and <b>foresee</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> technological changes will influence not only the economic system, but also the daily life of the individual and the society. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, depending on the point of view), all these evolutions and technological and social developments are as many challenges for the governments of the world. In this paper we will highlight only four of the challenges facing the governments, grouped in a structured model with the following specific concepts: Big Data, Social Data, Linked Data and Mobile Data. This is an emerging paradigm of the information and communication technology supporting national and global eGovernment projects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{developer}} {{must often}} {{be able to}} understand a software system at several levels of detail [...] from abstract system architecture down to source code [...] before being able to change system functionality or fix bugs. Each of these levels might require its own notation and tools. For example, source code, written in a programming language, is viewed and manipulated using browsers and editors, whereas architectural designs, expressed as diagrams, are viewed and manipulated using visual editors. In this paper we show how a multi-view perspective of a software system can be realized, simply and economically, by loosely integrating a set of existing independent tools. Ideally, all environments would be designed a priori to allow their combination into tightly integrated systems. In actual fact, it is common that developers of individual tools cannot <b>foresee</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which their tools will be used. People who integrate such tools must exploit what is available to them. The Star system demonstrates how loose integration among existing tools can rapidly and simply result in useful environments for software development. ...|$|R

50|$|The scholar {{related the}} {{development}} of Lithuanian pedagogical thought with the general issues of the national culture. Thus her investigations were distinguished for their culturology aspects and extensive viewpoint. Her scientific works were conducted {{on the verge of}} three fields of science - pedagogy, literature and culturology, and surpassed the prevailing investigations of those times, concentrated on the narrow specific issues of school system, didactics. Meilė Lukšienė raised essential questions of the orientation of the Lithuanian education system, namely: ratio of nationality and universality; education of cultural identity; continuation of the cultural tradition and modernization of education; social justice. Then she formulated the ideal of education, which served as basis for the new content of education at school: a person who is moral, active citizen, independent thinker, creative and able to intake a variety of cultural values and act in a constructive <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> public discussions of these topics turned into an important factor of the change of pedagogic mentality and the overall mentality of the society.A valuable trait of M. Lukšienė was her ability to get and embrace the newest information {{from a variety of sources}}, analyse the Western Europe education systems and the tendencies of their development, the newest ideas of education science, and to <b>foresee</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> of their application in Lithuanian context. Meilė Lukšienė was able to communicate, to read in several languages - the Lithuanian, Polish, French, Russian, and German, thus was non-formally, intensively learning from a variety of sources of literature world-wide. Meilė Lukšienė had a characteristic deep systems-oriented thinking. In all investigations conducted she considered the independent education system to be among the guarantees of statehood, while the presence of direction, purpose and capacity to embrace all possible layers of the society by the education system - one of the conditions for successful existence of the state.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is {{underline}} why the designer must really become a central figure in space research programs that involve human presence focussing the attention on the importance of theoretical and methodological approach “half way between design and human sciences”. Because of the rapid expansion of manned missions in space exploration and, especially, for the gradual increase in the duration of the time humans are spending onboard the International Space Station, the relative studies into the habitability of confined spaces and in microgravity have also multiplied, to guarantee, now and in the near future when we are thinking of mission to Mars, a more comfortable and functional, and therefore more efficient, way of living and working in space. Designing for space means starting anew, applying a different logic for a different environment, conceiving new instruments for uses and activities that Earth dwellers have difficulty in envisaging, but which on the whole presuppose a different relationship between our bodies, the objects, and the surrounding space. The objectives that will be explained in this pages try to demonstrate as design research for confined environments and microgravity conditions requires a capacity of “use forecast”, that is to say <b>foreseeing</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which an object will be used, to be able to imagine, for example, the actions and the movements of the crewmembers in relationship to the “neutral posture” that is assumed in microgravity, and to <b>foresee</b> <b>the</b> physiological, perceptive, ergonomic, psychological and motional requirements that will arise in the astronauts in conditions that are completely new and unknown to the human being. The conclusions of the reflections discussed in the paper, related of the particular space context, delineate the task of the architecture and industrial design {{to improve the quality of}} life on board, planning on board environments that can facilitate human movement and, at <b>the</b> same time, <b>foresee</b> new ways of using instruments and new gestures in relationship to the extraordinary conditions of the space environment.

50|$|The {{invention}} of the cotton gin caused massive growth {{in the production of}} cotton in the United States, concentrated mostly in the South. Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850. As a result, the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery, with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy. While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day. The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production, increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850. By 1860, black slave labor from the American South was providing two-thirds of the world’s supply of cotton, and up to 80% of the crucial British market. The cotton gin thus “transformed cotton as a crop and the American South into the globe's first agricultural powerhouse, and - according to many historians - was the start of the Industrial Revolution".According to the Eli Whitney Museum website:Whitney (who died in 1825) could not have <b>foreseen</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which his invention would change society for the worse. The most significant of these was the growth of slavery. While it was true that the cotton gin reduced the labor of removing seeds, it did not reduce the need for slaves to grow and pick the cotton. In fact, the opposite occurred. Cotton growing became so profitable for the planters that it greatly increased their demand for both land and slave labor. In 1790 there were six slave states; in 1860 there were 15. From 1790 until Congress banned the importation of slaves from Africa in 1808, Southerners imported 80,000 Africans. By 1860 approximately one in three Southerners was a slave.|$|R

40|$|The {{vision of}} {{ubiquitous}} computing (UbiComp), as introduced by Mark Weiser, goes beyond simple embedding of computational capabilities in the environment. <b>The</b> vision <b>foresees</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> humans interact with technology {{in a very}} different way; the future of man-machine interaction will not be through clicking and typing on computers but through interacting with objects around us through speech, touch, gestures or movement, etc.; any required computation will be performed in the background, hidden from the user. Since Weiser first introduced his idea, technology has been progressing making essential bricks of such an environment available and successful research projects have been developed; however, the UbiComp vision is still far from current reality. This is partly {{due to the fact that}} technology is still too visible, and partly due to the complexity of the systems themselves but even more so due to the complexity of setting up and handling both systems and services. Most users of UbiComp applications can be expected to be technology agnostic, they don’t have technical background and their knowledge of the programming languages that are typically used to set up UbiComp applications is either very limited or does not exist. This has so far limited building smart environment applications to professional developers. At the same time, the actual users of UbiComp have typically rather individual requirements depending on their intended uses and environment; they tend to define tasks in their own way to take control over their environment. Thus there is a need to move the customisation functionality of applications to the users’ side of the process. This entails simplifying <b>the</b> <b>way</b> service are defined and customised by making discovery, operational modification and provisioning transparent to the user. This thesis presents a top down approach providing a high level UbiComp programing language that aims at empowering end-users with the ability to control their environment without needing understanding about the underlying technologies. The work defined and investigated a set of algorithms for mapping users’ service requirements to available assets in the network and proved that they outperform SOTA in resource allocation. The here defined programming language builds on this mapping and hides away the complexity of the system from its users. The usability of the language was verified using “cognitive dimensions”, formal semantics was used for verifying the language and connecting it to the mapping algorithms...|$|R

I will be lending my focus to disparities in mental health, HIV/AIDs care, reproductive health, trans health, and physical health issues among women who are either currently incarcerated or those who have completed their sentences and are at higher risk for re-entry after attempting re-integration. There is a lack of care, access, and proper treatment for women inmates in U. S. prisons and reform is needed. I <b>foresee</b> <b>the</b> best possible <b>way</b> to accomplish this change short-term is by reforming healthcare policies in prisons, creating competency trainings for healthcare professionals in correctional facilities, including individualized services and trauma informed care, creating community-based services on the outside, and advocating for policy reform outside of prisons until they are abolished altogether. By creating better access to care for women outside of prison, many crimes of necessity will decrease, as well as substance abuse among those coping with physical disabilities and/or mental illness.
