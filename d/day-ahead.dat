50|$|ISO New England has {{enhanced}} {{these markets}} in 2003, when it adopted a “Standard Market Design (SMD).” SMD added {{features such as}} a <b>Day-Ahead</b> Market to protect against price volatility and locational pricing that improves efficiency by accurately gauging {{the true cost of}} producing and supplying power anywhere in the region.|$|E
50|$|EPEX SPOT {{operates}} <b>day-ahead</b> power {{markets for}} Germany/Austria/Luxembourg, France,the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. These <b>day-ahead</b> markets are organized by an auction process, matching {{once a day}} supply and demand curves and thus fixing prices in an anonymous, yet transparent and secured manner. Members of the Exchange enter their orders for hourly quantities of power into the order book which is closed on 11 am for Switzerland and on 12 pm for all other markets. EPEX SPOT calculates the offer and demand curves and their intersection for each hour of the following day. Results are published from 11.10 am (Switzerland) and 12.55 pm (all other markets). The price index for the German/Austrian/Luxembourg market is called the Physical Electricity Index, or PHELIX, and is a reference for power wholesale prices in Europe {{by virtue of its}} underlying liquidity.|$|E
50|$|IEX {{is one of}} the two {{operational}} Power Exchanges in India. Ever {{since its}} incorporation, it has held an influential market share. IEX operates a <b>day-ahead</b> market based on closed auctions with double-sided bidding and uniform pricing; it has over 3,800 registered clients, over 300 private generators and more than 3,300 industrial electricity consumers.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, partial or {{complete}} {{deregulation of the}} wholesale generation business have created a number of Independent Power Producers, who build and operate power plants and sell over the long term, through power purchase agreements — with terms of up to 35 years — and in <b>day-ahead</b> and hour-ahead transactions, where such markets exist.|$|E
50|$|The {{mitigation}} of supplier (generators) {{market power}} is commonly accepted but less well documented. For suppliers to exercise market power {{they would need}} to withhold generation in the <b>Day-Ahead</b> market (DAM). This is more difficult in the presence of virtual bidding as virtual traders can submit virtual supply to compete away this withholding practice.|$|E

50|$|On 9 November 2010, <b>day-ahead</b> market {{coupling}} for the extended region was launched. This region covers Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordic region and Estonia. It represents the world's largest single power market of 1,816 TWh, about 60% of European power consumption. The second step adding the NorNed cable between Norway and the Netherlands started on 12 January 2011.|$|E

It links the markets of Austria, Benelux, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, the Nordic and the Baltic {{countries}} by a price coupling solution in order to optimize the use of cross-border capacities between these countries, increasing the gains in social welfare on all markets.|$|E
5000|$|EXAA {{operates}} a <b>day-ahead</b> electricity spot market, {{with a single}} daily auction point at 10:15 AM. Traders place closed buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders for electric energy, to be physically delivered the following day, until 10:12 AM when the orderbook closes. Traders can place bids and asks for electric power in individual hours, {{as well as in}} standardized blocks (comprising several hours).|$|E
5000|$|... 4M MC is an ATC based <b>day-ahead</b> {{implicit}} allocation process striving on the {{compatibility with}} the EU Target Model while {{taking into account}} the fact that 4M solution is to be considered as an interim step before the Central Eastern European (“CEE”) regional solution. The primary target of the market coupling is to assure a deeper integration of regional power markets. The process aims at maximizing the energy flow from the low price area to the high price area by {{taking into account the}} available cross-border capacity. Consequently, price levels among the individual market areas converge. By this procedure, not only the security of supply can be increased but the price volatility on relevant power markets can be moderated and the power sale and purchase can become more effective.The Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian NRAs, TSOs and PXs jointly implemented the extension of CZ-SK-HU Market Coupling to Romanian <b>day-ahead</b> electricity market (4M MC) on 19 November 2014 based on PCR solution.|$|E
50|$|A 2013 study {{estimates}} the merit order effect of both wind and photovoltaic electricity generation in Germany between the years 2008 and 2012. For each additional GWh of renewables {{fed into the}} grid, the price of electricity in the <b>day-ahead</b> market is reduced by 0.11-0.13¢/kWh. The total merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1¢/kWh in 2012.|$|E
50|$|EXAA {{was founded}} 2001 and started <b>day-ahead</b> spot market trading of {{electric}} energy on March 21, 2002. Since then, EXAA has {{developed into a}} major platform for efficient trading that makes use of the possibilities offered by a liberalized energy market in Central Europe. In June 2005, trading started in European CO2 emissions allowances (EUAs) in the market segment for environmental products, which resulted in 2011 into a joint effort with the Greenmarket environmental exchange.|$|E
50|$|As utility {{companies}} began integrating their operations in more complex ways with their neighbors, they {{evolved into a}} vertical organizational structure with three tiers: Generation, Transmission, and Scheduling. On a day-to-day or <b>day-ahead</b> operational level these functions might be performed by three or more people at large utilities, but might be combined into a single employee's job at a small utility. The size of the back office support for each function varies greatly depending upon {{the size of the}} utility.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{prediction}} intervals (PI) and densities, or probabilistic forecasting, {{has become}} much more common over the past three decades, as practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts. Despite the bold move by the organizers of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 to require the participants to submit forecasts of the 99 percentiles of the predictive distribution (<b>day-ahead</b> in the price track) and not the point forecasts as in the 2012 edition, this {{does not seem to be}} a common case in EPF as yet.|$|E
50|$|ISOs and RTOs {{coordinate}} {{generation and}} transmission across wide geographic regions, matching {{generation to the}} load instantaneously to keep supply and demand for electricity in balance. The grid operators forecast load and schedule generation to assure that sufficient generation and back-up power is available in case demand rises or a power plant or power line is lost. They also operate wholesale electricity markets that enable participants {{to buy and sell}} electricity on a <b>day-ahead</b> or a real-time spot market basis. These markets provide electricity suppliers with more options for meeting consumer needs for power at the lowest possible cost.|$|E

ABC's sports programs are aired with less delay, and often {{in the middle of}} the night, Guam time; some sporting events that air live in prime-time often air in the late-morning hours in Guam—one example was Monday Night Football which, when it was on ABC, aired on Tuesday mornings at 11 am in Guam.|$|E
50|$|Power trading between regions {{started in}} 1950 after the signed {{agreement}} between the Democratic Republicans of Congo and Zambia. Other parts of the continent also started a power trading business until 1995. In 1995 SAPP was founded {{and it was the}} first and advanced power pool in Africa. Since then the SAPP influenced the energy market and started competitive energy markets such as a <b>day-ahead</b> market (DAM). Every year, each member donates a certain amount of money to the group as pre-determined in the document that set up the Power Pool.Today, most of the money that funds the Pool comes from donors, such as the World Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Once a {{particular}} day's gas obligations are finalized in the <b>day-ahead</b> market, traders (or more commonly lower-level {{personnel in the}} organization known as, [...] "schedulers") will work together with counterparties and pipeline representatives to [...] "schedule" [...] the flows of gas into ("injections") and out of ("withdrawals") individual pipelines and meters. Because, in general, injections must equal withdrawals (i.e. the net volume injected and withdrawn on the pipeline should equal zero), pipeline scheduling and regulations are a major driver of trading activities, and quite often the financial penalties inflicted by pipelines onto shippers who violate their terms of service are well in excess of losses a trader may otherwise incur in the market correcting the problem.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the state}} level, part of California's {{deregulation}} process, which was promoted {{as a means}} of increasing competition, was also influenced by lobbying from Enron, and began in 1996 when California became the first state to deregulate its electricity market. Eventually a total of 40% of installed capacity - 20 gigawatts - was sold to what were called [...] "independent power producers." [...] These included Mirant, Reliant, Williams, Dynegy, and AES. The utilities were then required to buy their electricity from the newly created <b>day-ahead</b> only market, the California Power Exchange (PX). Utilities were precluded from entering into longer-term agreements that would have allowed them to hedge their energy purchases and mitigate day-to-day swings in prices due to transient supply disruptions and demand spikes from hot weather.|$|E
50|$|Extreme price volatility, {{which can}} be up to two orders of {{magnitude}} {{higher than that of}} any other commodity or financial asset, has forced market participants to hedge not only volume but also price risk. Price forecasts from a few hours to a few months ahead have become of particular interest to power portfolio managers. A power market company able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule {{in order to reduce the}} risk or maximize the profits in <b>day-ahead</b> trading. A ballpark estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of short-term price forecasts is $300,000 per year for a utility with 1GW peak load.|$|E
50|$|An {{assessment}} of the lost revenues is needed if some power plants, such as wind turbines, have absolute priority (must-run plants). A dispatching authority will in this case order the other plants to decrease power. In some countries plant operators are entitled to receive compensation for such interventions. In a competitive electricity market the situation can be handled by a balancing mechanism, in which any imbalance from the schedule (typically a <b>day-ahead</b> schedule) is penalized, either using the price from a balancing market or a calculated price. Thus, since UK spark spreads were {{in the range of}} 4-9 £/MWh - on average £6.5/MWh, or 0.65 p/kWh, we can assess the likely cost of relegating existing power stations to a standby role for a large penetration of renewables as being around 0.65 p/kWh.|$|E
