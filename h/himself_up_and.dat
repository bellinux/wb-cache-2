5|$|Braham {{was summoned}} to see Basil Embry. The {{commanding}} officer made Braham wait until he had cleaned <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was properly dressed. Embry gave Braham a stern rebuke for risking himself in such a fashion. He had not given his agreement to the operation and Braham had taken off before he could give a definitive answer. Nevertheless, his 29th victory eased the tension and Embry invited him to the bar for a conciliatory beer. Bill Gregory did not fly with Bob Braham again. His DFC and bar with DFM reflected his contribution to Braham's success. He may also have taken the events of 12 May 1944 as a warning. For Braham, the thrill of ranger operations was addictive. On 25 May 1944 he attempted another but turned back because of poor weather. His last operations were flown with both Embry and Walsh on 6 June 1944 during the Normandy landings. The Western Front, dormant since 1940, was now re-activated. Braham flew over Normandy several times with Mosquito bomber groups in June 1944. These counted as his last successful operations.|$|E
5|$|The scene then flashes {{forward to}} a plane {{returning}} Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 1897, {{an attempt}} by a British force to take the {{strongly}} held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left foot and a broken right ankle. Unable to walk, he pulled himself to a boulder, propped <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders.|$|E

25|$|As {{the militants}} {{took over the}} {{security}} buildings, they took more than 42 people at gunpoint. The majority of them were civilian officials and unarmed military personnel. Due to prohibition of bearing weapons inside the GHQ Headquarters, the militants easily {{took control of the}} buildings. The Pakistan Army quickly planned the hostage rescue operation. After limited hours of preparation, the hostage operation was launched under the code name of Operation Janbaz. This was followed by deploying Pakistan Army Special Forces, 13th Regular regiment, and the SSG Division. The operation was led by the SSG Division's teams, while the Army Special Forces also participated in the operation. The Special Forces and SSG Division's teams stormed the buildings, and a heavy gun battle ensued. Well-armed Pakistani forces, cleared the building in {{the first phase of the}} operation. The first 20 military personnel and civilian hostages were rescued by the Army Special Forces, and 3 injured militants were captured. After that, the remaining hostages were then rescued by the Pakistan army's Special Forces and the SSG Division. Among the hostages were 22 who were being guarded by a suicide bomber, who failed to blow <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was subsequently killed. During the attack, which took place at 0600 hrs., four militants, two commandos, and three hostages (two civilians and one soldier) were killed. Three commandos later died of their injuries. One militant was captured; he was named as Mohammed Aqeel (alias Dr. Usman), and was said to be the leader of the group and the mastermind of the 3 March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team. Aqeel was arrested in a building separate from the other militants, and five hostages were rescued from him. He had also tried to blow <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was injured in the process.|$|E
25|$|When the Wei {{imperial}} court received {{news of the}} invasion, Cao Rui ordered Cao Zhen to lead Wei {{forces to}} resist the invaders. At Ji Valley, Cao Zhen easily defeated Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi, who had been given command of the weaker soldiers in the Shu army. (Zhuge Liang had reserved the better soldiers for his own army to attack Mount Qi.) In the meantime, the Wei general Zhang He attacked and defeated the Shu general Ma Su at the Battle of Jieting. Around the time, one Yang Tiao (楊條) from Anding Commandery had rallied some followers, taken the commandery officials hostage and captured the revenue office. When Cao Zhen and his troops besieged Anding Commandery, Yang Tiao tied <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> surrendered. Zhuge Liang and the Shu forces retreated upon learning of Ma Su’s defeat. The Wei forces under Cao Zhen and Zhang He then used the opportunity to quell the rebellions in the three commanderies and restore peace.|$|E
500|$|As Hornsby {{recalled}} later, Ruth [...] "didn't say a word. He didn't {{even look}} around or up at me. He just picked <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walked away". Ruth's {{failed attempt to}} steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.|$|E

500|$|Maulbetsch's {{style was}} {{described}} as [...] "line-plunging." [...] A New York newspaper noted: [...] "When the ball is snapped to him he almost doubles <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and,</b> with his head aimed at the knees of the opposing line, he dives head first. [...] Those who have seen Maulbetsch in action marvel at the great momentum he can get up {{in two or three}} steps." [...] Noted football writer Walter Eckersall said: [...] "Mauly is a little fellow, being built close to the ground. [...] They say that when he plunges at the line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops – that he hits so low that it's well nigh impossible to stop him." [...] An Iowa newspaper wondered how it was possible [...] "for a man to smash into a line of human bodies with the force that Maulbetsch does and come out of the game without a broken neck." ...|$|E
500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base. [...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E

500|$|According to The Tombstone Epitaph, [...] "Wyatt Earp {{stood up}} and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit." [...] Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan's shot hit Billy in the right wrist, {{disabling}} his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He {{tried and failed to}} grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. [...] Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, [...] "That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him." [...] Morgan Earp picked <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> also fired at Frank. [...] Frank fell to the sidewalk {{on the east side of}} Fremont Street.|$|E

2500|$|In Game 1, Rays {{first baseman}} Carlos Peña started the game, but left {{after his first}} at-bat after {{reportedly}} having blurry vision because of an eye injury suffered at his home the previous night. Rays third baseman Evan Longoria hit a solo {{home run in the}} 2nd inning on the first pitch of his first career post-season at-bat, giving the Rays the early one-run lead. White Sox left fielder DeWayne Wise hit a 3-run home run in the next inning to put Chicago ahead 3–1. The Rays came back in {{the bottom half of the}} 3rd inning with three runs of their own, including another home run by Longoria, putting the Rays back on top 4–3. Two more RBI singles in the 5th inning gave the Rays a 6–3 cushion. In the 7th inning, Rays relief pitcher Grant Balfour appeared to get into an argument with White Sox shortstop Orlando Cabrera. After Balfour's first pitch to Cabrera, which was a ball to Cabrera's far side, Cabrera kicked some dirt in Balfour's direction. Balfour, who is known to get fired up by shouting to himself, may have yelled something that Cabrera took offense too. After words were exchanged between the two, play continued and Balfour finished the at-bat by striking out Cabrera. Cabrera later stated that he was unaware of Balfour's tendency to pump <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> that [...] "it was just heat of the moment." [...] Dan Wheeler would come in close for the Rays in the 9th inning. After giving up a leadoff home run, he retired the next three batters, capping off a 6–4 win for the Rays in their first playoff game in franchise history, giving them a one-game lead in the 5-game series.|$|E
