25|$|The wooden lodge where Barentsz' crew {{sheltered}} {{was found}} undisturbed by Norwegian seal hunter Elling Carlsen in 1871. Making {{a sketch of}} the lodge's construction, Carlsen recorded finding two copper cooking pots, a barrel, a tool chest, clock, crowbar, flute, clothing, two empty chests, a cooking tripod {{and a number of}} pictures. Captain Gunderson landed at the site on 17 August 1875 and collected a <b>grappling</b> <b>iron,</b> two maps and a handwritten translation of Pet and Jackman's voyages. The following year, Charles L.W. Gardiner also visited the site on 29 July where he collected 112 more objects, including the message by Barentsz and Heemskerck describing their settlement to future visitors. All of these objects eventually ended up in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, after some had initially been held in The Hague.|$|E

50|$|Smash {{and grab}} raids became {{common in the}} 1930s, and were {{particularly}} prevalent in the 1940s, but decreased in frequency as shopkeepers took to strengthening their windows and/or fitting protective grilles. By the 1950s, forced entry to shops was being effected by using cars and <b>grappling</b> <b>irons</b> to pull window bars off windows, a precursor to the 1980s phenomenon of ram-raiding.|$|R
5000|$|Confident in Carthage's superiority at sea, Hannibal Gisco deploys his ships for the Battle of Mylae in the {{traditional}} long line arrangement. Although inexperienced in sea battles, the Romans, led by consul Gaius Duilius Nepos, heavily defeat the Carthaginian fleet, mainly due to the innovative use of land tactics in naval warfare (including {{the use of the}} <b>grappling</b> <b>irons</b> and the corvus boarding bridge).|$|R
50|$|Just as the beak {{was about}} to strike, Nightingale, by a clever stroke of the helm, evaded the galley and turned her {{broadside}} to it, so close that the galley's oars were broken. Nightingale secured La Palme with <b>grappling</b> <b>irons,</b> and fired a broadside of grapeshot; {{at the same time}} a hail of grenades came from aloft. Nightingale then sent fifty men aboard, to deal with any men still alive.|$|R
60|$|Next instant--how, {{he never}} knew--Castell {{was at his}} side, and after him came two more men, but one of these rolled from the deck into the sea and was lost. As he vanished, the chain of the <b>grappling</b> <b>iron</b> parted, and the Margaret swung away from them, leaving those three alone {{in the power of}} their foes, nor, do what she would, could she make fast again. As yet, however, there were no Spaniards to be seen, for the reason that none had dared to stand upon this high tower whereof the bulwarks were all gone, while the {{bowsprit}} of the Margaret crashed down upon it like a giant's club, and, as she rolled, swept it with its point.|$|E
60|$|And as we {{laid out}} on the next tack to wind-ward, I bent a piece of line to a small {{grappling}} hook I had seen lying in the bail-hole. The end of the line I made fast to the ring-bolt in the bow, and with the hook out of sight I waited for the next opportunity to use it. Once more they made their leeward pull down the port side of the Lancashire Queen, and once more we churned down after them before the wind. Nearer and nearer we drew, and I was making believe to reach for them as before. The stern of the skiff was not six feet away, and they were laughing at me derisively as they ducked under the ship's stern. At that instant I suddenly arose and threw the <b>grappling</b> <b>iron.</b> It caught fairly and squarely on the rail of the skiff, which was jerked backward out of safety as the rope tautened and the salmon boat ploughed on.|$|E

5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons.

6000|$|There {{was a loud}} {{splash of}} men jumping overboard, and then, almost instantly, the cry of [...] "Quarter! quarter!" [...] The {{lieutenant}} ran {{to the edge of}} the vessel. It was as he had thought: the <b>grappling</b> <b>irons</b> of the pirate sloop had parted, and it had drifted away. The few pirates who had been left aboard of the schooner had jumped overboard and were now holding up their hands. [...] "Quarter!" [...] they cried. [...] "Don't shoot!--quarter!"

After me poured a yelling, cheering, cursing throng of Helium's best fighting-men. Nothing could withstand them in the fever of battle lust which enthralled them.|$|R
50|$|La Santé {{was seen}} as escape proof. In his escapes from his Canadian prisons, Mesrine had {{required}} little more than wire cutters and a very high degree of audacity, now he faced security far better than any he had defeated before. A report noted that Mesrine had been seen doing exercises in his cell and was behaving {{like a man who}} had received good news. On May 8, 1978, he produced a gun, stole keys, and, with François Besse (a highly accomplished escaper in his own right), and another man, Mesrine got out of a cellblock and into a fenced-off yard walkway. They had a <b>grappling</b> <b>iron</b> with them and Mesrine forced some workmen with an extending ladder to bring the ladder along. The trio unlocked a yard gate in an inner wall; an armed guard was taken by surprise at his post. The men then reached an isolated part of the 14 metre (46 ft) high exterior wall (which would have presented a considerable challenge without the ladder). They hooked the <b>grappling</b> <b>iron</b> onto the top of the ladder and slid down the rope. The third man over the wall was shot dead by police in the street outside. Mesrine and Besse hijacked a car and evaded the police cordon; they had become the first men to escape from La Santé.|$|E

5000|$|For four days, {{the police}} dug up bogland and searched the {{mountains}} without result. At this time, a navigable waterway existed between Lough Mask and Galway Bay {{by way of}} the Corrib River at Cong. The services of Her Majesty’s Royal Navy were engaged, and forty men of HMS Banterer, then lying in Galway Bay, were sent to Lough Mask. [...] For twelve days, the “bluejackets harrowed and dragged the bottom of the lake, their efforts frequently hampered by rough waters.” Then on Friday, January 27th, “A <b>grappling</b> <b>iron</b> caught upon something weighty, which on being brought to the surface proved to be the body of the younger of the two missing men. The body was tied up in a sack in to which he had been put head foremost…. The second body was found about twenty minutes later, only a few yards from the spot where the first body had been found. The murderers had not taken the trouble to put the old man’s body in a sack. They merely wrapped his own overcoat around him, and having firmly fastened a large stone round his legs, threw him into the water... The old man’s body was also very little decomposed.” ...|$|E
500|$|Although most {{of these}} devices failed to go off, except prematurely, one did sink the 1,000 ton Brazilian ironclad Rio de Janeiro killing 155 men, {{so they had to}} be taken seriously.

60|$|Besides {{the above}} advantages, Mr Beeching's boat was fitted {{with the usual}} air-cases round the sides, and with a thick stripe of cork outside the gunwale; also with lines hanging over the sides in festoons, so that any one in the water, using them as stirrups, might get into the boat with ease. She was further {{provided}} with an anchor and cable; with strong but light lines attached to <b>grappling</b> <b>irons</b> at the bow and stern, which, when thrown into the rigging or upon a wreck, might fasten themselves to the ship and retain the boat without any other aid; also with a life-buoy, and a lantern for night work, besides numerous small articles.|$|R
60|$|There was {{one part}} of the {{arrangements}} made by the Romans in preparing their fleets which was strikingly characteristic of the determined resolution which marked all their conduct. They constructed machines containing <b>grappling</b> <b>irons,</b> which they mounted on the prows of their vessels. These engines were so contrived, that the moment one of the ships containing them should encounter a vessel of the enemy, the <b>grappling</b> <b>irons</b> would fall upon the deck of the latter, and hold the two firmly together, so as to prevent the possibility of either escaping from the other. The idea that they themselves should have any wish to withdraw from the encounter seemed entirely out of the question. Their only fear was that the Carthaginian seamen would employ their superior skill and experience in naval maneuvers in making their escape. Mankind have always regarded the action of the Romans, in this case, {{as one of the most}} striking examples of military courage and resolution which the history of war has ever recorded. An army of landsmen come down to the sea-shore, and, without scarcely having ever seen a ship, undertake to build a fleet, and go out to attack a power whose navies covered the sea, and made her the sole and acknowledged mistress of it. They seize a wrecked galley of their enemies for their model; they build a hundred vessels like it; they practice maneuvers for a short time in port; and then go forth to meet the fleets of their powerful enemy, with grappling machines to hold them, fearing nothing but the possibility of their escape.|$|R
5000|$|The miser of {{the title}} is called Harpagon, a name adapted from the Latin harpago, meaning a hook or <b>grappling</b> <b>iron.</b> He is obsessed with the wealth he has amassed and always ready to save expenses.

The play also makes fun of certain theatrical conventions, such as the spoken aside addressed to the audience, hitherto ignored by the characters onstage.

The Windsor Castle′s crew mustered with pikes and repelled the boarders, killing or wounding between eight and ten of the French.

Trumpets blared and drums beat on the poop, and the Spaniards in morion and corselet, armed with calivers and pikes, stood to defend their lives and liberty. The gunners sprang to the culverins. But fire had to be kindled and linstocks ignited, and in the {{confusion}} much time was lost--so much that not a single cannon shot was fired before the <b>grappling</b> <b>irons</b> of the first galley clanked upon and gripped the Spaniard's bulwarks. The shock of the impact was terrific. The armoured prow of the Muslim galley--Asad-ed-Din's own--smote the Spaniard a slanting blow amidships that smashed fifteen of the oars {{as if they had been}} so many withered twigs.|$|R

Centurion was prepared for any such engagement, having prepared their close quarters in readiness. However, there were only 48 men and boys fit for duty. As the Spanish galleys bore up, the Centurion discharged her ordnance. The other merchant vessels initially lay out of danger, while five of the galleys laid on board the Centurion, which they made themselves fast with their <b>grappling</b> <b>irons,</b> two to a side with a fifth galley on the stern. On both sides of the ship the Spanish were repelled; the ropes and grapples were cut successively and fire was maintained to cripple the Spanish ships. The Centurion was set ablaze several times, but was extinguished each time with little damage.|$|R

On both sides the sails were let down, for none had any thought of flight. Some rushed to the oars and got enough of them out to work the ships. Others ran to the <b>grappling</b> <b>irons,</b> and the rest began to shoot with their bows. Before one could count two hundred from the time of sighting, the war cry of [...] "Valhalla! Valhalla!

50|$|Ramming {{itself was}} done by smashing into the rear or side of an enemy ship, {{punching}} {{a hole in the}} planking. This did not actually sink an ancient galley unless it was heavily laden with cargo and stores. With a normal load, it was buoyant enough to float even with a breached hull. It could also maneuver for some time as long as the oarsmen were not incapacitated, but would gradually lose mobility and become unstable as it flooded. The winning side would then attempt to tow away the swamped hulks as prizes. Breaking the enemy's oars was another way of rendering ships immobile, rendering them into easier targets. If ramming was not possible or successful, the on-board complement of soldiers would attempt to board and capture the enemy vessel by attaching to it with <b>grappling</b> <b>irons.</b> Accompanied by missile fire, either with bow and arrow or javelins. Trying to set the enemy ship on fire by hurling incendiary missiles or by pouring the content of fire pots attached to long handles is thought to have been used, especially since smoke below decks would easily disable rowers.|$|R

According to Witts's testimony, he had met Rushbrook in the Engineers' Inn at 8:30 the previous evening, where he had bought her a drink. The two had left the pub separately, but had met again at another pub where he bought her another drink, and at around 11 pm she [...] "made a suggestion" [...] to which he agreed. Rushbrook led him to Pottery Bridge, a drawbridge separating North Dock from a canal. While crossing the narrow bridge Rushbrook caught her foot on a beam, and fell into the lock below. Although Witts tried to catch her he failed to do so, only managing to grab her shawl. Witts, still holding Rushbrook's shawl, approached a police officer in the High Street and informed him of what had happened, and soon afterwards police arrived at the scene with <b>grappling</b> <b>irons.</b> The water level in the lock was lowered, and at 3 am Rushbrook's body was recovered.
