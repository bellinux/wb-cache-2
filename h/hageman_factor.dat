25|$|The contact {{activation}} pathway {{begins with}} {{formation of the}} primary complex on collagen by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein, and FXII (<b>Hageman</b> <b>factor).</b> Prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the tenase complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor role that the contact activation pathway has in initiating clot formation can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} patients with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and prekallikrein do not have a bleeding disorder.

50|$|<b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1955 when a routine preoperative blood {{sample of the}} 37-year-old railroad brakeman John Hageman (1918) {{was found to have}} prolonged clotting time in test tubes, even though he had no hemorrhagic symptoms. Hageman was then examined by hematologist Oscar Ratnoff, who found that Hageman lacked a previously unidentified clotting factor. Ratnoff later found that the <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, after examining several related people who had the deficiency. Paradoxically, pulmonary embolism contributed to Hageman's death after an occupational accident. Since then, case studies and clinical studies identified an association between thrombosis and Factor XII deficiency. Hepatocytes express blood coagulation factor XII.|$|E
5000|$|Coagulation factor XII, {{also known}} as <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> is a plasma protein. It is the zymogen form of factor XIIa, an enzyme (...) of the serine {{protease}} (or serine endopeptidase) class. In humans, factor XII is encoded by the F12 gene.|$|E
50|$|While in Cleveland in 1954, Ratnoff {{encountered}} a young patient, railway worker John Hageman. The {{man had a}} long clotting time, but he had undergone successful surgery in the past without suffering from major bleeding. Working with biochemist Earl Davie, Ratnoff identified a protein missing in the man's blood. Ratnoff named the missing substance Hageman trait or <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> As other clotting factors had been discovered {{by the time of}} Ratnoff's encounter with his patient, <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> became known as factor XII. In 1964, Ratnoff and Davie published their model of the clotting cascade; a similar cascade was independently reported by Robert Gwyn Macfarlane of the University of Oxford at around the same time.|$|E
50|$|Prekallikrein (PK), {{also known}} as Fletcher factor, is an 85,000 Mr serine {{protease}} that complexes with high-molecular-weight kininogen. PK is the precursor of plasma kallikrein, which is a serine protease that activates kinins. PK is cleaved to produce kallikrein by activated Factor XII (<b>Hageman</b> <b>factor).</b>|$|E
50|$|Purpura {{is common}} with typhus {{and can be}} present with {{meningitis}} caused by meningococci or septicaemia. In particular, meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis), a Gram-negative diplococcus organism, releases endotoxin when it lyses. Endotoxin activates the <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (clotting factor XII), which causes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The DIC is what appears as a rash on the affected individual.|$|E
50|$|Factor XII {{deficiency}} (also <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> deficiency) is {{a deficiency}} {{in the production}} of factor XII (FXII), an plasma glycoprotein that as a clotting factor participates in the coagulation cascade and activates factor XI.

After a postdoctoral fellowship with Fritz Lipmann at Harvard Medical School, Davie worked at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine from 1957 to 1962, where he met hematologist Oscar Ratnoff, the discoverer of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (later known as factor XII).

50|$|The {{irreducible}} complexity argument {{assumes that}} the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary, and therefore {{could not have been}} added sequentially. However, in evolution, something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary. Natural selection can lead to complex biochemical systems being built up from simpler systems, or to existing functional systems being recombined as a new system with a different function. For example, one of the clotting factors that Behe listed {{as a part of the}} clotting cascade (Factor XII, also called <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor)</b> was later found to be absent in whales, demonstrating that it is not essential for a clotting system. Many purportedly irreducible structures can be found in other organisms as much simpler systems that utilize fewer parts. These systems, in turn, may have had even simpler precursors that are now extinct. Behe has responded to critics of his clotting cascade arguments by suggesting that homology is evidence for evolution, but not for natural selection.|$|E
40|$|Proteolytic {{cleavage}} and {{activation of}} isolated, single chain, zymogen <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> {{was observed in}} the presence of kaolin alone. The rate of cleavage of kaolin-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was enhanced 50 -fold by the presence of prekallikrein and high molecular weight kininogen. The two-chain 82, 000 dalton form of activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (α-HF(a)) also cleaved kaolin- bound single-chain <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in a dose-dependent manner, yielding fragments of 28, 000 and, 50, 000 dahons under reducing conditions. Cleavage of kaolin-bound single-chain <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was not inhibited by preincubation with diisopropylfluorophosphate (12 mM) for 10 min, but long-term incubation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> with diisopropylfluorophosphate (up to 48 h) resulted in inhibition of cleavage of kaolin-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> to an extent proportional to the inhibition of procoagulant <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> activity. <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> cleavage was maximal when the kaolin concentration was {approximately} 10 -fold greater than the <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> concentration (wt:wt), and was partially inhibited by high molecular weight kininogen. Kaolin-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> cleaved clotting factor XI in an amount which correlated with the extent of cleavage of the <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> These findings are compatible with the concept that single-chain <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and α- HF(a), are both capable of cleaving and activating kaolin-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and that a close molecular association of kaolin-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> molecules is required for this reaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> {{is required for}} the initiation of three biologically active protein sequences in human plasma.

A third substrate of activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> or <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> fragments, designated the plasminogen proactivator, has been separated from pre-PTA and from prekallikrein and isolated free of detectable contanainants.

40|$|The {{activation}} {{and function}} of surface-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in human plasma are dependent upon both high molecular weight (HMW) kininogen and prekallikrein. HMW kininogen {{does not affect the}} binding of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> to surfaces, but it enhances the function of surface-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> as assessed by its ability to activate prekallikrein and Factor XI. The initial conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein by the surface-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in the presence of HMW kininogen is followed by a rapid enzymatic activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by kallikrein. The latter interaction is also facilitated by HMW kininogen. Kallikrein therefore functions as an activator of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by a positive feedback mechanism and generates most of the activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> during brief exposure of plasma to activating surfaces. HMW kininogen is a cofactor in the enzymatic activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by kallikrein and it also augments the function of the activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> generated. The stoichiometry of the Hagman factor interaction with HMW kininogen suggests that it enhances the activity of the active site of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> Since HMW kininogen and prekallikrein circulate as a complex, HMW kininogen may also place the prekallikrein in an optimal position for its reciprocal interaction with <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> to proceed. The surface appears to play a passive role upon which bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and the prekallikrein-HMW kininogen complex can interact...|$|E

40|$|Activation of {{plasminogen}} through surface-mediated reactions is well recognized. In {{the presence}} of kaolin, purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (Factor XII) changed plasminogen to plasmin, as assayed upon a synthetic amide substrate and by fibrinolysis. Kinetic studies suggested an enzymatic action of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> upon its substrate, plasminogen. <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> fragments, at a protein concentration equivalent to whole <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> activated plasminogen to a lesser extent. These protein preparations were not contaminated with other agents implicated in surface-mediated fibrinolysis. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate treatment of plasminogen did not inhibit its activation by <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> These studies indicate that <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> has a hitherto unsuspected function, the direct activation of plasminogen...|$|E
40|$|Activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (Factor XII) upon {{exposure}} to negatively charged agents has {{been attributed to}} proteolytic cleavage of this molecule. To examine this question, purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was exposed to Sephadex gels to which ellagic acid had been adsorbed. Such <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> separated from the gels and studied in the fluid phase, was amidolytic. Nonetheless, no cleavage of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> treated in this way could be demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

40|$|Rabbit <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was proteolytically cleaved and {{activated}} by a homogenate prepared from cultured rabbit endothelial cells. Cleavage of radiolabeled <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was monitored by {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate. Endothelial cell-mediated cleavage of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was demonstrated both in a purified system and in plasma, was time and concentration dependent, and was associated with formation of the characteristic 28, 000 Mr form of active <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> The rate of cleavage of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was not affected by Triton X- 100 (Rohm and Haas, Co., Philadelphia, Pa.), hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene, Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.), hirudin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or antisera to plasminogen or prekallikrein. However, cleavage was enhanced by kaolin, and was inhibited by diisopropyl-fluorophosphate. The enzyme responsible for cleavage of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was localized to the 100, 000 -g-sedimentable, subcellular fraction of the endothelial cell homogenate and was relatively specific, because neither radiolabeled rabbit Factor XI nor rabbit prekallikrein were themselves proteolytically cleaved by the endothelial cell homogenate. However, when these molecules were incubated with the homogenate in the presence of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> both Factor XI and prekallikrein were cleaved, demonstrating that <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> had been {{activated by}} the endothelial cell homogenate. Furthermore, the kallikrein generated by endothelial cell homogenate-activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was capable of liberating kinin from high molecular weight kininogen as measured by bioassay. Cultured rabbit endothelial cells, therefore, possess the capacity to activate <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by proteolysis. This may be one mechanism for <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> activation in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> {{high molecular weight}} kininogen (HMWK), and prekallikrein were studied in patients who had chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Serum HMWK and prekallikrein activities were decreased in chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, but <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> activity was low in cirrhosis only. The reduction of prekallikrein, HMWK, and <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was dependent {{on the degree of}} liver failure. Similar prekallikrein values were found in serum samples, activated or not, with an excess of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and HMWK, which suggests that the decrease of prekallikrein in liver disease is not influenced by the simultaneous decrease of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and HMWK...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which human high molecular weight kininogen (HMKrK) contributes to the surface-dependent activation of the <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> systems have been studied. The ability of various mixtures of purified human <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (coagulation factor XII), HMrK, prekallikrein, and kaolin to activate coagulation factor XI was determined with factor XIa (activated factor XI) clotting assays. <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> HMrK and prekallikrein were required for maximal rates of activation of factor XI. A certain optimal mixture of purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> HMrK, prekallikrein, and kaolin gave the same rapid initial rate of activation of purified factor XI as an equivalent aliquot of factor XI-deficient plasma. This suggests that potent, surface-mediated activation of factor XI in plasma is explicable in terms of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> HMrK, and prekallikrein. By studying separately some of the surface-dependent reactions involving <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> {{it was found that}} HMrK accelerated by at least an order of magnitude the following reactions: (i) the activation of factor XI by activated Hageman factor; (ii) the activation of prekallikrein by activated Hageman factor; and (iii) the activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by kallikrein. Stoichiometric rather than catalytic amounts of HMrK gave optimal activation of factor XI. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HMrK and <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> form a complex on kaolin which renders <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> more susceptible to proteolytic activation by kallikrein and which facilitates the action of activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> on its substrate proteins, factor XI and prekallikrein...|$|E

The permeability activity of both factors was also absorbed on anti-Hageman factor F(ab') 2 -Sepharose beads. The latent form of the permeability factor derived from skin extracts produced a single immunoprecipitation line with anti-Hageman factor and gave a reaction of identity with a precipitation band developing between purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and anti-Hageman factor. The latent permeability factor in the fraction corrected the clotting activity of Hageman-factor-deficient human plasma. The clotting activity was also blocked by anti-Hageman factor F(ab') 2 antibody.

Sephadex-ellagic acid-exposed <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> whether purified or in plasma, activated plasma thromboplastin antecedent, but only when high molecular weight kininogen was presnet. In the absence of plasma prekallikrein, maximal activation of plasma thromboplastin antecedent was slightly delayed in plasma, a delay not observed with similarly treated purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> Thus, high molecular weight kininogen was needed for expression of Hageman factor's clot-promoting properties and plasma prekallikrein played a minor role in the interaction of ellagic acid-treated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> and plasma thromboplastin antecedent...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which negatively charged substances such as celite, kaolin, or ellagic acid contribute to the surface-dependent activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (Factor XII) was studied. Kinetic studies of the proteolytic activation of 125 I-labeled human <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by human plasma kallikrein, plasma, activated Factor XI, and trypsin were performed in the presence and absence of high molecular weight kininogen and surface materials such as celite, kaolin, or ellagic acid. The results showed that surface-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was 500 times more susceptible than soluble <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> to proteolytic activation by kallikrein {{in the presence of}} high molecular weight kininogen. Surface binding of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> enhanced its cleavage by plasmin, activated Factor XI, and trypsin by 100 -fold, 30 -fold, and 5 -fold, respectively. On a molar basis, trypsin was twice as potent as kallikrein in the cleavage of the surface-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> while plasmin and activated Factor XI were an order of magnitude less potent than kallikrein. Kallikrein even at concentrations as low as 0. 5 nM (i. e., 1 / 1000 th of the concentration of prekallikrein in plasma) was very potent in the limited proteolysis of the surface-bound <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> These results suggest that substances classically known as “activating surfaces” promote the activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> indirectly by altering its structure such that it is much more susceptible to proteolytic activation by other plasma or cellular proteases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was {{purified}} from {{guinea pig}} plasma by successive column chromatography. The guinea pig <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> appeared homogeneous as a single-chain protein on polyacrylamide gels {{in the presence}} of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and beta-mercaptoethanol. The apparent molecular weight was 76, 000 daltons by SDS [...] polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 105, 000 daltons by gel filtration with a Sephadex G- 150 column. Amino acid composition of the guinea pig <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was similar to that reported for human, bovine, and rabbit Hageman factors. The purified guinea pig <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> as well as guinea pig plasma, showed strong clotting time correction activity in Hageman-factor [...] deficient human plasma. The activity could be blocked by the IgG fraction of antiserums against guinea pig <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> raised in rabbits or a goat. The concentration of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in guinea pig plasma was determined to be 120 microgram/ml by quantitative radial immunodiffusion assay. The 28, 000 -dalton active form of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (beta-HFa) was prepared from guinea pig <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by treatment with plasma kallikrein. beta-HFa caused an increase in vascular permeability when injected into guinea pig skin at concentrations as low as 3 x 10 (- 10) M (0. 8 ng). Native, or zymogen <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> did not cause an increase in permeability at concentrations of up to 2 x 10 (- 7) M. The increased permeability induced by beta-HFa was short lasting, with about a 50 % decrease in activity apparent within 6 minutes after intradermal injection. The permeability enhancement activity of beta-HFa was inhibited by pretreatment of beta-HFa with diisopropylfluorophosphate. It may be concluded that active <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in the interstitial space of guinea pigs acts as a vascular permeability factor of far greater potency than bradykinin...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in solid and fluid phase has been analyzed. Activation of highly purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> occurred after it interacted with and became bound to a negatively charged surface. Activation {{was observed in}} the absence of enzymes that are inhibitable with diisopropylfluorophosphate, phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride and ε-amino-n-caproic acid. The binding of [125 I]Hageman factor to the negatively charged surface was markedly inhibited by plasma or purified plasma proteins. Activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> in solution (fluid phase) was obtained with kallikrein, plasmin, and Factor XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent). Kallikrein was greater than 10 times more active in its ability to activate <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> than plasmin and Factor XI. The data offer a plausible explanation for the finding that highly purified kallikrein promotes clotting of normal plasma. In addition, the combined results of this and previously reported data from this laboratory indicate that the reciprocal {{activation of}} <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by kallikrein in fluid phase is essential for normal rate of activation of the intrinsic-clotting, kinin-forming, and fibrinolytic systems. Activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> was associated with three different structural changes in the molecule: (a) Purified <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> activated on negatively charged surfaces retained its native mol wt of 80 – 90, 000. Presumably a conformational change accompanied activation. (b) In fluid phase, activation with kallikrein and plasmin did not result in cleavage of large fragments of rabbit <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> although the activation required hydrolytic capacity of the enzymes. (c) Activation of human <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> with kallikrein or plasmin was associated with cleavage of the molecule to 52, 000, 40, 000, and 28, 000 mol wt fragments. Activation of rabbit <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> with trypsin resulted in cleavage of the molecule into three fragments, each of 30, 000 mol wt as noted previously. This major cleavage occurred simultaneously with activation...|$|E
40|$|Passively {{sensitized}} {{human lung}} fragments {{were shown to}} release a protease by an IgE-dependent mechanism which can cleave human <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (Coagulation Factor XII). This enzyme, lung <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> cleaving factor, was partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration and was {{shown to be a}} serine protease with an apparent molecular weight of 12, 000 - 13, 000. This protease appears to be unrelated to any known activator of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> by molecular weight and inhibition profile and was shown to be distinct from an IgE-dependent prekallikrein activator, as well as the kininogenase activity defined as basophil kallikrein of anaphylaxis. Although it appears marginally capable of activating <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> it rapidly cleaves and inactivates the activated form so that the net effect is a loss of activatable <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor.</b> The result suggests that diminished levels of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> that may be seen associated with IgE-dependent reactions can be due to digestion and depletion rather than activation, and other criteria for activation of the contact system must be employed...|$|E
40|$|Human {{umbilical}} vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) {{produce a}} property that impairs {{the generation of}} coagulant and amidolytic activity initiated when normal human plasma is exposed to glass. This inhibitory property blocks the adsorption of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (factor XII) to glass, thereby preventing the activation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor,</b> but does not impair the coagulant or amidolytic activity of already activated <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> (factor XIIa). This property in HUVEC lysates could be neutralized by a purified preparation of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> but not by purified prekallikrein or high molecular mass kininogen. A partially purified inhibitory fraction from cell lysates exhibited a single homogeneous band in SDS/PAGE of approximately 22. 5 kDa. Inhibitory activity was also found in concentrates of conditioned media from HUVECs, which also impaired the binding of <b>Hageman</b> <b>factor</b> to a surface; {{it may not be}} identical with that found in cell lysates...|$|E
