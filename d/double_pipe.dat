5|$|In the 18th century, the {{corridor}} {{of what is}} now MD194 was the HanoverFrederick portion of the Monocacy Road, a migration route that connected Philadelphia and Winchester, Virginia via York, Frederick, Boonsboro, and Williamsport. The Frederick County portion of the highway later became the path of a pair of turnpikes. The Woodsboro and <b>Double</b> <b>Pipe</b> Creek Turnpike connected the namesake town and creek; the Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike extended from Woodsboro south to the junction with the Liberty and Frederick Turnpike in Ceresville. The two turnpikes issuing from Ceresville were connected to Frederick by the Frederick and Woodsboro Turnpike. The Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike was the last privately maintained toll road in Maryland when it was purchased by the Maryland State Roads Commission, the predecessor to the Maryland State Highway Administration, in 1921.|$|E
5|$|MD194 {{parallels}} the Maryland Midland Railway's northsouth line, Israel Creek, and Laurel Hill north to Woodsboro. At {{the south end}} of the town, Main Street, which is unsigned MD194A, continues straight north while MD194 veers northeast to bypass the town. The state highway starts to run concurrently with MD550 at Woodsboro Road, which heads east as MD550 toward Libertytown. On the north side of town, MD550 heads west as Woodsboro Creagerstown Road, which meets the northern end of Main Street before heading northwest toward Creagerstown and Thurmont. MD194 veers northeast and has a grade crossing with the railroad track at New Midway, where the highway intersects Legore Road, which leads to the LeGore Bridge. The state highway passes through the village of Ladiesburg before crossing Little Pipe Creek, one of the tributaries of <b>Double</b> <b>Pipe</b> Creek, into Carroll County.|$|E

6000|$|In all {{the loveliest}} {{representations}} in central Greek {{art of the}} birth of Athena, Apollo stands close to the sitting Jupiter, singing, with a deep, quiet joyfulness, to his lyre. The sun is always thought of as the master of time and rhythm, and as the origin of the composing and inventive discovery of melody; but the air, as the actual element and substance of the voice, the prolonging and sustaining power of it, and the symbol of its moral passion. Whatever in music is measured and designed belongs therefore to Apollo and the Muses; whatever is impulsive and passionate, to Athena; hence her constant strength a voice or cry (as when she aids the shout of Achilles) curiously opposed to the dumbness of Demeter. The Apolline lyre, therefore, {{is not so much the}} instrument producing sound, as its measurer and divider by length or tension of string into given notes; and I believe it is, in a double connection with its office as a measurer of time or motion and its relation to the transit of the sun in the sky, that Hermes forms it from the tortoise-shell, which is the image of the dappled concave of the cloudy sky. Thenceforward all the limiting or restraining modes of music belong to the Muses; but the more passionate music is wind music, as in the Doric flute. Then, when this inspired music becomes degraded in its passion, it sinks into the pipe of Pan, and the <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> of Marsyas, and is then rejected by Athena. The myth which represents her doing so is that she invented the <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> from hearing the hiss of the Gorgonian serpents; but when she played upon it, chancing to see her face reflected in water, she saw that it was distorted, whereupon she threw down the flute which Marsyas found. Then, the strife of Apollo and Marsyas represents the enduring contest between music in which the words and thought lead, and the lyre measures or melodizes them (which Pindar means when he calls his hymns [...] "kings over the lyre"), and music in which the words are lost and the wind or impulse leads,--generally, therefore, between intellectual, and brutal, or meaningless, music. Therefore, when Apollo prevails, he flays Marsyas, taking the limit and external bond of his shape from him, which is death, without touching the mere muscular strength, yet shameful and dreadful in dissolution.|$|E

Firstly, the heat losses {{are found to be}} nearly independent of the mass flow rate in the range of mass flow rates usually encountered in thermal network pipes. The remaining heat loss calculation is simply based on temperature levels and thermal resistance factors, determined by the pipe dimensions and materials. Furthermore, it is found that heat losses from supply to return side should be incorporated in the analysis for better accuracy of the results, even more so with the increasing popularity of twin pipes with common insulation. status: publishe...|$|R
