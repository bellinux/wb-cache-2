40|$|The paper {{describes}} the knowledge about and {{results of the}} experimental heats performed in an <b>electric</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plant.</b> The aim was to verify the possibilities of a controlled desulphurization of alloy steel in a VOD (Vacuum Oxygen Decarburization) device, particularly when using chemical heating through the OVD process (Oxygen Vacuum Deoxidation/Degassing), {{as well as the}} standard slag formers. Experimental procedures were used in the production of alloy tool steel. Both, the system of making the reducing slag and optimizing the composition of individual oxides in order to achieve the desired basicity, are complicated by the products of the chemical heating. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a new production technology that would eliminate such oxide products of chemical heating and, thus, the maximum degree of desulphurization could be achieved. The main principle of the technology is to create appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic conditions required for desulphurization. In particular, this concerns a low oxygen activity in the steel, the composition of refining slag, and an intense bath stirring with argon. Web of Science 47114013...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the results of the {{experimental}} heats performed in the <b>electric</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> of TŘINECKÉ ŽELEZÁRNY, a. s. (TŽ, a. s.). The aim was to verify the possibility of deep desulphurization of steel in the basic 10 -t electric arc furnace. Experimental procedures making use of the industrially produced synthetic slag were applied in the production of the high-alloy chrome steels and the middle-alloy tool steels, where the desulphurization, in terms of thermodynamics, is a more demanding process than the chrome-nickel steel desulphurization. With the use of the technological processes it is possible to achieve low contents of sulphur in steel, below mass fraction 0. 003 %. Achieving these contents depends on a suitable slag basicity, and, in particular, on the ratio of CaO/Al 2 O 3. Based on the analysis of the results, a critical factor significantly affecting the final content of the sulphur and thus the efficiency of the desulphurization of steel, the content of FeO in the reduction slag, is carefully considered. A higher MgO content in slag (up to w = 25 %) had no significant influence on the results of the steel desulphurization. Web of Science 46330329...|$|E
40|$|Generally speaking, sulphur is {{considered}} a harmful element for steel quality, reason why all the technological steps are being taken in order to eliminate it from the metal bath. This paper deals with {{the influence of the}} chemical composition, on the slag quantity and of the bath stirring condition upon the desulphurization process in the casting ladle by treatment with synthetic slag. The experiments were made at an open-hearth plant with the steel tapping in two ladles (the desulphurization was made with synthetic slag at one ladle while the other one was considered standard) and at the <b>electric</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> and for the synthetic slag formation a mix was used, made, according to several receipts, of: lime (50 - 75 %), fluorine (0 - 17 %), bauxite (0 - 32 %) and aluminous slag (8 - 22 %). The data were processed in the calculation programs EXCEL and MATLAB, which resulted in a series of correlations between the desulphurization degree and the chemical composition of the slag, respectively the slag quantity both for the charges bubbled with Argon and the unbubbled ones. En general, el azufre es considerado un elemento nocivo para la calidad del acero y, por eso, en la pr&aacute;ctica, se toman todas las medidas de orden tecnol&oacute;gico para su eliminaci&oacute;n del ba&ntilde;o met&aacute;lico. En este trabajo se analiza la influencia de la composici&oacute;n qu&iacute;mica, de la cantidad de escoria y del estado de agitaci&oacute;n del ba&ntilde;o sobre el proceso de desulfuraci&oacute;n en la cuchara para fundir por tratamiento con escoria sint&eacute;tica. Los experimentos se han realizado en una acer&iacute;a evacuando el acero en dos ollas (en una cuchara se efectu&oacute; la desulfuraci&oacute;n con escoria sint&eacute;tica y a la otra se consider&oacute; como patr&oacute;n) y en un acer&iacute;a el&eacute;ctrica y para la formaci&oacute;n de la escoria sint&eacute;tica se utiliz&oacute; una mezcla producida seg&uacute;n muchas recetas, formada por: cal (50 - 75 %), fluorina (0 - 17 %), bauxita (0 - 32 %) y escoria aluminosa (8 - 22 %). Los datos han sido procesados en los programas de c&aacute;lculo EXCEL y MATLAB, resultando una serie de correlaciones entre el grado de desulfuraci&oacute;n y la composici&oacute;n qu&iacute;mica de la escoria, la cantidad de escoria respectivamente, tanto para las cargas burbujeadas con arg&oacute;n como no burbujeadas...|$|E

By the 1950s Templeborough's open hearth furnaces were in need of replacement and the United Steel Companies set about the task of updating its melting facilities.

5000|$|Steel, Peech and Tozer, {{known locally}} as [...] "Steelos" [...] {{was one of the}} largest {{manufacturers}} in the Rotherham area. In 1918 they merged with Samuel Fox and Company, based in Stocksbridge and Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe creating United Steel Companies (USC). The Templeborough steelworks was reputed to be a mile long. At its height in the mid-20th century, the company employed 10,000 people. In the 1950s as Templeborough's open hearth furnaces had become outdated USC set up “Operation SPEAR” (<b>Steel</b> Peech <b>Electric</b> Arc Reorganization), to inroduce six modern electric arc furnaces to replace the 14 open hearth furnaces.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Altered {{patterns}} of gene expression mediate {{the effects of}} particulate matter (PM) on human health, but mechanisms through which PM modifies gene expression are largely undetermined. OBJECTIVES: We aimed at identifying short- and long-term effects of PM exposure on DNA methylation, a major genomic mechanism of gene expression control, in workers in an <b>electric</b> furnace <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> with well-characterized exposure to PM with aerodynamic diameters < 10 microm (PM(10)). METHODS: We measured global genomic DNA methylation content estimated in Alu and long interspersed nuclear element- 1 (LINE- 1) repeated elements, and promoter DNA methylation of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), a gene suppressed by DNA methylation and induced by PM exposure in blood leukocytes. Quantitative DNA methylation analysis was performed through bisulfite PCR pyrosequencing on blood DNA obtained from 63 workers {{on the first day}} of a work week (baseline, after 2 days off work) and after 3 days of work (postexposure). Individual PM(10) exposure was between 73. 4 and 1, 220 microg/m(3). RESULTS: Global methylation content estimated in Alu and LINE- 1 repeated elements did not show changes in postexposure measures compared with baseline. PM(10) exposure levels were negatively associated with methylation in both Alu [beta = - 0. 19 % 5 -methylcytosine (% 5 mC); p = 0. 04] and LINE- 1 [beta = - 0. 34 % 5 mC; p = 0. 04], likely reflecting long-term PM(10) effects. iNOS promoter DNA methylation was significantly lower in postexposure blood samples compared with baseline (difference = - 0. 61 % 5 mC; p = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: We observed changes in global and gene specific methylation that should be further characterized in future investigations on the effects of PM...|$|R
