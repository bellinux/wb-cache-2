5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} casting process for <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th was more {{difficult}} than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. s Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its North American box office gross, <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th earned over $9.5 million in foreign markets on its opening weekend.

According to Paramount, this was the largest opening outside North America {{of any of the}} <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th films. The film finished its North American box office run with $65,002,019; coupled with its earnings of $27,688,218 outside North America, the film has accumulated $92,670,237 worldwide.

5|$|Jason Voorhees is {{the main}} {{character}} from the <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th series. He first appeared in <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th (1980) as the young son of camp cook-turned-murderer Mrs. Voorhees, {{in which he was}} portrayed by Ari Lehman. Created by Victor Miller, with contributions by Ron Kurz, Sean S. Cunningham, and Tom Savini, Jason was not originally intended to carry the series as the main antagonist. The character has subsequently been represented in various other media, including novels, video games, comic books, and a cross-over film with another iconic horror film character, Freddy Krueger.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th novella storyline was not {{connected}} to the Jason X series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character of Jason in its own way. <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th: Hell Lake. In Hate-Kill-Repeat, two religious serial killers attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that {{the three of them}} share the same contempt for those that break the moral code. In The Jason Strain, Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in Carnival of Maniacs.

5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{months after}} the release of Grove's book, Titan Books, in {{association}} with Sparkplug Press, released a detailed history on the <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th series. Peter M.

Bracke spent three years researching the series and collecting more than 200 interviews from the cast and crew of each of the films. Bracke's extensive work for the book prompted Sean S. Cunningham to provide a foreword. Crystal Lake Memories also includes images, storyboards, concept art, and publicity material that had not been released to the public. A private party was held on October 22, 2005 at Universal Studios CityWalk Hollywood for the book's premiere.|$|E

5|$|<b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th was the fifteenth-highest {{grossing}} R-rated film of 2009. Because of {{the significant}} decrease in box office revenues in its second weekend, the film had the sixth-largest second-weekend drop. It is the seventh-largest drop for a film that opened as the top-earning film in the United States. With its $65 million revenue at the North American box office, <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th is the highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, which comprise When a Stranger Calls (2006), Black Christmas (2006), Halloween (2007), Prom Night (2008), and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009).

5|$|In September 2013, Farrands {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a second documentary film on the Friday franchise, this time directly inspired by Bracke's book. Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, {{as well as the}} television series. It is narrated by Corey Feldman, and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested that his work on the well-received 2010 film, , which documented the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, His Name Was Jason. In making such a film, Farrands turned to Bracke's book, which he had also worked on, and drew from its structure and content. Curious Goods: Behind the Scenes of <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th: The Series by Alyse Wax, a retrospective focusing on the 1987 television series, was released in October 2015 by BearManor Media.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th (1980), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) stalks and murders the teenagers preparing Camp Crystal Lake for re‑opening. She {{is determined to}} ensure that the camp does not reopen after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake due to the negligence of two staff members. The last counselor, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King), fends off Mrs. Voorhees long enough to grab a machete and decapitate her. In <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th Part 2 (1981), Jason (Steve Daskewisz/Warrington Gillette) is revealed to be alive and fully grown. After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. During the events of <b>Friday</b> <b>the</b> 13th Part III (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the machete from his shoulder and finds his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.|$|E
