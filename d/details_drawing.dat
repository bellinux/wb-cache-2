40|$|Data {{conferencing}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} commercially successful examples among conferencing applications, because of its effectiveness and relatively modest resource requirements. Existing data conferencing applications are built almost exclusively on IP-based packet switched networks. While they are very effective in improving office communications, their use in the households is still quite limited because data conferencing end-points are mostly personal computers and are thus not particularly friendly to a majority of the population in the world. In contrast, more than 95 % of the population in the United States are quite comfortable with conventional telephones. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an information appliance, called DataPhone that can be used both as a regular phone and a data conferencing device. A DataPhone consists of a touch sensitive screen, a SVD modem and a microcontroller-based single board computer. DataPhone allows two parties to have a regular voice communications channel, as well as a shared whiteboard for sketching and for document sharing. Typical applications of DataPhone include annotating an engineering design while discussing its technical <b>details,</b> <b>drawing</b> a map to a person's house for a friend, and scribbling random information down for future reference. One of the key design decisions of DataPhone is that it runs directly on PSTN, and does not required any additional infrastructural support, such as ISP subscription, domain name service, routing gateway, etc., thus avoiding their associated configuration headaches. We have successfully built a fully functional DataPhone prototype and evaluated its usefulness through end user testing. Initial responses are both favorable and encouraging...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{durability}} assessment for design {{and analysis of}} two plate mold insert for dog bone specimen using selected sample. The objective of this thesis is to design two plate mold insert and analyze the material flow of the selected product. The thesis describes the material flow analysis to analyzed the material flow in the part and identify the best gate locations of the components. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) materials were studied in this thesis as sample of material and {{it is commonly used}} in industry and lab. The structural three-dimensional solid modelling of two plate mold was developed using the computer-aided drawing software. The strategy of analysis model was developed. The material flow and gate location analysis was then performed using Moldflow Plastic Insight software. The analysis model of the components was analyzed using the two cavities with cold runner design. Finally, the orientation skin for 21 number of different gate location is analyzed. From the results, it is observed that the analysis using Moldflow material flow analysis show the different orientation skin for different gate locations. The gate locations is constrain at the middle of the part where the area that would be test for the specimen. The orientation skin at the both sides of the part is same but only change the length of runner. The increase of length of runner will increase the projected area, the clamping force, filling time and the material waste. So that, the best locations of gate is at the nearest or as short as it can for runner length to be design. But, the first priority is the orientation skin for the material flow. The orientation skin should be same at the middle of part which is parallel to the strength that would be applied on testing. The final design was done in solid modelling and <b>details</b> <b>drawing</b> using SolidWorks software. The results can also significantly reduce the cost and time to fabricate the insert.

DIDACTIC PANEL READS: MY FATHER During the “One Hundred Flowers Blooming” movement in 1957 in China, my father talked about his ideas for China like many Chinese did. He believed everyone could help the government and build a new country. But it was a trap, like millions of others her was called “right-wing”, which meant the enemy. The government took him away from his family and beat him and forced him to renounce his ideas. Later on he was sent to build a railway for five years. After that he was sent to a coal factory far away from my hometown. I was four years old, my sister was seven years old and my younger brother was thee years old. Our family was destroyed. Several times my father tried to commit suicide but he always stopped himself, because {{he did not want to}} die without knowing what had happened to my mother and his children. Six years later, my father was allowed to come back to see is once a year for twelve days. After thirty years of separation he returned and finally came home...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the contested practices of union solidarity with undocumented migrant workers in Germany. Unionists part ways {{when it comes to}} the practical meaning of solidarity with workers who lack work permits. To some union members, undocumented migrant workers ought to be included in the bonds of union solidarity by virtue of being workers. To others, undocumented migrant workers are primarily illegal and unfair competitors undermining existing practices and institutions of solidarity. Since 2008, six union centres for undocumented migrant workers called MigrAr (German Migration & Arbeit, English migration & labour) have been established by labour activists. Their institutionalization under the umbrella of German unions continues to arouse controversies among their members. This research builds on an activist ethnography following the Extended Case Method. The researcher is positioned as an activist in the MigrAr centre in Berlin. In a critical encounter with Jrgen Habermas's work, the research charts the significance of instrumental and normative rationalities in union controversies around undocumented labour, since it became a topic two decades ago. The fieldwork shows that activists engagement for expanding union solidarity cannot be properly understood in relation to Habermass account of instrumental and normative rationality alone. The dissertation, moreover, contests Habermas's dismissal of material reproduction, especially in relation to work and citizenship, as significant for the development of solidarity. Contrary to Habermas's premise of symmetrical reciprocity in his notion of solidarity, this research demonstrates that activists understand their own practice as being premised on conditions of asymmetry. Differences pertain among activists, as to whether this requires holding on to established labour standards and union procedures, or whether specific measures are required to practice union solidarity under the condition of undocumented workers legal, economic, and social vulnerabilities. Affirming the latter approach, activists in the Berlin centre encounter multiple obstacles to implement it in union organizations as the ethnography <b>details.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on participant observations and interviews, I argue that the activist practice of solidarity is motivated by what I call political imagination; the ability to imagine activist practices as a contribution towards realizing an alternative form of union solidarity...|$|E
