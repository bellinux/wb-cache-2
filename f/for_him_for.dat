5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E
