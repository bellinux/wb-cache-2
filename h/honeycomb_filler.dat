40|$|Petroleum pitch carbon {{microspheres}} {{were prepared}} by flash heating emulsified pitch and carbonizing the resulting microspheres in an inert atmosphere. Microsphere composites {{were obtained from}} a mixture of microspheres and tetraester precursor pyrrone powder. Scanning electron micrographs of the composite showed {{that it was an}} aggregate of microspheres bonded together by the pyrrone at the sphere contact points, with voids in and among the microspheres. Physical, thermal, and sorption properties of the composite are described. Composite applications could include use as a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>filler</b> in elevated-temperature load-bearing sandwich boards or in patient-treatment tables for radiation treatment of tumors...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} investigations {{on a number}} of various phase change materials (PCMs) and PCMs in combination with metals and other materials are reported. The evaluations include the following PCM system performance characteristics: PCM and PCM/filler thermal diffusivities, the effects of long-term thermal cycling, PCM-container compatibility, and catalyst effectiveness and stability. Three PCMs demonstrated performance acceptable enough to be considered for use in prototype aluminum thermal control devices. These three PCMs are lithium nitrate trihydrate with zinc hydroxy nitrate catalyst, acetamide, and myristic acid. Of the fillers tested, aluminum <b>honeycomb</b> <b>filler</b> was found to offer the most increase in system thermal diffusivity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAsymptotic {{homogenization}} {{models for}} smart composite plates with periodically arranged embedded actuators and rapidly varying thickness are derived. The formulated models enable {{the determination of}} both local fields and effective elastic, actuation, thermal expansion, and hygroscopic expansion coefficients from three-dimensional local unit cell problems. The actuation coefficients, for example piezoelectric or magnetostrictive, characterize the intrinsic transducer nature of active smart materials {{that can be used}} to induce strains and stresses in a coordinated fashion. The theory is illustrated by means of examples pertaining to thin smart composite plates of uniform thickness, riband waferreinforced smart composite structures, and sandwich smart composite plates with <b>honeycomb</b> <b>filler...</b>|$|E
40|$|Parabolic three-layered reflectors from polymer {{composite}} materials with the aluminium <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fillers</b> became {{widely used in}} space communication systems in the past decades. There are technological possibilities for creating reflectors {{in the form of}} thin-walled ribbed shell with the lower linear density than that of the three-layered structures.

40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} the {{mathematical}} models for forecasting and failure of the honeycomb panel skin at low-speed shock and to evaluate the residual strength. The designed models permitting to forecast the behaviour of the honeycomb panels with thin composite skins at shock have been developed {{by means of the}} posible movements. The procedure on the substitution of the real defect in the panel for the equivalent concentrator and procedure for determination of its dimension for evaluation of the residual strength in the skin at extension have been proposed. The panels with <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fillers</b> of the glass-honeycombed plastic, polymer-honeycombed plastic and aluminium foil and skins of the organic- and carbon plastics and hybrides on their base have been investigated.

40|$|The {{experimental}} and numerical quasi-static crushing behaviors of Nomex TM honeycomb-filled thin-walled Al tubes were investigated. The <b>honeycomb</b> <b>filler</b> was modeled using a unit cell model. The numerical model and experimental results have shown that, 6. 4 mm and 4. 8 mm cell size honeycomb filling {{had no effect}} on the deformation mode (diamond); however 3. 2 mm cell size honeycomb filling changed the deformation mode to mixed/concertina. Honeycomb filling was also shown to increase the specific energy absorption of filled tubes over that of Al tube. The specific energy absorption of honeycomb filling was further compared with those of tube wall thickening and Al closed cell foam filling. ...|$|E
40|$|Some {{properties}} and applications of a pitch carbon microsphere composite are described. The small hollow microspheres {{are made from}} the pitch which is usually a wasted by-product of petroleum refining. In contrast to high density composites or syntactic foams in which microspheres are inclusions within a continuous matrix, this composite is an aggregate of microspheres bonded together by {{a small amount of}} thermosetting polymer which does not form a continuous matrix. The result is a composite with low density and thermal expansion, modest strength and rigidity, and high porosity and carbon content. Mechanical, thermal, and sorption properties have been measured. Applications of the composite include <b>honeycomb</b> <b>filler</b> for high temperature or ionizing radiation fields and a wicking absorber for solar-powered stills...|$|E

Initially, most of the effort was devoted to preparing Pyrrone prepolymers with improved and more reproducible foaming properties for making chemically blown foams.

40|$|Spacecraft {{optoelectronic}} modules {{traditionally have}} aluminum alloy or titanium alloy casing which substantial weight increases fuel consumption required {{to put them}} into orbit and, consequently, {{total cost of the}} project. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer based composite constructive materials is an efficient solution that allows reducing weight and dimensions of large optoelectronic modules 1, 5 – 3 times and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion 15 – 20 times if compared with metals. Optical characteristic is a crucial feature of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer that determines composite material interaction with electromagnetic emission within the optical range. This work was intended to develop a method to evaluate Carbon fiber reinforced polymer optoelectronic modules casing effect on lens scattering by computer simulation with Zemax application software package. Degrees of scattered, reflected and absorbed radiant flux effect on imaging quality are described here. The work included experimental study in order to determine bidirectional reflectance distribution function by goniometric method for LUP- 0. 1 carbon fabric check test pieces of EDT- 69 U epoxy binder with EPOFLEX- 0. 4 glue layer and 5056 - 3. 5 - 23 -A aluminium <b>honeycomb</b> <b>filler.</b> The scattered emission was registered within a hemisphere above the check test piece surface.
