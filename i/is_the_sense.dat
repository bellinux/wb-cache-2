5|$|Kumara Vyasa wrote Gadugina Bharata in 1430 in the Vyasa tradition. The {{title of}} the work is a {{reference}} to Gadagu (modern Gadag), where the author lived. The writing is based on the first ten chapters of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and is also alternatively titled Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari or Kumaravyasa Bharata. It is a dedication to the deity of Gadag and emphasises the divinity and grace of the Hindu god Krishna. Unlike Pampa, who adhered to a strictly Jain interpretation of the epic in his Vikramarjuna Vijaya (941), eulogising Pandava Arjuna as the hero, making Draupadi solely Arjuna's wife and casting the Kaurava prince Duryodhana and his loyal companion Karna as lofty individuals, Kumara Vyasa portrays all characters with the exception of Krishna as deeply human with foibles. His depiction of the secondary characters, such as the cunning Keechaka and the coward Uttara Kumara, is also noteworthy. An interesting aspect of the work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of humour exhibited by the poet and his hero, Krishna. This work marks the transition in Kannada literature from old to modern. Particularly known for his use of sophisticated metaphors, Kumara Vyasa earned the title Rupaka Samrajya Chakravarti ("Emperor of the land of Metaphors"). The remaining chapters of the epic were translated by Timmanna Kavi (1510) of the court of King Krishnadevaraya. The poet named his work Krishnaraya Bharata after his patron king. Airavata (1430) by Kumara Vyasa recounts an episode from the Mahabharata and is a story of the elephant ridden by god Indra.|$|E

25|$|Hearing or {{audition}} (adjectival form: auditory) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> {{of sound}} perception. Hearing {{is all about}} vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which {{are located in the}} inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the inner ear, which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000hertz, with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called deafness or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as vibrations conducted through the body by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.|$|E

25|$|Balance, equilibrioception, or {{vestibular}} sense <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> {{that allows}} an organism to sense body movement, direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance. The organ of equilibrioception is the vestibular labyrinthine system found {{in both of}} the inner ears.

25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when they get to the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

25|$|A {{black bear}} has better {{eyesight}} {{and a better}} sense of hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies, and hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time of the day or night although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Their social behavior is somewhat similar to that of canids.|$|E

500|$|The term Government of Singapore {{can have}} a number of {{different}} meanings. At its widest, it can refer collectively to the three traditional branches of government – the Executive branch, Legislative branch (the President and Parliament of Singapore) and Judicial branch (the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts of Singapore). The term is also used colloquially to mean the Executive and Legislature together, as these are the branches of government responsible for day-to-day governance of the nation and lawmaking. At its narrowest, the term is used to refer to the Members of Parliament (MPs) belonging to a particular political party (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in Parliament sufficient to enable the party (or coalition) to form the Cabinet of Singapore – this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> intended when it is said that a political party [...] "forms the Government".|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened.

500|$|In higher organisms (like people), {{these two}} modes of {{perception}} combine into what Whitehead terms [...] "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation {{in a process}} that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. [...] By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. [...] An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. [...] However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, [...] "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead [...] "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." [...] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. [...] Moreover, animals do the same thing. [...] Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog [...] "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." [...] In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions {{on the one hand and}} causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).|$|E
500|$|Toriyama {{said that}} by {{the second half of}} the series, he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become [...] "too square", so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, he struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that the manga could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able to think of what to do that week. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he did not think of an ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low-key ending to make it seem as if the story might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it clear that Goku's battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama added a message to the ending for the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004.|$|E
