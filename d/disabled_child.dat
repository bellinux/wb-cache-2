5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} <b>disabled,</b> <b>child</b> care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Research {{suggests}} that parents of <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> are dissatisfied with inpatient care delivery to their children. Objectives: - To explore the inpatient care of <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> - To determine the rewards {{and challenges of}} working with <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and young people and those with complex health needs - To analyse contemporary nursing curricula in order to ascertain areas of teaching pertinent to <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and young people and those with complex health needs - To consider compliance with policy benchmarks for <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and young people and those with complex health needs Methods: This project {{is part of a}} service evaluation for <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and their families that utilises different approaches. Three components of the project were designed: 1. To conduct focus group meetings using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) with nursing staff 2. To conduct an in-depth content analysis of contemporary nursing curricula 3. To conduct an audit of compliance with policy benchmarks for <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and young people and those with complex health needs Results: Four themes have been generated from the integrated data analysis of the current service evaluation, namely: effective communication, provision of training, provision of equipment, unfavourable environment. Conclusion: This service evaluation has revealed that nursing staff need to improve their knowledge and expertise in the field of communication with <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and their families, and also enhance the quality of care delivered to this population. Additionally, it is vital that more equipment be provided, and the number of expert nursing staff caring for <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> increased, in order {{to improve the quality of}} care for <b>disabled</b> <b>children</b> and their families...|$|R

After EA 2002, employees gained the right to request flexible working patterns for the purpose of caring for a child under the age of 6, or a <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> under age 18. The right to make the request is contained in ERA 1996 section 80F, {{and despite the fact that}} employers may decline the request, employers grant requests in 80 per cent of cases. An employee must make the request in writing, the employer must reply in writing, and can only decline the request on the basis of a correct fact assessment, and within 8 grounds listed in section 80G, which generally concern business and organisational necessity.

2500|$|UK and EU law divide {{discrimination}} into {{direct and}} indirect forms. Direct discrimination means treating a person, because of a [...] "protected characteristic", less favourably than a comparable person who has {{a different type of}} gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. This is an objective test, so the employer's motives are irrelevant. Even if employers have [...] "positive" [...] motives, for instance to help underprivileged groups, discrimination is still unlawful in principle. The claimant's trait merely has to be the reason for the unfavourable treatment. An appropriate comparator is one who is the same in all respects except for the relevant trait, which is claimed as the ground for discrimination. For instance in Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary a chief inspector claimed that she was dismissed because the police force was sexist, and pointed to male chief inspectors who had not been treated unfavourably. The House of Lords overturned a Tribunal finding of sex discrimination because colleagues had complained about how Ms Shamoon had performed appraisals, and her chosen comparators had not received complaints. Generally there is, however, no need to point to an actual comparator, so a claimant can allege they were treated less favourably than a hypothetical person would have been, who is the same except for the protected characteristic. The burden of proof is explicitly regulated so that claimants merely need to show a set of facts from which a reasonable tribunal could conclude there was discrimination, and need not show an intention to discriminate. Because the law aims to eliminate the mindset and culture of discrimination, it is irrelevant whether the person who was targeted was themselves a person with a protected characteristic, so that people who associate with or are perceived to possess a protected characteristic are protected too. In Coleman v Attridge Law a lady with a <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> was abused by her employer for taking time off to care for the child. Even though Ms Coleman was not disabled, she could claim disability discrimination. And in English v Sanderson Blinds Ltd, a man who was from Brighton and went to boarding school was teased for being gay. Even though he was married with children, he successfully claimed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. An instruction by an employer to discriminate against customers or anyone else also violates the law.|$|E

2500|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} time off during working life will be to care for newly born or adopted children. However, unlike paid holidays or breaks that are available for [...] "workers", child care rights are restricted to [...] "employees". They are also less favourable for male parents, which affects gender equality. Going beyond the minimum in the Pregnant Workers Directive, the ERA 1996 section 71 to 73 and the Maternity and Parental Leave, etc Regulations 1999 guarantee maternity leave for 52 weeks in total, but in four steps, paid and unpaid. First, women must take two weeks compulsory leave {{at the time of}} child birth. Second, and covering the compulsory leave, there is a right to 6 weeks' leave paid at 90 per cent of ordinary earnings. Third, there is a right to 33 weeks leave at the statutory rate, or 90 per cent of ordinary earnings if this is lower, which was £138.18 per week in 2014. The government reimburses employers for the costs according to the employer's size and national insurance contributions. Fourth, the mother may take additional, but unpaid maternity leave for another 13 weeks. A contract of employment can always be, and if collectively bargained usually is, more generous. There is no qualifying period for the right to unpaid leave, but the mother must have worked for 26 weeks for the right to paid leave. The mother must also tell the employer 15 weeks before the date of the expected birth, in writing if the employer requests it. Employees may not suffer any professional detriment or dismissal while they are absent, and should be able to return to the same job after 26 weeks, or another suitable job after 52 weeks. If parents adopt, then the rights to leave follow maternity rules for one primary carer. However, for fathers ordinarily, the position is less generous. The Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 entitle a father to 2 weeks leave, at the statutory rate of pay. Both parents may also take [...] "parental leave". This means that, until a child turns 5, or a <b>disabled</b> <b>child</b> turns 18, parents can take up to 13 weeks unpaid leave. Unless there is another collective agreement in place, employees should give 21 days' notice, no more than 4 weeks in a year, at least 1 week at a time, and the employer can postpone the leave for 6 months if business would be unduly disrupted. Otherwise, employees have a right to suffer no detriment, nor be dismissed, and have the right to their previous jobs back. To redress the imbalance between women and men bearing children, the Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 made it possible for the woman to transfer up to 26 weeks of her maternity leave entitlements to her partner. However, it remains the case that women care for children more than men, which operates as a comparative obstacle to career advancement, and perpetuates the gender pay gap.|$|E
