6000|$|Lalun never mourned. She played little {{songs on}} the sitar, and to hear her sing, [...] "O Peacock, cry again," [...] was always a fresh pleasure. She knew all the songs that have ever been sung, from the war-songs of the South that make the old men angry with {{the young men and}} the young men angry with the State, to the love-songs of the North where the swords whinny-whicker like angry kites in the pauses between the kisses, and the Passes fill with armed men, and the Lover is torn from his Beloved and cries, Ai, Ai, Ai! evermore. She knew how to make up tobacco for the huqa so that <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> the Gates of Paradise and wafted you gently through them. She could {{embroider}} strange things in gold and silver, and dance softly with the moonlight when it came in at the window. Also she knew the hearts of men, and the heart of the City, and whose wives were faithful and whose untrue, and more of the secrets of the Government Offices than are good to be set down in this place. Nasiban, her maid, said that her jewelry was worth ten thousand pounds, and that, some night, a thief would enter and murder her for its possession; but Lalun said that all the City would tear that thief limb from limb, and that he, whoever he was, knew it.|$|E

When she set it down before him he swore <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> swine's flesh, but knowing where to find the finger, she {{immediately}} turned it up, which fairly convinced him of the contrary. The pie only served to sharpen his appetite, and I heard him sharpening his knife and saying he must have a collop or two, for he was not near satisfied. But what was my terror when I heard the giant groping among the bodies, and, fancying myself, cut the half of my hip off, and took it with him to be roasted. You may be certain I was in great pain, but the fear of being killed prevented me from making any complaint. However, when he had eaten all he began to drink hot liquors in great abundance, so that in a short time he could not hold up his head, but threw himself on a large creel he had made for the purpose, and fell fast asleep. When I heard him snoring, as I was I went up and caused the woman to bind my wound with a handkerchief; and, taking the giant's spit, reddened it in the fire, and ran it through the eye, but was not able to kill him.|$|E

5000|$|A smell {{rose from}} its pages {{that was not}} merely the {{delicate}} scent of aging paper and cracked vellum.

5000|$|Turkish {{soldiers}} {{guided the}} fire through the modern Greek and European section of Smyrna by pouring flammable liquids into the streets. These were poured {{in front of}} the American Consulate to guide the fire, as witnessed by C. Clafun David, the Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee of the Red Cross (Constantinople Chapter) and others who were standing {{at the door of the}} Consulate. Mr Davis testified that he put his hands in the mud where the flammable liquid was poured and indicated that <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> mixed petroleum and gasoline. The soldiers who were observed doing this had started from the quay and proceeded towards the fire, thus ensuring the rapid and controlled spread of the fire.|$|E
5000|$|... "That {{actually}} happened to me. In {{the seventh grade}} I had a counselor who came into class and passed around {{a little piece of}} marijuana. He lit it so everyone could see how <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>like,</b> and then it disappeared. And he was like, 'Where is it now? Who has it now? Can you please pass it back to the front.' But it was like, gone. So I just wrote down that experience, which became that scene." [...] Trey Parker [...] "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At {{the beginning and end of}} the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, [...] "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: [...] "Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now." [...] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode [...] "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".|$|E

40|$|I am {{building}} {{my career}} on {{the loss of}} a man named Stojan Sokolovic (and on the loss of many millions of others, that is to say, Others, {{who may or may not}} resemble him). And one night, he told me: "You write about violence – you say that fear is a violence – that the things that cause fear and insecurity are violences. But you do not know how that fear sits like a bear on my heart. You talk about fear, as though you understood what it tasted like – what <b>it</b> <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> – that electrified, trembling scent of mortar dust and artillery shells. You talk about guilt, but you look in from an angle that does not allow you to see it well. Violence must be quantifiable in your world. It must count bodies, burned houses, livestock, and graves – lost libraries, churches and synagogues, mosques. It must count the flood of refugees driven across the border from their own fields into those of others – into fields that do not want to take them. There is no scale with which to weigh the contents of heart and soul. And so, you can identify ‘victims,’ but you cannot ever really know what violence the committer of violence has done to himself, and you have not bothered to theorize that. No one watches as he sleeps to see if he cries out, or if he weeps, and no one has devised a gauge to look behind his eyes. No one wants to talk to those who hid behind the artillery wearing sneakers because their army did not have proper boots for them. No one wants to ask them if they will ever be alright again, trapped as they are in this life, and hemmed in on all sides by the measure of their own responsibility. You do not see it, because you have never been consumed by fear. If you had heard our wailing – killer and killed alike – you would say something other than what you are saying at your seminars and your conferences. I don’t know what it would be, but I know that it would not be the same [...] . ...|$|E
