5|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Sustainment Brigade was {{permanently}} {{attached to}} the 1st Cavalry Division, though it could operate independently when needed. Currently, it falls under {{the organization of the}} 1st Armored Division, having relocated as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005. This assignment allows the unit maximum flexibility when deployed, as <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> any support function needed, without being permanently attached to any particular unit or area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> very high performance. However, compared {{to some other}} open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E

25|$|Critics and {{supporters}} are largely in factual agreement regarding {{the characteristics of}} null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): While <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> critical information, it is inadequate as the sole tool for statistical analysis. Successfully rejecting the null hypothesis may offer no support for the research hypothesis. The continuing controversy concerns {{the selection of the}} best statistical practices for the near-term future given the (often poor) existing practices. Critics would prefer to ban NHST completely, forcing a complete departure from those practices, while supporters suggest a less absolute change.|$|E

25|$|The local {{environment}} and the construction materials <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide,</b> govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) {{were part of a}} self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.|$|E
25|$|While {{the member}} {{municipalities}} {{provide for their}} own municipal services, the FVRD acts as the local government for the electoral areas.
