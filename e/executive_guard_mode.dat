5000|$|In {{addition}} to faster components, two significant design improvements were incorporated: base registers and additional hardware instructions. The two 18-bit base registers (one for instruction storage {{and one for}} data storage) permitted dynamic relocation: as a program got swapped {{in and out of}} main memory, its instructions and data could be placed anywhere each time it got reloaded. To support multiprogramming, the 1108 had memory protection using two base and limit registers, with 512-word resolution. One was called the I-bank or instruction bank, and the other the D-bank or data bank. If the I-bank and D-bank of a program were put into different physical banks of memory, a 1/2 microsecond advantage accrued, called [...] "alternate bank timing." [...] The 1108 also introduced the Processor State Register, or PSR. In {{addition to}} controlling the Base Registers, it included various control [...] "bits" [...] that enabled the various Storage Protection features, allowed selection of either the User or Exec set of A, X & R registers, and enabled [...] "Guard Mode" [...] for user programs. <b>Guard</b> <b>Mode</b> prevented user programs from execution of Executive Only [...] "privileged" [...] instructions, and from accessing memory locations outside the program's allocated memory.|$|R

The type of controller we investigate is the switching control mechanism of a hybrid automaton (via <b>guard</b> and <b>mode</b> invariant sets), and the robustness result is {{with respect to}} variations in the right hand sides of the differential equations that depend continuously on a parameter. We present a novel methodology for controller design and synthesis which uses modal logic as a formalism for reasoning about sets of plant states, and various operators on sets arising from the differential equations and from metric tolerance relations on the state space. ...|$|R
