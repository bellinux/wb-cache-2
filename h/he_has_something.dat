5|$|On the October 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Heyman, on Lesnar's behalf, {{challenged}} Goldberg to a fight after the pair had been feuding {{for several months}} through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. Heyman stated that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar's WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. On the October 17 episode of Raw, Goldberg returned to the WWE after a twelve-year absence and accepted Lesnar's request for a fight with their match later scheduled for Survivor Series. On the final Raw before Survivor Series, Lesnar and Goldberg had a confrontation {{for the first time}} in twelve years, resulting in a brawl with security after Heyman insulted Goldberg's family. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Lesnar lost to Goldberg in 1 minute and 26 seconds, marking the first time in three years that Lesnar was pinned. The next night on Raw, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week on Raw, Heyman addressed the Survivor Series match, stating that they underestimated Goldberg and that the match was a humiliation and embarrassment for him and Lesnar, who would also be in the Royal Rumble as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to prove. Lesnar returned on the January 16 episode of Raw to confront other Royal Rumble participants, attacking Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Lesnar entered at number 26 and went on to eliminate Enzo Amore, Dean Ambrose and Dolph Ziggler before confronting Goldberg, who entered at number 28 and quickly eliminated Lesnar after a spear.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the tower}} block in Birmingham, Plokta captures many people within its rooms {{by giving them}} an {{illusion}} of their hearts desire. Using the collected magical energy of these people, Plokta creates an army of Mindless Ones. When challenged by Captain Britain, Plokta reveals <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> Brian may want; Meggan. Captain Midlands betrayed his remaining comrades, allowing them to be captured by Plokta briefly. When the team eventually defeated Plokta, Midlands was taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|The player {{enters the}} central chamber, {{resisting}} the Dark Fall, and recites the incantation, imprisoning it, and releasing the trapped souls. Timothy thanks him, {{and before he}} departs, tells him things may not have turned out as he thinks. All evidence of the spirits trapped by the Dark Fall throughout history disappear. The game then cuts back to the opening scene, as the player receives a message from Pete. In the message, Pete begins by saying <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> very important to tell his brother, but then forgets why he rang, and says the redevelopment of the hotel is going well, {{and he will be}} home shortly.|$|E

500|$|Politicians {{from both}} parties opined on the propriety of the Fund and on what Nixon should do, most in accord with their {{political}} affiliation. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson, though, publicly reserved judgment, leading Chotiner to suspect [...] "that Stevenson is afraid of something here. I bet <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to hide." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter {{announces that}} he and Barbara are getting a divorce, causing Peter to suggest he meet other people. Taking him to the local club, Peter {{introduces}} Carter to the dating scene, where he soon meets Paula, an attractive blonde. Going on to demand an African American patron fetch him a drink, Carter is {{accused of being a}} racist by Paula, who leaves him. Continuing to desire Barbara, Carter decides to take a bouquet of roses to his former wife. While there, he discovers that Barbara has begun dating the man she had an affair with during the war (who sings to her in the tune of 'The Miners Mother'). Announcing <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> important to say to Barbara, Carter confesses his love for her, and apologizes. Barbara then allows Carter to earn her trust by letting him move back in, and the two ultimately embrace in a passionate kiss.|$|E
500|$|Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{had been}} told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at {{campaign}} stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on {{the early days of}} the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, [...] "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> delicious to work with, some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick." [...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E

500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
500|$|Critics judged Leyland {{a better}} Test than county batsman. His {{first-class}} batting figures were not exceptional {{compared to other}} cricketers who played far fewer Test matches, but in Tests, his average is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the strongest of England's opponents during his career, he averaged 56, a further increase of ten runs. Gibson suggests that he rose to the big occasions, and that he performed best against the toughest opponents. According to Leyland's obituary in The Times, [...] "He was essentially a man for the big occasion, a batsman at his best in a crisis, and his favourite game was a Roses match or an Australian Test. England's supporters often {{breathed a sigh of}} relief to see his burly figure purposefully striding to the wicket." [...] The writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that Leyland in a Test match was like the [...] "four-squarers of ancient or romantic times. He was Horatius on the tottering bridge; Hector, who alone stood between Troy and destruction. He was born to rescue. But he is more dangerous than those who are stubborn or grim. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> of D'Artagnan in him; there is a gaiety besides the simplicity and strength; seen in the slight list of the cap, and in a certain jauntiness and optimism of gait." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sagan was a straight-A student but {{was bored}} due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring {{teachers}}. His teachers realized this {{and tried to}} convince his parents {{to send him to}} a private school, the administrator telling them, [...] "This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> really remarkable." [...] This they couldn't do, partly because of the cost.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the framing}} story the astronaut, Grimaldi, arrives at home {{where he is}} greeted by his daughter. He says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to show her. When he opens his case, a green, {{crystalline}} sphere rises out and melts him. It introduces itself to the terrified girl as [...] "the sum of all evils". Looking into the orb known as the Loc-Nar, the girl sees how it has influenced societies throughout time and space.|$|E
2500|$|In Southey's {{personal}} appearance, {{there is}} something eccentric, even off-putting: he [...] "walks with his chin erect {{through the streets of}} London, and with an umbrella sticking out under his arm, in the finest weather." [...] "With a tall, loose figure, a peaked austerity of countenance, and no inclination to embonpoint, you would say <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> puritanical, something ascetic in his appearance." [...] Hazlitt hopes the negative aspects of his character will dissipate, wishing that Southey live up to his own ideal as expressed in his poem [...] "The Holly-Tree" [...] so that [...] "as he mellows into maturer age, all [...] asperities may wear off...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Berg began researching Wilson in 2000: [...] "I have {{an image}} of him {{in my mind that}} is unlike any picture I have seen {{anywhere}} else, based on material at Princeton and 35 years of researching and thinking about him". “When most people think of Woodrow Wilson, they see a dour minister’s son who never cracked a smile, where in fact {{he was a man of}} genuine joy and great sadness. I did not write a diplomatic history or a history of foreign affairs in his life. I wanted the reader to walk through his life and see it with his eyes.” [...] "It takes a certain amount of egotism for a biographer to think <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> new to add to the record, and I believe I do." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "No Reaper Left Behind," [...] John {{attempts}} to regain {{some semblance of}} a normal life {{through the use of}} the internet, only to be disappointed. [...] In an effort to find some purpose, he asks Sam to send him to Hell in an attempt to locate Alan Townsend and help Sam get out of his deal. [...] Sam agrees and sends him to Hell with the Nerf gun vessel. John subsequently contacts Sam by cell phone and tells him he's discovered a way for Sam to break the deal, but he's trapped in the third circle of Hell (it is unknown how he got there as the third level is inhabited by the gluttons). Nina goes to Hell to get it and rescue him, but he stays behind, saying <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> important to do.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, “he {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by writers like Montaigne and Lessing... {{but he made}} no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited” [...] However, in his celebrated Autobiography, John Stuart Mill (arguably the nineteenth-century's most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to [...] "his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up," [...] was [...] "seldom sufficiently appreciated." [...] "His book," [...] Mill continued, [...] "is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him..." [...] He was also highly praised by Thomas De Quincey: [...] "or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson {{on the possibility of}} imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian" [...] In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and {{is an integral part of}} the history of education. He is believed to be the “earliest spokesman for a child-centered education” (141), which is discussed above under his early childhood education theories. As well, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of tropes and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the post-structuralist and formalist theories. For example, the works of Jacques Derrida on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian’s assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes.|$|E
