50|$|Fast shifting, {{with only}} a single operation. This {{requires}} less skill to learn than techniques like <b>double</b> <b>declutching</b> and it offers faster shifts when racing.|$|E
50|$|The new MCT {{transmission}} {{is essentially the}} 7G-Tronic transmission without a torque converter. Instead of a torque converter, it uses a compact wet startup clutch to start the car off, and also supports computer-controlled <b>double</b> <b>declutching.</b> The MCT (Multi-Clutch Technology) acronym refers to a planetary (automatic) transmissionâ€™s multiple clutches and bands for each gear.|$|E
5000|$|... (TMS) which {{contains}} two ECU's the {{transmission control unit}} (TECU) and the gear selector control unit (GECU). I-Shift borrowed from old transmission technologies like non-synchronised main gears which allowed a reduction in size and weight and a countershaft brake to achieve more precise shift control while matching engine rpm to transmissions rpm e.g. TECU requests the EECU to correct engine rpm so as to synchronise the rpm to effect a smooth gear change, similar to <b>double</b> <b>declutching.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "I used to {{love the}} old cars," [...] {{explained}} Robert Hardy. [...] "Except when they gave up. They were always giving up. We had a permanent mechanic up there {{and he was always}} deep inside the bonnet of this or that car. But I had some nice cars to drive, and when they worked they were great fun. And, of course, I was old enough to remember how to <b>double</b> <b>declutch</b> and all that sort of thing, so they weren't a shock to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans {{decided to}} find out what his {{customers}} wanted in an [...] "owner driver's ideal" [...] car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need to <b>double</b> <b>declutch.</b> There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed constant-mesh gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the MG, the 15/50 engine {{had only}} a single SU {{carburettor}} so the power output was slightly less at [...] at 4400 rpm. Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a [...] "Manumatic" [...] two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a vacuum servo. Having no synchromesh on bottom gear could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require <b>double</b> <b>declutching,</b> difficult.|$|E
50|$|In {{a gearbox}} with neutral between gears, a typical shift {{actually}} involves two gear changes, once into neutral, and {{again into the}} next gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the engine and transmission of the force from the opposing components. Using the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is <b>double</b> (<b>de)clutching.</b> Due {{to the absence of}} a neutral spacing, double clutching is ill-advised for sequential gear changes, as in a fully sequential gearbox such as a typical motorcycle.|$|E
