5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the PT boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> what had occurred.|$|E

Franklin Matthias first set up his temporary <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> the banks of the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> the fifth floor of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, {{who was in charge}} of the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district did not change.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 the United States {{government}} {{forced the}} railroad {{to move out}} of its <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.

Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building in the middle of 1929.|$|E

5|$|In April 1944, 2e DB {{was shipped}} to Britain to {{participate}} in Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of northern France.

The division moved to training areas in Yorkshire, where Leclerc established his <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> the estate of Henry Frederick Hotham, 7th Baron Hotham, at Dalton Hall, Beverley. Training was conducted in concert with Maczek's 1st Polish Armoured Division.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center for volunteers was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force's <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{established}} his district <b>headquarters</b> <b>on</b> the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York City. He chose the name Development of Substitute Materials (DSM), {{but this would}} not stick. Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the head of the}} Construction Branch in the Office of the Chief of Engineers thought it would attract undue attention. Instead, the new district was given the innocuous name of the Manhattan Engineer District, following the usual practice of naming engineer districts after the city in which their headquarters was located. The name of the project soon followed suit. It was formally established by the Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on August 16, 1942.|$|E
