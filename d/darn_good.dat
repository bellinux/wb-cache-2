Since the show had already {{established}} itself in the first two seasons, they were able to give it more depth during their tenure. Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans and critics regard season three and four as the best seasons of The Simpsons. Bill Oakley, another writer on The Simpsons, has commented that [...] "Mike and Al are responsible for the best thing that ever appeared on television, which was the third season of The Simpsons." [...] Comedy writer Jay Kogen has said that [...] "those years with Al Jean and Mike Reiss running it were pretty <b>darn</b> <b>good.</b> And then the ones after that maybe not so much. Some people ran it better than others." ...|$|E

Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{said the}} group were poised to succeed [...] "where other X Factor winners have failed by releasing a great single at the right time". Cragg highlighted the song's production, writing that it had [...] "everything you'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012", and likened Little Mix's [...] "ridiculous vocal runs" [...] to those of Christina Aguilera. Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds {{an awful lot like}} 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus". Rivers concluded: [...] "'Wings' is really pretty <b>darn</b> <b>good.</b> Not just good-for-X-Factor good, but good-in-the-context-of-all-pop-music good." ...|$|E
500|$|Time magazine's Lev Grossman {{named it}} one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium. Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that [...] "...the spectacularly complex interplay of {{narrative}} and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume." [...] In a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer said, [...] "Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a <b>darn</b> <b>good</b> bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun". They also praised {{the second half of the}} novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it [...] "provocatively sketchy". In another review from The Times, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was [...] "not an original, high-concept author", she was [...] "right up there with other greats of children's fiction". Craig went on to say that the novel was [...] "beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which [...] "is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century".|$|E

Peter Keough of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] " [...] may end up {{as one of the}} worst movies of 2015, but {{it is also one of}} the most entertaining". The Guardian writer Jordan Hoffman gave the film two stars, writing that [...] "it is bad, but it isn't THAT bad", and said: [...] "for a would-be cult [...] classic, this could have been much more". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times was {{critical}} of [...] The Boy Next Door, calling it [...] "breathless, uninspired (...) junk that feels like the iffiest bits of a Lifetime movie and late-night cable schlock slapped together", calling Guzman's character boring. Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt similarly wrote that the film was a [...] "few deliciously bonkers bons mots dot the Lifetime-grade dialogue", while calling its script [...] "too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at". Despite negative reviews, Lopez has received praise. Richard Lawson from Vanity Fair wrote: [...] "Given the material, Lopez is actually pretty <b>darn</b> <b>good</b> in [...] the movie, taking it seriously enough that it's not irksomely arch camp, but also plenty aware that she's not doing Shakespeare. She's a joy to watch throughout." [...] Claudia Puig from USA Today stated that the movie was an improvement on her previous romantic comedies, calling Lopez [...] "believably powerful in moments of physical conflict".|$|E

I Did It Again received an average score of seventy-two, based on twelve reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Giving the album {{four out of}} five stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the album [...] "has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made 'One More Time'," [...] but remarked that, [...] "Fortunately, she and her production team not only have a stronger overall set of songs this time, but they also occasionally get carried away with the same bewildering magpie aesthetic, [...] giv the album character apart from the well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that serve as its heart. In the end, it's what makes this an entertaining, satisfying listen." [...] Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "'Oops!...' indicates that she's developing a soulful edge and emotional depth that can't be conjured with a glass-shattering note," [...] praising the album for consistently cast Spears as a young woman coming to terms with her inner power—and that's a <b>darn</b> <b>good</b> message to offer an impressionable audience." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne gave the album a B-rating, writing that the album [...] "reminds us once again that the best new pop can be a blast of cool air in a stifling room." ...|$|E

5000|$|Truth or Consequences {{started out}} as a radio game show that premiered on NBC Radio in March 1940, and aired for 38 years on radio and television. After a ridiculously {{difficult}} trivia question was asked, and Beulah the Buzzer went off when they inevitably failed to answer, contestants were asked to perform often ridiculous stunts for prizes of cash or merchandise. From the start contestants preferred to miss the question, with Edwards commenting [...] "Most of the American people are <b>darned</b> <b>good</b> sports." ...|$|R

[...] Kay, aka 'Tubby' (which all her teammates continued to call her even after they knew the truth), played first base for the season, but was forced to quit after just one season because a new rule, known as the Tubby Rule, was created.

Probably the chappie thought he {{was some kind of}} a confidence johnnie or something. It was absolutely rotten! He continued to blush till one could have fancied him scarlet to the ankles.

But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There {{are a lot of}} historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson's book: something happened during Steve's NeXT years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that [...] "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone suggests that [...] "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" [...] but also notes that [...] "Jobs is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat." [...] Contributor for rogerebert.com, Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, [...] "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple Inc. guru Steve Jobs and - more importantly - what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's Behind the Music." [...] She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for The New York Times, writer Manohla Dargis writes that Jobs was [...] "inevitably unsatisfying" [...] and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the still {{continuous}} and centuries old skill of “Rafoogari” or the Darning and Maintenance of Pashmina Shawls by the Rafoogars or Darners of Najibabad, an historical town in western Uttar Pradesh. It {{is the home of}} several ‘Rafoogar’ families and the hub of the kani shawl trade. While Kashmiri pashmina shawls have been elaborately researched, the important role of darners in the maintenance of these priceless shawls has not yet been recognized. Although darning is a highly intricate and laborious task necessary to the maintenance, restoration, and renewal of the shawls, the role of the darners has remained unnoticed, possibly because the hallmark of <b>good</b> <b>darning</b> is to “share invisibility. ” The tradition of production of these intricately designed and expensive shawls came from Central Asia to India along with Islam and got further refined by local cultural influence, pushing the technique to its creative limit in a process of appropriation and acculturation lasting more than five centuries. The production of these shawls has become almost extinct. The socio–cultural conditions that made such a practice possible have changed. Normal production of such exquisite pieces is not possible anymore. The continuing tradition of darning becomes extremely significant in this context. The special skill of the darners has been helping to rescue a substantial number of priceless shawls from destruction. Darning has kept them in circulation and continuous use until today in changing circumstances and in an interesting simultaneous transformation of the product and the market instead of being preserved only in museum collections. The paper will highlight this particular cultural approach to objects where historicity is maintained without sacrificing the use value. It will further discuss a complex range of issues in conservation, restoration and renewal of cultural products raised in the context of darning as an independent practice...|$|R
