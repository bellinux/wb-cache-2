5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine.

If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E
