2500|$|An {{effort has}} been {{undertaken}} to fit the three damaged reactor buildings with fabric covers and filters to limit radioactive contamination release. On 6 April 2011, sources told Kyodo News that a major construction firm was studying the idea, and that construction wouldn't [...] "start until June". The plan {{has been criticized for}} potential only having [...] "limited effects in blocking the release of radioactive substances into the environment". On 14 May, TEPCO announced that it had begun to clear debris to create a space to install a cover over the building of reactor 1. In June, a large crane was erected near Reactor 1 to begin construction of the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover.</b> From mid August to mid September 2011, a rectangular steel frame entirely surrounding the reactor building was constructed. Starting 9 September, the crane was used to attach polyester panels to the frame. On 20 September 2011, TEPCO announced that within three weeks they hoped to complete the construction of the polyester shield over the No.1 reactor. By that time the steel frame for the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> had been completed. By 7 October, the roof of the structure was being added. On 9 October, the walls of the cover appeared to be placed, and by 13 October the roof had been completed.|$|E

2500|$|A chair {{cover is}} a {{temporary}} <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> for a side chair. [...] They are typically rented for formal events such as wedding receptions to increase the attractiveness of the chairs and decor. The chair covers may come with decorative chair ties, a ribbon to be tied as a bow behind the chair. Covers for sofas and couches are also available for homes with small children and pets. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, some people used custom clear plastic covers for expensive sofas and chairs to protect them.|$|E

50|$|Tension fabric {{buildings}} {{are constructed using}} a rigid frame which can consist of timber, steel, rigid plastic, or aluminum and a sturdy fabric outer membrane. Once the frame is erected in place, the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> is stretched over the frame. The <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> is tensioned to provide the stable structural support of the building. The fabric is tensioned using multiple methods varying by manufacturer, creating a tight fitting cover membrane. Compared to traditional structures may have lower operational costs,be naturally bright, be installed quickly, {{and be able to}} be re-located easily..|$|E

50|$|The initial {{process begins}} with {{the making of the}} helmet shell using a vacuum forming machine and a metal mould. A sheet of black {{fortified}} plastic is heated and then lowered over the mould, where a vacuum pulls the plastic into shape over the mould. Once hardened instantly, a rubber mallet is used to release the plastic from the mould so that the excess plastic around brim of the helmet can be trimmed with a bandsaw and sanded. The helmet's fabric covers are made out of water-repellent wool that are cut in halves and stitched together to give the helmet a distinctive centred, front-to-back seam. Moving down the line of production, glue is applied to both the inside of the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> and the outside surface of the helmet shell, the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> is then steamed and stretched tightly over the shell to prevent buckling. A wooden tool is carefully used to smooth away any air bubbles as well as to ensure the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> is in full contact with the helmet shell; excess fabric is cut away.|$|E

At the same time, Smith developed a water polo ball made with an inflatable bladder and a rubber <b>fabric</b> <b>cover,</b> which improved performance.|$|E
50|$|A type {{of metal}} helmet worn by Athenian cavalry {{was made in}} the shape of a petasos. Some {{examples}} have holes around the outer edge of the brim, presumably so a <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> could be attached. These are known from reliefs and vase paintings, with at least one archaeological example found in an Athenian tomb.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, {{smooth finish}} helmets worn without a <b>fabric</b> <b>cover,</b> {{have become more}} common. A newly popular style in the hunter-jumper world {{features}} a lightly textured (less shiny) plastic shell with a decorative ventilation strip down the center. This design goes by many brand names, but, due to the ventilation strip, is informally called a “skunk helmet.” ...|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the AIR-9 followed Yavovlev's previous designs with wooden plywood and <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> wings, welded steel tube fabric-covered fuselage and Duralumin <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> tail surfaces.

5000|$|Reportedly {{inspired}} by the Percival Gull, Yakovlev designed and built a similar aircraft using his tried and tested structural formulae of wooden wings, <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> steel tube fuselage with <b>fabric</b> <b>covered</b> D1 (Duralumin) tail section and control surfaces. The fixed tail-wheel undercarriage was spatted and fitted with trousers, with a spring steel tail-skid, or, alternatively, on skis.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the sport}} was played with {{ordinary}} tennis balls, but the fiber cover of these balls slowed them excessively, reduced their bounce, {{and made the}} game very slow. To speed the game, the <b>fabric</b> <b>cover</b> of the tennis balls was removed. Later, balls made of oilcloth were imported from England and the United States {{with the goal of}} further speeding the game.|$|E

From May 1941 metal ailerons were fitted to all Spitfires coming off the production lines.|$|R
