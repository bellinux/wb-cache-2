5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{shortcomings}} {{noted above}} limit {{the usefulness of}} the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
50|$|Clarinets with <b>few</b> <b>keys</b> cannot {{therefore}} easily play chromatically, limiting {{any such}} instrument to a <b>few</b> closely related <b>key</b> signatures. For example, an eighteenth-century clarinet in C could {{be played in}} F, C, and G (and their relative minors) with good intonation, but with progressive difficulty and poorer intonation as the key moved away from this range. In contrast, for octave-overblowing instruments, an instrument in C with <b>few</b> <b>keys</b> could much more readily be played in any key.|$|R
5000|$|Language: Very <b>few</b> <b>keys</b> are multilingual. Translations {{of a key}} may be {{incorrect}} or misleading. Many keys contain vague {{words that}} do not translate..|$|R
30|$|Previous keys. So {{to avoid}} a overly skewed {{distribution}} of keys the number of current keys stored by each host is considered and hosts with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys</b> are preferred as replicas.|$|R
5|$|Most of Riefenstahl's {{unfinished}} {{projects were}} lost {{towards the end}} of the war. The French government confiscated all of her editing equipment, along with the production reels of Tiefland. After years of legal wrangling, these were returned to her, but the French government had reportedly damaged some of the film stock whilst trying to develop and edit it, with a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> scenes being missing (although Riefenstahl was surprised to find the original negatives for Olympia in the same shipment). She edited and dubbed the remaining material and Tiefland premiered on 11 February 1954 in Stuttgart. However, it was denied entry into the Cannes Film Festival. Although Riefenstahl lived for almost another half century, Tiefland was her last feature film.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on 28 November 2013 at Hyderabad. Tamannaah {{joined the}} film's sets on 12 December 2013. A village set resembling Tadipatri was erected in Gujarat for the film's shoot to avoid local interference from crowds that would ensue if shot in Andhra Pradesh, where Mahesh is a star. <b>Few</b> <b>key</b> scenes including a fight sequence were shot at Nanakramguda {{in a large}} set. The next schedule stated at Bellary from 23 February 2014. Mahesh did not suffer any injuries during the film's shoot at Bellary, but took rest due to the stress he underwent. Filming continued at Hyderabad from 10 March 2014. Some comedy scenes were filmed on the principal cast. Few scenes were filmed at the Mount Opera in Hyderabad. Scenes featuring Mahesh, Prasad and Sood were filmed in early April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, {{beginning}} a population shift to central and northern Indiana, {{and contributed to}} a relative decline {{in the southern part}} of the state. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been. Indiana's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war, making it one of a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> swing states that often decided national elections. Between 1868 and 1916, five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets. In 1888 Benjamin Harrison, one of the state's former Civil War generals, was elected president of the United States.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, an {{automatic}} redial is a service feature {{that allows the}} user to dial, by depressing a single <b>key</b> or a <b>few</b> <b>keys,</b> the most recent telephone number dialed at that instrument.|$|R
50|$|Chording, with a chorded {{keyboard}} or keyer {{allows one}} to produce as many characters, as a QWERTY keyboard, but with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys</b> and less motion per finger, and is thought to alleviate or prevent carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|Some IMEs {{provide an}} [...] "abbreviation" [...] feature, where {{impossible}} Cangjie codes are interpreted as abbreviations for the Cangjie codes {{of more than}} one character. This allows more characters to be input with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys.</b> An example is SCIM.|$|R
5|$|The Sounds {{rejoined the}} Cincinnati Reds farm system in 1987, {{this time as}} their Triple-A affiliate. As a result, a number of minor leaguers played in the Reds {{organization}} at two different levels with Nashville. Spending {{the beginning of the}} 1987 season around the top of the standings, the team hit a slump after losing a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> players midseason. The result was a 64–76 record under skipper Jack Lind and a last place finish. One player lost due to injuries was third baseman Chris Sabo. Sabo was promoted to Cincinnati in 1988 and was named the National League Rookie of the Year, a first for any former Sounds player.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led by the major magnates, {{and then by the}} more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E
5|$|When the South {{returned}} to firm Democratic {{control at the}} end of the 1870s, Indiana, which was closely split between the two parties, was one of a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> swing state that often decided the balance of power in Congress and the presidency. Five Hoosier politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets held between 1868 and 1916, as the nation's political parties vied for the support of the state's electorate. In 1888, at the height of the state's post-war political influence, former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president, and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{tuning in}} guitars determines most Flamenco music {{to be played}} only in a <b>few</b> <b>keys.</b> Of those, the most popular are the A minor and D minor (equivalent to E and A Phrygian, respectively). They are as following: ...|$|R
5000|$|Lighting and magnification: Very <b>few</b> <b>keys</b> {{give details}} of how the {{specimen}} was viewed (the magnification, lighting system, angle of view etc.). This can cause problems. The author may, for instance refer to tiny bristles, hairs or chaetae—but how tiny? ...|$|R
50|$|The flute {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of Irish traditional music since roughly the middle of the 19th century, when art musicians largely abandoned the wooden simple-system flute (having a conical bore, and <b>fewer</b> <b>keys)</b> for the metal Boehm system flutes of present-day classical music.|$|R
5|$|The Pictish and Cumbric {{languages}} {{were replaced}} by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse, with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, Scots, derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, educational opportunities widened and a growth of lay education cumulated in the Education Act 1496. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from John Barbour's Brus (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court makars, and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed {{to the development of}} the wider insular style. Much of the finest later work has not survived, but there are a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by bards and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms.|$|E

25|$|An {{omission}} is when {{a person}} tells most of the truth, but leaves out a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> facts that therefore completely change the story.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha EX5 is a synthesizer/workstation {{produced}} by Yamaha from 1998 to 2000. The EX5 combines several methods of sound generation, namely AWM2, AN, VL, FDSP, and sampling. The later released EX7 was a cheaper {{version of the}} EX5 with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys,</b> polyphony, sounds and functions.|$|R
50|$|Stage pianos {{usually have}} 88 keys, which is {{standard}} for all modern acoustic pianos. However, some stage pianos have <b>fewer</b> <b>keys,</b> {{such as the}} Kurzweil SP76. It has only 76 semi-weighted keys, but is still called a stage piano because of its layout and weighted keys.|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} Breton clarinet {{usually has}} only 13 keys (though sometimes {{as few as}} six), {{in contrast to the}} more common 'Boehm' instrument used in jazz, classical music and other fields. [...] This is because classical musicians discarded the clarinets with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys</b> in favor of more complex and state-of-the-art pieces.|$|R
25|$|Another popular (and perhaps older) march {{style is}} the regimental march, or review march. There are a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> {{differences}} between a typical military march and a regimental march.|$|E
25|$|Theories of {{nucleosynthesis}} {{are tested}} by calculating isotope abundances and comparing those results with observed abundances. Isotope abundances are typically {{calculated from the}} transition rates between isotopes in a network. Often these calculations can be simplified as a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> reactions control the rate of other reactions.|$|E
25|$|Game 7 {{would end}} in a duel between Pierce (41 points) and James (45 points) that some {{compared}} to the Bird–Wilkins duel in the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals. But timely offensive rebounding (10 in all), 18 second chance points, and a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> shots from Celtics veteran P.J. Brown helped push Boston into the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
50|$|The PC-1430 is a stripped-down {{variant of}} the PC-1401. The display and case are mostly the same (except for <b>fewer</b> <b>keys),</b> but the PC-1430 lacks the {{calculator}} modus (for calculations the BASIC mode has to be used), it offers less functions, only 2 KB RAM, and no speaker or buzzer.|$|R
50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{used in conjunction with}} text-messaging services. Some portable telecommunications devices (such as the BlackBerry) have bypassed the need for this by incorporating a mini-keyboard for users to type on. As of 2012, most mobile phones with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys</b> than alphabet letters offer a predictive text input method.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} Breton clarinet {{usually has}} only 13 keys (though sometimes {{as few as}} six), {{in contrast to the}} more common 'Boehm' instrument used in jazz, classical music and other fields. This is because classical musicians discarded the clarinets with <b>fewer</b> <b>keys</b> in favor of more complex and state-of-the-art pieces.|$|R
25|$|The {{composition}} of Biyoghé Mba's new government was announced on 17 October; it {{was reduced to}} only 30 ministers, thus fulfilling Bongo's campaign promise {{to reduce the size}} of the government and thereby reduce expenses. The government was also mostly composed of new faces, including many technocrats, although a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> ministers, such as Paul Toungui (Foreign Minister), Jean-François Ndongou (Interior Minister), and Laure Olga Gondjout (Communications Minister), retained their posts.|$|E
25|$|The {{creators of}} Emergency! tried to {{accurately}} portray the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) by using apparatus and equipment in current use. Although a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> items were fictionalized, {{such as the}} identification of Station 51 and its equipment, many of the locations and apparatus reflected the operating reality of locations used in some filming. The extensive cooperation of the LACoFD is repeatedly apparent in the program.|$|E
25|$|IX Troop Carrier Command (TCC) {{was formed}} in October 1943 {{to carry out the}} {{airborne}} assault mission in the invasion. Brigadier General Paul T. Williams, who had commanded the troop carrier operations in Sicily and Italy, took command in February 1944. The TCC command and staff officers were an excellent mix of combat veterans from those earlier assaults, and a <b>few</b> <b>key</b> officers were held over for continuity.|$|E
25|$|Further the {{keyboard}} size {{depends on the}} extent to which a system is used where a single action is produced by a combination of subsequent or simultaneous keystrokes (with modifier keys, see below), or multiple pressing of a single key. A keyboard with <b>few</b> <b>keys</b> is called a keypad. See also text entry interface.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} {{principles}} above, there is no official list of key themes. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has identified these seven key themes of Catholic Social Teaching set out here. Other sources identify more or <b>fewer</b> <b>key</b> themes based on their reading of the key documents of the social magisterium.|$|R
30|$|The {{recovery}} scheme should {{balance a}} receiver's ability to recover against the overall {{vulnerability of the}} system. Specifically, it should assist a receiver that has lost one or a <b>few</b> <b>keys</b> to recover at sufficiently low computational cost, but it should limit the ability of an attacker, who has obtained a previous (old) key, to decrypt ongoing broadcast messages.|$|R
