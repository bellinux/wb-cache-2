40|$|Abstract The Biocide Product Directive (BPD) of the European Union is {{intended}} to balance the efficacy of biocides in their intended use with their impact on human and animal health and the environment. It legally organizes the process of putting a biocide {{on the market and}} harmonizes the regulation of the EU Member States. Biocides have to be subjected systematic tests for efficacy and risk before approval. The BPD achieves its aims using a two-stage regime of rigorous evaluation of bio-cidal active substances and products, to ensure they pose no unacceptable risks to people, animals or the environment. Ultimately only those biocidal products that contain an active substance that is included in Annex I of the Directive will be authorized for use. Active substances have to be evaluated to ascertain whether or not they will be included in Annex I. This requires industry to submit data, which is evaluated by Member States with decisions over Annex I inclusion being taken at the European level. Industry is charged a fee for this process. Once an active substance has been included in Annex I, national Competent Authorities can authorize products containing it in indi-vidual Member States (providing that any necessary data have been supplied and any conditions put on Annex I inclusion are met). Once a product has been author-ized in the <b>first</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> it will be possible for it to be mutually recognized and therefore authorized by other Member States (providing relevant conditions are similar). However, {{there will have to be}} an application from other Member States, and again there will be a fee for these processes. ...|$|E

A series of independent food safety agencies have been created and more are on. the way with a pan-European agency scheduled for 2002. Ireland was the <b>first</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> to create a new agency, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). Accountable to the Minister for Health and Children, the FSAI is a science based consumer protection agency. A key objective of the FSAI is to develop a culture of food safety in Ireland so that Irish consumers and purchasers of Irish food abroad can have the utmost confidence in our standards and controls. In Ireland, the food safety inspection system was fragmented with responsibilities dispersed over 48 agencies each working independently of other agencies on a segment of the food chain. Under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998 responsibilities for enforcement of food safety standards rests with the FSAI. This responsibility is discharged via service contracts with all the official agencies involved. It is hoped that by co-ordinating all food safety control activity through service contracts that a seamless inspection service can be developed with no gaps in the continuum from farm to fork. Over 1, 900 people are involved, whole time and part time, in food safety activities and the range of skills and abilities is formidable. Effectively, harnessing the innate enthusiasm and abilities of these staff will ultimately determine whether this "seamless inspection service" becomes a reality. The achievements possible by the agencies working together as agents of the FSAI will far exceed the sum of the individual contributions. Together we can and will achieve change and raise standards in all sectors of the food industry...|$|E

Leaving aside Greenland’s departure from the European Community in 1983 – because of its political union with Denmark, Greenland has been {{recognized as one of}} the Overseas Countries and Territories of the EU –, the United Kingdom is the <b>first</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> in the history of European integration to engage in a process of disintegration which may ultimately see full withdrawal from the EU in the spade of two years following the UK’s trigger of Article 50 TEU. This means that a new chapter in the rich literature on differentiated European integration is going to be opened. Obviously, the dusk has yet to settle before the impact on both the EU and the UK will become discernible and the future shape of the UK-EU relationship in the post-Brexit era will finally appear. Thus, it is a timely task for practitioners and scholars of various EU-related disciplines to ponder what the implications for the future of European integration are in more genuinely. Has European integration reached a tipping and is interstate cooperation reverting to the ‘old normal’ of intergovernmental relations of ‘sovereign states’ constituting the bedrock of international relations? We are convinced that, now more than ever, academics from different sub-fields of European studies and stakeholders should be brought together in order to discuss the causes and consequences of Brexit. It is through interdisciplinary co-operation that researchers will be able to fully grasp the new developments across and beyond Europe.

40|$|The {{so called}} refugee crisis of 2015 had several effects, among which the {{definitive}} {{demonstration of the}} unsustainability of the Dublin system and the need of a radical change in the modalities of allocation of the competence for the exam of asylum claims in the EU. The same credibility of the EU is at stake, {{as well as the}} capacities of national governments to manage the relevant flows reaching the Schengen area. This Policy Brief provides sound arguments both for supporting the demand for a new legal framework, and for the determination of new criteria which combines fairness, realism, solidarity, cooperation. A quota approach would be combined with a “genuine link” approach, thus trying to find a proper balance between the States’ interests and the point of view (and related behaviors) of asylum seekers, and also between the objections of human rights defenders and the concerns of European public opinion. The need to turn the page with the Dublin age warmly suggests to choose, for the new proposed regulation, a nick name which evokes the features of the current historical (and dramatic) passage of European integration and our deep sense of belonging to a place where much part of our way of thinking and of being a society is rooted: Athens. Having regard to the lessons learnt from decades of regulation of the determination of jurisdiction in civil, commercial and criminal matters, a first step to take is the adoption of a new conception for the role of the asylum seeker, who should be allocated to the State with which he/she holds a substantial link: the configuration of the relevant connecting factors (family relations; economic or social ties) should pay due regard to the empirical dimension of the phenomenon and to the need to avoid unnecessary sufferance and waste of public funds and time. If the asylum seeker has genuine links with more States, a certain relevance to his/her free choice should be awarded. Lacking any connection with a given country, the State with the lowest performance in fulfilling its reference quota should be the competent one. In the same time, an already overburdened country should be afforded the possibility to refuse responsibility, provided that some basic family ties are safeguarded. In such cases, a less connected country should be responsible, or the one less engaged in hosting asylum seekers and refugees, or as extrema ratio the country of first entrance or where the application is lodged. Whether an asylum seeker is allocated to a country where he/she does not have any substantial link and his/her asylum claim receives a positive outcome, the possibility of accepting a genuine job offer in another Member State should be admitted. This way, a partial freedom of circulation for work purposes could be recognized, but its exercise would relieve the <b>first</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> by protection duties. As an accompanying measure, a system of financial incentives/disincentives for Member States should be conceived...|$|E
40|$|The Dublin Regulation {{determines the}} Member State {{responsible}} for accepting {{and making a}} decision on asylum claims lodged in the European Union (‘EU’), Norway and Iceland. It aims to ensure that each asylum claim is examined by one and only one Member State, {{to put an end}} to the practice of ‘asylum shopping’ and to prevent repeated applications, both of which have been costly for the receiving Member States and caused severe inefficiencies in the determination processes in the EU in the past. With the <b>first</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> of entry being the major determinant for the allocation of asylum responsibility under the Dublin Regulation, there has been growing discontent among Member States at the external borders of the EU, particularly the southern Member States in the Mediterranean, over what they see as a system that has unjustly placed disproportionate burdens on them regarding the admission of seaborne asylum seekers and the costs associated with it. As a result of changes in migration rules and consequent adjustments in the entry strategy employed by irregular migrants and people smugglers, the Member States at the EU’s ‘southern frontline’ have unwillingly played the role of reluctant hosts to boatloads of unwelcome asylum seekers. This thesis aims to examine how the EU has attempted to tackle the challenging situation of the unauthorised migration of asylum seekers into its territory by sea, and in particular, how it has responded to demands from affected Member States for a more equitable system of asylum responsibility allocation in spite of and outside the Dublin framework. It would argue that the ‘small’ EU Member States in the Mediterranean themselves have, over the last five years at least, become the unexpected drivers of the EU’s declared commitment to the principles of ‘solidarity’, ‘fair sharing of responsibility’ and ‘effective multilateralism’. ‘ Small’ as they may be in terms of resources, size or influence vis-à-vis the larger Member States, the former have been able to create their own mark in a global regime that has traditionally been resistant to the idea of burden-sharing. The measures taken by the EU’s ‘southern frontline’ have collectively changed the landscape of a global protection regime where not only is asylum ‘burden sharing’ highly elusive – its terms and conditions are also dictated by the more powerful sovereign states. While the theoretical point of departure in this study is the influence wielded by the ‘small’ EU Member States in the burden-sharing debate, the degree or level of ‘influence’ small Mediterranean Member States can exercise in pushing for cooperative arrangements is itself determined by a system that is biased towards large states, increasingly securitised, and is therefore limited in both nature and scope. Nevertheless, the experience of ‘burden-sharing’ in the EU between 2005 and 2010 demonstrates that the Member States at the periphery have proactively taken the responsibility for the operationalisation of the founding values and principles of the EU, and through active norm advocacy and related strategies, have been able to achieve what has eluded the global protection regime so far – a refugee burden sharing scheme...|$|E
40|$|ES piliečių ekstradiciją tarp valstybių narių reguliuoja Europos arešto orderis, o konkrečių ES teisės normų, kurios reguliuotų ES piliečių ekstradiciją į trečiąsias šalis, nėra. Dvišalės valstybių sutartys paprastai reguliuoja tik pasirašiusiųjų valstybių piliečių ekstradicijos procesą, tad ES piliečių ekstradicija į trečiąsias šalis šiuo metu yra „pilkojoje zonoje“. Jei apsauga nuo ekstradicijos taikoma tik šalies piliečiams, atsiranda skirtingas požiūris, palyginti su kitų ES valstybių narių piliečiais, o tai galimai pažeidžia SESV 18 str. įtvirtintą nediskriminacijos principą, kuris draudžia bet kokią diskriminaciją dėl pilietybės, bei SESV 21 str. principą dėl laisvo žmonių judėjimo, kuriuo remiantis kiekvienas ES pilietis turi teisę laisvai judėti ir apsigyventi valstybių narių teritorijoje. Siekiant išsiaiškinti, ar ES valstybių narių ekstradicijos praktika atitinka ES teisės principus, darbe išanalizuota Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo praktika ir išsiaiškinta, jog ES piliečių teisių apribojimas gali būti pateisinamas objektyviomis priežastimis, tik jeigu jos yra būtinos interesų, kuriuos jomis siekiama užtikrinti, apsaugai ir tik tiek, kiek šių tikslų negalima pasiekti mažiau ribojančiomis priemonėmis. ES valstybėms narėms siūloma tokioje situacijoje teikti pirmenybę keitimuisi informacija su ES valstybe nare, kurios pilietis yra asmuo dėl kurio pateiktas trečiosios šalies ekstradicijos prašymas, ir suteikti gimtosios ES valstybės narės valdžios institucijoms galimybę išduoti Europos arešto orderį, jeigu pagal nacionalinę teisę jos gali vykdyti šio asmens baudžiamąjį persekiojimą už nusikaltimus, padarytus už šios valstybės teritorijos ribų. Tokiu atveju, kai teikiama pirmenybė galimam kaltinamojo asmens gimtosios ES valstybės narės Europos arešto orderiui, palyginti su trečiosios šalies ekstradicijos prašymu, priimančioji ES valstybė narė veiktų mažiau ribodama naudojimąsi teise laisvai judėti ir kartu kiek įmanydama pašalintų riziką, kad asmuo liks nenubaustas už nusikaltimą, už kurį yra persekiojamas. Tačiau pažymėtina, kad kreipimasis į ES piliečio kilmės valstybę narę ir siūlymas pasinaudoti Europos arešto orderiu tėra ES valstybėms narėms pasiūlyta „galimybė“, o ne pareiga. Todėl darytina išvada, jog ES piliečių ekstradicija į trečiąsias šalis nepažeidžia nediskriminacijos ir laisvo žmonių judėjimo principų. Extradition between EU {{members is}} governed by European Arrest Warrant, while rules on extradition, in a {{situation}} in which EU has not concluded an agreement on extradition with a third State, falls within the competence of the Member States. In most cases Member States have a nationality exception in their extradition agreements with third States and protect their citizens against foreign punitive systems. But these protective provisions do not include EU citizens of other Member States, therefore it creates situation in which principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement might be violated. This work analyzes EU citizens extradition regulation and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) practice in relevant cases in order to find out whether Article 18 TFEU and Article 21 TFEU should be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of extradition of a citizen of any Member State of the European Union to a non-Member State under an extradition agreement concluded between a Member State and a third country, the same level of protection must be guaranteed as is guaranteed to a citizen of the Member States in question? Three cases have reached CJEU for preliminary rulings and two of them are analyzed in this work in detail, in particular CJEU judgment on 6 September 2016 in Petruhhin case. The questions discussed in Petruhhin case concern the balance between the objectives of extradition agreements (the need to combat impunity), on the one hand, and the need {{to protect the rights of}} the person to be extradited (the EU citizen) under the Treaties. In that case Advocate General Bot delivered an opinion that nationality exception certainly constitutes a difference in treatment prohibited under Art. 18 TFEU. However, it also stated that the risk of impunity is a legitimate objective in EU law, which has to be attained by Member States according to the principle of necessity and proportionality, and thus by “less restrictive measures”. Principle aut dedere aut judicare provides a guidance to identify less restrictive measures, in so far as it allows to extend the protection against extradition to other EU citizens provided that at least one Member State has the jurisdiction to prosecute the offender. Finally, CJEU ruled that when a Member State to which a Union citizen, a national of another Member State, has moved receives an extradition request from a third State with which the <b>first</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> has concluded an extradition agreement, it must inform the Member State of which the citizen in question is a national and, should that Member State so request, surrender that citizen to it, in accordance with the provisions of European Arrest Warrant, provided that that Member State has jurisdiction, pursuant to its national law, to prosecute that person for offences committed outside its national territory. However, it is uncertain how such an approach will function in practice, as further questions arise. For example, whether the State of nationality will actually perform the criminal proceedings in a satisfactory way? Difficulties may arise due to a possible lack of evidence, especially if there is no cooperation with the third State in question on that matter. Furthermore, it is not possible to bind the State of nationality to any specific conclusion of the criminal proceedings in a particular case, and the case may be closed for various reasons before it comes before the court of that State. Even though CJEU has refrained from expressly qualifying the relationship between the principle of non-discrimination and the nationality exception of the extradition agreement as a conflicting one, it confirmed that EU law may still apply to issues falling within the competence of the Member State, such as a bilateral extradition agreement between a Member State and a third State. Furthermore, the CJEU accepts that the host Member State may not need to extend its national provisions protecting its own citizens from extradition to another Member State, if this is necessary to promote the legitimate objective of prevention of impunity. However, host Member State should seek less restrictive ways to achieve this objective and highlights how impunity in such cases may be combated by making use of cooperation mechanisms available in EU, such as the European Arrest Warrant, which enables extradition to the home Member State and thereby avoids unduly compromising citizens’ right to free movement within the EU. Since CJEU did not state that the Member State of nationality is obliged to issue a European Arrest Warrant when it has jurisdiction to prosecute, but merely that it must be given the „opportunity“ to do so, the conclusion of this work is that Member States who extradite EU citizens to third states do not violate principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement...|$|E
