5|$|A thunderstorm, also <b>known</b> <b>as</b> an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm {{characterized by the}} presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, <b>known</b> <b>as</b> thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, <b>known</b> <b>as</b> supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are <b>known</b> <b>as</b> infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved is <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a pathogen.

When the pathogen establishes itself in a step <b>known</b> <b>as</b> colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), also <b>known</b> <b>as</b> {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, <b>known</b> <b>as</b> autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a plasma.|$|E
