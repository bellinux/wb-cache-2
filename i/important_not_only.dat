5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium is <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{for maintaining the}} nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|St Helen's Church was {{designated}} as a Grade I listed building in 1950, recognising it as a building of exceptional interest. It is <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> for the medieval structures that remain, but also for its monuments and fittings. The Victorian restoration is also noted as being of high quality and {{in keeping with the}} older parts of the church.|$|E

5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is <b>important,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
25|$|The {{study is}} <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> because it {{demonstrates}} the ethnocentric media bias, {{but also because}} Entman included polling that appears to show the unbalanced coverage swayed public opinion against the Soviet Union and Iran.|$|E
25|$|During this process, Sweden {{failed to}} secure a {{provision}} that the islands not be fortified. The issue was <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> for Sweden {{but also for the}} United Kingdom, which was concerned that a military presence on the islands could threaten Britain's military and commercial interests.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> to palpate the SDFT but the {{branches}} of the SDFT, the DDFT, check ligament, and suspensory ligament as well. These structures could have been damaged {{at the same time as}} the SDFT. Both legs should be checked, although tendinitis usually only occurs in one leg.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the island was always based almost {{exclusively}} on commerce and services. Due to lack of rain, agriculture is at a subsistence level. Fishing has some relevance, but conditions prevent it from being more <b>important,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> for the catch—lobster—but also for the associated industries: conserves, drying and salting of fish, and naval construction.|$|E

25|$|Viruses are capsid-encoding organisms {{composed}} of proteins and nucleic acids that can self-assemble after replication {{in a host}} cell using the host's replication machinery. There is a disagreement in science about whether viruses are living due to their lack of ribosomes. Comprehending the viral genome is <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> for studies in genetics but also for understanding their pathogenic properties.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{diseases}} that affect dogs are <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> from a veterinary standpoint, {{but also because}} of the risk to public health; an example of this is rabies. Genetic disorders also affect dogs, often due to selective breeding to produce individual dog breeds. Due to the popularity of both commercial and homemade dog foods, nutrition is also a heavily studied subject.|$|E
25|$|Salt domes {{are also}} found in Louisiana. Their origin {{can be traced back}} to the early Gulf of Mexico, when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation. There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most {{familiar}} is Avery Island.

25|$|The {{area and}} its environs are <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> in naturalistic terms, but also anthropologically and historically; {{research}} has highlighted a number of human settlements scattered between Barche di Solferino and Bande di Cavriana, Castellaro and Isolone del Mincio. These dated, without interruption, from Neolithic times (5th–4th millennium BC) to the Bronze Age (2nd–1st millennium BC) and the Gallic phases (2nd–1st centuries BC), and ended with Roman residential settlements, which could {{be traced to the}} 3rdcentury AD.|$|E
25|$|Physicians like al-Razi {{wrote about}} the {{importance}} of morality in medicine, and may have presented, together with Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, the first concept of ethics in Islamic medicine. He felt that it was <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> for the physician to be an expert in his field, but also to be a role model. His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three concepts: the physician's responsibility to patients and to self, and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the pancarte was recopied after {{a number}} of {{additions}} had been made to the original, and this could occasionally lead to errors in chronology, as the additions to the original might have been made without respect to the actual order of the donations. The historian Marjorie Chibnall states that the medieval historian Orderic Vitalis used now lost pancartes of various Norman monastic houses as sources for his historical writings. The surviving pancartes are <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> for their recording of now-lost charters, but also for understanding the history of historical writing.|$|E

25|$|Originally air {{turbulence}} {{was kept}} to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above head height is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are <b>important,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the last}} hundred years, {{more than half of}} the Earth's {{wetlands}} have been destroyed and have disappeared. These wetlands are <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide water filtration and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the Aral Sea in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.|$|E
25|$|Shadows of Yog-Sothoth is <b>important</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{because it}} {{represents}} the first published addition to the boxed first edition of Call of Cthulhu, but because its format defined {{a new way of}} approaching a campaign of linked RPG scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. Its format has been used by every other campaign-length Call of Cthulhu publication. The standard of CoC scenarios was well received by independent reviewers. The Asylum and Other Tales, a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in Issue 47 of White Dwarf magazine.|$|E
