60|$|There is {{no greater}} mistake than to think women cowards because they are {{sometimes}} nervous over trifles. Were it necessary, innumerable cases could be quoted from history to prove that women can, upon occasion, fight as courageously as men. Cæsar found that {{the women of the}} German tribes could fight bravely {{side by side with the}} men, and the Amazons of the King of Dahomey are more feared by the neighboring tribes than are his male soldiers. Almost every siege has its female heroines, and in the Dutch War of Independence the female companies at Sluys and Haarlem proved themselves a match for the best soldiers of Spain. Above all, in patient endurance of pain and suffering, women are immeasurably superior to men. <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> this point because I know that many boys, simply because they are stronger than girls, are apt to regard them with a sort of contempt, and to fancy themselves without the least justification, not only stronger but braver and more courageous--in fact superior beings in every way.|$|E

60|$|As {{soon as we}} were comfortably {{seated in}} our smoking-chairs, which takes longer than some people think, Pettigrew offered me a Cabana. I would have {{preferred}} to begin at once with the tobacco; but of course he was my host, and I put myself entirely in his hands. I noticed that, from the moment his wife left us, he was a little excited, talking more than is his wont. He seemed to think that he was not doing his duty as a host if the conversation flagged for a moment, and what was still more curious, he spoke of everything except his garden tobacco. <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> this here at starting, lest any one should think that I was in any way responsible for the manner in which our experiment was conducted. If fault there was, it lies at Pettigrew's door. I remember distinctly asking him--not in a half-hearted way, but boldly--to produce his tobacco. I did this at an early hour of the proceedings, immediately after I had lighted a second cigar. The reason I took that cigar will be obvious to every gentleman who smokes. Had I declined it, Pettigrew might have thought that I disliked the brand, which would have been painful to him. However, he did not at once bring out the tobacco; indeed, his precise words, I remember, were that we had lots of time. As his guest I could not press him further.|$|E

50|$|Kyrie, I eulogize the archons of the Panethnic Numismatic Thesaurus and the Ecumenical Trapeza for the orthodoxy {{of their}} axioms, methods and policies, {{although}} there is an episode of cacophony of the Trapeza with Hellas. With enthusiasm we dialogue and synagonize at the synods of our didymous organizations in which polymorphous economic ideas and dogmas are analyzed and synthesized. Our critical problems such as the numismatic plethora generate some agony and melancholy. This phenomenon is characteristic of our epoch. But, to my thesis, we have the dynamism to program therapeutic practices as a prophylaxis from chaos and catastrophe. In parallel, a Panethnic unhypocritical economic synergy and harmonization in a democratic climate is basic. I apologize for my eccentric monologue. <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> my euharistia to you, Kyrie to the eugenic and generous American Ethnos and to the organizers and protagonists of his Amphictyony and the gastronomic symposia.|$|E
50|$|In February and 2000, to a {{libel case}} at the British High Court in London against LM magazine. At the {{beginning}} of his summation, High Court Judge Morland defined what the libel case was about: “Members of the jury, you may well think that in a democratic society it is vital that journalists are fearless, investigative reporters. It is, you may well think, of the utmost importance that they are accurate and fair reporters. It is right that one journalist, if he considers that another journalist has been inaccurate, unfair and misleading, should say so. But this case, you may think, is not about whether Penny Marshall and Ian Williams have been inaccurate, unfair or misleading; the nub of this case is whether the defendants have established that Penny Marshall and Ian Williams have deliberately - <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> that word, 'deliberately’ - compiled misleading television footage.’” LM could not prove such a deliberate mistake and lost the case.|$|E

In this intestinal field there are thousands of gastroentromologists that study cancer or colitis or Crohn’s Disease, but there are very few, if any, labs studying normal tissue, which is amazing because that is a tissue that we use every five days.

5000|$|Nevertheless, in rejecting {{morality}} {{as a form}} {{of natural}} law outside of human enactments, and superior to them, Holmes was not rejecting moral principles that were the result of enforceable law. [...] "The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law." [...] Holmes insistence on the material basis of law, on the facts of a case, has led some to characterize him as unfeeling, however.

5000|$|Lee {{changed the}} kicking stance of the US athletes. He {{shortened}} the length, lifted {{the heel of}} the back foot and placed 51% of the weight on the front foot. This new kicking stance was revolutionary for sparring. A Taekwondo athlete could move much faster forward and backward and to the side. Additionally, the stance had an added advantage of allowing for a quicker and greater variety of kicks, especially the spinning kicks, which were becoming more popular in the 1980s. According to Lee: [...] "When we competed in the 1960's, we could make points with our first or second kick. But these days, the athletes are very fast and they kick continuously- now {{you need to use}} four and five kick combinations {{in order to make a}} point. That is why <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> the short, unstable stance in bringing the leg back fast after each kick, so that you can get ready for the next one while keeping your balance forward so that you can kick continuously and quickly." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{offers his}} {{students}} [...] "challenging questions {{for which the}} solution {{is by no means}} apparent". For example, when teaching students about topology, he asked students if it is [...] "possible to take a cord of rope 6 ft long and tie it snugly around your right ankle and your left ankle, take off your pants, turn them inside out, and put your pants back on without ever cutting the rope?" [...] He proceeded to demonstrate the solution to that challenge, wearing huge Boston Red Sox boxer shorts under his trousers, at the Boston Public Library in the summer of 2005. He believes that failure is closely tied to creativity: In all my courses, <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> the power of failure: learning from failed attempts and taking risks. Five percent of students’ final grades are based on their narrative of failure: how they learned from their failed attempts. I judge the quality of their failure {{by the size of the}} risk they’ve taken and the amount of insight they have generated from their mistakes. I do that as an invitation to the student to take risks, to try ideas without fear of failure.|$|E

5000|$|Holmes, also {{insisted on}} the {{separation}} of ought and is which are obstacles in understanding {{the realities of the}} law. As an ethical sceptic, Holmes tells us {{that if you want to}} know the real law, and nothing else, you must consider it from the point of view of bad man who cares only from material consequences of the courts decisions, and not from the point of view of good man, who find his reasons for conduct [...] "in the vaguer sanctions of his conscience. The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and talks about rights and duties, malice, intent, and negligence- and nothing is easier in legal reasoning than to take these words in their moral sense. Holmes said: [...] "I think our morally tinted words have caused a great deal of confused thinking. But Holmes is not unconcerned with moral question.

50|$|Kyrie, it is Zeus' {{anathema}} on our epoch for the {{dynamism of}} our economies and the heresy {{of our economic}} methods and policies that we should agonize the Scylla of numismatic plethora and the Charybdis of economic anaemia. It is not my idiosyncrasy to be ironic or sarcastic, but my diagnosis would be that politicians are rather cryptoplethorists. Although they emphatically stigmatize numismatic plethora, they energize it through their tactics and practices. Our policies have to be based more on economic and less on political criteria. Our gnomon {{has to be a}} metron between political, strategic and philanthropic scopes. Political magic has always been anti-economic. In an epoch characterized by monopolies, oligopolies, monopsonies, monopolistic antagonism and polymorphous inelasticities, our policies have to be more orthological. But this should not be metamorphosed into plethorophobia, which is endemic among academic economists. Numismatic symmetry should not hyper-antagonize economic acme. A greater harmonization between the practices of the economic and numismatic archons is basic. Parallel to this, we have to synchronize and harmonize more and more our economic and numismatic policies panethnically. These scopes are more practicable now, when the prognostics of the political and economic barometer are halcyonic. The history of our didymus organizations in this sphere has been didactic and their gnostic practices will always be a tonic to the polyonymous and idiomorphous ethnical economies. The genesis of the programmed organization will dynamize these policies. Therefore, I sympathize, although not without criticism on one or two themes, with the apostles and the hierarchy of our organs in their zeal to program orthodox economic and numismatic policies, although I have some logomachy with them. I apologize for having tyrannized you with my Hellenic phraseology. In my epilogue, <b>I</b> <b>emphasize</b> my eulogy to the philoxenous autochthons of this cosmopolitan metropolis and my encomium to you, Kyrie, and the stenographers.|$|E
