40|$|Seasonal {{measurements}} {{from three}} field seasons on first-year ice are summarized. Results {{showed that the}} properties of first-year ice change dramatically during summer melt. The ice had reached an isothermal state by mid-June and, by mid-July, the ice was nearly devoid of salt throughout its full thickness. First-year ice had 12 % of its mid-winter strength by mid-July. Strength remained at that level until measurements were concluded three weeks later. Measurements on old ice were conducted in June and August. Second year ice behaves much like first-year ice during the decay season, in that it had only 19 % of its mid-winter strength in August. Two multi-year floes were sampled in June (each about 5 m thick) and another floe in August (over 6 m thick). In June, ice salinity was less than 2 ‰ {{to a depth of}} 1. 4 m. The strength of the multi-year ice was 56 % and 47 % of its maximum mid-winter strength (30 MPa) in June and August, respectively. The <b>floeberg</b> ice was so-called because it was about 30 m thick, was extremely level and the extracted 1. 2 m core had no measurable salinity. In June, the temperature profile of the <b>floeberg</b> ice showed that ice above a depth of 1. 6 m was warmer than – 2 °C, whereas below that depth the ice was – 6. 8 °C.

50|$|The most {{important}} auxiliary sea ice observation is {{the location of}} the ice edge. Its value reflects both the importance of the ice edge location in general and the difficulty of accurately locating the ice edge with remotely sensed data. It is also useful to provide a description of the ice edge in terms of indications of freezing or thawing, wind-driven advance or retreat, and compactness or diffuseness. Other important auxiliary information includes {{the location of the}} icebergs, <b>floebergs,</b> ice islands, old ice, ridging and hummocking. These ice features are poorly monitored by remote sensing techniques but are very important aspects of the ice cover.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Since m/s "SOYA" {{had reached}} the ice edge on Dec. 27, 1959 at 65 ° 152 ̆ 7 S, 48 ° 352 ̆ 7 E, the {{officers}} on watch carried out continuous visual ice observations, {{under the supervision of}} the navigating officer, until the ship left the ice off Riiser-Larsen Peninsula on Feb. 21, 1960. The items of observation were nearly identical with those of the previous three expeditions. As the ship was not bound with drift ice, several surveying cruises were performed between 33 °E and 50 °E and eleven oceanographic stations were set up in the region. Miscellaneous observations other than general, for instance, observations on the drift of ice field and icebergs, were also made on occasion. 1. Some comments on ice terminology and recording form Several terms were supplemented to the WMO ice terminology mainly from Russian source. Terms were rearranged and compiled in "A glossary of ice terminology to be used in JARE". An example of supplemented terms is secondary slush, which is a combined conception of melting sludge in Baltic ice code and ledyanaya podushka in Russian terminology. Observed items were nearly identical with those required by the U. S. Hydrographic Office 2 ̆ 7 s reporting form. Obtained results were compiled in ice charts. Notations used in charts were also similar to those of the U. S. Hydrographic Office. However, the following changes were made both in observed items and in chart notations in order to describe encountered ice conditions more adequately: a) The size of predominant floes was recorded by nearest meters as the index of mechanical decaying. The item "puddling" seems to be insufficient to describe the dacaying state of Antarctic drift ice which decays mechanically before puddles have developed on it. Another index of mechanical decaying such as whether floes have angular or smooth outlines should have been recorded. b) Inter-ice melting sludge was excluded from the first group in the item "concentration by size" and its existence was indicated by a prefix Sl. Though it is difficult to distinguish between ice cakes and melting sludge from the air, the ship observer must distinguish them because the latter behaves quite differently from the former during the compression or the dispersion of an ice field. Melting sludge, if exists, usually covers inter-ice area completely. The compression (or dispersion) of the ice field, not causing hummocking (or formation of open water), only changes the thickness of sludge. The latter, which has important effects on the navigability, should have been recorded at least qualitatively. 2. General ice observations 2 a) Note on observation practice. Separate measurements of snowdepth and ice thickness were difficult because the boundary was not clear to identify whether it is porous ice or firnized snow. For convenience 2 ̆ 7 sake, the upper layer easily separable by turning over floes was regarded as snow. In this sense, most floes were covered by snow 0. 3 - 0. 5 m thick. Estimation of the age of floes was also difficult. The age of little hummocked floes was estimated by their thickness, as usually done. But, this method seemed inadequate for summer ice, for level ice less than 1 m thick often had two planktonrich brown thin layers. 2 b) Ice conditions along ice edges and 2 c) Those in ice field. Main results are shown in Figs. 1 - 10. Along edges, ice cakes were predominant and inter-ice area was usually covered by melting sludge. If the edge was under the dispersing effect of wind, there appeared along it a narrow region of a small ice concentration composed only of brashes (no melting sludge). Newly developed ice fields composed of small pancake ice were only seen after the middle of February. On Jan. 21 giant clusters of <b>floebergs</b> were seen at 45 ° 302 ̆ 7 E on the edge. Vast and big floes encountered in the region south of 67 ° 202 ̆ 7 S during the first penetration of the ship into ice area were probably fragments of the shore ice. The heights of reliefs on them were more than 3 m, but the fraction of hummocked area was rather small (2 / 10 - 3 / 10). 2 d) The shore ice off the western part of the Prince Olav Coast and the lead off the edge of the shose ice. Although the width of the lead on 40 °E meridian had narrowed from several kilometers on Jan. 3 to several hundred meters on Jan. 15 and finally the lead disappeared on Feb. 4, the position of the edge did not change during the observation period (Jan. 3 -Feb. 10). The constant position of the edge must have some relations with the bottom relief (the sea suddenly deepens northward from about 300 m to 1000 m at several kilometers north of the edge). Along the edge there was a hummocked narrow zone (2 - 3 km wide). South of the zone there was another a little wider zone (less than 20 km wide) where sasturgi running NEN-WSW were developed. Farther south the surface was flat. Puddles were developed little even in the beginning of February. 3. Miscellaneous observations 3 a) Icebergs. The first iceberg was seen at 53 ° 092 ̆ 7 S, 32 ° 172 ̆ 7 E on Dec. 23, 1959 and the last at 54 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 25 ° 102 ̆ 7 E on Feb. 26, 1960. The largest iceberg which was observed off Cape Ann was supposed to be identical with the vast iceberg observed by Russian ice breaker "LENA" at 65 ° 402 ̆ 7 S, 88 ° 142 ̆ 7 E on Feb. 16, 1957. 3 b) Drift of icebergs. Only the drifts in the lead were analyzed showing the existence of a current of about 0. 3 knot there (Table 1). 3 c) Drift of ice field. From Jan. 22 to Jan. 27 the ship drifted in an ice field composed of 50...|$|R
