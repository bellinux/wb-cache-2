40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the development and performance tests of a contact-free fingerprint sensor, TrueFinger 3 D (TF 3 D). This contactless fingerprint sensor is designed to be perfectly interoperable with fingerprint image data captured with contact-based sensors or <b>ink</b> <b>pads.</b> This is achieved by acquiring a 3 D dataset of the fingertip together with the image of the papillary lines. Based on the 3 D data, the papillary lines image can be processed to compensate perspective foreshortening or even emulate deformation effects caused with contact-based sensors. The 3 D measurement mechanism and the image processing are described in detail. The resulting fingerprint images taken by the contactless sensor are then matched with images taken by regular contact-based fingerprint readers at different force levels. The comparison shows that the geometric distortion of our contactless sensor TF 3 D is comparable to that of contact-based sensors deployed under regular conditions. Our test also shows that contact -based sensors operated under irregular or strong force conditions suffer from a substantial performance degradation, not seen with the contactless sensor TF 3 D, which has perfect reproducibility. The results also indicate perfect interoperability of the TF 3 D with any contact-based data and should therefore entitle the sensor to a certification for governmental use...|$|R

Objective: The present study was conducted to observe and compare the differences in the dermatoglyphic patterns between cleft lip/palate (CL/P) and normal healthy children and evaluate their associated dental findings. Setting: This is a cross-sectional prevalence study in which dermatoglyphic patterns and dental anomalies of 90 (CL/P) and normal healthy children aged 0 - 15 years were recorded under standard conditions of seating and lighting. Materials and Methods: Dermatoglyphic traits were recorded using <b>ink</b> stamp <b>pad</b> method. Dental findings were recorded through clinical and radiographic examination. Results: The most frequently seen dermatoglyphic trait in the study and control group was loops followed by whorls and arches. A highly significant (P < 0. 001) difference between loops in the study and control group and statistically significant difference in the whorls (P = 0. 001) were found using Student′s t-test.

Bilateral footprints were obtained from 126 Ghanaian students (66 males and 60 females) aged 18 - 30 years at Koforidua Polytechnic using an <b>ink</b> <b>pad</b> and white papers. Seven dimensions-length of each toe (designated T 1 -T 5) from the most anterior point of the toe to the mid-rear heel point, breadth at ball (BAB) and breadth at heel (BAH) [...] and the heel-ball (HB) index were obtained from each footprint. Some footprint dimensions (i. e. T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5) showed statistically significant bilateral asymmetry in males only. All the footprint dimensions, except HB index, were significantly greater in males than females (p< 0. 001). Applied singly in discriminant function analysis, the footprint dimensions allowed 69. 8 %- 80. 3 % of cases to be correctly classified into their sex groups; the accuracy of sex classification was higher using left footprints than right footprints. With all dimensions subjected to stepwise discriminant function analysis 80. 3 % and 77 % of cases could be correctly classified, combining both T 5 and BAH for left footprints and T 1, BAB and BAH for left footprints respectively.

40|$|Ireland is {{currently}} undergoing the largest extension to the National road network in recent years. For this reason, {{the number of}} crossing structures for wildlife on the Irish National road network has increased markedly within the last few years. In Ireland, the structures are targeted at protected species whose habitat is directly disturbed by road construction. In general, the target species are otters (Lutra lutra) and badgers (Meles meles). However, structures {{have been put in}} place for red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris); i. e., rope ladders linking trees on opposite sides of a motorway and the first structures for pine martens (Martes martes) and bats will be put in place in the coming year. Bat boxes and bird boxes have also been fitted on the tunnel ceilings of oversized arched culverts with mammal ledges. Underpasses and overpasses (potential green bridges) have been constructed where farms have been bisected by new road schemes. These structures allow for the safe passage of domestic cattle over the road carriageway, but may also be utilized by wildlife, for example, red deer (Cervus elaphus) and other smaller wildlife species. Non-target native species which can utilise these structures are: red deer (Cervus elaphus), the indigenous Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus), stoat (Mustela erminea hibernica), fox (Vulpes vulpes), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and field or wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Non-native species which could potentially utilize such structures include: Sika deer (Cervus nippon), fallow deer (Cervus dama), brown hare (Lepus europaeus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus (musculus) domesticus), bank vole (Clethrionomys Glareolus), feral ferret (Mustela furo), American mink (Mustela vison), and domestic cats and dogs, amongst other introduced species. This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of crossing structures in Ireland. An initial pilot study monitoring the use of crossing structures on the Watergrasshill By-Pass, County Cork, Ireland, revealed encouraging results as the following species were found to utilize oversized arched culverts with mammal ledges: otter, fox, rabbit, pygmy shrew and wood mouse. Tracking tools utilized include: <b>ink</b> <b>pads,</b> sand beds, and infrared cameras. The initial pilot study was expanded to monitor crossing structures on a national scale in order to examine: (A) how effective are the culverts at providing passage for the target species? and (B) to what extent are cow under- and overpasses being utilised by wildlife? More specifically, the study is also currently examining: (1) with what frequency are the various passages being utilized?; (2) what non-target species utilize these passages?; (3) does the design of the fauna pipe (dimensions) affect utilization of the passage? e. g., are shorter pipes or longer pipes or small diameter (600 mm) or large diameter pipes (900 mm) more frequently used?; (4) does the presence of hedgerow planting enhance use of passage structures? (5) what kind of pipes do smaller species have a preference for? It is intended that {{the results of the study}} will provide valuable information which could improve the layout, design, and maintenance of future crossing structures to be put in place on national road schemes in Ireland, and indeed, in other countries...|$|R
