[...] He {{came out of the}} control booth and he had a couple of bikers - bikers hung around with him a lot, some pretty tough looking {{customers}} - and I'd had enough. [...] I just said, 'Hey Waylon!' [...] And he turned. [...] I said, 'I got these songs that you claimed you was gonna listen to, and if you don't listen to 'em I'm gonna whip your ass right here in front of everybody.' And boy, whew. [...] Man! [...] Everything got quiet and them old boys started formin' and Waylon stopped 'em. [...] He said, 'Hoss, you don't know how close you come to gettin' killed.' [...] I said, 'Well, I've had enough.

6000|$|Alton {{laughed a}} little. [...] "Well," [...] he said dryly, [...] "it {{seems to me}} that the poor man should do a little of the holding off himself.

[...] She pressed her lips {{together}} and fastened one hand firmly on the other. If the assurance that was required from her was ever to be exacted, it should not be exacted by Serjeant Bluestone. [...] "I have seen his lordship to-day," [...] continued the Serjeant, [...] "and he has done me the honour to promise that he will dine here to-morrow." ...|$|E

[...] "I like you very much--I always have--and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> seriously. All of us have friends. Some people--you, for instance--have a great many.

[...] "No friend can ever be the same to you as your father, and no {{friendship}} can make up what his displeasure will cost you. I do not mean to say that I shan't always be your friend, for I shall be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} to finish, partner, because there's a reason you should hear it all. By and by Father Herman had to nurse us both, and when I got better Hattie died. We buried her by torchlight in the dusty mission yard--she was a Catholic--you'll see the marble cross. I've been lonely ever since, and that's partly why I sent for you; Peter came next to Hattie and you are Peter's son. Now I'm ready to pull out and somehow I think Hattie will find me when I'm {{wandering}} in the dark. Love like hers is strong. But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> when you have given me another drink." ...|$|E

I’ve taken up a good many risky deals and put them through, fighting the men who meant to down me as best I could; but all my business hasn’t been a raid on somebody else’s property. In fact, you can’t play the bold pirate too often. Very well; now and then, when I was doing an innocent trade, I wanted a respectable associate {{as a kind of}} guarantee, and asked your father to stand in. He’s known as a straight man, and my having him helped to disarm suspicion; I’ll admit that I found him useful in that respect. I hope I’ve said enough to satisfy you?” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, my dear, if I were to {{say that}} I accused you, perhaps you would {{misunderstand}} me. I hope--I thoroughly expect, that before I leave you, I {{may be able to}} say that I do not accuse you. If you will only listen to me patiently for a few minutes, Margaret--which I couldn't get you to do, you know, before you went away from the Cedars in that very extraordinary manner--I think I can explain to you something which--" [...] Here Lady Ball became embarrassed, and paused; but Margaret gave her no assistance, and therefore she began a new sentence.

You weren't quite awake then, and must have been dreaming you were a boy again. You are awake now, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to me. I have come from Stella and Lucy to their old playmate, and to my old friend's son. They know that I am {{going to bring you}} home with me, and you will find them as ready with a welcome {{as they were in the}} old days. I want you to come to my house and stay until you are {{yourself}} again, and as much longer as you will. We heard of your being down in the world, and in the midst of temptation, and we agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more. Will you come, my boy? Will you drop our old family trouble and come with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now, Harold, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to me. You know, my dear boy, that I am your father's oldest friend, {{and right}} sure I am {{that he would}} approve of what I say. You must come home with me to live. I know that in his last hours the great concern of your dear father's heart {{would have been for}} the future of his boy. And I know, too, that it was a comfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends, and that the son of my dearest old friend would be as a son to me. We have been friends, you and I, a long time, Harold; and we have learned to trust, and I hope to love, one another. And you and my little Stephen are such friends already that your coming into the house will be a joy to us all. Why, long ago, when first you came, she said to me the night you went away: [...] "Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?"' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But don't you see, little girl, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> love me," [...] {{he hurried}} on.
