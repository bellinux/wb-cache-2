5|$|There were {{multiple}} {{reports of}} looting during {{the fire and}} in its aftermath, both of businesses and private residences.

5|$|While in Congress, Ferraro focused {{much of her}} {{legislative}} {{attention on}} equity {{for women in the}} areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans. She was a cosponsor of the 1981 Economic Equity Act. On the House Select Committee on Aging, she concentrated on the problems of <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> In 1984, she championed a pension equity law revision that would improve the benefits of people who left work for long periods and then returned, a typical case for women with families. The Reagan administration, at first lukewarm to the measure, decided to sign it to gain the benefits of its popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|A devout Buddhist from youth, {{once her}} {{children}} {{had grown up}} Ho decided to serve the Buddhist cause, and to dedicate {{the rest of her}} life to caring for others. In 1958, she became a Buddhist nun at the age of 50. In 1969, aged 61, Ho bought a two-storey detached house in Richards Avenue with her savings, and turned it into the Man Fut Tong Old Peoples' Home for aged sick and single <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> Most of the 20 or so residents had neither enough earnings to support themselves nor any relatives to turn to. To raise additional funds for the home, she cultivated and sold prize-winning white orchids at Tanglin, and vegetarian food at Kong Meng San Temple in Bishan. She cleaned, cooked, took her charges to the doctors, helped them to collect their social benefits and even sometimes saw to their last rites.|$|E

In addition, Bean turns up the music playing on the store's intercom, to make it harder for her to be heard. Ultimately, she falls backward.|$|R
5000|$|... 26 {{states were}} affected, {{with at least}} 200 cases of the disease being {{reported}} as of December 23, 2006.

A fourth death of an <b>elderly</b> <b>woman</b> in Maryland is still under investigation to determine if it is linked to this outbreak. Spinach has also been distributed to Canada and Mexico; one case has been reported in Canada. There have been over 400 produce-related outbreaks in North America since 1990.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two <b>elderly</b> <b>women,</b> killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, {{the company}} met {{to debate the}} wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were {{unfamiliar}} with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the <b>elderly,</b> <b>women</b> and young children would lead to suffering, sickness and even death. All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, {{perhaps as many as}} 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.|$|E

5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in care homes. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Olga was {{genuinely}} popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, her immediate patronages included the Amalieion orphanage {{founded by the}} previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support {{and the support of}} wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the Evangelismos (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.|$|E

25|$|The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, {{the ratio}} of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due {{primarily}} to the high median age of the population (<b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> are more common than elderly men).

25|$|The 16th century {{also saw}} the height of witch-hunts in Europe, and Switzerland was no exception.

These often ended with death sentences (usually burning) for the accused, who typically were <b>elderly</b> <b>women,</b> crippled persons, or other social outcasts.|$|E
