40|$|Research {{questions}} in several research domains imply the simultaneous analysis of different blocks {{of information that}} pertain to the same research objects. In personality psychology, for example, to study the relation between individual differences in behavior and cognitive-affective units that can account for these differences, two types of information pertaining to {{the same set of}} persons need to be analyzed simultaneously: (1) information about the situation-specific behavior profile of these persons, and (2) information about the cognitive-affective units these persons exhibit. When dealing with such coupled data blocks (i. e., different N-way N-mode data blocks that have one or more modes in common) it often happens that one data block is much larger in size than the other(s). In this case, the question arises whether the <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> or the <b>data</b> blocks should be considered as the units of information, in order to disclose the true structure underlying the coupled data blocks. To answer this question, two weighting schemes are compared that are obtained by applying weights in the overall objective function that is to be optimized in the data analysis, with each weight indicating {{the extent to which the}} corresponding data block influences the integrated analysis. In a simulation study it is showed that weighting the different data blocks such that each <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> influences the analysis to the same extent (i. e., <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> as <b>units</b> of information) outperforms a weighting scheme in which each data block has an equal influence on the analysis (i. e., data blocks as units of information). This superior performance is demonstrated for two global models for coupled data consisting of a three-way three-mode data block and a two-way two-mode data block that have one mode in common: (1) a multiway multiblock component model for coupled real-valued data, and (2) a simultaneous clustering model for coupled binary data. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Use of {{electronic}} health record (EHR) systems can place a considerable <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden upon {{the emergency department}} (ED) physician. Voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> has been proposed as one mechanism to mitigate some of this burden; however, no reports are available specifically comparing emergency physician (EP) time use or number of interruptions between typed and voice recognition data entry-based EHRs. We designed this study to compare physician time use and interruptions between an EHR system using typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus an EHR with voice recognition. Methods: We collected prospective observational data at 2 academic teaching hospital EDs, one using an EHR with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> {{and the other with}} voice recognition capabilities. Independent raters observed EP activities during regular shifts. Tasks each physician performed were noted and logged in 30 second intervals. We compared time allocated to charting, direct patient care, and change in tasks leading to interruptions between sites. Results: We logged 4, 140 minutes of observation for this study. We detected no statistically significant differences in the time spent by EPs charting (29. 4 % typed; 27. 5 % voice) or the time allocated to direct patient care (30. 7 %; 30. 8 %). Significantly more interruptions per hour were seen with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (5. 33 vs. 3. 47; p= 0. 0165). Conclusion: The use of a voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> system versus typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> did not appear to alter the amount of time physicians spend charting or performing direct patient care in an ED setting. However, we did observe a lower number of workflow interruptions with the voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> EHR. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden in the ED and examine alternative mechanisms for chart entry as EHR systems continue to evolve.
