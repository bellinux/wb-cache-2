25|$|Shalit's captors {{issued a}} {{statement}} the following day, offering information on Shalit if Israel were to agree to release all female Palestinian prisoners and all Palestinian prisoners {{under the age of}} 18. The statement was issued by the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades,</b> the Popular Resistance Committees (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas), and a previously unknown group calling itself the Army of Islam.|$|E
25|$|Early on 25 June 2006, Palestinian militants {{from the}} <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades,</b> Popular Resistance Committees, and Army of Islam crossed into Israel from the Gaza Strip through an {{underground}} tunnel near Kerem Shalom, and attacked an IDF post. Two Israeli {{soldiers were killed}} and another two, apart from Shalit, were wounded. Two of the attacking Palestinian militants were also killed. Shalit suffered a broken left hand and a light shoulder wound, and the militants captured him and took him via a tunnel into Gaza.|$|E
25|$|On June 26, Shalit's captors {{issued a}} series of {{statements}} demanding the release of all female Palestinian prisoners and all Palestinian prisoners {{under the age of}} 18. The statements came from <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades</b> (the military wing of Palestinian governing party Hamas), the Popular Resistance Committees (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas), and the Army of Islam. More than 8,000 Palestinians were being held as prisoners by Israel. Approximately two-thirds of these prisoners were convicted in court, while around ten percent were held without charge.|$|E
50|$|Sheikh Tawfiq Ibrahim, one of {{the leaders}} of the 1936-39 Arab revolt in Palestine and an {{associate}} of <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam,</b> was from Indur.|$|R

25|$|From its {{inception}} in 2002, the Initiative deeply divided the organization. As stated before, members of the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades,</b> Hamas' military wing, committed the Passover Massacre on same day as the peace Initiative's adoption. At that time, Hamas rejected not only peace with Israel but even negotiations with it. The official administration of Hamas never recognized the Initiative, which alienated it {{from members of the}} Arab League, especially Jordan and Egypt. One of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' conditions of forming a national coalition government with Hamas after the 2006 election was that Hamas had to recognize the Initiative, but he was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|During Ramadan, al-Manar {{features}} special programs, many {{of which}} are self-produced. In 2001, Izz al-Din al-Qassam: Qisat al-jihad wa al-muqawama (Izz al-Din al-Qassam: A Story of Jihad and Resistance), a four-part drama based on the life of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, an early-twentieth-century Arab, after whom the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades</b> are named. It was considered a success among Palestinians. The 2002 program Faris bi la jawad (A Knight without a Horse), which was produced by an Egyptian, was based on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an old Russian anti-Semitic text claiming a conspiracy of Jews control the world, like many programs of the station. The 29-part series Ash-Shatat (The Diaspora), which was aired in 2003, was also based on The Protocols and produced in Syria; it led to the banning of al-Manar in France.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1919-20 {{revolt against}} French rule in Syria, Zanqufa {{was used as}} a base of guerrilla {{operations}} and training by rebel leader <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam.</b>|$|R

25|$|Abu Tir {{was born}} in Umm Tuba, a present {{neighborhood}} in East Jerusalem. Abu Tir joined Fatah {{some time in the}} early 1970s. Around this time, he was convicted of terror-related activities in Israel and subsequently joined the Muslim Brotherhood. He spent nearly 25 years in Israeli prisons, on and off, for directing terror activities against Israel, including the attempted poisoning in the early 1990s of Israel's water supplies and for directing the activities of Hamas's military arm, the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades.</b> In 2005, prior to the elections, he was released after serving a term of nearly seven years in prisons. After his release, he was recruited by Hamas to head its national list following its Gaza leader, Ismail Haniyeh. He was most recently arrested and later detained for campaigning near Jerusalem's Damascus Gate after violating a ban that forbade the practice. He was interrogated and later released. The incident transformed Tir into a minor celebrity among the public in his constituency. This incident, in the end, contributed positively to his overall campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{accusation}} that Israel employs dolphins for espionage {{was made on}} August 19, 2015 when the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades</b> of Hamas claimed they captured one wearing cameras and other equipment off the Gaza coast.|$|E
2500|$|According to Muhammad Abdel-El of the Hamas-allied Popular Resistance Committees, Hamas and {{its allies}} have {{captured}} quantities of foreign intelligence, including CIA files. Abu Abdullah of Hamas' [...] "military wing", the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades,</b> claims Hamas will make portions of the documents public, in a stated attempt to expose covert relations between the United States and [...] "traitor" [...] Arab countries.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 June 2007, a {{year after}} Shalit's capture, the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades</b> {{released}} an [...] in which Shalit is heard {{sending a message to}} his family, friends, and the Israeli government and army, and appealing for a prisoner-swap deal to be reached to secure his release. Shalit said that his medical condition was deteriorating, and that he required immediate and lengthy hospitalization.|$|E
2500|$|Each leader {{must take}} into account the {{approval}} of his counterpart, of both people, of the United Nations, the United States and the Arab world. The Palestinian President also has to deal with the Fatah and Hamas and the Israeli Prime Minister with the Yesha Council (representing the settlers) and all the Palestinian militant organisations (such as the Islamic Jihad, the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades</b> and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades).|$|E
2500|$|For example, in July 2002 the Israeli Defense Forces {{carried out}} an air strike {{targeting}} Salah Shahade, {{the commander of}} <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades,</b> the military wing of Hamas, in a densely populated residential area of Gaza City. [...] The night-time bombing resulted {{in the deaths of}} 15 persons, nine of whom were children, and the injury of 150 others. According to the Israeli government, Shehade was {{responsible for the deaths of}} hundreds of Israeli civilians, and earlier Israel asked the Palestinian Authority to arrest him but no action was taken. [...] Israel maintains that Shehade was in the process of preparing another large-scale attack inside Israel and thereby constituted a [...] "ticking bomb".|$|E
50|$|On 3 January 2009, Israeli {{aircraft}} {{attacked the}} car in which Abu Zakaria al-Jamal, a leader of <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> armed wing, was traveling. He subsequently died of the wounds suffered in the bombing.|$|R

50|$|During {{his time}} in Haifa, he became a close disciple of the Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-British rebel <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam.</b> As part of his efforts against British rule, Abu Durra {{actively}} sought recruits to join an armed struggle led by al-Qassam.|$|R
2500|$|Hamas' Lebanon {{representative}} Osama Hamdan {{said that}} it was likely Israel was targeting the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades.</b> The Brigades asserted that the Israeli [...] "occupation has opened the doors of hell." [...] Other militant factions, such as the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) also denounced the killing of Jabari and vowed retaliation. The PIJ said it would [...] "respond fiercely" [...] to Jabari's death, calling it an [...] "act of war." [...] Member of the PLO Executive Committee, Saeb Erekat, condemned the [...] "Israeli crime and assassination of Jabari." [...] Angry protests erupted around the Shifa Hospital, where Jabari was taken, following news of his death, with members of Hamas demanding retaliation.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Shuja'iyya {{occurred}} between the Israel Defense Forces, the Hamas military wing, and the <b>Izz</b> <b>ad-Din</b> <b>al-Qassam</b> <b>Brigades,</b> on 20 July 2014 during 2014 Israel–Gaza {{conflict in the}} Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City, in the Gaza Strip. Shuja'iyya, with 92,000 people in 6 sq-kilometres, {{is one of the}} most densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip. According to the IDF, it had become a [...] "terrorist fortress", that between 8 and 20 of July had fired over 140 rockets into Israel after the outbreak of hostilities.

[...] One security source {{said that it is}} believed that they have delivered [...] "indirect logistical support" [...] to a radical group located in the Sinai, which perpetrated the attack. [...] Palestinian Authority security forces said that the three men are Raed Attar, Ayman Nofal, and Muhammad Abu-Shamalah. [...] Attar is the commander of the brigades in Gaza, and was involved in the abduction of Gilad Shalit in 2006. [...] Although Hamas was willing to deliver the senior Hamas members to Egypt, the men refused, saying that they were scared of being tortured by the Egyptian authorities, but they agreed to allow Egyptian intelligence authorities question them in Gaza.|$|E
