5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up with TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could see it was him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October, the {{prosecution}} demanded that De G. receive fourteen years' imprisonment, asserting that De G. {{could not have}} had consensual sex with Nicole, arguing that she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a relationship. On 21 November, De G. {{was found guilty of}} rape and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. In determining the penalty, the court took into account the finding that De G. was legally insane {{at the time of the}} crime. De G. was acquitted of manslaughter on the basis of the possibility that another of the three people whose DNA was found, who was never affirmatively identified, was involved in the death.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} {{nineteen}} Isaac {{was sent}} to the Academy of Geneva, where he read Greek under Franciscus Portus a Cretan. Portus died in 1581, recommending Casaubon, then only twenty-two, as his successor. He remained at Geneva as professor of Greek until 1596. There he married twice, his second wife being Florence Estienne, daughter of the scholar-printer Henri Estienne. At Geneva, Casaubon lacked example, encouragement and assistance and struggled against the troops of the Catholic dukes of Savoy, but became a consummate Greek and classical scholar. He spent all the money he could spare on books, including copying classics that were not then in print. Even though Henri Estienne, Theodore de Beza (rector of the university and professor of theology), and Jacques Lect (Lectius), were men of superior learning, they often <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Casaubon.|$|E

25|$|David Ervine was the {{youngest}} of five children born to Walter and Elizabeth Ervine, and raised in a Protestant working-class area of east Belfast between the Albertbridge and Newtownards roads. His household was not loyalist at all, his father Walter described himself as a socialist, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Ian Paisley and didn't attend church. When Ervine joined the Orange Order aged 18, he said he was the first member of his family to ever be a member. His membership however didn't last long. Like many in his situation, he grew up closely identifying with his community and absorbed the Ulster Unionism ideals and opinions that go along with this identity. He left Orangefield High School at 14, and at the age of 19 Ervine joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), believing this to {{be the only way to}} ensure the defence of the Protestant community after the events of Bloody Friday. A neighbour of Ervine's who was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) William Irvine, had died in one of the bomb blasts on Bloody Friday.|$|E
500|$|Another general {{attitude}} and prejudice of Fleming's that Bond gives voice to includes {{his approach to}} homosexuality. While Fleming {{had a number of}} gay friends, including Noël Coward and his editor, William Plomer, he said that his books were [...] "written for warm-blooded heterosexuals". His attitude went further, with Bond opining that homosexuals were [...] "a herd of unhappy sexual misfits – barren and full of frustrations, the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied", adding that [...] "he was sorry for them, but he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them." ...|$|E
500|$|This led to what Hanbury Brown {{describes}} as [...] "the great minimum range controversy". From October 1939, {{working around the}} clock to install the remaining Mk.

They were aware that the minimum range was still greater than was satisfactory but Bowen and Hanbury Brown were convinced there was a simple solution they could implement once the initial installations were completed. Meanwhile, the current sets continued to be installed, although all were aware of their problems. On 24 January 1940 Arthur Tedder admitted to Tizard that: ...|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, Shankly gave {{insights}} into his character {{such as his}} world-view as a socialist, explaining that the socialism he believed in was not about politics but about collectivism, with everyone working {{for each other and}} enjoying a share of the rewards. That was the basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares the rewards. He admitted to idolising Robert Burns, whose birthplace was only 26 miles from Glenbuck and he was inspired by many of Burns' philosophical quotations, such as [...] "A man's a man for a' that". Shankly <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> bigotry or prejudice, especially arising from differences of religion. He compared the cities of Glasgow and Liverpool by saying that [...] "fortunately there is nothing like the Rangers–Celtic situation in Liverpool because the supporters of Liverpool and Everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football".|$|E
500|$|Discounting his {{collaboration}} with Dukas in {{the completion of}} Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, {{two of which are}} opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns [...] "lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior." [...] In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: [...] "Saint-Saëns obviously <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Massenet's histrionics". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan [...] "with a light French touch".|$|E
500|$|Poulenc {{said that}} he was not inventive in his {{harmonic}} language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, [...] "All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity." [...] Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language [...] "as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing". Poulenc <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for [...] "a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!" [...] He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by René Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is [...] "directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up– [...] "la légende de facilité"– that his music came easily to him; he commented, [...] "The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a genuine}} desire {{to lead a}} smart and {{efficient}} unit, Brudenell set about using his own fortune to improve his regiment's reputation and performance. In purchasing brilliant new uniforms for his men, Brudenell also caused resentment among his professional officers; they had to match the men's attire with even more costly uniforms, {{and they had to}} buy their own. (It was in this role that he was portrayed in the historical fiction novels Flashman and Flashman at the Charge by George MacDonald Fraser.) He wished his officers to be as aristocratic, flamboyant and stylish as he was himself and as a consequence he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> those men—"Indian officers"—who had learnt their profession over many years of service with the 11th during its long posting to India. This attitude was particularly in evidence in the mess: Brudenell had forbidden the serving of porter, the beverage of choice among the professional officers, and when at a formal mess dinner a visitor had requested Moselle wine, which was served in a [...] "black bottle" [...] similar to that of porter, he decided that the [...] "Indian" [...] Captain John Reynolds, who had ordered it for the guest, was defying him. Reynolds was arrested and in due course received a strongly worded reprimand from Lord Hill, who although privately believing that his misgivings about Brudenell had been well founded, felt that, in the interests of good order and discipline, a public demonstration of support was necessary. Reynolds's guardian sent the details of the case to all the London papers and for many months thereafter Brudenell, his regiment and the commander-in-chief were subject to ridicule, hissing and cat-calls of [...] "black bottle" [...] whenever they appeared in public. A more serious punishment was administered to Richard Reynolds, cousin to John Reynolds and another long-serving captain, who was court-martialled for sending Cardigan an [...] "insubordinate" [...] letter in response to being barred from his commanding officer's quarters. Hill drafted a strong memorandum urging Cardigan to employ [...] "temper and discretion" [...] in dealings with his officers, but Reynolds was cashiered.|$|E

Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art, Russell theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered [...] "cerebral and sedate and we <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> that", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as [...] "Anglophiles".|$|E

He mentions {{that he was the}} butt of the [...] "occasional" [...] practical joke growing up. Despite varying from apple pie beds and black eye telescopes to hiding a small land mine in Rimmer's sandpit, Rimmer believes that none of this was [...] "sinister". Rimmer says that some considered his mother (played by Kalli Greenwood) to be cold and aloof, but himself believes that she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> fools. Rimmer believes this to be [...] "tragic", because they would otherwise have got on [...] "famously".|$|E

2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening for me at the time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> anything else.

2500|$|Emily Hobhouse, a {{delegate}} of the South African Women and Children's Distress Fund, visited {{some of the}} camps in the Orange Free State from January 1901, and in May 1901 she returned to England on board the ship, the Saxon. Alfred Milner, High Commissioner in South Africa, also boarded the Saxon for holiday in England but, unfortunately for both the camp internees and the British government, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Miss Hobhouse, regarding her as a Boer sympathiser and [...] "trouble maker." [...] On her return, Emily Hobhouse did much to publicise the distress of the camp inmates. She managed {{to speak to the}} Liberal Party leader, Henry Campbell-Bannerman who professed to be suitably outraged but was disinclined to press the matter, as his party was split between the imperialists and the pro-Boer factions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916 {{the young}} {{engineer}} Louis Waldman was approached {{at a meeting}} of his Socialist Party branch and was drafted into becoming a candidate of the party for the New York State Assembly. Although he protested that between his engineering job and his evening studies of law he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> campaigning, the party official approaching him smiled and replied, [...] "Campaigning? Who said anything about campaigning? We just want someone to run for office. If you get more than seven hundred votes we'll be lucky. The real campaigns this year will be for Meyer London and Morris Hillquit." [...] And thus was born a Socialist Party politician. Waldman did actually campaign, however, mounting the platform to give public speeches, at which he gradually improved. Waldman performed well in the 1916 election, tripling the Socialist tally while losing to his Democratic opponent by a few hundred votes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1241–1242, {{the kingdom}} of Hungary {{suffered}} a major blow {{in the wake of}} the Mongol invasion of Europe. After Hungary was invaded by the Mongols in 1241, the Hungarian army was defeated disastrously at the Battle of Mohi. King Béla IV first fled the battlefield, and then the country after the Mongols pursued him to its borders. Before the Mongols retreated, a large part of the population died; indeed, historians estimate the losses between 20 and 50 percent. In the plains, between 50 and 80% of the settlements were destroyed. Only castles, strongly fortified cities and abbeys could withstand the assault, as the Mongols <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> long sieges – their goal was to move west as soon as possible. [...] The siege engines and the Chinese and Persian engineers that operated them for the Mongols had been left in Russia. The devastation caused by the Mongol invasions later led to the invitation of settlers from other parts of Europe, especially from Germany.|$|E
