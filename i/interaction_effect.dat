25|$|Copulas {{are useful}} in portfolio/risk {{management}} and help us analyse the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the marginals and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting {{of a large number}} of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> with other traders'. This <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to herd their trading behaviour and decisions.|$|E

40|$|In many {{psychological}} experiments, <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> in {{factorial analysis}} of variance (ANOVA) designs are often estimated using total scores derived from classical test theory. However, <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> can be reduced or eliminated by nonlinear monotonic transformations of a dependent variable. Although cross-over interactions cannot be eliminated by transformations, the meaningfulness of other interactions hinges on achieving a measurement scale level for which nonlinear transformations are inappropriate (i. e., at least interval scale level). Classical total test scores do not provide interval level measurement according to contemporary item response theory (IRT). Nevertheless, rarely are IRT models applied to achieve more optimal measurement properties and hence more meaningful <b>interaction</b> <b>effects.</b> This paper provides several conditions under which <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> that are estimated from classical total scores, rather than IRT trait scores, can be misleading. Using derived asymptotic expectations from an IRT model, <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> of zero on the IRT trait scale were often not estimated as zero from the total score scale. Further, when nonzero interactions were specified on the IRT trait scale, the estimated <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> were biased inward when estimated from the total score scale. Test difficulty level determined both the direction and {{the magnitude of the}} biased <b>interaction</b> <b>effects.</b> Index terms: factorial designs, <b>interaction</b> <b>effects,</b> interval measurement, item response theory, level of measurement, measurement scales, statistical inference...|$|R

2500|$|Based on {{findings}} {{of changes in}} OCD symptoms in menstruating women and differences {{in the development of}} the disease between men and women, Hill and colleagues set out to research the effect of estrogen deprivation on the development of compulsive behavior in mice. [...] Male mice with an aromatase Gene knockout who were unable to produce estrogen showed excessive grooming and wheel running behaviors, but female mice did not. [...] When treated with 17β-estradiol, which replaced estrogen in these mice, the behaviors disappeared. [...] This study also found that COMT protein levels decreased in mice that did not produce estrogen and increased in the hypothalamus after estrogen-replacement treatment. [...] Briefly, the COMT protein is involved in degrading some neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. [...] This data suggests that there may be a hormonal component and a hormone-gene <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> that may contribute to obsessive behaviors.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim in {{analyzing}} a 2 k factorial design is {{to estimate the}} 2 k main and <b>interaction</b> <b>effects.</b> If some of these main and <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> {{are known to be}} zero or negligible, {{it is not necessary to}} estimate all the main and <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> in 2 k factorial design. When S main and <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> are non-zero, all possible sets of S treatment combinations are not sufficient for estimating these main and <b>interaction</b> <b>effects.</b> For this reason, a method is introduced to obtain the smallest set of the S treatment combinations. In this study, two smallest sets are obtained for all possible scenarios of interest for 23 factorial design using this method given by Tsao and Wibowo.

50|$|Researchers in {{psychology}} have incorporated intersection effects since the 1950s, before {{the work of}} Patricia Hill Collins. Psychology often does through via the lens of biases, heuristics, stereotypes and judgements. Psychological interactions effects span a range of variables, although person by situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other <b>interaction</b> <b>effect.</b> In addition, oppression is a subjective construct, and even if an objective definition were reached person-by-situation effects would {{make it difficult to}} deem certain persons as uniformly oppressed.

Kinematic <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> on the "input" motion at the bases of structures are found to be relatively modest in many cases, whereas inertial <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> on the structural response to these motions can be significant. To quantify inertial <b>interaction</b> <b>effects,</b> fixed- and flexible-base modal vibration parameters {{are used to}} evaluate first-mode period lengthening ratios T-tilde /T and foundation damping factors zeta-tilde 0. The response of some structures is dominated by inertial interaction (e. g., T-tilde /T [approximate] 4, zeta-tilde 0 [approximate] 30 %), whereas others undergo negligible soil-structure interaction (e. g., T-tilde /T [approximate] 1, zeta-tilde 0 [approximate] 0). Simplified analytical formulations described in the companion paper by Stewart et al. are used to predict inertial <b>interaction</b> <b>effects.</b> The predictions are found to be reasonably accurate relative to empirical results, with some limitations for deeply embedded and long-period structures. A collective examination of the empirical and predicted results reveals a pronounced influence of structure-to-soil stiffness ratio on inertial interaction, as well as secondary influences from structure aspect ratio and foundation embedment, type, shape, and flexibility...|$|R
