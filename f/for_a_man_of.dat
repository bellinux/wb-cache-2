5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> his age.|$|E
5|$|In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut {{for a large}} invited audience; it was {{remarked that}} his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his {{personal}} bearing was admirable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, {{with the intention of}} wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the Cimetière de Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> his age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which {{he had in the}} United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

25|$|His {{exceptionally}} straight bat {{and quick}} footwork (surprising <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> heavy build as he was) {{made him one}} of the most difficult batsmen to dismiss throughout his career. His mastery over the best county spin bowlers even on the most treacherous pitches is remarkable, but he could also be very good against the fastest bowling because he could get closer into line than just about any batsman in cricket history.|$|E
25|$|He was, we are told, {{a passionate}} collector—not only {{of books and}} manuscripts but works of art of every kind; more {{remarkable}} still <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> his class, {{he seems to have}} been an excellent painter. He was the most generous of patrons—to writers and scholars, artists and craftsmen. Finally, he was an excellent Emperor: a competent, conscientious and hard-working administrator and an inspired picker of men, whose appointments to military, naval, ecclesiastical, civil and academic posts were both imaginative and successful. He did much to develop higher education and took a special interest in the administration of justice.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the squad}} were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith {{averaged}} over 30, and that was flattered by his big century at Antigua. He was in terrible form {{for the vast majority}} of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests – a poor return <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> his talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all – Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't even get that chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.|$|E

25|$|Smoking {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{preventable}} death globally. In the United States about 500,000 deaths per year are attributed to smoking-related diseases and a recent study estimated that as much as 1/3 of China's male population will have significantly shortened life-spans due to smoking. Male and female smokers lose an average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively. At least half of all lifelong smokers die earlier as a result of smoking. The risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female current smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman. Smoking one cigarette a day results in a risk of heart disease that is halfway between that of a smoker and a non-smoker. The non-linear dose response relationship may be explained by smoking's effect on platelet aggregation.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} and versatile player, Gullit epitomised {{the ethos of}} Total Football as he was naturally adept in several positions, and was capable of aiding his team defensively as well as offensively due to his work-rate, ball-winning abilities, and tactical intelligence {{in addition to his}} skill and physical qualities. Normally deployed as an attacking midifielder or as a second striker, he was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front-line, on either wing or even in the centre, and could also play as a sweeper. Regarded {{as one of the greatest}} players of all-time, his foremost attribute was his athleticism, as he used his strength and speed, combined with his technique, to great effect; he was also strong in the air, as he was tall, powerful, and an excellent jumper. Yet, unusually <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> his stature, Gullit was an elegant player, who also possessed outstanding natural balance, poise, technical ability, and dribbling skills, which gave a graceful style to his game. Gullit also was noted for his intelligence, creativity, vision, and spatial abilities, qualities that helped him score goals early in his career and enabled him to play in a deeper role as a playmaker late in his days, where he was known for creating chances for teammates. Gullit thus combined physical presence with flair, mental acuity, formidable technique and natural touch, to become an iconic figure in world football. Despite his talent, Gullit struggled with injuries throughout his career, which later affected his fitness.|$|E

500|$|Since Parsifal could {{initially}} only {{be seen at}} the Bayreuth Festival, {{the first}} presentation in 1882 was attended by many notable figures. Reaction was varied. Some thought that Parsifal marked a weakening of Wagner's abilities. The critic Eduard Hanslick gave his opinion that [...] "The Third act may be counted the most unified and the most atmospheric. It is not the richest musically," [...] going on to note [...] "And Wagner's creative powers? <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> his age and his method they are astounding ... It would be foolishness to declare that Wagner's fantasy, and specifically his musical invention, has retained the freshness and facility of yore. One cannot help but discern sterility and prosaicism, together with increasing longwindedness." ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{began his}} {{architectural}} {{studies at the}} University of Karlsruhe instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the hyperinflation crisis of 1923 limited his parents' income. In 1924 when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the [...] "much more reputable" [...] Technical University of Munich. In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the Technical University of Berlin where he studied under Heinrich Tessenow, whom Speer greatly admired. After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow's assistant, a high honor <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> 22. As such, Speer taught some of Tessenow's classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies. In Munich, and continuing in Berlin, Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over 50 years, with Rudolf Wolters, who also studied under Tessenow.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} few months after Muhammad's arrival in Medina, the Banu Qurayza were {{involved}} in a dispute with the Banu Nadir: The more powerful Nadir rigorously applied lex talionis against the Qurayza while not allowing it being enforced against themselves. Further, the blood money paid <b>for</b> killing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> the Qurayza was only half of the blood-money required <b>for</b> killing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> the Nadir, placing the Qurayza in a socially inferior position.

The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may [...] have limited Jackson's ability to perform. [...] "His overall health was fine," [...] said Dr. Zeev Kain of the University of California, who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination, [...] "The results are in normal limits." [...] The autopsy also revealed that he was partially bald and that his lips, eyebrows, and scalp were tattooed.|$|E
500|$|On 18 November 1763 the Mozart family {{arrived in}} Paris, {{one of the}} most {{important}} musical centres of Europe, and also a city of great power, wealth, and intellectual activity. Leopold hoped to be received by the court of Louis XV at nearby Versailles. However, a recent death in the royal family prevented any immediate invitation, so Leopold arranged other engagements. One person who took particular note of the children was the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, whose journal records Wolfgang's feats in glowing terms: [...] "the most consummate Kapellmeister could not be more profound in the science of harmony and modulation". Leopold's own assessment, written a few months later, was similarly effusive: [...] "My little girl, although only 12 years old, is {{one of the most}} skilful players in Europe and, in a word, my boy knows more in his eighth year than one would expect <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>of</b> forty".|$|E
