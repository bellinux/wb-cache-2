[...] This is also in line with a much cited research study published in 1997 researching county level data from 1977 to 1992 concluding that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths. However, a 2014 Stanford University study reported that these laws were associated with an 8% increase of aggravated assaults, and a 2017 NBER working paper found that the laws caused a 13-15% increase in violent crime, though the murder and property crime rates were unaffected.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the contemporary case law of European courts regarding Community trade mark. The thesis {{is composed of}} five chapters. First chapter characterizes Community trade mark as a legal instrument {{of the law of}} the European Union. Second chapter analyzes relevant sources of law. Third chapter deals with institutions that are crucial mainly for the registration and protection of Community trade marks. Then the fourth chapter describes the registration process before the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market. First part of this chapter focuses on the formalities of an application of the Community trade mark filed at the Office. Second part is concerned with the right of priority. Third part looks at absolute grounds for refusal of an application. Fourth part refers to relative grounds for refusal. Finally, the fifth part describes the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> of the rights of the Community trade mark.

40|$|Revocation and Invalidity of European Trade Mark Revocation and {{invalidity}} of European trade mark, {{more precisely}} termed as Community trade mark (hereinafter as "CTM"), {{is a specific}} field of trade mark law of the European Union. It is Council Regulation (EC) No 207 / 2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark which forms a legal basis in this regard. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and especially the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union play very significant role in this area. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding Directive 2008 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trade marks is also relevant for the revocation and invalidity of CTM as this Directive provides for the revocation and invalidity of national trade marks in similar manner.

40|$|In academia, after a {{reasonable}} probationary {{period of service}} and upon the achievement of tenure, the recipients of tenure {{are entitled to a}} continuing appointment at an institution without mandatory retirement and with only limited <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>revocation.</b> Advocates of tenure argued that it protected academic freedom through economic security. Opponents of tenure argued that it fostered inefficient and unproductive behavior. This dissertation developed a framework for examining academic tenure in U. S. economics departments. I constructed a dataset of tenured U. S. economics professors who were Ph. D. recipients between 1990 and 2006 and tracked their publications. In the first chapter, based on difference-in-difference analysis I found that tenure has a direct effect on the choice of research direction/focus. In general, tenured groups had a higher degree of specialization than non-tenured groups after they received tenure. For some tenured groups, even if their extent of specialization decreased after tenure, when I controlled for unobserved heterogeneity, tenure still had a positive effect on extent of specialization. This result suggested that the job security provided by tenure made tenured faculty more narrowly focused on their research. Using path analysis in the second chapter, my finding suggested that the extent of specialization was one of the key factors which might influence a scholar’s productivity. In addition, the extent of specialization helped explain gender differences in academic productivity. The results revealed that the effect of gender on productivity through the degree of specialization was more notable among older generations, and in most fields, gender differences in extent of research specialization mediated gender difference in research performance; although there were some fields in which gender difference in the research process could not explain gender difference in research performance. The third chapter expanded our understanding of advancement in academics by exploring a new dimension of inquiry: whether the extent of specialization in scholars’ research programs improved promotion prospects. Using discrete event analysis, my research showed that the extent of research specialization contributed to career acceleration, although gender difference on the prospects of advancement in academics was not significant...|$|E
40|$|Historically, Anglo-American courts {{refused to}} enforce {{arbitration}} agreements, jealously guarding their dispute resolution monopoly. During {{the early twentieth}} century, merchants and attorneys began seeking legislation requiring courts to defer to arbitration. The United States Abitration Act took effect January 1, 1926 and has remained essentially unchanged. It was written with the implicit assumption {{that it would be}} invoked by commercial actors having relatively equal bargaining power and emotive appeal to a jury. The Act says nothing to direct the court 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry concerning the quality of either party 2 ̆ 7 s assent to the arbitration clause other than requiring a written arbitration agreement and referring to <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> available at common-law. Section 1 of the Act broadly defines key terms used subsequently in the Act. Section 2 provides that written agreements to arbitrate, whether part of an initial contract in commerce or in a maritime transaction or a separate agreement pertaining to such a contract, “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. ” The Act supplies the substantive rules for deciding whether to uphold an arbitration agreement, stay judicial proceedings, compel arbitration, confirm the award, vacate the award, or alter the award. Although there is some possibility of exception, the prevailing view is that even strong state statutory policies do not override the Act. Although the Act is considered substantive law, it imposes many procedural requirements upon the parties seeking to promote or attack arbitration. The Act also promotes arbitration by providing that litigation may be stayed by the court until completion of the arbitration. The court must first be “satisfied that the issue involved is referable to arbitration. ” Section 4 authorizes federal courts to compel arbitration if a party refuses to honor an arbitration agreement. The Act states that any contractually specified method of arbitration shall be followed and provides subpoena power to the arbitrator. Sections 9, 10, and 11 deal with the confirmation, vacation, or modification of arbitration awards. The court must grant an order confirming the award unless the court finds the case to meet one of several narrow grounds. The courts have generally accorded these exceptions confined scope due to the limited enumerated grounds, the language of the section, and the Act 2 ̆ 7 s goal of encouraging arbitration...|$|E
