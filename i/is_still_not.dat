5|$|If {{the pain}} <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry {{a risk of}} addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have {{a greater risk of}} side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> certain {{how many}} people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Tribunal in 1994, only one constitutional reference has been made to it. Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995 arose from the issue of the application of Article 22H(1) of the Constitution in relation to Article 5(2A), which was and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> yet in force. The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to clarify the scope of the application of both Articles. The Government was represented by Chan Sek Keong and Soh Tze Bian of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and the Presidency by Joseph Grimberg and Walter Woon.|$|E
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> clear, but {{it is known that}} the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Serpens {{represents}} a snake {{held by the}} healer Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, {{but the majority of}} atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus' body or between his legs.|$|E

Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E

When Lord of Runestone Yohn Royce asks how Sansa became married to Ramsay Bolton instead {{of at the}} Fingers, Littlefinger claims Bolton's men {{attacked}} them and kidnapped her on the way. When Royce is dubious, Littlefinger adds {{that he was the}} only person who knew of their destination, implying his guilt. He manipulates Arryn into considering executing Royce, then into giving him a second chance after he pledges his absolute loyalty. Littlefinger then tells Arryn that Sansa, his cousin, has escaped the Boltons and is taking refuge at Castle Black, but that she <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> safe. Arryn agrees to command Royce to lead the knights of the Vale to protect her.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion was {{originally}} {{built for the}} 1958 FIFA World Cup, during which it was the venue for four matches. It replaced Malmö IP as Malmö's main sports stadium, where IFK Malmö, MAI and Malmö FF had been based since the early 20th century. It also hosted three matches during the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship. The stadium today holds 26,500 spectators when in its sporting configuration, with 14,000 fans seated and 12,500 standing. For concerts, the ground can hold up to 40,000 people depending on {{the location of the}} stage. On 2 February 2015 Malmö Stad took the decision to approve the demolition of the stadium for redevelopment of the area. Malmö Stad has previously decided that a new public swimming arena is to be built on the site in the near future.

Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John {{comes to his}} aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own heart for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John.

5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> understood, but some successful {{models have been}} developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E

On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others they know, and with themselves.|$|E
