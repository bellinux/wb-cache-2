50|$|Stereoscopy is the {{production}} of the illusion of depth in a photograph, movie, or other two-dimensional image by the presentation of a slightly different image to each eye, which adds the first of these cues (stereopsis). The two images are then combined in the brain to give the perception of depth. Because all points in the image produced by stereoscopy focus at the same plane regardless of their depth in the original scene, the second cue, focus, is not duplicated and therefore the illusion of depth is incomplete. There are also mainly two effects of stereoscopy that are unnatural for human vision: (1) the mismatch between convergence and accommodation, caused by the difference between an object's perceived position in front of or behind the display or screen and the real origin of that light; and (2) possible crosstalk between the eyes, caused by imperfect <b>image</b> <b>separation</b> in some methods of stereoscopy.|$|E

40|$|The cold {{dark matter}} {{scenario}} predicts {{that a large number}} of dark subhalos should be located within the halo of each Milky-way sized galaxy. One tell-tale signature of such dark subhalos could be additional milliarcsecond-scale image splitting of quasars previously known to be multiply-imaged on arcsecond scales. Here, we estimate the <b>image</b> <b>separations</b> for the subhalo density profiles favoured by recent N-body simulations, and compare these to the angular resolution of both existing and upcoming observational facilities. We find, that the <b>image</b> <b>separations</b> produced are very sensitive to the exact subhalo density profile assumed, but in all cases considerably smaller than previous estimates based on the premise that subhalos can be approximated by singular isothermal spheres. Only the most optimistic subhalo models produce <b>image</b> <b>separations</b> that would be detectable with current technology, and many models produce <b>image</b> <b>separations</b> that will remain unresolved with all telescopes expected to become available in the foreseeable future.

In summary, it presents PSNR values of 12 ~ 16  dB under a wide range of noise condition, while all other methods provide much poor PSNR values of 4 ~ 10  dB under the same noise condition. The proposed method, therefore, appears to be an efficient approach to separate mixed images even under noisy conditions.|$|E

We demonstrate that perceptual <b>image</b> <b>separation</b> may be preferable over perceptual image fusion for the combined display of enhanced and synthetic imagery. In this context <b>image</b> <b>separation</b> refers to the simultaneous presentation of images on different depth planes of a single display. <b>Image</b> <b>separation</b> allows the user to recognize {{the source of the}} information that is displayed. This can be important because synthetic images are more liable to flaws. We have examined methods to optimize perceptual <b>image</b> <b>separation.</b> A true depth difference between enhanced and synthetic imagery works quite well. A standard stereoscopic display based on convergence is less suitable since the two images tend to interfere: the image behind is masked (occluded) by the image in front, which results in poor viewing comfort. This effect places 3 D systems based on 3 D glasses, as well as most autostereoscopic displays, at a serious disadvantage. A 3 D display based on additive or subtractive transparency is acceptable: both the perceptual separation and the viewing comfort are good, but the color of objects depends on the color in the other depth layer(s). A combined additive and subtractive transparent display eliminates this disadvantage and is most suitable for the combined display of enhanced and synthetic imagery. We suggest that the development of such a display system is of a greater practical value than increasing the number of depth planes in autostereoscopic displays...|$|E

Baryonic cooling causes galaxy-mass halos to have different central density profiles than group- and cluster-mass halos, which causes the distribution of normal arcsecond-scale lenses to differ from the distribution of "wide-separation" (Δθ≳ 4) lenses. Fortunately, the various parameters related to cosmology and halo structure have very different effects on the overall <b>image</b> <b>separation</b> distribution: (1) the abundance of wide-separation lenses is exremely sensitive (by orders of magnitude) to the distribution of "concentration" parameters for massive halos modeled with the Navarro-Frenk-White profile; (2) the transition between normal and wide-separation lenses depends mainly on the mass scale where baryonic cooling ceases to be efficient; and (3) dark energy has effects at all <b>image</b> <b>separation</b> scales. While current lens samples cannot usefully constrain all of the parameters, ongoing and future imaging surveys should discover hundreds or thousands of lenses and make it possible to disentangle the various effects and constrain all of the parameters simultaneously.
