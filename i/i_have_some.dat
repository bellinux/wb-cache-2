5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

500|$|For {{many years}} {{following}} Chamberlain's {{departure from the}} University of Kansas, critics claimed that he either wanted to leave the very white Midwest or was embarrassed by {{not being able to}} bring home the NCAA basketball tournament victory. In 1998, Chamberlain returned to Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his #13. Around this time, he has been quoted as saying: [...] "There's been a lot of conversation, since people have been trying to get my jersey number retired, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> dislike for the University of Kansas. That is totally ridiculous." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent bank bailouts, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Capuano berated the bank CEOs for their practices, saying at one point: [...] "You {{come to us}} today on your bicycles after buying Girl Scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa and telling us, 'We're sorry, we didn't mean it, we won't do it again, trust us.' Well, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks {{and they say the}} same thing." [...] Capuano's speech was included in the 2010 documentary film Inside Job, described by director Charles H. Ferguson as being about [...] "the systemic corruption of the United States by the financial services industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption." ...|$|E
500|$|Sibelius was {{not easily}} stirred from his exile; {{friend and fellow}} {{composer}} Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly {{to persuade him to}} conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a [...] "major work" [...] in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, [...] "My conscience forces me to this. But when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 ("I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come".).|$|E
500|$|After the poem's {{original}} creation, it {{was expanded}} {{from its original}} use of an Aeolian harp as its theme over the months that followed. However, Coleridge did not stop working on it {{when it was first}} published. Instead, the poem was expanded and rewritten throughout Coleridge's life until 1817. Of the final version, lines 21–25 were previously removed between the 1797 and 1815 editions of Coleridge's poems. Likewise, lines 26–33 were altered through the multiple editions. Regardless of the amount of editing, Coleridge believed that the poem served as a model for other poems, especially those in the series called Conversation poems. Of The Eolian Harp as a model for poetry, Coleridge wrote, [...] "Let me be excused, if it should seem to others too mere a trifle to justify my noticing it—but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> claim to the thanks of no small number of the readers of poetry in having first introduced this species of short blank verse poems—of which Southey, Lamb, Wordsworth, and others have since produced so many exquisite specimens." ...|$|E

I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E

[...] Between 2011 and 2012, Parks issued six {{double-sided}} singles, which featured new original songs, collaborations, unreleased archival recordings, re-recordings of older tracks, and covers. The singles also featured guest spots from singers Gaby Moreno and Inara George of The Bird and the Bee. Parks has also {{stressed the importance}} of the singles' artwork, contributed by visual artists such as Klaus Voorman, Ed Ruscha, and Art Spiegelman. Artist Charles Ray also sculpted two life-size statues of Parks.|$|E

Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle.

2500|$|On one account, {{moments before}} his death, Beethoven was laying upon bed, pale and suffering, {{when a man}} entered. It was fellow {{composer}} Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was Beethoven's old and only friend, {{and one of his}} contemporaries. Hummel, who had heard of Beethoven's illness, came to him with succor and money. But it was too late; Beethoven was speechless, and a grateful smile was all that he had to bestow upon his friend. Hummel bent toward him, and, by the aid of an acoustic instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his compassion and regret. Beethoven seemed reanimated, his eyes shone, he struggled for utterance, and gasped, [...] "Is it not true, Hummel, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> talent after all?".
