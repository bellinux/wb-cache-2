Before 1967 I had not found it difficult to publish reports in these journals, and by then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> 150 articles and several books in the establishment press.|$|E
500|$|... "The Love Club" [...] is a electropop song. It {{addresses}} the befriending of [...] "a bad crowd." [...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} experience <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> a year ago where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation. Then I started to maybe realise that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into this crazy world, and you’re all in love".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up the back of my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E

500|$|During his 1966 tour, Dylan was {{described}} as exhausted and acting [...] "as if on a death trip". D. A. Pennebaker, the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as [...] "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else." [...] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I {{was on the road}} for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things... just to keep going, you know?" [...] In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: [...] "I got very, very strung out for a while... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it." [...] Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had [...] "been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|... "Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas {{about what to do with}} it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on the feeling <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the upper}} deck, {{looking over the}} railing, {{there was a young}} man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was {{watching}} the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck…A round straw hat, the funnel leaning left, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railing made of circular chains – white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape…I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> life." ...|$|E
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
