25|$|Amphibious Floating Bridge and Ferry System {{intended}} for transporting heavy armour, troops and engineering equipment across large and deep water obstacles. The vehicle can convert to a <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> bridge configuration of 28.4 metres in length in 9 minutes. Two more vehicles can be joined in tandem {{to form a}} floating bridge of 105 metres in length in 30 minutes. The bridge superstructure is integrated with floats to provide stability and additional buoyancy. The vehicle is also capable of retracting its wheels {{for use as a}} grounded bridge/ramp for high banks.|$|E
25|$|Gradually, the {{provision}} of decks on the boats became more common, {{which led to a}} further increase in boat size to compensate for the reduced space for the catch. In addition to decks, new boats were being built with a small forecastle in the bow, which contained bunks and provided shelter for the fishermen. This evolution in boat design led to the introduction of the Baldie in 1860 and the Zulu in 1879. By {{the end of the century}} all the east coast fishing vessels were <b>fully</b> <b>decked.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, uncle of American President Theodore Roosevelt, {{also built}} a proa {{at about the}} same time. [...] He used it sailing from Long Island. It was {{significantly}} different but equally creative, and at , much longer. [...] From his 1898 article in The Rudder, it appeared the main hull of Roosevelt's proa was an open [...] wide scow hull; the ama was a smaller, <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> scow which looked like it could rock on a single aka. [...] The mast was a bipod arrangement with both masts stepped to windward, with a boomed, balanced lugsail suspended from the apex. [...] A balanced rudder at each end managed itself by pivoting 180° when its end was the [...] "bow", and leeboards were used.|$|E
50|$|In December 1970, {{he fought}} Ali at Madison Square Garden, {{in the former}} champ's second bout after his three-year layoff. Bonavena absorbed {{punishment}} throughout but fought well, getting through with various head and body punches. With just under 1:30 left in the 15th and final round, Ali caught Oscar rushing in and decked him with a perfectly placed left hook. Bonavena got up, but was clearly not <b>fully</b> recovered. Ali <b>decked</b> him twice more, and the fight was automatically stopped under the three knockdown rule, giving Ali a TKO (technical knockout). The ending was somewhat controversial, as Ali stood over Bonavena as Bonavena was getting up, never going to a neutral corner as the rules of boxing require, which allowed Ali to quickly knockdown Bonavena twice more and automatically end the fight. After the second knockdown, the referee appears to be attempting to guide Ali to a neutral corner, but Ali brushes the referee's arm away and pursues a wobbly Bonavena. The knockout by Ali {{was the only time}} in Bonavena's career he lost by a knockout.|$|R
5000|$|The Neverwas Haul is a three-story, {{self-propelled}} mobile art vehicle {{built to}} resemble a Victorian house on wheels. [...] Inspired by the fantastical stories of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, the Haul was designed by Shannon O’Hare and built by a crew of volunteers at the Shipyard art space in Berkeley, CA, in 2006. Originally {{intended to be a}} ‘mutant vehicle’ for the Burning Man art festival in Nevada, the Haul is made from 75% recycled materials, and measures 24 feet long, 24 feet high, and 12 feet wide. It is built on the base of a fifth-wheel trailer, and the second and third story of the structure pack down into the first for highway towing. When <b>fully</b> built and <b>decked</b> out for exhibition at Burning Man, the Haul is able to propel itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and requires a crew of ten people to operate safely (since Victorian houses are notoriously lacking in side- and rear-view mirrors). Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an “art car factory” in Vallejo, CA, owned by O’Hare and home to several other self-styled “contraptionists.” ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{acceptance}} campaign {{then started}} and three different [...] "models" [...] of the Flying Eleven {{were taken to}} different clubs each weekend and sailed in all weathers. These three models were called the Open Sailer, the Self Drainer, and the <b>Fully</b> <b>Decked</b> Model. The <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> model did not appeal to the go-fast boys and, although the self drainer was popular, the VJ self drainer was well established therefore the emphasis was put on a boat which, firstly, had to be expertly sailed to stay afloat and, secondly, {{would serve as a}} trainer for the open skiff classes — so the open sailer it had to be.|$|E
50|$|The hull has oak planked sides, elm bottoms {{and pine}} deck with a fully fitted {{traditional}} boatman’s cabin. She {{was one of}} a large fleet of all wooden boats used by that Company for liquid cargo carrying, the main hold area being <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> over.|$|E
50|$|The 7th day is hase Karaga when symbolically {{the goddess}} is readied for her marriage.

50|$|A Mersey flat {{is a type}} of doubled-ended barge with rounded bilges, carvel {{build and}} <b>fully</b> <b>decked.</b> Traditionally, the hull was built of oak and the deck was pitch pine. Some had a single mast, with a fore-and-aft rig, while some had an {{additional}} mizzen mast. Despite having a flat bottom and curved sides, they were quite stable. They were common from the 1730s to 1890s.|$|E

50|$|The classic {{eighteen}} {{foot long}} flat-bottomed Rogue River dory with a nearly full deck {{is a favorite}} among guides on the Colorado River and was pioneered in Grand Canyon by Martin Litton beginning in 1963. On the same river, the sporty fifteen to sixteen foot long arc-bottomed McKenzie River dory, <b>fully</b> <b>decked,</b> was pioneered by Stephen Moulton Babcock Fulmer in 1955. Though it carries less gear, this hull design has a large following among do-it-yourself Grand Canyon river runners due to its ease of rowing. Either hull design, when decked for dry storage of gear on the whitewater run through Grand Canyon, {{is known as a}} Grand Canyon dory.|$|E
5000|$|The liburnian (liburna, λιβυρνίς, libyrnis) was {{a variant}} of lembos invented by the tribe of the Liburnians. Initially used for piracy and scouting, this light and swift vessel {{was adopted by the}} Romans during the Illyrian Wars, and {{eventually}} became the mainstay of the fleets of the Roman Empire following Actium, displacing the heavier vessels. Especially the provincial Roman fleets were composed almost exclusively of liburnians. [...] Livy, Lucan and Appian all describe the liburnian as bireme; they were <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> (cataphract) ships, with a sharply pointed prow, providing a more streamlined shape designed for greater speed. In terms of speed, the liburnian was probably considerably slower than a trireme, but on a par with a [...] "five".|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Boomerang would {{resonate}} through Giugiaro's future designs for many years. Its sharp angles and wedge shape could be easily recognised in the 1973 Audi Asso di Picche concept, 1973 VW Passat Mk1, 1974 VW Golf Mk1, 1976 Lotus Esprit and Medici II show car, 1979 Lancia Delta and Maserati Quattroporte III, {{as well as the}} 1976 designed and 1981 launched De Lorean DMC-12. Powered by a [...] 4.7L V8 engine driving the rear wheels, 5 speed manual transmission, and having a <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> out interior. It has a unique dashboard layout where the steering wheel and gauge cluster are part of a single console that emerges from the dash, and the steering wheel rotates around the stationary gauges.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, uncle of American President Theodore Roosevelt, {{also built}} a proa {{at about the}} same time. He used it sailing from Long Island.

5000|$|According to Polybius, at the Battle of Ecnomus, the Roman quinqueremes {{carried a}} total crew of 420, 300 {{of whom were}} rowers, and the rest marines. Leaving aside a deck crew of ca. 20 men, and {{accepting}} the 2-2-1 pattern of oarsmen, the quinquereme would have 90 oars in each side, and 30-strong files of oarsmen. [...] The <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> quinquereme could also carry a marine detachment of 70 to 120, giving a total complement of about 400. A [...] "five" [...] would be ca. 45 m long, displace around 100 tonnes, be some 5 m wide at water level, and have its deck standing ca. 3 m above the sea. Polybius is explicit in calling the quinquereme superior as a warship to the old trireme, which was retained in service in significant numbers by many smaller navies. Accounts by Livy and Diodorus Siculus also show that the [...] "five", being heavier, performed better than the triremes in bad weather.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Nineteenth Century {{yachting}} {{was mainly}} a pursuit of the rich and the only people engaged in cruising were a handful of pioneers such as Edward Frederick Knight, Claud Worth, Frank Cadogan Cowper, Richard Turrill McMullen, Erskine Childers etc. As early as 1880 a small group who were interested in cruising, rather than racing, decided there was a need for a new club to cater for the interests of the cruising yachtsman. The leader of this group, many of whom lived far from the sea in or around Wolverhampton was a 29-year-old Barrister, Arthur Underhill, who had just had his first <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> yacht built - a two and a half ton sloop. This was the start of the Cruising Club and after eight years Underhill became Commodore, an office he was to hold until 1937, two years before his death. In 1901 the Club was well enough established to be granted the Royal prefix. The intention {{of the founders of the}} RCC, however, was that it should remain small, friendly and intimate. To ensure this, a limit was set on the numbers and in 1904 this was to be 260, later expanded to 400.|$|E
5000|$|Purdue Pete goes {{to all of}} the {{football}} games, and the home basketball games, as well as the tournaments such as the Big Ten Bowl Games and the NCAA. [...] Purdue Pete also makes appearances at softball, soccer, and baseball home games, but he doesn’t stay for the whole games. [...] At the events, Purdue Pete gets the fans riled up and helps them cheer our teams to victory. He also does several skits during the games. [...] At the basketball games, Pete does his surfing skit where he gets people to lay down on the ground and he rides a surfboard over top of them. [...] The Purdue Petes also do several of their own made up stunts. [...] This allows the different Petes, who all have unique personalities, to put their own touches into the performance. [...] It typically takes about ten minutes to get completely dressed up before the games. [...] Purdue Pete wears a basketball jersey to the basketball games and is <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> out with football jersey and pads for {{the football}} games. [...] He also wears his football outfit as his main clothing of choice. [...] Besides games, Purdue Pete also goes to numerous social events. [...] He has been to grand-openings for companies around the West Lafayette area. [...] He goes to tailgates before games and special alumni events. [...] If you are a special donor to the school or are visiting in the Presidential game box, you can probably expect to see Pete make a visit to the box. [...] Although the football outfit is his main clothing style, he can wear other things for special appearances, {{as long as you can}} find clothes that fit him. [...] For a banquet to welcome the new president of Purdue, France A. Córdova, they got Purdue Pete a tuxedo to wear.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a family}} from New Jersey moves into South Park, Sharon invites the family {{into their home}} for dinner. The tacky Jersey woman (Teresa Giudice) becomes very obnoxious very quickly, and starts to insult Sharon and her friends, leading Sharon to insult her calmly. The woman goes crazy and smashes the table and chairs, but {{eventually}} calms down. Soon after, many people from New Jersey move into South Park and everyone starts to get annoyed with them. Randy calls {{a meeting at the}} Park County Community Center, where he reveals that New Jersey is trying to take over the country and already has everything east of the Rocky Mountains, with all of Colorado in danger of becoming [...] "West Jersey". Meanwhile, Sheila reveals that she is originally from New Jersey, and that she was once a notorious party girl nicknamed [...] "S-Woww-Tittybang". When the other families find out, Cartman shuns Kyle from their group, stating that if he is Jersey (along with being Jewish and ginger, which Cartman already hates him for), he is all bad. Later that night, Kyle (in a parody of the first transformation scene in Teen Wolf), seemingly unable to control his actions, begins to cut and grease his bushy Jewfro into a style similar to Pauly D's hairstyle from Jersey Shore which makes Ike scream and faint. He is even more shocked to find Sheila now <b>fully</b> <b>decked</b> out in this fashion. Sheila reveals to her son that he's technically from New Jersey: Kyle was conceived in New Jersey and during the first two months that Sheila was pregnant with him, she and Kyle's father, Gerald, were living with Sheila's parents in Newark, New Jersey. Whenever either of them is around New Jersey influences, she says, they will start to exhibit the same behavior.|$|E
