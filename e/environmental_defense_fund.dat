5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund</b> in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund,</b> {{concluded}} that ILUC affects {{the life cycle}} assessment and that instead of saving, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|DDT {{became a}} prime {{target of the}} growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements, and in 1967 a group of {{scientists}} and lawyers founded the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund</b> (EDF) with the specific goal of enacting a ban on DDT. Victor Yannacone, Charles Wurster, Art Cooley and others in the group had all witnessed bird kills or declines in bird populations and suspected that DDT was the cause. In their campaign against the chemical, EDF petitioned the government for a ban and filed lawsuits. Around this time, toxicologist David Peakall was measuring DDE levels in the eggs of peregrine falcons and California condors and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Program's cap {{and trade}} program has been hailed as {{successful}} by the EPA, industry, economists and certain environmental {{groups such as the}} <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund,</b> while skeptical environmentalists have argued that reduction in emissions occurred due to broad trends unconnected to the program. The EPA has used what is called the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the effect of the Acid Rain Program (ARP). The output from the model says that annual emissions of sulfur dioxide were reduced by 8 million tons (from 17.3 to 9.3), nitrogen oxides by 2.7 million tons (from 7.6 to 5), and mercury by 10 tons (from 52 to 42). However, it is difficult to estimate the emissions which would have occurred without the ARP. For example, the EPA updated its analysis to reflect the effect of low-sulfur coal becoming more economical due to reduced transportation, leading the EPA to reduce its estimate of the impact of ARP by sulfur dioxide emissions by one million tons.|$|E

500|$|What {{could have}} been the most serious human impact on nature in central Florida was the Cross Florida Barge Canal, an attempt to connect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state by {{channeling}} the Ocklawaha River, first authorized in 1933. The canal was intended to be [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] deep. Canal construction was top among the engineering priorities in the state, and by 1964 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Flood control was the primary impetus behind its construction, though the broader reasoning and feasibility of the project remained unclear. The Army Corps of Engineers was also constructing hundreds of miles of canals in the Everglades {{at the same time and}} by the 1960s was being accused of wasting tax money through its unnecessary construction projects. In 1969 the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund</b> filed suit in federal court to stop construction on the canal, citing irreparable harm that would be done to Florida waterways and the Floridan Aquifer, central and north Florida's fresh water source.|$|E
500|$|By 1971, Gravel was urging {{construction}} of the much-argued Trans-Alaska pipeline, addressing environmental concerns {{by saying that the}} pipeline's builders and operators should have [...] "total and absolute" [...] responsibility for any consequent environmental damage. Two years later, the debate over the pipeline came to a crux, with The New York Times describing it as [...] "environmentalists [...] a holy war with the major oil companies." [...] In February 1973 the U.S. Court of Appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction; Gravel and fellow Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens reacted by urging Congress to pass legislation overturning the court's decision. Environmentalists opposed to the pipeline, such as the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund</b> and the Sierra Club then sought to use the recently passed National Environmental Policy Act to their advantage; Gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law, and thus speed its construction. Passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline. On July 17, 1973, in a dramatic roll call vote, the Gravel amendment was approved as a 49–49 tie was broken in favor by Vice President Spiro Agnew. The actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily; Gravel had triumphed.|$|E

40|$|Much green {{business}} literature, both academic and practitioner-oriented, views alliances between business and ecology groups as exemplifying {{a paradigm shift}} from command and control to {{a new kind of}} environmental practice, market environmentalism, and privileges the latter. This privileging occurs despite the claim made by the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund’s</b> (EDF) leader Fred Krupp, one of the early proponents of market environmentalism, that the new form supplements&mdash;rather than replaces-command and control. This paper, a case study, examines the public discourse of one such alliance between McDonald’s and EDF. Rather than indicating a paradigm shift, the analysis shows that both partners drew, and had to draw, not only from the emerging discourse of market environmentalism, but also from the older, and purportedly displaced, paradigm of command and control. This rhetorical ambivalence is emblematic of a larger discursive struggle, namely, the contemporaneous socio-political conflict over how the ecological crisis was to be defined and what should constitute legitimate practice-by business, government and environmentalists-in its name...|$|R

2500|$|Carson's {{work had}} a {{powerful}} impact on the environmental movement. Silent Spring became a rallying point for the new social movement in the 1960s.

No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically." [...] Carson's work and the activism it inspired are partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s.

40|$|Operational {{efficiency}} {{has remained}} elusive despite {{the potential for}} 10 - 20 % savings from low and no cost measures in many office buildings. This is because office building energy performance is shaped {{by the actions of}} multiple stakeholders, including the owner, facility staff, occupant organizations and office workers. These stakeholders control different aspects of energy use and have different interests. But they all face social barriers such as information feedback, process assistance, and the need for social endorsement. Smart Energy Now@, a new advanced metering and community-based social marketing pilot in Charlotte NC, {{is one of the first}} programs to focus exclusively on operational efficiency in office buildings across an entire downtown. A preliminary evaluation reveals that the pilot has been successful in many of its activities, including gaining almost 100 % owner participation, providing interval meter data and professional development for facility staff, and training more than 450 Energy Champions. Several other programs, including the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund's</b> Climate Corps, the Building Owners and Managers Association's Kilowatt Crackdown, and the Chicago Green Office Challenge are also testing ways to deliver education, assistance and recognition tailored to building stakeholders. These programs reveal that stakeholder-based social interventions can directly result in energy saving behaviors and increase the likelihood of capital investment. However, efficiency potential varies depending on each building's technical characteristics and organizational structure. Therefore, many successful programs are using flexible frameworks that establish a process for participation, but allow stakeholders to select the efficiency activities that make sense for them. Implementing these programs requires working with new partners, such as organizational leaders, professional networks and civic organizations. by Elena F. Alschuler. Thesis (M. C. P.)
