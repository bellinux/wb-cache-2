5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people <b>have</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E

In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.|$|E

5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was electrocuted while another man was crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan were due to drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were {{historical}} characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, {{are based}} on an actual incident {{that took place in}} 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} of a fatal form of the disease was {{documented}} in 1995, though tissue samples from {{as early as the}} 1980s have since tested positive for the virus, and localized skin lesions in wild African elephants were recorded in the 1970s. Since 1995, there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe, of which only nine have been successfully cured. Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity, though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos <b>have</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Tess and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought extensive flooding {{to much of}} {{the central}} Philippines. In Cebu, eight people were killed, and many homes and bridges were destroyed. The province of Palawan, a geographically isolated island {{from the rest of the}} country, suffered severe damage due to mudslides and flooding. There, 75people were confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>died,</b> <b>and</b> 600others were later presumed to have perished. In the suburbs of the capital city of Manila, 3,000people were forced to flee their homes due to rising floodwaters. In all, there were a total of 686deaths in the country. Nationwide, 144,136 people were evacuated to shelter, and 86homes were destroyed, with 430others receiving damage. Damage in the country totaled $11.38million(1988USD). In addition to the impact on the Philippines, Tess killed 37people and inflicted $11million in damage in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the seven deaths, 15 people (police, New Libyans, and bystanders) were injured in the shootout.

25|$|We cannot {{ignore the}} fact that {{thousands}} of Chechen civilians <b>have</b> <b>died</b> <b>and</b> more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes.

The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia's work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.|$|E
