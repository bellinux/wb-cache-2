5|$|Mamilla Mall runs {{perpendicular}} to the Old City Walls between Jaffa Road and Yitzhak Kariv Street. It opens onto the intersection of King Solomon, King David, and Agron Streets at its northern end, and Jaffa <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> its southern end.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} post-dating Ascall's fall revealing that he gifted {{the church of}} St Brigid, and its surrounding lands, to the priory of the Holy Trinity (Christ Church Cathedral). In about 1190, the city <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> Nicholas Street was known as porte Hasculf.|$|E
5|$|Acting on a 1942 {{initiative}} by Chief Scout Lord Somers, {{a formal}} Baden-Powell House Committee {{was established by}} The Scout Association in 1953 {{under the direction of}} Sir Harold Gillett, later Lord Mayor of London. The committee's directive was to build a hostel to provide Scouts a place to stay at reasonable cost while visiting London. For this purpose, in 1956 the committee purchased a bombed-out property at the intersection of Cromwell Road and Queen's <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> a cost of £39,000.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan {{were taken}} to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from a balcony. Reagan then made his speech at the Brandenburg <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> 2:00pm, in front of two panes of {{bulletproof}} glass. Among the spectators were West German president Richard von Weizsäcker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and West Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> the top of the steps from the patio and a low <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th century, plans {{were made to}} replace the old toll <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> Hyde Park Corner with a grander entrance, {{following}} the gentrification of the area surrounding it. The first design was put forward by Robert Adam in 1778 as a grand archway, followed by John Soane's 1796 proposal {{to build a new}} palace adjacent to the corner in Green Park.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the <b>gates</b> <b>at</b> {{the airport}} were renumbered in {{preparation}} for the addition of Terminal B. <b>Gate</b> A16B <b>at</b> the north end became Gate 1 and <b>Gate</b> A1A <b>at</b> the south end became Gate 16.|$|R

5|$|On 30 May 2012, EVA Air Cargo Flight BR661 (Boeing 747-400F) clipped {{the tail}} of American Eagle Flight 4265 at Chicago O'Hare. The {{regional}} jet had arrived from Springfield, Mo., and was taxiing toward a <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> Terminal 3. The accident occurred around 1 p.m. CT. The incident occurred as the American Eagle jet was pulling into Gate G20. Damage to the two aircraft appeared to be minor and both returned to service after repair.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire {{started on}} December 22, 1910, {{destroying}} $400,000 {{of property and}} killing twenty-one firemen, including the Fire Marshal James J. Horan. Fifty engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies fought the fire until it was declared extinguished by Chief Seyferlich on December 23. In 2004, a memorial to all Chicago firefighters who {{have died in the}} line of duty was erected just behind the Union Stock Yards <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> the intersection of Exchange Avenue and Peoria Street.|$|E
5|$|The Panama–Pacific International Exposition, {{constructed}} in San Francisco by the Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> {{a cost of}} $50 million, was open from February 20, 1915, to December 4, 1915. About 19,000,000 people attended, and the exposition was a great success, generating enough profit to build the San Francisco Civic Auditorium with about $1 million remaining. The Palace of Fine Arts is the only building from the fair which remains on the site.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground floor}} of the monastery is where ritual dances are performed. The walls of the monastery also have a profusion of thangkas of Buddhist deities and saints. Curtains are {{suspended}} over the balcony and these are painted with Buddhist symbols. Within the precincts of the monastery there are residential buildings to accommodate about 700 monks, which now houses 450 monks. The abbot of the monastery resides in a house located near the <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> the southeastern corner of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight. The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|If Magus {{joined the}} party, he departs {{to search for}} Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> the fair before it closes, {{prompting}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca to {{set out in the}} Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1920, Goodison Park {{hosted a}} match between; Dick, Kerr's Ladies & St Helens Ladies. An {{estimated}} 53,000 attended the match, {{at a time}} when the average <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> Goodison Park in 1919–20 was near 29,000. Dick, Kerr's Ladies won 4–0. More than £3,000 was raised for charity. Shortly after, the Football Association banned women's football. The reasons given by the FA were not substantial and it is perceived by some that the women's teams were a threat to the men's game. The ban was lifted in 1970.|$|E
