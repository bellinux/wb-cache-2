40|$|Ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> is an {{emerging}} technology enabling molding of thermo-plastic polymers in seconds. A stack of polymer foils is heated by the {{friction between the}} foils and protruding microstructures on a tool when ultrasonic vibrations are generated by a sonotrode. The polymer is molten and adapts {{to the shape of}} the microstructures on the tool. Thus, a micro structure is generated in much shorter time than by injection molding or hot <b>embossing.</b> The objective of this work was investigating how tools for ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> can be fabricated and what is the influence of the tool on the process. How the <b>embossing</b> energy is distributed in the whole process is briefly discussed in this thesis. When ultrasound is generated, the induced energy is mainly transferred to and absorbed in sonotrode, polymer stack, tool and anvil. At the interfaces, ultrasound is reflected and, this way, re-contributing to heat generation. Ultrasonic energy distribution analyses are based on temperature measurements in the <b>embossing</b> tools and dimension measurements on the <b>embossed</b> polymer micro structures. <b>Embossing</b> tools from aluminum, nickel, steel, polycarbonate (PC) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) were produced and <b>embossed</b> with high density polyethylene (HDPE). The cooling rates of different tools are compared while the energy distributed into <b>embossed</b> polymer and <b>embossing</b> tool was roughly calculated. <b>Embossing</b> tools with larger acoustic impedance compared to the <b>embossed</b> polymer reflect more ultrasound back to the polymer for melting. <b>Embossing</b> tools with higher heat conduction result in a faster cooling rate after <b>embossing</b> while with less heat capacity and density a higher peak temperature is achieved. The isolation at the interface between <b>embossing</b> tool and anvil affects the tool temperature and its cooling rate. Consequently, aluminum is more suitable for the sonotrode while nickel and steel are suitable for the tool. <b>Embossing</b> tools from PC and PEEK have shown limited lifetimes for ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> and, therefore, are no appropriate alternative. Various ways have been attempted to fabricate ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> tools. They are milling, nickel electroplating, lithography and silicon etching. New combinations of these ways were also developed to fabricate a tool with multi-level structures or enlarge the tool size. The operating steps, process parameters, challenges, precautions, advantages and disadvantages of these fabrication ways are discussed and compared. Among them, milling is the most promising way producing <b>embossing</b> tools allowing three-dimensional micro structures, up to more than several hundred micrometers in height and down to 50 µm in width. Besides, nickel electroplating was applicable to produce the tools with structure dimensions of less than 50 µm. The templates for electroplating were prepared by lithography and silicon etching. Liquid metals were also prepared to be employed as <b>embossing</b> tool. Their performance and the reasons of failure are discussed. Several micro devices were developed and fabricated demonstrating the fabrication of tools for ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> of three-dimensional micro structures. Design idea, production process and performance are introduced. A Fresnel lens was produced by ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> for the first time. Micro nozzles, 150 and 250 µm in diameter, which were used for gas/liquid dispersion, were produced by ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> and welding. The nozzle could sustain pressures as high as 29 MPa and 2. 5 MPa at 20 °C and 90 °C, respectively. The multi-phase dispersing ability was also proven. An electronic spiral coil forming a molded interconnect device (MID) was fabricated by ultrasonic hot <b>embossing.</b> The surface of the coil was not flat but bowed and the coil line was distributed along a three-dimensional spiral curve. The calculated and measured resonance frequencies of this coil combined with a capacitor were 1. 6 MHz and 1. 65 MHz, respectively. Several polymer surfaces were <b>embossed</b> with tools fabricated by x-ray lithography and electroplating of nickel and milling of aluminum with different structures designs for hydrophobic surfaces. The wettability of the <b>embossed</b> surface was investigated by contact angle measurements. The polymer surface <b>embossed</b> from the x-ray lithography and electroplating of nickel tool turned out being more hydrophobic than the one <b>embossed</b> from the aluminum tool. The contact regimes of the <b>embossed</b> surface from the two <b>embossing</b> tools were also theoretically analyzed. The last application was the ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> of nano-structures, 600 nm in height, on PC and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly (lactic acid) foils. The challenges and the solutions in ultrasonic hot <b>embossing</b> with this tool are introduced. Finally, the nanostructures were successfully <b>embossed</b> into these polymers...|$|R
