He received awards for his marksmanship {{until the age of}} 90 and served as the coach of the Olympic shooting team until 2000. At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself. Aside from some hearing and memory loss, he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor.|$|E
5|$|The FALN {{was led by}} Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, {{who was one of}} the FBI's {{most wanted}} criminals. The group served as the {{predecessor}} of the Boricua Popular Army. Several of the organization's members were arrested and convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery and for firearms and explosives violations. On August 11, 1999 then United States President Bill Clinton offered clemency to sixteen of the convicted militants under the condition that they renounce any kind of violent manifestation. This decision drew criticism towards the Clinton administration from figures that include the Office of the United States Attorney, the <b>FBI,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States Congress.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the <b>FBI</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<b>FBI)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The <b>FBI</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the <b>FBI,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the <b>FBI</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{declared}} a police intervention against terrorists, {{the local media}} quickly questioned the officers' testimonies {{as well as the}} only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<b>FBI)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.|$|E
