50|$|The ‘Duncansby Race’ forms off Ness of Duncansby at {{the start}} of the SE-going tidal stream (flood). Initially {{extending}} ENE but wheeling gradually anti-clockwise until it extends about 1.5 km NW some 2½ hrs later at which point it is known as ‘The Boars of Duncansby’. During the time of the SE stream there is additional turbulence off Duncansby Head, particularly to the East. The race temporarily ceases at the turn of the tide before forming in an ENE direction in the NW-going tidal <b>stream</b> (<b>ebb)</b> before ceasing again at the next turn of the tide. The race is particularly violent and dangerous when the tidal stream is opposed by gales in the opposite direction. During the east-going stream a race forms off Ness of Huna. This race can be particularly violent in an easterly or southeasterly gale.|$|R
5000|$|Scholars on Gorky {{agree that}} {{suffering}} and loss he experienced during the Armenian Genocide strongly informed {{the production of}} his modernist paintings in America. Comparisons of Gorky’s The Plough and the Song (1946-7) with works of his contemporaries {{in the field of}} organic biomorphic abstraction reveal the stark manifestation of his experiences of brutality and horror. Gorky appears to have systematically developed the imagery of the canvas such that many of his biomorphic forms appear to be “bleeding,” alluding to the horrors and violence he witnessed during the Armenian Genocide. He depicts red far more fluidly, yet systematically. Several of his forms appear to be “bleeding,” given the semblance of a trail of blood that streams down from the inflicted “wounds” on the biomorphic forms. Gorky makes liberal use of shading to deliberately draw {{attention to the fact that}} these <b>ebbing</b> blots and <b>streams</b> of red are, in fact, bleeding wounds. Yet, the ironic truth in the way Gorky seems to weld his nostalgia for Armenian culture and rich heritage with the violent history of genocide in a single compositional frame ultimately reflects many Armenians’ own views of their fractured history. There exists a constant dialectic of culture and barbarism in the history of Armenians, where violence persists a theme as constant as the beauty of its culture and its people.|$|R

40|$|In this study, a PortMap Ocean Surface Current Radar {{operating}} in the VHF band was {{used in conjunction with}} a seabed mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler to obtain measurements of current velocity through the Lido channel to the Venice Lagoon. Current flow data were obtained over a six week period from both instruments. These data, together with additional data obtained from tide gauges and wind speed data from weather stations have been used to develop techniques for producing the measurements required to obtain the mass transport of water through the inlet. The combination of data from these two different instruments was used to overcome the limitations of each technology in obtaining a complete estimation of mass transport through the inlet. Seabed mounted ADCPs only provide current measurements for a single geographical point, and are unable to measure the surface current due to side-lobe ringing within a few metres of the surface. It {{is for this reason that}} a second technology, the surface current radar was used to measure the current across the surface of the channel. For the PortMap Ocean Surface Current Radar {{operating in}} the VHF Band (152. 2 MHz) this represents a depth weighted average measurement in the upper 15. 7 cm of the water column. The PortMap radar systems used in Venice produced data that were generally of a very poor signal-to-noise ratio. This was determined to be caused by a hardware fault present in the PortMap radar affecting the range resolution. Although this resulted in insufficient radar coverage of the channel required to produce an evaluation of mass transport, techniques were developed to produce the secondary data required for this purpose. The analysis software was modified to reflect the change in range resolution, enabling high resolution, short-range current vector maps to be produced for the regions surrounding each radar station. During the deployment, a turbid water plume was observed entering on the Sabbioni side of the inlet while the tide continued to ebb on the Lido side of the inlet. The high resolution vector current maps produced were sufficient to observe this interesting current dynamic. These measurements show that during an outgoing tide with a strong <b>ebb</b> tidal <b>stream</b> on the Lido side of the channel, water begins to flow into the channel on the Sabbioni side of the channel. This current dynamic has obvious implications for the transport of sediment from the neighbouring Cavallino beach into the inlet, and into the Venice Lagoon...|$|R
