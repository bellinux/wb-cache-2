A well pattern consisting of a minimum of four concentric rings of horizontal producers and injectors is proposed to conserve pressure from the injection process, minimize loss of CO 2, control the lateral extent of overpressure, and segregate the CO 2 and brine production zones.

40|$|Those {{investing}} in mining companies were, wisely, warned to tread warily {{to avoid being}} duped by ‘wild cat’ promotions, for many companies were blatant speculations and most would fail. The three main causes of failures were misrepresentation {{of the value of}} the ore, over-capitalization combined with <b>insufficient</b> <b>working</b> capital, and mismanagement. Mining investment was a form of gambling, with professional speculators seeking quick profits not long-term rewards. Companies were floated on the basis of inadequate prospecting, and some flotations were unquestionably fraudulent. Laws creating no or limited liability companies were designed to protect investors, but they encouraged floating companies with inadequate capital. Issuing partly paid-up shares required shareholders to pay calls, but often they preferred to forfeit their interests; and sometimes dummies were used to avoid payment. Despite claims of having found good ore, much unproven ground was floated, and share prices fluctuated depending on the latest reports of ore values. Fraudulent or at best exaggerated assay results were produced, for often samples did not reflect the general values. Examples are cited of how to salt mines or provide misleading assays and of companies shepherding their properties in the hope of nearby companies making good discoveries and enabling them to sell their ground for an unearned profit. Management was an expensive cost, especially in overseas companies, but insufficient money was provided to prospect and develop ground. Press ‘puffery’ was condemned, but newspapers relied on information provided by mine managers. Surveyors sometimes produced plans showing reefs that did not exist, and many ‘experts’ imported from overseas were selected to produce the optimistic reports that company promoters required. Examples are cited of deliberately false reports and dubious prospectuses listing carefully selected shareholders’ names to attract investors. And in some cases companies even had either no title or an insecure one to the ground being floated. As stockbrokers could not be trusted, there was opposition to brokers being directors. Nor could miners always be trusted, as they played the market also. Overselling and forward selling of shares were problems, but the main ones were that under-capitalized companies had <b>insufficient</b> <b>working</b> capital: several examples are cited. Some companies were over-capitalized, and it was common to erect expensive plants prematurely. Because only a small percentage of the nominal capital was paid up, companies had to rely on calls to increase their capital. And vendors and company promoters made excessive profits from floating mines. In short, company flotation was more a form of gambling than a way of enabling honest mining...|$|E

It is hypothesized that patterns of behavior do persist in each in dictator, {{as they relate to}} future stock market trends. Special emphasis is directed in reference to behavior pat terns in these indicators before fluctuations in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average of 5 % or greater. The writings of experts in the field of the clinical analysis are examined to determine what to expect in the behavior patterns of these indicators and it is determined that many of their "rules of use" are <b>insufficient</b> when <b>working</b> on the shorter term basis.

40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{relationship}} between working conditions and health status using the data provided by The First Colombian National Survey on Health and Working Conditions (I-ENCST). Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted on 931 workers from 737 work centers. The outcome variable was self-perceived health status (good/poor). Exposure variables were working conditions, i. e. hygiene, safety, ergonomic, and psychosocial risk factors. Additional variables were: sex, age, social class, education level, geographic region, and economic activity. We estimated the relationship between working conditions and health status using crude odds ratios (OR) that were adjusted through logistic regression with their confidence intervals at 95 % (CI 95 %). Results: workers exposed to the following factors had a higher probability of having a poor health status: <b>insufficient</b> <b>working</b> space (aOR 3. 9; 95 %CI 1. 9 - 8. 3), “the position held {{does not make it}} possible to develop skills” (aOR 6. 2; 95 %CI 2. 6 - 14. 7), the work center is very unsafe or not very safe (aOR 7. 5; 95 %CI 3. 0 - 18. 6), and the tools or workstation are inadequate (aOR 5. 6; 95 %CI 2. 3 - 14. 0).

AIM:To identify possible stressors which the healthcare workers in the mentioned region are exposed to and establish a recommendation METHODS: Papers dealing with stress related health problems within Nigeria are presented. There were only two publications found in these topic and setting. Both are presented separately including methodology, results and main findings. RESULTS: Result from the first publication by John et al., (2015) which is titled “Work-related stress among healthcare workers in Ugep, Yakurr Local Government Area, Cross Rivers State, Nigeria: a study of sources, effects and coping strategy” shows that there is a significant relationship between work related stress on healthcare workers and service delivery, work overload and increase in work stress and poor managerial relationship and staff attitude to service delivery. Result from the second publication by Moyoyinola (2008) titled “Effects of Job Stress on Health, Personal and work Behavior of Nurses in Public Hospitals in Ibadan Metropolis, Nigeria”, shows that job stress has a significant effect on physical and mental health of nurses. It also demonstrates that there is a significant difference in personal and work behavior of highly stressed nurses and less stressed nurses. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the data from the two publications listed above lead to a conclusion that workplace stress occurs regularly among healthcare workers in Nigeria due to; shortage of manpower within healthcare settings, underpaid and overworked staff and <b>insufficient</b> <b>working</b> conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of large and complex fault trees {{is a very}} difficult task. The main limit-ing factor is an <b>insufficient</b> <b>working</b> memory. Several methods are available in literature to reduce the working memory requirement including modularization, the so-called ‘re-writing rules’, and truncation, i. e. the use of logic and/or probabilistic cut-offs to determine only the most important system failure modes. The truncation method is very effective, as it allows significant reductions in the computational effort; however, it implies the estimation of the truncation error, a problem not yet solved satisfactorily. Recently, a new method based on the decomposition of a complex fault tree into a set of mutually exclusive simpler fault trees was proposed. The decomposition is repeatedly applied until the generated trees are sufficiently simple to be exactly analysed with the available work-ing memory. Theoretically, this approach would allow the exact {{analysis of}} fault trees of any complexity, but the related computation times are generally too high. The scope {{of this paper is to}} show how the combined application of decomposition and truncation constitutes a valuable method to analyse complex fault trees. The upper and lower bounds of the top-event probability, obtained by applying this method, are very close to the exact value and their difference depends on the dimension of the available working memory. Furthermore, the probabilistic quantification, including the importance measures of basic events, can easily be performed by properly combining the results from the independent analysis of all simpler fault trees. The developed methodology has been implemented in a software tool and successfully applied to the analysis of several complex fault trees, some of which are considered in this paper...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{people suffer}} from {{complaints}} of the arm, neck or shoulder (CANS). CANS causes significant work problems, including absenteeism (sickness absence), presenteeism (decreased work productivity) and, ultimately, job loss. There {{is a need}} for intervention programs for people suffering from CANS. Management of symptoms and workload, and improving the workstyle, could be important factors in the strategy to deal with CANS. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the experienced problems of employees with CANS, as a first step in an intervention mapping process aimed at adaptation of an existing self-management program to the characteristics of employees suffering from CANS. METHODS: A qualitative study comprising three focus group meetings with 15 employees suffering from CANS. Based on a question guide, participants were asked about experiences in relation to continuing work despite their complaints. Data were analysed using content analysis with an open-coding system. During selective coding, general themes and patterns were identified and relationships between the codes were examined. RESULTS: Participants suffering from CANS often have to deal with pain, disability, fatigue, misunderstanding and stress at work. Some needs of the participants were identified, i. e. disease-specific information, exercises, muscle relaxation, working with pain, influence of the work and/or social environment, and personal factors (including workstyle). CONCLUSIONS: Employees suffering from CANS search for ways to deal with their complaints in daily life and at work. This study reveals several recurring problems and the results endorse the multi-factorial origin of CANS. Participants generally experience problems similar to those of employees with other types of complaints or chronic diseases, e. g. related to their illness, <b>insufficient</b> communication, <b>working</b> together with healthcare professionals, colleagues and management, and workplace adaptations.

40|$|Multimedia {{streaming}} means delivering {{continuous data}} to {{a plethora of}} client devices. Besides the actual data transport, this also needs {{a high degree of}} content adaptation respecting the end users’ needs given by content preferences, transcoding constraints, and device capabilities. Such adaptations can be performed in many ways, usually on the media server. However, when it comes to content editing, like mixing in subtitles or picture-in-picture composition, relying on third party service providers may be necessary. For economic reasons this should be done in a service-oriented way, because a lot of adaptation modules can be reused within different adaptation workflows. Although service-oriented architectures have become widely accepted in the Web community, the multimedia environment is still dominated by monolithic systems. The main reason is the <b>insufficient</b> support for <b>working</b> with continuous data: generally the suitability of Web services for handling complex data types and state-full applications is still limited.

The study found, like previous ones, that care home residents’ days were characterised by a lack of activity. Drawing on observations, interviews and focus groups with residents and staff from these homes, this paper attempts to understand why care homes residents do not engage in meaningful activities. We reject the idea that these low levels of activity are a natural part of the ageing process or that they can be explained by notions of resident choice. Instead the findings point to both <b>insufficient</b> funding and <b>working</b> practices within care homes as more substantive explanations. These explanations inform a discussion of how the low levels of engagement in meaningful activity could be addressed and residents’ quality of life improved...|$|R

Material and methods: Both quantitative (Study I and IV) and qualitative (Study II and III) research methods were selected. Study I: quantitative data collection among nurses (n= 270) through a questionnaire and data analysis using logistic regression. Study II: qualitative data collection among nurses (n= 19) through interviews utilising Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM). Study III: qualitative data collection among parents (n= 21) through interviews utilising GTM. Study IV: quantitative data collection through questionnaires in pre- and poststudy design among the intervention group (n= 24) and a control group (n= 27) of nurses. Data analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and variance analysis. Results: The nurses reported <b>insufficient</b> <b>working</b> conditions and cultural competence. They experienced difficulties in their interaction with this group of children and their parents, and the difficulties were particularly associated with long professional experience, full-time work and a high proportion of children of foreign origin. The nurses main concern turned out to be their anxiety about missing children being exposed to risks of ill-health due to various conditions in their home environments. Unfamiliar and not understandable psychosocial conditions created difficulties for the nurses when trying to assess health risks for the child s health and development. A theoretical model was created that explains the process of assessing risks for the child s health and various elucidating strategies used by the nurses. The parents main concern turned out to be their feelings of exposure and anxiety about being misjudged as parents due to their origin. Hence they were watchfully checking rapport i. e. if they could perceive sympathy and understanding from the nurses. A theoretical model was created that illustrates the interactive process between parents and nurses and factors determining whether parents believed that rapport was possible to be established. After specific training, the intervention group of nurses rated their cultural competence to be somewhat improved, especially their cultural skills. Conclusions: Deficient working conditions, lack of cultural competence and experiences of difficulties were found among nurses. Assessing risk factors in a child s home environment seems to be a difficult task for nurses in need of certain competence, skills and elucidating strategies. These strategies could further be developed and frame the nurses cultural skills when performing their assessment of health risks for the child. The possibility to establish rapport with the nurse can prevent parents from feeling hesistant and unwilling to bring the child in for check-ups. Thus, it is crucial for nurses to become aware of their own demeanour and way of interacting with parents and children of foreign origin. The concept of establishing rapport frames and elaborates the concerns of cultural encounters and cultural competence in the context of child health services. Short, specific training programmes in cultural competence are helpful for nurses, who rate them as having an impact on their ability to cope with the demands of working with parents and children of foreign origin. Findings and theoretical models in this thesis are important tools for professional reflection, as a means for teaching cultural competence and as a basis for further exploration and conceptualisation...|$|E
5000|$|An active vent at {{the edge}} of the lake is a source of {{elemental}} sulfur, and supports a mining operation. Escaping volcanic gases are channelled through a network of ceramic pipes, resulting in condensation of molten sulfur. The sulphur, which is deep red in colour when molten, pours slowly from the ends of these pipes and pools on the ground, turning bright yellow as it cools. The miners break the cooled material into large pieces and carry it away in baskets. Miners carry loads ranging from 75 kg to 90 kg, up 300 m to the crater rim, with a gradient of 45 to 60 degrees and then 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) down the mountain for weighing. Most miners make this journey twice a day. A nearby sulfur refinery pays the miners by the weight of sulfur transported; as of September 2010, the typical daily earnings were equivalent to approximately $13 US. The miners often receive <b>insufficient</b> protection while <b>working</b> around the volcano [...] and complain of numerous respiratory afflictions. There are 200 miners, who extract 14 tons per day - about 20 percent of the continuous daily deposit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In 2010, an {{accident}} occurred in Americana-SP, Brazil, involving two trains and one bus on a Grade Crossing, when 10 people died and 17 were injured including workers. This paper aims {{to analyze the}} accident using the Model of Analysis and Prevention of Work Accidents (MAPA). The method provides observation of work, interviews and analysis of documents to understand precedents of the event in the following stages: to understand the usual work from the involved people, the changes occurred in the system, the operation of barriers, managerial and organizational aspects. By the end, measures are suggested to avoid new occurrences. The accident took place at night in a site with <b>insufficient</b> lighting. The <b>working</b> condi-tions of bus drivers, train operators and watchmen are inadequate. There were only symbolic barriers (visual and acoustic sig-nals) triggered manually by watchman upon train operator radio communication. The fragility of the barrier system associated to poor lighting and short time to trigger the signaling seem to {{play a critical role}} in the event. Contrary to the official report which resulted in guilt of the bus driver, the conclusion of the paper emphasizes the fragility of the safety system and the need of level crossing reproject...|$|R
40|$|Summary The 22 {{countries}} of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region are experiencing {{an increase in}} the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer. Of the six WHO regions, the Eastern Mediterranean Region is projected to have the greatest increase in cancer incidence in the next 15 years. Furthermore, most cancers are diagnosed at a late stage, resulting in a lower cancer survival rate than in the European Region and the Region of the Americas. With increasing numbers of deaths from cancer, palliative care should be available to relieve suffering in patients with advanced disease {{and at the end of}} life. However, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the palliative care available is variable and inconsistent. Several barriers exist to the development and expansion of palliative care delivery in this region, including the absence of palliative care in national policies, little partnership <b>working,</b> <b>insufficient</b> palliative care education for health-care professionals and volunteers, poor public awareness, and gaps in access to essential pain-relief medicines. In this Review, we explore data and evidence from published literature, WHO meeting reports, cancer control mission reports, and the WHO global NCD country capacity survey to identify the status of palliative care in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, including the challenges and opportunities for development...|$|R
