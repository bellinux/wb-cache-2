5|$|After that, {{she retired}} to Plymouth to rearm, {{returning}} to the French coast on 11 June. From then until 15 June, she supported the army in its advance inland. By 15 June, the troops had advanced {{to the edge of}} Texass gun range; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range, the starboard torpedo blister was flooded with water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the <b>fire</b> <b>mission.</b> With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June, Texas left Normandy for England on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|In February 1967 1 ATF {{focused on}} the Dat Do area and the {{south-east}} of Phuoc Tuy province, initiating a program of conventional operations and pacification, with 5 RAR concentrating on cordon and search and civic action against Viet Cong cadres in the villages, while 6 RAR was tasked with search and destroy missions targeting the Viet Cong D445 Battalion. During the first week 6 RAR conducted ambushes along Route 23 between Dat Do and the Suoi Tre river, pre-empting Viet Cong attacks in the area during the Tet holiday. The results of this operation were modest, and the Australians suffered a number of casualties from a misplaced <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> from the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery which killed four and wounded 13, including Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, who had earlier received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions at Long Tan, and was among the dead. Meanwhile, 5 RAR continued its cordon and search operations. On 13–14 February the battalion completed a cordon and search of An Nhut, just west of Dat Do, with South Vietnamese forces, apprehending 14 Viet Cong suspects, five communist sympathisers, two South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) deserters and a draft dodger. The Australians again suffered heavy casualties after the officer commanding C Company, his second-in-command, and a New Zealand artillery forward observer were killed by an unrecorded ARVN mine. Regardless, these operations met with some success, and over a six-day period the battalion captured 40 Viet Cong. Yet even as Graham continued to refine his strategy the Viet Cong struck, and this sudden initiative would force the Australians into the type of conventional engagement that Westmoreland had been advocating.|$|E

On the day of the landing, a naval task force, Task Force 39 under Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill, including several cruisers and destroyers bombarded the airfields around Buka and the Bonis Peninsula, followed by a <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> on the Shortlands, as part of a diversionary attack to take Japanese attention away from Cape Torokina. Elsewhere, the Treasury Islands were secured by New Zealand and US forces, in the days prior to the landings at Cape Torokina, to secure anchorages around Blanche Harbor and establish a radar station to support air operations over Bougainville. A battalion of paramarines also launched a raid on Choiseul to divert Japanese attention from Bougainville.|$|E
500|$|The action {{had lasted}} just {{two minutes to}} this point, yet already a party of {{approximately}} 10 Indonesians across the river began to engage the Australians with heavy automatic fire, although it was largely inaccurate.

The forward observation officer subsequently called in a defensive artillery <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> onto the abandoned position, reducing the volume of Indonesian fire and allowing the Australians to break contact. Shortly after an Indonesian [...] mortar began to fire, dropping rounds into the jungle towards Siding, away from B Company's escape route. Elements of D Company and Support Company had been deployed so as to support the withdrawal, and the patrol subsequently recrossed the border into Sarawak without further incident, returning to Bukit Knuckle later that evening.|$|E

500|$|The North Korean attacks drove K Company from Yongju that night, {{forcing them}} {{back towards the}} battalion's main {{defensive}} position [...] to the north. Yet the paratroopers managed to reform into a tight perimeter on {{the northern edge of}} Yongju. Renewing their attack at 05:45, the North Koreans then assaulted the command post of US 3/187 RCT and the L Company perimeter, but suffered heavy casualties from American enfilade and direct fire. During this action a column of North Koreans had moved towards L Company just before daybreak, singing as they approached. Dug-in on the forward slopes facing the road, the 3 Platoon position gave the Americans a good field of fire overlooking the rice paddies and they began to engage the North Koreans with machine-guns. Meanwhile, 1 Platoon and Company Headquarters also began to fire in support. Yet in the darkness the attackers claimed to be South Koreans and the Americans subsequently held their fire until the light became sufficient to confirm their identity. An American 57mm recoilless rifle subsequently destroyed a North Korean truck at the head of another column as it moved up the road. The North Koreans then attempted to move a machine-gun forward, but were thwarted as the Americans killed a number of men as took over the weapon. Under heavy fire the North Korean attack was broken up, with many of the survivors attempting to take cover behind the raised road. Meanwhile, the howitzers had continued to support the paratroopers, and by 05:50 the two guns had fired 145 rounds. During a single <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> 54 North Koreans were killed, while by the time US 3/187 RCT was finally relieved later that day C Battery, 674th Artillery Battalion had accounted for more than 200 North Koreans.|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{the noise}} of machine-gun and rifle fire and the Viet Cong bugle calls, Stanley quickly brought the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery into action to support the Australian infantry. Yet as {{he was unable to}} see them, for safety reasons the initial rounds were {{directed}} a distance from 11 Platoon's known location, before [...] "walking" [...] the fire in to between [...] of their position, aided by D Company's favourable location between the Viet Cong and the gunline at Nui Dat, which allowed the rounds to pass over their heads and fall away from them. Landing beyond 11 Platoon, the rounds exploded amid the Viet Cong as they began to form up for an assault. But with 11 Platoon engaged from its left, front and right, it became clear the Viet Cong force was stronger than a platoon, and was probably at least company-sized. Supported by heavy machine-guns, they launched a series of assaults against 11 Platoon, only to be held off by small arms and artillery fire. As the fighting continued Stanley realised a single artillery battery would be insufficient, and at 16:19 requested a regimental <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> using all 24 guns of the 1st Field Regiment, RAA. The Viet Cong continued their assault regardless, surging around the flanks of 11 Platoon. The Australians responded with controlled small arms fire, picking off a number of Viet Cong soldiers as the rain and artillery continued to fall. After making the required corrections Stanley requested another regimental <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> at 16:22, yet still unable to see the rounds land he had to work entirely from radio communications with 11 Platoon, adjusting the fire over an area of [...] using just a map.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1943, the {{regiment}} {{returned to the}} 6th Division and {{was moved to the}} Atherton Tablelands, where it was re-organised for jungle warfare. This resulted in {{the regiment}}'s establishment dropping to 688 personnel. It was also re-equipped with a quantity of short 25-pounders {{as well as some of}} the standard pieces. Still, due to a perception in the Army that there was little need for artillery in jungle warfare, the regiment did not see action again until December 1944 when it joined the 6th Division's campaign in Aitape–Wewak, once again assigned to the 19th Brigade. In January 1945, the regiment received four 4.2-inch mortars to assist in the provision of close support to long-range infantry patrols; two 155mm guns were also added to the regiment's equipment scale. Throughout January and February, the regiment supported the advance from Aitape to the Danmap River. As the campaign progressed, in March they were switched to operations between Maprik and Wewak. Late in the campaign, Bleby left the regiment on promotion to 1st Division Headquarters and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Chapman. The regiment saw action right up until the end of the war, and had the distinction of firing the last <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> in the New Guinea campaign, when on 15 August, it fired 1,000 rounds on [...] "six regimental targets" [...] eight hours after Japan's surrender to deal with a Japanese artillery unit that was continuing to hold out.|$|E

2500|$|At 02:43 on {{the night}} of 16/17 August Nui Dat was heavily bombarded by the Viet Cong, being hit by over 100 rounds from several 82mm mortars, 75mm RCLs and an old Japanese 70mm {{howitzer}} fired from a position [...] to the east. Most of the infantry were deployed at the time, with 5 RAR still engaged on Operation Holsworthy, although a small stay behind party remained. A Company, 6 RAR was on patrol in the north-east of the TAOR, while a platoon from C Company was manning a night ambush to the south-east. Continuing for 22 minutes, it damaged vehicles and tents and wounded 24 men, one of whom later died. The impact was spread over the south and south-east, with the 103rd Field Battery heaviest hit. Despite coming under fire, the guns from the 1st Field Regiment, RAA were quickly brought into action, commencing counter-battery fire at 02:50. As the artillery locating radar was suspected of being faulty, this was done using compass bearings on sound and flash. After the likely firing point was plotted, a regimental <b>fire</b> <b>mission</b> of 10 rounds was fired from each gun totalling 240 rounds, and the mortaring ceased. With the attack over the Australians remained alert in case of a ground assault; however, no follow up occurred. Regardless, the artillery continued to shell suspected firing positions and withdrawal routes until 04:10. Although the Viet Cong were expected to have withdrawn, several company patrols would be dispatched the following morning to search the area east of Nui Dat in response.|$|E
