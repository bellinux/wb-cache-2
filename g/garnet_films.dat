The <b>garnet</b> <b>film</b> {{used in this study}} was a magnetically soft material that was originally designed for a Faraday rotator at optical communication wavelengths in the near infrared region. The film had a thickness of 2. 1 μm and a small optical loss at a wavelength of λ= 780 nm resonant with Rb atoms. The Faraday effect was also small and, thus, barely affected the polarization of light at λ= 780 nm. In contrast, large Faraday rotation angles at shorter wavelengths enabled us to visualize magnetic domains, which were perpendicularly magnetized in alternate directions with a period of 3. 6 μm. We confirmed the generation of an evanescent wave on the <b>garnet</b> <b>film,</b> which can be used for the optical observation and manipulation of atoms {{on the surface of the}} film.

The microstructure and thickness of these <b>garnet</b> <b>films</b> has a strong influence over their optical, magnetic and magneto-optic (MO) properties. The thickness of these films has been measured indirectly via optical interference and ellipsometry, which are unable to map thickness variations due to surface roughness of both the film and the substrate. However, little direct observation has been carried out to provide detailed information about the microstructure of the <b>garnet</b> <b>films,</b> especially in cross-section. All these have resulted in a lack of understanding of processing–microstructure–MO property relationship, which in turn impedes the development of high-performance <b>garnet</b> <b>films.</b> The combined use of focused ion beam (FIB) milling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), described as the FIB–TEM method hereafter, provides a reliable, direct means of characterization of site-specific micron-sized regions of a specimen within a reasonable length of time.

40|$|Plasmon {{resonance}} induced Faraday rotation enhancement in <b>garnet</b> <b>films</b> {{offers the}} promise {{for development of}} compact and higher performance polarization dependent optical devices. Enhancement of Faraday rotation has been achieved utilizing strong localized electric fields induced by the excitation of plasmon resonances in gold nanoparticles deposited on or in garnets. Experimental results are presented that reveal strong Faraday rotation enhancement in bismuth-doped <b>garnet</b> <b>films</b> with gold nanoparticles incorporated in or on the epitaxial films. The strength of the enhancement is governed by {{the thickness of the}} <b>garnet</b> <b>films,</b> the dimensions and separations of the nanoparticle assemblies, and the relative ratio between the height of the nanoparticles and the thickness of the films. For samples with embedded nanoparticles, there have been noticeable effects on the magnetic properties of the films due to the presence of the embedded gold nanoparticles. The embedding of nanoparticles in the films can be practically utilized to control the local anisotropy of the films. Special efforts have been made to improve the growth process and produce sub-micron thick films with thicknesses around 200 nm to ensure that the induced electric fields are uniformly spread over the thickness of the films. At this thickness, nanoparticles have been incorporated {{on the surface of the}} liquid phase epitaxy grown <b>garnet</b> <b>films</b> rather than embedded in the films due to the low growth rate necessary to grow these films. New techniques have been developed to improve the accuracy of Faraday rotation enhancement measurements. Faraday rotation enhancement as high as 110 % has been observed for samples with nanoparticle assemblies incorporated on the surfaces of the films but the enhancement depends on a number of factors and can be substantially lower. Stronger enhancement can be obtained by increasing the nanoparticle height to film thickness ratio as well as increasing the relative spacing between nanoparticles...|$|E
