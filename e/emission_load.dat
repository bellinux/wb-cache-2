Further, there is no mechanism to evaluate the benefits due to emission control strategies as no reliable emission inventory is available, specially to estimate local concentration levels. This paper discusses the development of a vehicle emission inventory {{that could be used for}} estimating vehicle emission with respect to special distribution. This inventory has developed with provision to accommodate improved vehicle emission factors for different vehicle types and traffic conditions in the future. This inventory is capable of estimating <b>emission</b> <b>load</b> due to traffic on any road link categorized as a National road.

Transportation Engineering Division (TED) of the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Moratuwa maintains a road inventory and socio economic database covering the entire country except certain parts in the North & the East. Transport planning model "Transplan" has been developed to estimate the daily vehicle volumes and average operating speeds of vehicles on all main roads in the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMR) and all national roads (A & B Class) in the other provinces except certain parts in North & East. Transplan model was extended to estimate the vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>load</b> for a given set of vehicle emission factors for different vehicle types and operating conditions (average speed).

Surprisingly, all cavities showed significant improvements in Q-values between 4. 2 and 1. 6 K. The BCS surface resistance was lowered by nearly a factor of two. This cannot be explained by solely a reduction of dielectric losses caused by adsorbates at the surface or by a decrease of the mean free path due to possibly diffusion of oxygen into the surface layer. In several experiments also the high field behavior of the cavity improved after the in-situ baking procedure.
