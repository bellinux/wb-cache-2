Starting from a theoretically well-founded general-equilibrium framework, where specialization depends on relative factor endowments and technological differences, we study the possible additional effect of labor unions. Using country-year panel data, we obtain that they are an important determinant of relative economic performance for a sample of manufacturing sectors. In particular low wages-labor-intensive industries turn out to be relatively disadvantaged, while high wages-capital-intensive sectors are relatively advantaged by stronger labor unions.

Yet, {{at all levels of the}} economy, we behave as if we don’t believe this: firms value short-term profits over investment in the workforce; federal policymakers tolerate high, persistent unemployment and underemployment; wages for most of the workforce have stagnated for three decades, despite gains in productivity; unions have become a convenient scapegoat despite their sharp decline in influence; and job satisfaction nationally has declined steadily over the past decade.

40|$|Problems {{related to}} unpopular housing {{are not new}} in Britain's social rented sector. In the past, however, these have {{generally}} been associated with housing provided directly by the state through local authorities. For many, the term 'difficult to let' has become synonymous with large, ageing, poor quality estates managed under a centralised framework and subject to {{a long period of}} low investment and indifferent management. There has also been a long-standing assumption that social housing allocations systems tend to channel the most vulnerable tenants into the least desirable housing. In fact, the problem of difficult to let property is now as pervasive in the not-for-profit sector managed by housing associations as it is within council housing. In many cases the developments affected are small in scale and, in a significant proportion of cases, recently constructed. In explaining why property becomes difficult to let, the local and regional context is clearly important. The balance between social, economic and housing demand circumstances and property and estate characteristics varies between regions. There is relatively little evidence that difficult to <b>let</b> housing <b>association</b> properties are occupied by disproportionate numbers of the most severely disadvantaged tenants and this suggests that something has happened to modify the segregating effects of allocations systems observed in earlier studies. Nevertheless, this apparent change must be seen {{within the context of the}} general trend towards a residual role for social housing in its entirety. The social class and income range of new social sector tenants now is much diminished by comparison with earlier decades with few distinctions between the occupiers of difficult to let and other housing...|$|R

Discussion on this theme is rather complex because, beyond the theory, few country’s experiences are at hand to corroborate theories. Only Canadian case is perhaps the best (good?) example and Brazilian case (the bad one?), apart from the limited example of Argentina and India cases (not so good).

The length to which one man's memory can go in <b>letting</b> drop <b>associations</b> that are vital to another can hardly find a limit. It {{is not to be}} supposed that a person desirous to make an agreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you, with some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first to elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such instances of obliviousness. You naturally remember your peculiar connection with your acquaintance's judicious views; but why should he? Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an additional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of obligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us in our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt to be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of polite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of celebration. In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the first weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best is precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of our neighbours. But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who borrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again forgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so much the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind. Some absent persons cannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and have no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a fellow-visitor's more recent purchase: they may be excellent householders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one wishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a neighbours umbrella may be newer than their own.|$|R

Methods: Internet survey data (2, 399 men; 3, 210 women) captured arousal profiles related to safer sex and unintended pregnancy. Chi square tests and regression analyses gauged associations between arousal profiles, unprotected sex in the last year, and lifetime experience of unintended pregnancy. Results: Many respondents reported arousal loss related to both safer sex products (35 %) and risk of unintended pregnancy (45 %). As expected, {{women and men who}} strongly agreed that safe sex products can lessen their arousal {{were significantly more likely to}} have unprotected sex in the last year than those who strongly disagreed (OR= 1. 8 for men, 3. 7 for women); those who strongly agreed that pregnancy risk can lessen their arousal were significantly less likely to have had an unintended pregnancy than those who strongly disagreed (OR= 2. 0 for men, 1. 4 for women). Surprisingly, safer sex arousal loss was more strongly associated with unprotected sex among women than among men, whereas pregnancy arousal loss was more strongly associated with unintended pregnancy among men than among women. Conclusions: Many men and women are turned off by safer sex practices, while others are turned off by pregnancy risk. Given arousal profiles’ potential contributions to reducing unintended pregnancies and STD transmission, they should be integrated into sexual health behavioral models, research, and programming. status: publishe...|$|R

In the meantime, some residents said drugs were being sold illegally from apartments in the building.

5000|$|Supporters of {{taxation}} usually assert that no such violation of rights is taking place.

The general view is that taxation is required to fund basic provisions that provide for infrastructure and enhance economic growth (i.e. law and order, transport/telecom/energy services). However, this view has been criticized by Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century lawyer and political philosopher, who argued in his essay No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation, because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract.No open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can say this to him; because there is no such association or body of men in existence.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyse}} how managers react to firm's financial {{conditions in the}} Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). To do so we appeal to text mining techniques such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis. The main assumption is that the MD&A content may vary depending on financial and economic conditions companies are experiencing. The study is conducted on a sample of US listed financial companies which experienced, between 1998 and 2011, different financial conditions, namely: 1) companies which filed for Chapter 11, thus having {{a high risk of}} bankruptcy; 2) companies not filing for Chapter 11, but with a medium risk of bankruptcy according to their economic and financial performance ratios; 3) companies not filing for Chapter 11, with a healthy financial situation. The expected results might <b>let</b> emerge an <b>association</b> between the bankruptcy risk levels and the content of the MD&A. In fact, MD&As issued by companies with higher bankruptcy risk are expected to be more optimistic, proactive and appealing, composed of more verbose and complex periods than the MD&As released by healthy companies. This research provides support for stakeholders, as it suggests to read MD&As with a critical interpretation, considering that a very optimistic and positive tone may actually hide an alarm signal. Taking advantage from the text mining analysis, it makes some elements explicit that would otherwise remain implicit or even hidden behind complex periods and sentences. Future insights provided by this research are related to the possible association between the MD&A and the audit opinion. Recent studies demonstrated that auditing firms often fail in predicting the bankruptcy risk of distressed companies. Perhaps, such an error could be due to the role of MD&A, as auditors may consider its content and its tone as signals of future improvements. Through a matching analysis between MD&A and the related audit opinion, further results may be found out...|$|R

The theoretical portion {{deals with the}} comprehensive issue of pulmonary hypertension { [...] } its aetiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology, classification, clinical picture, examination methods, therapy and prognosis. It also covers its health and social aspect, which is further divided into its health and social impact. The health and social aspect is divided into health and illness, health support, prevention and quality of life. The health impact focuses on nutrition, physical activity, natural medications, colds and depression. The social aspect explores the social effects on health, illness and social benefits for clients with pulmonary hypertension. The practical portion of this work presents the results from a quantitative questionnaire carried out with clients monitored at IKEM Prague between 1 July 2008 and 28 February 2009. The purpose of the questionnaire was to establish whether patients with pulmonary hypertension often suffer from depression, whether the illness affects their health and social status and whether clients have sufficient information about pulmonary hypertension. The results show that the objectives were fulfilled. It has been proved that clients with pulmonary hypertension suffer from depression, their health and social status is also affected by the illness and most of them have sufficient information about pulmonary hypertension.

Beneath her forms as well detachment had learned to sit, and behaviour had become for her, in the social sense, a false account of herself. There was but one account of her {{that would have been}} true all the while and that she could give straight to nobody, least of all to John Marcher. Her whole attitude was a virtual statement, but the perception of that only seemed called to take its place for him as one of the many things necessarily crowded out of his consciousness. If she had moreover, like himself, to make sacrifices to their real truth, it was to be granted that her compensation might have affected her as more prompt and more natural. They had long periods, in this London time, during which, when they were together, a stranger might have listened to them without in the least pricking up his ears; on the other hand the real truth was equally liable at any moment to rise to the surface, and the auditor would then have wondered indeed what they were talking about. They had from an early hour made up their mind that society was, luckily, unintelligent, and the margin allowed them by this had fairly become one of their commonplaces. Yet there were still moments when the situation turned almost fresh--usually under the effect of some expression drawn from herself. Her expressions doubtless repeated themselves, but her intervals were generous. [...] "What saves us, you know, is that we answer so completely to so usual an appearance: that of the man and woman whose friendship has become such a daily habit--or almost--as to be at last indispensable." [...] That for instance was a remark she had frequently enough had occasion to make, though she had given it at different times different developments. What we are especially concerned with is the turn it happened to take from her one afternoon when he had come to see her in honour of her birthday. This anniversary had fallen on a Sunday, at a season of thick fog and general outward gloom; but he had brought her his customary offering, having known her now long enough to have established a hundred small traditions. It was one of his proofs to himself, the present he made her on her birthday, that he hadn't sunk into real selfishness. It was mostly nothing more than a small trinket, but it was always fine of its kind, and he was regularly careful to pay for it more than he thought he could afford. [...] "Our habit saves you, at least, don't you see? because it makes you, after all, for the vulgar, indistinguishable from other men. What's the most inveterate mark of men in general? Why the capacity to spend endless time with dull women--to spend it I won't say without being bored, but without minding that they are, without being driven off at a tangent by it; which comes to the same thing. I'm your dull woman, a part of the daily bread for which you pray at church. That covers your tracks more than anything." ...|$|R
40|$|Searching the Web {{involves}} more than sifting through a huge graph of pages and hyperlinks. Specific collaboration networks have emerged that serve domain-specific queries better by exploiting the principles and patterns that apply there. We continue this trend by suggesting heuristics and algorithms to mine the evolution of collaboration networks, to discover interesting roles played by entities. The first section of the dissertation introduces the concept of nurturers using the computer science research community as a case study, while the second section formulates three roles - scouts, promoters and connectors, played by ratings in collaborative filtering systems. Nurturers: Nurturing, a pervasive mammalian trait, naturally extends to most association networks that involve humans. The increased availability of digital and online data about <b>associations</b> <b>lets</b> researchers experiment with algorithms to gain insight into such phenomena. Consider some examples of nurturing: • Slashdot endorsement. Slashdot {{was not the first}} site to link to Firefox, but the publicity Firefox received from this association surely helped it become popular quickly. The phenomenon of many small websites crashing due to publicity received through Slashdot has become well known as the Slashdot Effect. • A VC (Venture Capitalist) seed-funding a new startup. This event has a high nurturing value if the startup’s valuation increases rapidly after the funding. • A blogger writing about a topic. Kim Cameron has nurtured the “Laws of Identity” topic if it later becomes the buzz in blog circles. A nurturer need not always be the innovator or originator. The evangelist who adopts a prodigal idea and launches it on its way to success can also be a nurturer. • A professor guiding his student through the art of scientific research and bootstrapping him into a vibrant research community. New nodes not only emerge around these nurturers, but also become important in the network. Knowing nurturers is useful especially in vertical search, where algorithms exploit the structure of specialized collaboration networks to make search more relevant: knowing early adopters of good web pages can make web-search fresher; a list of VCs ranked by their nurturing value is useful to people with new startup ideas; the list of top nurturers in computer science is a valuable resource for a student seeking to do research. This dissertation presents a framework for discovering nurturers by mining the evolution of an association network, and discusses heuristics and customizations that can be applied through a case study: finding the Best Nurturers in Computer Science Research. Roles of Ratings in Collaborative Filtering: Recommender systems aggregate individual user ratings into predictions of products or services that might interest visitors. The quality of this aggregation process crucially affects user experience and hence the effectiveness of recommenders in e-commerce. The dissertation presents a novel study that disaggregates global recommender performance metrics into contributions made by each individual rating, allowing us to characterize the many roles played by ratings in nearest neighbor collaborative filtering. In particular, we formulate three roles - scouts, promoters, and connectors that capture how users receive recommendations, how items get recommended, and how ratings of these two types are themselves connected (respectively). These roles find direct uses in improving recommendations for users, in better targeting of items, and most impor -tantly, in helping monitor the health of the system as a whole. For instance, they can be used to track the evolution of neighborhoods, to identify rating subspaces that do not contribute (or contribute negatively) to system performance, to enumerate users who are in danger of leaving, and to assess the susceptibility of the System to attacks such as shilling. The three rating roles presented here provide broad primitives to manage a recommender system and its community...|$|R
40|$|Antineoplastic {{drugs are}} a {{heterogeneous}} group of chemicals {{used in the}} treatment of cancer, and have been proved by IARC to be mutagens, carcinogens and teratogens agents (Fucic et al., 1998; Burgaz et al., 1999; Sessink & Bos, 1999; Bouraoui et al., 2011; Gulten et al., 2011; Buschini et al., 2013). In general, chemicals that interact directly with DNA by biding covalently or by intercalating, or indirectly by interfering with DNA synthesis, were among the first chemotherapeutics developed (Jackson et al., 1996). Also, these drugs can induce reactive oxygen species that can lead to DNA damage and, consequently, mutations (Rombaldi et al., 2008). These drugs are often used in combination to achieve synergistic effects on tumour cells resulting from their differing modes of action. However, most if not all of these chemical agents are generally nonselective and, along with tumour cells, normal cells may undergo cytotoxic/genotoxic damage (Connor, 2006; Kopjar et al., 2006; Villarini et al., 2012). The in vivo exposure to antineoplastic drugs has been shown to induce different types of lesions in DNA, depending on the particular stage of cell cycle at the time of treatment. Besides the patients that use these drugs as a treatment, workers that handle and/or administer these drugs can be exposed to these substances; namely pharmacy, and nursing personnel in hospital context. The comet assay identifies injuries which are still reparable, such as single and double-strand DNA breaks, alkali labile lesions that are converted to strand breaks under alkaline conditions and single-strand breaks associated with incomplete excision repair sites (Villarini et al., 2012), thus providing information about recent exposures (Laffon et al., 2005). In particular, the comet assay with the use of enzymes, which recognizes and cuts specifically oxidized DNA bases allows for the evaluation of oxidative DNA damage (Collins, 1999). It {{is one of the most}} used methods in biomonitoring studies of genotoxicity on blood lymphocytes (Cavallo et al., 2009), and is widely used to evaluate the genotoxic effects of exposure to specific antineoplastic drugs in several in vitro and in vivo studies (Digue et al., 1999; Blasiak et al., 2000; Brahnam et al., 2004). DNA glycosylase (OGG 1) represents the main mechanism of protecting the integrity of the human DNA with respect to 8 -OHdG (Hu & Ahrendt, 2005; Jiao et al., 2007), the most well studied biomarker of oxidative damage. Some findings indicate that the inactivation of OGG 1 plays a role in the multistage process of carcinogenesis. The human OGG 1 gene is located on chromosome 3 (3 p 26), and encodes a bifunctional DNA glycolylase endowed with an AP lyase activity. This is a region frequently lost in various types of cancer, especially in small-cell lung cancers where loss of heterozygosity in nearly 100 % of the cases can be observed. Loss of one OGG 1 allele may lead to a moderate generation of 8 -OHdG in DNA. However, loss of both alleles would abrogate OGG 1 activity imposing an increased risk of mutagenicity on the cell due to the imbalance of oxidative burden and accumulation of 8 -OHdG in DNA (Pilger & Rüdiger, 2006). The product of OGG 1 gene exhibits specificity and activity for the excision of 8 -OHdG (Boiteux & Radicella, 1999; Cooke et al., 2003; Au et al., 2004), and has a major role in the prevention of ROS-induced carcinogenesis (Cooke et al., 2003). A common polymorphism is Ser 326 Cys, which affects over 50 % of Chinese and Japanese and approximately 33 - 41 % of Caucasian population (Hu & Ahrendt, 2005). The OGG 1 has a C→G polymorphism at position 1245 in exon 7 which causes the substitution of serine by cysteine at codon 326 (Kohno et al., 1998) and it is associated with increased risk for cancer (Macpherson et al., 2005). The study population consisted of 46 exposed subjects working as pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and nurses that handle antineoplastic drugs of two hospital units, and 46 unexposed control subjects. Isolated lymphocytes were cryopreserved following the protocols of Duthie et al. (2002) and Singh & Lai, (2009). Briefly, isolated lymphocytes suspended in RPMI medium with L-glutamine were either centrifuged (600 g, 10 min) and ressuspended in freezing mix (90 % v/v heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 % v/v DMSO), frozen at - 1 C/min in polystyrene and stored at - 80 C. For analysis of DNA damage and oxidative damage a modification of the comet assay (originally described by (Singh et al., 1988) was used to measure the basal level of DNA oxidation in lymphocytes (Collins, 2009). We measured also DNA oxidative damage by using FPG [kindly donated by Prof. Andrew Collins (Department of Nutrition, University of Oslo, Norway) ]. The slides were dried at room temperature, stained with 25 µl DAPI (1 µg/mL) and visualized. Percentage of DNA in the tail and oxidative damage parameters were measured using Zeiss AxioScope. A 1 fluorescence microscope and Comet Assay IV capture system (Perceptive Instruments ® software) and 50 nucleoids were scored per gel. The genotype of the polymorphisms OGG 1 (rs 1052133) was studied by Real Time PC R using the iCycler iQ®Multicolor Real-Time PCR. It was found higher mean levels of % DNA in tail and DNA oxidative damage in the exposed group (15. 18 ± 1. 40 and 5. 32 ± 0. 54, respectively) in comparison with controls (12. 42 ± 1. 24 and 4. 59 ± 0. 59, respectively). However, no statiscally significant differences (Mann-Whitney test, p> 0. 05) were found between subjects with and without exposure. No significant differences were observed in genotypic and allelic frequencies in OGG 1 polymorphisms under study between exposed and controls (Fisher’s exact test, p> 0. 05) and no consistent trend regarding the variation of biomarkers measured with alkaline comet assay and OGG 1 polymorphisms was found (Kruskal-Wallis test, p> 0. 05). Our results suggest that occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs in healthcare workers induces DNA damage but the increase compared to controls was not significant, being in line with studies from Ursini et al., (2006) and Buchini et al. (2013). A possible explanation may have to do with comet assay predominantly detecting single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, which are induced by antineoplastic drugs (Kopjar et al., 2009). Since both types of DNA damage are continuously and efficiently repaired, the measured damage level is a result of equilibrium between the amount of DNA damage inflicted and the speed of repair (Kopjar & Garaj-Vrhovac, 2001). An important aspect to consider is the fact of antineoplastic drugs are well-known cross-linking agents, which can increase the effective molecular weight of DNA, are thereby are known to reduce the ability of DNA containing strand breaks to migrate in an electric field (Villarini et al., 2011). Occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs is associated with genotoxic effects, although comet assay analyzed parameters were higher in exposed comparing with controls, were not significant. Also the study of the susceptibility biomarkers did not show statistical significant differences, the small size of our sample hampered the finding of a possible <b>association,</b> <b>let</b> alone a causality relationship...|$|R
