5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began their}} 2007football season with emotion and remembrance. As Virginia Tech {{recovered}} from the worst school shooting in American history, football served {{as a way to}} help the university community emotionally heal. The opening game of the season, on September 1, 2007, was against East Carolina University and featured numerous remembrance ceremonies and commemorations. Buoyed by the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> the day, the Hokies earned a 177 victory. Their next game would not be as easy. One week later, Virginia Tech traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to face the No.2 Louisiana State University Tigers. The Tigers were widely regarded in pre-season polls as favorites to play in the National Championship Game and overwhelmed the Hokies in front of a home crowd, 487.|$|E

5|$|The {{first part}} of the episode was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half was written by Peterson and Souders. Due to the {{important}} nature of the episode, Septien, Meyer, Peterson, and Souders began working on the script before Christmas, in the fall of 2010 after the writers had a general idea for the {{first part of}} the 10th season episodes. Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced heart palpitations due to exhaustion, excitement, and the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> the experience.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} reliability and validity of a Cognitive and Emotional Empathy Scale for Adults (CEES-A) and the relationships between empathy and both prosocial and aggressive behavior. The participants were 469 university students. The results of factor analysis reveal six factors. Cognitive empathy consists of two factors: "sensitivity to the <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sens) " and "perspective-taking (pt) ". Emotional empathy consists of four factors: "sharing the positive <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sp) ", "sharing the negative <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sn) ", "good feelings toward the positive <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (gf) " and "sympathy for the negative <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others (sym) ". The results of path analysis indicate that sens, sp, and sn have positive relationships with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, sp has a negative relationship with aggressive behaviors. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future research on empathy...|$|R

5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the <b>emotion</b> <b>of</b> the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the effect <b>of</b> the {{displayed}} <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> third party customers and purchase occasion on customers are examined, {{even when there}} is no direct interaction between customers. Three independent studies, including two experiments are employed. The first experiment examines the effects of both positive and negative displayed <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> third party customers and purchase occasion on customer emotions and repurchase intentions, {{when there is no}} direct interaction between customers. The second experiment captures changes in the customers’ affective state on a moment-by-moment basis enabling differentiation between the effects of the service environment and the intervention of exposure to the displayed <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> third party customers. Results show that customers are “infected” by the displayed <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> third party customers even when there is no direct interaction between the customers. It is also demonstrated that the purchase occasion affects the type and intensity <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> customers experience and the likelihood of repurchase.

40|$|The {{psychology}} <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> {{has been}} studied primarily from an intrapsychic perspective. A social psychological perspective <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> can supplement this intrapsychic approach by examining three areas: (1) controlling the <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others; (2) controlling the thoughts of others through emotional expression; and (3) emotional congruence, or the fit between anticipated emotional communications and actual communications. To control the <b>emotions</b> <b>of</b> others, one must have naive theories about the determinants <b>of</b> <b>emotion.</b> Research has shown that attributional principles form the heart of some zaive conceptions <b>of</b> <b>emotion.</b> Two attribution-based naive theories <b>of</b> <b>emotion</b> play important roles in the social lives of children and adults: self-esteem of others is controlled by altering communications along a locus dimension and anger of others is manipulated by altering communications along a controllabilit...|$|R

These Rasas are – Śringāra (eros and beauty), Vīra (heroism or bravery), Hāsya (mirth), Raudra (fury), Karuṇa (compassion), Bībhatsa (disgust), Bhayānaka (horror), Adbhuta (amazement). Apart from this Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam also has the ninth Rasa as propounded by Mammaṭa – the Śānta Rasa (calmness), and the three new Rasas as – Bhakti (devotion), Vatsala (parental love) and Preyas (love).|$|E
