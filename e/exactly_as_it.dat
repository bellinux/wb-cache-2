25|$|Following a {{performance}} of William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, a huge fire destroyed {{the interior of the}} building in 1899. It had its interior redesigned by Frank Matcham and reopened on 31 December 1901. Externally, the building is <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was when it was first built.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, many camp residents ended up living in temporary shelters elsewhere. The camp itself became the site of intense efforts at documenting, recording and expressing the experiences of those displaced and affected by the incursion. In discussing how to properly honor those who had fallen, one proposal suggested leaving the destruction, at least in the Hawashin neighborhood, <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, as a memorial and testament to struggle and sacrifice. Camp residents, however, insisted that the camp be rebuilt almost <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been, while also establishing a museum of memory in the Old Hijaz Railway building. They rejected the proposal of the Israeli housing minister to rebuild the camp at a nearby site with enlarged roads, viewing it as an attempt to erase the political reality of the camps whose existence they see as living testaments to the 1948 Palestinian exodus.|$|E
25|$|The Charles O. Boynton House is an 1887 Queen Anne style home {{which stands}} along Main Street, {{north of the}} DeKalb County Courthouse. Its {{distinctive}} red brick facade has aged fairly well and the porch is nearly <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in the late 19th century. Boynton was a dry goods dealer. On the adjacent property is the Frederick B. Townsend House. Townsend helped found the DeKalb County Farm Bureau and {{was a native of}} DeKalb County.|$|E

25|$|HR characterizes {{feelings}} and emotions {{as indicators of}} the quality of one's thinking. Within the HR model, unpleasant feelings or emotions, or stressful feelings, indicate that one's thinking is based on insecurity, negative beliefs, conditioning or learned patterns that are not necessarily appropriate to the live moment here and now. They simultaneously indicate that the individual has temporarily lost sight of what HR asserts is his or her own role in creating experience. Pleasant or desired feelings (such as a sense of well-being, gratitude, compassion, peace, etc.) indicate, within the HR model, that the quality of one's thinking is <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> needs to be.|$|E
25|$|The summit {{area is a}} ridge running north–south {{with the}} final pyramid near the {{south-west}} corner and crags on three sides. The southern face is formed by Bowfell Links, an impressive wall of crag scarred by nine vertical gullies and with corresponding tongues of scree at its foot. A climb up these is neither pleasurable nor safe as they are extremely active loose rock channels. The eastern face carries a wealth of features including Flat Crag, Cambridge Crag and the Bowfell Buttress, the latter two providing good climbing. Flat Crag includes the Great Slab, a remarkable tilted sheet of rock which looks <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> sounds. Below these faces runs the Climber's Traverse, a narrow path providing an excellent high-level walking route to the summit from the highest point of The Band. This largely horizontal line contours around beneath many of Bowfell's most dramatic crags, finally reaching the summit via a rocky route known as the River of Boulders, running parallel to the Great Slab. Finally on the north- east corner of the summit ridge is Hanging Knotts, a complex series of faces and outcrops looking down upon Angle Tarn.|$|E
25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or screw bit that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|E

50|$|In a Digital Prototyping workflow, {{manufacturing}} {{teams are}} involved {{early in the}} design process. This input helps engineers and manufacturing experts work together on the digital prototype throughout the design process {{to ensure that the}} product can be produced cost effectively. Manufacturing teams can see the product <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it’s</b> intended, and provide input on manufacturability. Companies can perform molding simulations on digital prototypes for plastic part and injection molds to test the manufacturability of their designs, identifying potential manufacturing defects before they cut mold tooling.|$|R
500|$|The {{remains of}} the Japanese A6M2 Zero [...] "B11-120" [...] from the carrier Hiryu piloted by Airman First Class Shigenori Nishikaichi, who crash landed on Ni'ihau after the second wave {{of the attack on}} Pearl Harbor, are stored at the museum. [...] It is {{displayed}} <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was after the crash. [...] The {{remains of the}} tractor used to create trenches to prevent such a landing are stored at the museum. [...] The trenches were created after the island was warned that the Japanese had planned to use the island as a forward operating base.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's name is {{inspired}} by that of his sire, [...] the Nile, and his dam's sire, Yankee Gentleman. The horse's name also acknowledges Zayat's own Egyptian-American background. The misspelling of [...] "Pharaoh" [...] is permanent, but inadvertent. Zayat originally claimed that the spelling {{was the result of}} an error by The Jockey Club, but the organization's president stated, [...] "The name request for the 2012 colt American Pharoah was submitted electronically on January 25, 2014, through The Jockey Club's interactive registration site. Since the name met all of the criteria for naming and was available, it was granted <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was spelled on the digital name application." [...] Zayat later retracted his statement.|$|E
500|$|Ian Hendry {{stars as}} Dr John Kane, British {{astrophysicist}} {{and head of}} the Phoenix project. Hendry, who had appeared in the television series The Avengers (1961–69) and, according to Anderson, [...] "was always drinking", performed the stunt sequence depicting the aftermath of the Dove crash while drunk: [...] "...he was pissed as a newt, and it was {{as much as he could}} do to stagger away. Despite all that, it looked <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was supposed to on-screen!" [...] In the draft script, Kane's first name is Philip, and he has a wife called Susan. In scenes deleted from the completed film, a romance between Kane and Lise Hartman, a EUROSEC official portrayed by Austrian actress Loni von Friedl, is played out at Kane's villa and on a beach in Portugal.|$|E
5000|$|His 1975 book Blake's Progress, {{in which}} the poet William Blake is a time traveler, has been the author's {{greatest}} critical success. Richard A. Lupoff described <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a revelation," [...] saying [...] "Nelson's style is sharply focused and carefully colored... His plotting is <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> complex <b>as</b> <b>it</b> ought to be and his characters are nicely drawn." [...] It was rewritten and republished as 1985's Timequest.|$|R

500|$|The International Dyslexia Association {{screened}} Taare Zameen Par [...] on 29 October 2008 in Seattle, Washington. Khan {{noted in}} his official blog that there were about 200people in the audience {{and that he was}} [...] "curious to see the response of a non-Indian audience to what we had made." [...] He felt some concern that Taare Zameen Par was shown in a conference room rather than a cinema hall and was projected as a DVD rather than as a film. He said that the showing concluded to an [...] "absolutely thunderous standing ovation" [...] which [...] "overwhelmed" [...] him and that he [...] "saw the tears streaming down the cheeks of the audience." [...] Khan also noted that the reaction to the film [...] "was <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been with audiences back home in India".|$|E
500|$|The {{drug addict}} {{character}} {{appears in the}} songs [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] and [...] "Unknown Caller". [...] "Moment of Surrender", improvised and recorded by U2, Eno, and Lanois in a single take, demonstrates gospel influences. Eno and Lanois said the song is the closest to the group's original concept for an album of future hymns. Eno noted, [...] "Apart from some editing {{and the addition of}} the short cello piece that introduces it, the song appears on the album <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was the first and only time we played it." [...] In the song, the addict is having a crisis of faith. In [...] "Unknown Caller", the character is suicidal and, while using his phone to buy drugs, begins receiving cryptic text messages with technology-inspired directions. The track was developed early in the Fez sessions. The guitar solo at the song's conclusion was taken from the backing track.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{a high level of}} realism, Letts and Dicks hired a {{technical}} advisor, James Burke, a science correspondent who was well known to television viewers thanks to his work as anchorman on the television coverage of the Apollo moon landings and for presenting science series such as Tomorrow's World and The Burke Special. Burke decided that 2003 would be a realistic date for bases to have been established on the Moon, telling the Radio Times that [...] "Men won't go back to the Moon until the 1990s. Neither the Russians nor the Americans have any plans at present and no-one else can afford it. [...] As for the base itself – it should look <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would if they built one tomorrow. [...] They'd be small, supporting 30 or 40 men and running on a shoestring. [...] It'll be like life on a nuclear submarine".|$|E

500|$|This {{objection}} {{is fundamentally}} an argument {{by lack of}} imagination, or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being counterintuitive, and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution {{is not based on}} [...] "chance," [...] but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the [...] "designer." [...] Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem [...] "designed" [...] is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. snowflakes). It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of abiogenesis, that certain structures demonstrate poor design, and that the implausibility of life evolving <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.|$|E
