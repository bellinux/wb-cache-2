500|$|Westenra is {{the second}} {{youngest}} UNICEF Ambassador to date, behind Selena Gomez. In 2005, Westenra visited Ghana to publicise her project, [...] "Bikes for Ghana", and actively helped with fundraising to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them {{to get to their}} schools from outlying surrounding areas. When she was later interviewed about this charity work, she had this to say: [...] "I met girls who had been given bikes and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much it meant to them. We wanted to borrow one just for a photo and they wouldn't let them go; they were really reluctant". 2 May 2007, SYD Edition, LOCAL: 5.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson died in London of {{complications}} following a road accident. [...] Recalling his funeral, the Bishop of Knaresborough remarked [...] "As I gazed {{down on the}} rapt faces of that vast congregation, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they revered him {{as though he were}} the Almighty, though, of course, infinitely stronger on the leg side." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Scientology {{administrator}} Peggy Crawford said in {{a statement}} to The Commercial Appeal: [...] "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings." [...] Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying [...] "They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they could say that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>how</b> {{you meant}} to set about it!" [...] sighed John. [...] "But you know, Morris, you always {{were such a}} bungler." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{expected}} to be discovered. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it <b>could</b> possibly be avoided. John Stumpy was but a few feet away. In a second more {{he would be in}} full sight of me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am very sorry,' said Wilmet, 'but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> to help it. Your room is worse, {{with the}} glare of the setting sun; and so is Cherry's {{at this time of the}} evening.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was better}} {{used to the}} dim light now. I could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> {{emaciated}} she was.|$|E
60|$|No. It was {{a receipt}} from the coal merchant. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he despised {{me when he}} looked at the envelope--I didn't stick it down again very well. And I saw him smile when he found it was only a receipt.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know not}} whether Verena was provoked, but she {{answered}} with more spirit than sequence: [...] "Well, {{you know you}} did pour contempt on us, ever so much; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it worked Olive up. Are you {{not going to see}} her at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{something}} did happen," [...] said old Mangivik, [...] "though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it happened, for the smoke. Did not {{a lump of}} snow fly in your face and knock you over among the children?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> follow every {{instant of}} it; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> just <b>how</b> it was. If {{such a thing}} had {{happened}} to me, I would have died before I spoke of it {{at such a time}} as this. Oh, why do you suppose it happened to you?" [...] the girl grieved.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not but <b>see</b> <b>how</b> right {{he was and}} {{the terrible}} despair of Mina's face became relaxed in thought. There was hope in such good counsel.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{next morning}} {{when we came to}} pull out for Quito with a dozen flat cars loaded with rails, there she was in the cab waiting for us; and in the {{daylight}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much better a looker she was than the night before.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> little indeed she minded now, but I {{also kept}} {{the thread of}} my own {{intellectual}} history. [...] "Yes. Your not liking it is what I speak of as the piece. I hold it, you see, up before you. What, artistically, would you do with it?" ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{remainder}} of the day Jacob did not give words to the sorrow which was in his heart, and perhaps it would have been wiser had he not tried to hold his peace, for, strive as he might, again and again <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> earnestly he was struggling to remain silent.|$|E
60|$|The snow {{began to}} fall rapidly, and, what was worse, the wind blew {{directly}} in our faces, so that sometimes my eyes were so plastered up with snowflakes that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>see</b> <b>how</b> to drive. I never knew snow to fall with such violence. The roadway in front of us, as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it, was soon one unbroken stretch of white from fence to fence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{wonderful}} your {{finding out that}} I had been carried off in the Phantom. That was what troubled me most, except about mother. I did not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> you <b>could</b> guess that the brigantine we had both noticed the day before was the Phantom. I felt sure that you would suspect who it was, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> you would connect the two together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} have, {{now that you}} have {{something}} to look forward to; and you will be in excellent hands; the very thing I wanted for you, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> to manage it. I am going to dress. I shall tell them to send in dinner; and if I am not down, I shall be in the nursery. You won't come in to dinner, Leonard?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, wal, {{of all the}} {{moonlight}} nights that ever I did see, I never did see one equal to that. Why, {{you could see the}} color o' every thing. I 'member <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the huckleberry-bushes on the rock was red as blood when {{the moonlight}} shone through 'em; 'cause the leaves, you see, had begun to turn.|$|E
6000|$|Then Guy {{was opening}} {{the door for her}} and she stood in the doorway. She was in dark furs wrapped about her, but in the instant <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> ill she was and how broken. She came a step or so towards me and then stopped short, and so we stood, shyly and awkwardly under Guy and Tarvrille's eyes, two yards apart. [...] "You see," [...] she said, and stopped lamely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Elma," [...] she said, {{leaning over}} her, [...] "do {{you know what}} that was? That was the Naga Snake Dance. It gave you an almost irresistible longing to rise, and hold the snake in your own hands, and coil his great folds around you. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> you felt. But you were strong enough to resist. That was very well done. You {{resisted}} even the force of my music, didn't you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It is {{stressful}} doing a live TV broadcast," [...] she says. [...] "You can't {{make any}} mistakes {{at all in}} positioning or staging. At that time, the performances were not recorded, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only get feedback {{from family and friends}} afterwards." [...] Yang's mother was her most loyal viewer, and the advice she gave was professional and straightforward. Yang owes a lot to her mother's input.|$|R
60|$|I {{shook my}} head: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> poor people had {{the means of}} being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up {{like one of the}} poor women I saw {{sometimes}} nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste.|$|R
6000|$|... 155. Here again my torment would {{flame out}} and afflicte me; yea, it would grind me, as it were, to powder, {{to discern the}} {{preservation}} of God towards others, while I fell into the snare; for in my thus considering of other men's sins, and comparing of them with my own, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> evidently <b>see</b> <b>how</b> God preserved them, notwithstanding their wickedness, and would not let them, as he had let me, to become a son of perdition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stephen," [...] he confessed, [...] "I loathed {{that play}} {{the first night}} I saw it. I sha'n't forget how miserable I was. Louise was so {{wonderful}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> she swayed all that audience just by lifting or dropping her voice; but the story was a horror to me. The next day--well, she talked to me. She was very kind and very considerate. She explained many things. I try my best, now, {{to look at the}} matter from her point of view." ...|$|E
60|$|So I passed on, {{through the}} old, low, broad-eaved houses that cringe {{down to the}} very street, {{out into the open}} again. The air was fierce and savage. On one side was a moorland, level; on the other a sweep of naked hill, curved concave, and {{sprinkled}} with snow. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> wonderful it would all be, under five or six feet of winter snow, skiing and tobogganing at Christmas. But it needed the snow. In the summer there is to be seen nothing but the winter's broken detritus.|$|E
60|$|Ah well, I was {{not angry}} with him. I was sorry, very sorry, {{and that was}} all. Of course I was not so blind but that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the matter stood. He {{was in love with}} Edie, and he could not bear to think that I should have her. Poor devil, how could he help it? Maybe I should have been the same. There was a time when I should have {{wondered}} that a girl could have turned a strong man's head like that, but I knew more about it now.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] Chebron replied as {{he paced}} restlessly {{up and down}} the room. [...] "Now that I know the truth it seems {{impossible}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have really believed that all the strange images of our temples really represented gods. It worried me to think of them. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they <b>could</b> be, and yet I never doubted their existence. It seems to me now that all the people of Egypt are living in a sort of nightmare. Why do those who know so much suffer them to remain in such darkness?" ...|$|R
60|$|This seemed, indeed, a problem. Euphemia {{declared}} {{that she needed}} both hands to work her way back by {{the means of the}} long, horizontal limb which had assisted her passage to the place where she sat, and she also needed both hands to hold her prize. It was likewise plain that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not get to her. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> her light steps had taken her over the soft and marshy ground that lay between us. I suggested that she should throw the pelican to me. This she declined to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said to myself, {{often and}} often, 'If Kennedy were here, {{he would soon}} hit upon some plan for getting away;' but {{for the life of}} me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it was to be managed. It was a dull time, I can tell you. The food was bad, and the cooking was worse. Only a few {{officers}} were there, most of them being sent to some place a long distance inland; but, as we were all wounded, I suppose they thought that the loss of blood would keep us quiet.|$|R
60|$|She was {{extraordinarily}} dignified and extraordinarily absurd. She {{was hurt}} and thwarted beyond measure. She {{had no place}} in her ideas, I thought, for me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it appeared to her, but I could not make her see anything of the intricate process that had brought me to this divergence. The opposition of our intellectual temperaments was like a gag in my mouth. What was there for me to say? A flash of intuition told me that behind her white dignity was a passionate disappointment, a shattering of dreams that needed before everything else the relief of weeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "How did he anger her?" [...] asked Lawrence, {{wishing to}} find out how much this young woman knew. [...] "I haven't the least idea," [...] said Miss Annie. [...] "All I know is, she had quite a long talk with him, in the parlor, and after that she came flying up-stairs, just as indignant as she could be. She didn't say much, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> her soul raged within her." [...] And now the young lady stopped speaking, and looked {{straight}} into Lawrence's face. [...] "It isn't possible," [...] she said, [...] "that you have been sending my cousin to propose to her for you?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} talking of Venice, and {{what life was like}} there, and he made me tell him in some detail. He was {{especially}} interested in what I had to say of the minute subdivision and distribution of the necessaries, the small coins, and the small values adapted to their purchase, the intensely retail character, in fact, of household provisioning; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he pleased himself in formulating the theory that the higher a civilization the finer the apportionment of the demands and supplies. The ideal, he said, was a civilization in which you could buy two cents' worth of beef, and a divergence from this standard was towards barbarism.|$|E
6000|$|Having marched {{together}} for some distance, each leader detached his men and led them, as it were, to opposite directions of the compass, {{three of the}} bands making a considerable detour, {{in order to get}} the spot where the king stood in the centre of us. Then we halted and awaited the next signal. In about ten minutes it was given--a loud whistle--and we gave the word [...] "Forward" [...] again. I say [...] "we," [...] because the result proved that we had done so. Being out of sight of the other bands, of course <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they acted.|$|R
60|$|What a frightful {{distance}} {{he would}} fall!--for {{there are very}} few birds that fly as high as his starting-point. He would strike and bounce, two or three times, on his way down, but this would be no advantage to him. I would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard. I would rather, in fact, for the distance down would be about the same, and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the peasants got up to that chalet--the region seemed too steep for anything but a balloon.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not like}} the tone that Ethelbertha took. There seemed to be a frivolity about her, unsuited to the theme into which we had drifted. That a woman should {{contemplate}} cheerfully an absence of three or four weeks from her husband appeared to me to be not altogether nice, not what I call womanly; it was not like Ethelbertha at all. I was worried, I felt I didn't want to go this trip at all. If it had not been for George and Harris, I would have abandoned it. As it was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> to change my mind with dignity.|$|R
