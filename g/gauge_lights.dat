40|$|In Japan, {{built-up}} member {{composed with}} <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is used for}} studs of shear wall. Flexural buckling stress of built-up compression member is evaluated by effective slenderness ratio. The effective slenderness ratio of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> built-up compression member is proposed for heavy sections; however, it is not verified {{that it can be}} adopted in <b>light</b> <b>gauge.</b> In this paper, full scale testing of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> built-up members are conducted. From the test results, it is shown that current Standard overestimates the buckling strength. Based on energy equilibrium theory, modified effective slenderness ratio for <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> built-up member is derived. The validity of the modified effective slenderness ratio is shown with test results...|$|R

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members can}} be {{assembled}} in various combinations to provide cost-efficient and safe <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> floor systems for buildings. Such <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floor systems are widely accepted in industrial and commercial building construction. <b>Light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floor systems must {{be designed to}} serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. Floor assemblies with higher fire resistance rating are needed to develop resilient building systems for extreme fire events. Recently, a new composite panel system based on external insulation has been developed for <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floors to provide higher fire resistance rating under fire conditions. This article presents the details of an experimental investigation of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floors made of both the conventional (with and without cavity insulation) and the new composite panel systems under standard fires. Analysis of the fire test {{results showed that the}} thermal and structural performance of externally insulated <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floor system was superior than conventional <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floors with or without cavity insulation. Details of the experimental results including the temperature and deflection profiles measured during the tests are presented along with the joist failure modes. Such fire performance data can be used in the numerical modelling of <b>light</b> <b>gauge</b> steel framing floor systems to further improve the understanding of their fire behaviour and to develop suitable fire design rules...|$|R
