40|$|Study Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} safely implementing a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) in established gynecologists' practices with on-site coaching and monitoring of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> by an experienced visiting surgeon. Design: Multicenter prospective feasibility and implementation study (Canadian Task Force classification II- 2). Setting: Eleven general gynecologists in 8 hospitals (1 university hospital and 7 regional hospitals) participated. Patients: Laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed in 83 patients during <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> and in 83 patients after <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Interventions: During <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> an experienced visiting laparoscopist was available for coaching during each LH. A competence score was marked on an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) form. Complications were recorded intraoperatively and postoperatively for 6 weeks after surgery in all patients. Measurements and Main Results: Nine of 11 gynecologists reached the competence score of at least 28 points during the study, from January 2005 to January 2007. A major complication occurred in 3 of 83 LH procedures (4 %) performed during <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> and in 5 of 83 LH procedures (6 %) performed after <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> (p =. 72). Conclusion: The concept of a visiting surgeon for on-site coaching and monitoring of established gynecologists during <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> of an advanced laparoscopic procedure using Objectively Structured Assessment of Technical Skills is feasible. According to the observed complication rate during and after <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> on-site coaching is a useful tool when implementing a new laparoscopic technique in established gynecologists' practices.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{debate whether}} laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) is {{superior}} to open pyloromyotomy (OP) remains actual. A recent review showed no benefit between the LP or OP, but in the studied randomized, controlled trials <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> was not addressed. Comparing LP including <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> with OP after <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> is questionable. In previous research, <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> of LP was analyzed. It was concluded that the plateau was reached after 35 procedures with a steep decrease in complications when comparing before and after 35 procedures. This {{study was designed to}} retrospectively analyze the results obtained in HPS patients after <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> in LP has been reached. The results will be compared with results of OP in HPS patients in the same period. METHODS: A retrospective analysis in 106 OP and 57 LP was performed from September 2008 to June 2012. RESULTS: The overall complication rate in the OP group was significantly higher than in the LP group (18 % vs. 3. 5 %, p = 0. 012). Also there was a higher major complication rate in the OP group (10. 4 % vs. 1. 7 %, p = 0. 045).

Patients who underwent robotic or laparoscopic surgeries were compared retrospectively (n = 77 and n = 123 respectively). Cumulative sum (CUSUM) {{was used to evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Results. Robotic operations were comparable with laparoscopic in the average blood loss and conversion rate, but differed in the longer duration (237. 5 ± 74. 9 min versus 213. 5 ± 73. 1 min, p = 0. 024). The short-term outcomes and pathomorphological characteristics were not significantly different in both procedures. According to CUSUM, <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> of robotic surgery was the 46 cases and of laparoscopic surgery was the 54 cases. Comparison between 1 st phase and 2 nd phase in the robotic group showed significant difference in the total operation time and in docking and surgeon console time. Other perioperative characteristics did not differ significantly between the phases of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> For <b>the</b> laparoscopic group, there was also a decrease in the operation time after the 1 st phase of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> as well as a statistically significant decrease in intraoperative blood loss (140. 9 ± 68. 8 ml for 1 st phase versus 108. 1 ± 67. 8 ml for 2 nd phase, p = 0. 009).

Nevertheless, oncological RRC, especially if performed with intracorporeal ileocolic anastomosis confectioning, cannot be considered a technically easier procedure. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> of <b>the</b> RRC performed for oncological purposes and to evaluate its safety and efficacy investigating the perioperative and pathology outcomes in <b>the</b> different <b>learning</b> phases. METHODS: Data on a consecutive series of 108 patients undergoing RRC with intracorporeal anastomosis between June 2011 and September 2015 at our institution were prospectively collected to evaluate surgical and short-term oncological outcomes. CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) and Risk-Adjusted (RA) CUSUM analysis were performed in order to perform a multidimensional assessment of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for <b>the</b> RRC surgical procedure. Intraoperative, postoperative and pathological outcomes were compared among <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> phases. RESULTS: Based on the CUSUM and RA-CUSUM analyses, <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for RRC could be divided into 3 different phases: phase 1, <b>the</b> initial <b>learning</b> period (1 st- 44 th case); phase 2, the consolidation period (45 th- 90 th case); and phase 3, the mastery period (91 th- 108 th case).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 3794 patients who underwent RALP between Jan 2003 and Sep 2009 by three surgeons (DL, PW, AKT) from three centers (UPenn, Karolinska, Cornell). Mean overall PSM rates and mean overall OT were calculated for all three surgeons at intervals of 50 RALPs per surgeon, and <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> for these means were fit using a loess method.

RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for PSM rates for all patients demonstrated improvements continued with increasing surgeon experience, with over 1600 cases required to get a PSM rate < 10 %. When pT 3 patients were evaluated, <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> started to plateau after 1000 - 1500 cases. Mean OT plateaued after 750 cases though with further surgical experience the OTs started to climb again. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for RALP is not as short as previously thought, and a large number of cases are needed to get PSM rates and OTs to a minimum.
