5|$|Some of Fleming's {{friends had}} their names {{used in the}} story, with Ivar Bryce giving his name to the alias used by Bond, while another friend, Tommy Leiter, found his surname being used for Felix Leiter; Ivar Bryce's middle name of Felix was used for Leiter's first name, while John Fox-Strangways saw part of his surname being used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the MI6 station chief in Jamaica. Fleming also used {{the name of the}} local Jamaican Rufous-throated {{solitaire}} bird as the name of the book's main female character.|$|E

5|$|While {{the story}} was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title GoldenEye traces its origins to the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels.

5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Russian paleontologists began {{excavating}} Psittacosaurus {{remains at}} a locality {{near the village}} of Shestakovo in the oblast of Kemerovo in Siberia. Two other nearby localities were explored in the 1990s, one of which produced several complete skeletons. This species was named P. sibiricus in 2000 in a scientific paper written by five Russian paleontologists, but credit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> is officially given to two of those authors, Alexei Voronkevich and Alexander Averianov. The remains were not completely described until 2006. Two nearly complete, articulated skeletons and a variety of disarticulated material from other individuals of all ages are known from the Ilek Formation of Siberia, which ranges from the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British {{army officer}} and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{who served as}} Vice-Chamberlain {{during the reign of}} King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led to the demise of the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the Hawaiian ukulele.|$|E
5|$|He was {{intended}} to have the name Joachim, but this was stopped on request from Joachim G. Giæver who voiced his dislike <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b> He was then christened Halfdan, changed to Halvdan some years later. The family lived in Tromsø, where Paul Steenstrup Koht was a headmaster and mayor. The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the Liberal Party. Koht finished school here, taking his examen artium in 1890. His father was among his teachers {{for a while in}} Norwegian and Greek. In 1893, one year after the death of Koht's father, the family moved to Bekkelaget, a borough in Aker. Koht studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo).|$|E
5|$|I-75 {{has five}} named {{segments}} in Michigan. The southernmost section {{from the state}} line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. The segment through southern and central Detroit {{is known as the}} Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded Fisher Body, later a part of General Motors. After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for Walter P. Chrysler, founder of Chrysler. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland–Genesee county line.|$|E

Olive Oatman, who lived with the Mohave for five years, later stated that Irataba was {{the brother of the}} former chief, presumably Cairook, with whom Irataba clearly had a close relation. One anecdotal {{description}} states that Irataba had several wives, among them a Hualapai woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son. He also had at least one daughter, the mother of his granddaughter Tcatc who was interviewed in the 1950s. She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother's sons, but that they were eventually lost.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 1995, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new roller coaster, which would open as the tallest, fastest, and longest stand-up roller coaster in the world. The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Mantis, which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis. The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island which opened in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Peribsen's royal name is {{a subject}} of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is {{connected}} to the deity Seth rather than Horus, as was traditional <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of a pharaoh. Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see Hieroglyphics). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the Set animal, representing Seth, on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh, he is not the only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 13th dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre, the 19th dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 20th dynasty king Setnakhte.|$|E

5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} {{roller coaster}} being built at Six Flags Magic Mountain first emerged {{in the summer of}} 2004. Land {{clearing}} began in mid-2005 around the Samurai Summit area of the park with track for the new roller coaster soon later beginning arriving from Ohio. Construction permits filed by Six Flags Magic Mountain and a trademark <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Tatsu (filed on August 23, 2005) were later found by the public. Tatsu was officially announced to the public on November 17, 2005. Both Revolution and Roaring Rapids were temporarily closed in order for the roller coaster to be built. After construction and testing was complete, Tatsu opened to the public on May 13, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{high school}} was the first new high school {{to be built in}} Saint Paul or Minneapolis since the 1970s. The school {{district}} was also not expecting to build another high school for 40 years after. As a result, the competition to name the school was fierce. The name Arlington High School was eventually chosen from a list of 85 suggestions. Two names, Arlington and Mechanic Arts, were quickly favored. Mechanic Arts was the initial favorite after alumni of the former school campaigned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> to be reused after the first Mechanic Arts High School was closed down in 1976 after operating for 86 years. The alumni created a lobbying group and even enlisted the help of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a 1925 graduate of Mechanic Arts. However, the school board's policy of naming schools after local neighborhoods and street names eventually won out with the name Arlington being chosen in a 5-2 vote. The chosen school colors, blue and white, were the colors of Mechanic Arts.|$|E
5|$|The planning, {{design and}} {{development}} phases of Millennium {{took place over}} five years. The first rumors that a new record-breaking roller coaster would be built at Cedar Point, which included speculation about a ten inversion roller coaster from Bolliger & Mabillard and an Arrow Dynamics MegaLooper, began circulating in early 1998. A roller coaster from D. H. Morgan Manufacturing was also rumored. On July 2, 1999, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Millennium Force, which raised more speculation about what the ride would be like. About a week later, the first track pieces were seen at the park, which confirmed that the ride would be manufactured by Intamin. Cedar Point officials also confirmed {{that it would not}} have inversions.|$|E
