2500|$|In Adam Smith's TRPF theory, {{the falling}} {{tendency}} resulted from increased competition which accompanied {{the growth of}} capital. <b>Intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> itself would drive down the average profit rate. Criticizing Adam Smith, David Ricardo argued that competition could only level out differences in profit rates on investments, but not lower the general profit rate (the grand-average profit rate) as a whole. Apart from a few exceptional cases, Ricardo claimed, the average rate of profit could only fall if wages rose. In Das Kapital, Karl Marx criticized Ricardo's idea. Marx argued that, instead, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is [...] "an expression peculiar to the capitalist mode of production of the progressive development of the social productivity of labor". Marx never denied that profits could contingently fall {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but he thought there was also a structural reason for the TRPF, regardless of market fluctuations.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the fatigue responses to the same <b>intensified</b> rugby league <b>competition</b> differed depending on playing standard and physical fitness. Methods: Players from a high-standard (n[*]=[*] 15) and a low-standard (n[*]=[*] 16) junior rugby league team had lower body neuromuscular fatigue, perceptual wellbeing, and blood creatine kinase (CK) assessed over an <b>intensified</b> <b>competition.</b> Global positioning system units measured match activity profiles and rating of perceived exertion-assessed internal loads. Players were divided into high- and low-fitness groups across the two standards based on Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test performance. Results: Playing intensity increased with playing standard and fitness levels (high-standard[*]=[*] 92 [*]±[*] 6 m·min− 1 vs. 88 [*]±[*] 6 m·min− 1; low-standard[*]=[*] 88 [*]±[*] 2 m·min− 1 vs. 83 [*]±[*] 6 m·min− 1). Despite greater internal and external loads, high-fitness players showed smaller reductions in lower body power (high-standard effect size [ES][*]=[*]− 0. 74; low-standard ES[*]=[*]− 0. 41). High-standard players had smaller increases in blood CK (77 %[*]±[*] 94 % vs. 113 %[*]±[*] 81 %; ES[*]=[*]− 0. 41), primarily due to very small increases in the high-fitness group (50 %[*]±[*] 45 %). Conclusions: Increased fitness leads to greater internal and external workloads during <b>intensified</b> <b>competition,</b> smaller increases in blood CK, and less neuromuscular fatigue. Maximising player fitness should be a primary goal of coaches in order to increase match workloads and reduce post-match fatigue during <b>intensified</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|R

On 1 December, its fifteen staff were made redundant and the Grafton Cinema closed its doors for the last time. Shortly afterwards it was converted into a retail outlet.

In September 1959, with the 15M itself deleted from the range, Ford responded to the <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> by offering the larger 1.5-litre engine from the 15M in the 12M for a supplementary payment of only 110 marks.

50|$|Marketing {{of higher}} {{education}} is a well-entrenched macro process today, especially in the major English-speaking nations i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. One of the major factors behind the worldwide evolution of educational marketing could {{be a result of}} globalization, which has dramatically shriveled the world. Due to <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> for overseas students amongst MESDCs, i.e. major English-speaking destination countries, higher educational institutions recognize the significance of marketing themselves, in the international arena. To build sustainable international student recruitment strategies Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to diversify the markets from which they recruit, both to take advantage of future growth potential from emerging markets, and to reduce dependency on - and exposure to risk from - major markets such as China, India and Nigeria, where demand has proven to be volatile. For recruitment strategies, there are some approaches that higher education institutions adopt to ensure stable enrollments of international students, such as developing university preparation programs, like the Global Assessment Certificate (GAC) Program, and launching international branch campuses in foreign countries.|$|E

50|$|Population {{trends in}} North American elk and deer (mule deer and white-tailed deer combined) may be heading in {{opposite}} directions. The number of elk has increased steadily in Colorado and Wyoming, whereas the abundances of deer are {{showing signs of}} decline. Elk on U.S. Forest Service lands in the Rocky Mountains increased from 268,000 in 1965 to 372,000 in 1984. Similarly, the number of elk on Bureau of Land Management lands rose from 35,000 in 1966 to 114,000 in 1985. Meanwhile, the number of deer on U.S. Forest Service lands declined from 1,742,000 in 1965 to 1,197,000 in 1984. Deer populations also declined on Bureau of Land Management lands. Thus, in some areas in the last 20 years, the abundances of elk have increased by about 40%, whereas deer have decreased by about 30%. Possible reasons for the increase in elk populations include mild winters, range extension into lowlands and highlands, increased adaptability to human-modified landscapes, and lack of predation in spite of increased hunting. The causes of the deer population declines remain unknown but may include excessive harvest in the 1970s and habitat overlap with elk, <b>intensifying</b> <b>competition</b> for similar resources. Note, however, that deer population {{in the rest of}} the United States has increased fiftyfold between 1900 and 2005, as hunting has been limited and open space has been preserved.|$|E
