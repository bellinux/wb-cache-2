The adsorption of zinc ions onto silica and the morphology of composite zinc-silica coatings {{as a function}} of the pH of the plating solution were investigated. It was found that the adsorption of zinc ions onto silica, the codeposition of silica, and the formation of hydroxides increase with pH. Titania modified silica particles were found to codeposit at low pH.

The results are in very good agreement with earlier DC resistance studies and with data from the literature.

The band gaps derived from the resistance data, 0. 3 eV for Na 4 C 60 and 0. 5 eV for K 4 C 60, are in excellent agreement with data measured by other methods. For Li 4 C 60, our results disagree with a recent suggestion that the conductivity is dominated by ionic conduction.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{electrode}} material on the high voltage stoichiometry-polarization ("electrocoloration") of Fe-doped SrTiO 3 single crystals has been studied. For different electrode materials (150 -nm Ag/ 15 -nm Cr and 150 -nm Au/ 15 -nm Cr) secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) {{was used to measure}} the depth profile of the O- 18 -isotope after high-field stress.

Experiments {{were carried}} out using patch-clamp {{techniques}} in rat thalamic slices, maintained in vitro, {{to examine the effects}} of the benzodiazepine compound, clonazepam (UP), on intrathalamic inhibition. Bath-applied CZP reduced the y-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA & component of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and currents (IPSPs and IPSCs, respectively) evoked in rat thalamic somatosensory relay neurons by stimulation of nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt), without consistently affecting the GABA, IPSP. Secondary IPSPs, which occur as a result of intrathalamic oscillations, were dramatically reduced. 2. Voltage-clamp experiments combined with local or bath perfusion of the GABA * antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI), demonstrated that nRt is a site of GABA,-mediated postsynaptic inhibition that affects inhibitory output onto relay neurons.

It {{is the very}} first time that a similar procedure is fully described for the preparation of gold microelectrodes. Scanning Electron Microscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry, High Speed Chronoamperometry and Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy were used to characterize the electrodes. Radius of platinum and gold tips ranged from 7 nm and 500 nm up to several micrometers, respectively. Platinum probes with radius < 200 nm were employed in high resolution SECM imaging of an array of nanocavities (600 – 700 nm wide and 400 - 500 nm deep) prepared by means of nanosphere lithography. The small size of the probe employed in the study allowed resolving the features of the sample, showing the significant capability to do electrochemistry with submicrometer spatial resolution.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of phenolic compounds in aqueous media {{is known to}} be affected by the formation of electro-polymerized organic layers which lead to partial or complete <b>electrode</b> <b>blocking.</b> In this study the effect of high intensity microwave radiation applied locally at the electrode surface is investigated for the oxidation of phenol and triclosan in alkaline solution at a 500 m diameter glassy carbon or at a 500 m× 500 m boron-doped diamond electrode. The temperature at the electrode surface and mass transport enhancement are determined by calibration with the Fe(CN) 6 3 −/ 4 − redox system in aqueous 0. 3 M NaOH and 0. 2 NaCl (pH 12) solution. The calibration shows that strong thermal and mass transport effects occur at both glassy carbon and boron-doped diamond electrodes. The average electrode temperature reaches up to 390 K and mass transport enhancements of more than 20 -fold are possible. For the phenol electro-oxidation at glassy carbon electrodes and at a concentration below 2 mM a multi-electron oxidation (ca. 4 electrons) occurs in the presence of microwave radiation.

40|$|Ethanol {{oxidation}} {{has been}} studied on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(110) electrodes in order to investigate {{the effect of the}} surface structure and adsorbing anions using electrochemical and FTIR techniques. The results indicate that the surface structure and anion adsorption affect significantly the reactivity of the electrode. Thus, the main product of the oxidation of ethanol on the Pt(111) electrode is acetic acid, and acetaldehyde is formed as secondary product. Moreover, the amount of CO formed is very small, and probably associated with the defects present on the electrode surface. For that reason, the amount of CO(2) is also small. This electrode has the highest catalytic activity for the formation of acetic acid in perchloric acid. However, the formation of acetic acid is inhibited by the presence of specifically adsorbed anions, such as (bi) sulfate or acetate, which {{is the result of the}} formation of acetic acid. On the other hand, CO is readily formed at low potentials on the Pt(100) <b>electrode,</b> <b>blocking</b> completely the surface. Between 0. 65 and 0. 80 V, the CO layer is oxidized and the production of acetaldehyde and acetic acid is detected. The Pt(110) electrode displays the highest catalytic activity for the splitting of the C-C bond. Reactions giving rise to CO formation, from either ethanol or acetaldehyde, occur at high rate at any potential.

Intracellular recordings {{were obtained from the}} distal apical dendrites and somata and suprathreshold depolarizing current pulses were used to evoke a sAHP. The sAHP was blocked by low concentrations of carbacholine (Cch) but insensitive to high concentrations of apamin. In the presence of extracellular 4 -AP, the first dendritic sAHP evoked was reduced compared to a maximal sAHP evoked in the absence of 4 -AP. The reduction was evident at submillimolar concentration and increased to about 80 % with 4 [*]mM 4 -AP. The stability of the 4 -AP-induced block was affected by the type of anion used in the electrode solution. With K+ acetate (KAc) or K+ methylsulphate (KMeSO 4) containing <b>electrodes,</b> the <b>block</b> was progressively removed during the initial 300 [*]–[*] 400 [*]s of recordings.

Intracellularly applied 4 -AP also induced an acetate-sensitive block of the dendritic sAHP. 4 -AP also blocked the somatic sAHP and the stability of the block showed the same sensitivity towards anions as the dendritic sAHP. Thus 4 -AP appears to block the slow Ca 2 +-activated K+ current underlying the sAHP in a complex manner which is sensitive to certain types of anions...|$|R
