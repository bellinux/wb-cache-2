40|$|Visible plume was {{considered}} as a nuisance to the public due to health and visual issue especially in urban cities, and so heat coils were installed within cooling tower to carry out visible plume abatement. However, {{as it would be}} difficult in building to find heat source and high electricity consumption with <b>heat</b> <b>coil,</b> an alternative approach is required. Prior of developing a visible plume abatement approach, it was essential to identify the formation of visible plume. With this respect, a sophisticated mathematical model, the Poppe Approach was studied and developed a web-based calculator based on the theory. A real size mechanical cooling tower in China was constructed to carry out a validation test and showed to be very accurate and more accurate than the industrial approach, the Merkel Approach. Based on this validated Poppe Approach, an artificial environmental chamber was designed and constructed in China, and tests were conducted to identify the visible plume formation. CFD simulations were conducted to compare with the experimental results to validate the CFD simulation itself. Meanwhile, an alternative visible plume abatement approach was developed, the water shedding approach. The water shedding approach was designed to reduce the hour of visible plume occurrence and also to reduce the severity of visible plume. A building load of a commercial building was used to carry out visible plume abatement evaluation with the water shedding approach. With a Hong Kong climatic data, hours of visible plume would reduce by 38. 2...|$|E

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a variable speed fan and a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through – the fan is upstream of the <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> ...|$|R
