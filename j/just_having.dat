Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes <b>just</b> <b>having</b> a bad day.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{contribution}} to Allied victory in the First World War, Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on the battlefield. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. These also received their own seats in the League of Nations. Canada asked for neither reparations nor mandates. It played only a modest role at Paris, but <b>just</b> <b>having</b> a seat was a matter of pride. It was cautiously optimistic about the new League of Nations, in which it played an active and independent role.|$|E

25|$|The NFL adopted {{some of the}} {{innovations}} introduced by the AFL immediately {{and a few others}} in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks {{to keep track of the}} official game time, instead of <b>just</b> <b>having</b> a stopwatch used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the AFL than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.|$|E

500|$|... "Ironic" [...] {{was written}} by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, and {{produced}} by the former for her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill (1995).

He commented: [...] "I'm telling you, within 15 minutes we were at it—just writing. 'Ironic' was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were <b>just</b> <b>having</b> fun. I thought 'I don't know what this is—what genre it is—who knows? It's just good". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is a song set in the time signature of common time, composed in a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of B major with Morissette's vocal range from the tone of E5 to B5, and [...] "Ironic" [...] chord progression starts with the sequence of Emaj7–F♯6–Emaj7–F♯6, before changing to F♯–Badd2–F♯–G♯m7 in the chorus.|$|E

[...] Laverdure attempted to continue his withdrawal but, <b>just</b> <b>having</b> crossed the Chbouka river, his rearguard was surrounded and attacked repeatedly from all sides, being quickly overrun.

Reviewers have also stated that 4X games feature a range of diplomatic options, and that they are well known for their large detailed empires and complex gameplay. In particular, 4X games offer detailed control over an empire's economy, while other computer strategy games simplify this in favor of combat-focused gameplay.|$|E

Beyoncé further helped {{in the production of}} the song, adding elements that Detail had missed. She and Jay-Z later free-styled their verses for the song and Timbaland contributed keyboards. J-Roc, Dre Moon, Brian Soko and Rasool Ricardo Diaz contributed to the production of the song. Elaborating on the conception of the song, Beyoncé said: [...] "We just kinda had a party.

500|$|Bowie {{agreed to}} what {{at the time}} was {{considered}} a controversial commercial sponsorship agreement with PepsiCo, which was later seen as helping {{to pave the way for}} other big money tours by other artists.

The commercial had a short run, as Pepsi withdrew the commercial after Bowie was accused of sexual assault during the tour. Of the sponsorship agreement, Bowie said, [...] "We did a commercial sponsorship thing only for North America with the Pepsi-Cola company. As far as I'm concerned, what it's allowed me to do, having them underwrite the tour, is to be able to produce a far more extravagant show than if I were just doing it myself.

500|$|One of {{the strongest}} and toughest foes and allies of the game, Elites (who are from Sanghelios) are called Sangheili in the fictitious Covenant language.

Bungie concept artist Shi Kai Wang noted that project lead Jason Jones had, at one point, been insistent on giving the Elites a tail. While Wang thought it made the aliens look too animalistic, the idea was eventually dropped due to practical considerations, including where the tail would go when the Elites were driving vehicles. [...] "At one point, we considered <b>just</b> <b>having</b> the Elites tuck their tails forward, between their legs," [...] Wang noted, [...] "But [...] abandoned that... for obvious reasons." [...] According to Paul Russel, when Bungie was bought by Microsoft and Halo was turned into an Xbox launch title, Microsoft took issue with {{the design of the}} Elites, as they felt that the Elites had a resemblance to cats that might alienate Japanese consumers.|$|E
