25|$|Sixth-ranked Arkansas {{traveled}} to McKethan Stadium for a top-ten SEC showdown with No.4 Florida. The Hogs beat the Gators {{five times in}} 2009. The Razorbacks got home runs from Travis Sample, Bo Bigham and Collin Kuhn, plus ten strikeouts from Drew Smyly to win 8–3. Brett Eibner started game two, but the Gators <b>got</b> <b>six</b> runs in the sixth inning, propelling them to an 8–2 victory. The loss ended the Razorbacks' 13-game winning streak, the program's longest since 1996. Game three was tied 1–1 before Gator freshman Mike Zunino recorded a base hit {{in the ninth inning}} that scored Brian Johnson. This walk-off win gave the No.4 Gators the series.|$|E
25|$|Somerset won the toss at Northampton {{and chose}} to bowl – and {{although}} they got the hosts Northamptonshire out in a day, Martin Love (166) and wicketkeeper Riki Wessels (son of Kepler) (102) made quick centuries to lift the hosts to 408. Conversely, however, two Northamptonshire batsmen batting at 4 and 5 perished for ducks to Richard Johnson. Somerset replied well, though, with 53 from opener Matthew Wood, but rash strokes gave wickets around everywhere as Somerset made 356 – admittedly only 52 behind. Off-spinner Jason Brown <b>got</b> <b>six</b> wickets for 112, just as many as he had taken before this game, while Ian Blackwell played a typical 59 off 77 balls.|$|E

25|$|A menacing spell from Shoaib Akhtar, who <b>got</b> <b>six</b> wickets for 16 runs, {{including}} the first five as Gloucestershire crashed to 22 for 5, left Gloucestershire Gladiators without any hope in the bottom-fight at New Road, Worcester. Akhtar's bowling analysis was {{the best in the}} National League all season. After Akhtar was taken off, Malinga Bandara and Mark Alleyne set about trying to bat out fifty overs, but Alleyne was caught by Worcestershire Royals' Vikram Solanki and Kabir Ali cleaned up the tail with two wickets as Gloucestershire were all out for 105. Bandara then got the wickets of Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki with successive deliveries, but Chris Gayle guided the hosts home with an unbeaten 53 off 70 balls, as Worcestershire won with more than 20 overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|Surrey batted {{first at}} Trent Bridge, after Mark Ramprakash {{had won the}} toss, but despite Ramprakash making 42 the Nottinghamshire bowlers were {{completely}} in control. Andrew Harris took three for 55, Greg Smith removed three wickets in quick succession as Surrey fell from 53 for 1 to 57 for 4, and Surrey were bowled out for 136 with only four batsmen making their way into double figures. Nottinghamshire's reply lasted 66 overs, after eight wickets had fallen in 53 overs {{on the first day}} to take the first day wicket tally to 18, and Martin Bicknell <b>got</b> <b>six</b> for 56 with his swing bowling, his best return of the season. However, Nottinghamshire could thank Mark Ealham who negotiated the difficult conditions well to make 55 as Nottinghamshire earned a 90-run lead.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, after Stuart Matsikenyeri's half-century, they {{required}} 15 runs with 36 balls remaining; however, they only <b>got</b> <b>six</b> of those runs off the next 30 balls, with Gary Brent and Chris Mpofu rarely managing {{to get off}} the strike. Kevin O'Brien, whose only over had cost eight runs, was brought back in the 49th, and he took one wicket and had Mpofu run out in a maiden over. Zimbabwe now needed nine off the last over with only a wicket in hand. Matsikenyeri hit two twos and a single, Ed Rainsford got off the strike with a single off his only ball, before Matsikenyeri tied the scores with a cut for two. With one ball, one wicket and one run in contention, Rainsford's desperate dash caused him to be run out and the match a tie - the third of World Cup history.|$|E

25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only <b>got</b> <b>six</b> break points (converting on three).|$|E

The Phillies put two runners on with a walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino with one out in the eighth. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base, the second close call made by the first base umpire Brian Gorman. Gorman himself later admitted he missed this call, saying [...] "on a freeze frame, it looks like there's {{a little bit of a}} ball outside his glove when he hits the bag."
