25|$|QUINN Therm, at Scotchtown, Ballyconnell, County Cavan was {{commissioned}} in October 2004 {{to produce and}} distribute rigid polyurethane thermal insulation products for the Irish and UK markets. Aventas Therm produces rigid <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> for cavity wall insulation. QUINN Tarmac was established in 1994 to produce a range of blacktop products. Aventas Cement has been in production since 1989 at its Derrylin site using local raw material from the quarry facilities. Because of increasing demand from the construction sector, a second plant {{was commissioned}} in 2000 {{in the northern part}} of the Republic of Ireland, outside the small town of Ballyconnell and close to the Northern Ireland border.|$|E
5000|$|Foamcore, <b>foam</b> <b>board,</b> or paper-faced <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> is a {{lightweight}} and easily cut material used for [...] of photographic prints, as backing in picture framing, in for making scale models, and in painting.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an infi ltration casting technique for manufacturing big size open-cell aluminum <b>foam</b> <b>boards.</b> The principle and key technologies of infi ltration casting are also analyzed. Based {{on the previous}} practice of the small size aluminum foam production, the die for preparing big size aluminum <b>foam</b> <b>boards</b> is designed and manufactured. The experiments on aluminum boards of 300 mm × 300 mm × (20 - 75) mm, with the pore size ranging from 1. 0 to 3. 2 mm and average porosity of 60 %, have been performed. The experimental results show that a reliable infi ltration process depends critically on the pouring temperature of the molten Al-alloy, the preheated temperature of the mould and salt particles and vacuum. Current research explores the possibility of large-scale manufacturing and application of the aluminum foams...|$|R

50|$|If an {{insulated}} slab {{is to be}} poured {{inside the}} grade beam, then the outer surface of the grade beam and the rubble trench should be insulated with rigid XPS <b>foam</b> <b>board,</b> which must be protected above grade from mechanical and UV degradation.|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} thermal bridge effects is {{the installation of}} an insulation board (e.g. <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> EPS XPS, wood fibre board, etc.) over the exterior outside wall. Another method is using insulated lumber framing for a thermal break inside the wall.|$|E
50|$|Self-adhesive foam boards, {{intended}} for art and document mounting are also available, though {{these can be}} very tricky to use properly; {{this is because the}} glue sets very fast. It is considered cheaper to buy plain <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> and then re-positionable spray mount adhesive.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>foam</b> <b>boards</b> {{are usually}} shaped by hand, {{the use of}} {{machines}} to shape them has become increasingly popular. Vacuum forming and modern sandwich construction techniques borrowed from other industries have also become common. Many surfers have switched to riding sandwich-construction epoxy boards which have become especially popular with beginner surfers as they provide a durable, inexpensive, entry-level board.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, mood {{boards are}} made from <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> which can be cut up with a scalpel and can also have spray mounted {{cut-outs}} put onto it. Creating mood boards in a digital form may be easier and quicker, {{especially when it comes}} to collaboration or modification of projects, but physical objects often tend to have a higher impact on people because of the more complete palette of sensations physical mood boards offer, in contrast with the digital mood boards. Mood boards can also be painted.|$|E

50|$|The current {{trend in}} the Dominican Republic is for the ingenios to stop production, and thus {{the only source of}} income for the {{community}} and for the bateys to very slowly transform themselves into new sorts of communities. Los Alcarrizos in the Santo Domingo province {{is a good example of}} something that used to be a batey but now is a municipality which survives through jobs in the area and in Santo Domingo. The Batey is a modern form of slavery where Haitians are paid less than $2.00 American dollars for 12-14 hours of labor. They are forced to sleep on <b>foam</b> <b>boards</b> and live without electricity,running water.|$|R
50|$|The {{problems}} encountered with inland skimboarding are {{the countless}} rocks, sticks, logs, clam shells, railsliders, run-away boards, etc. These obstacles will eventually destroy any <b>foam</b> constructed <b>board,</b> so wood {{is still the}} preferred material of choice for most inland skimmers.|$|R
5000|$|One purported {{benefit of}} {{insulated}} siding {{is its ability}} to reduce energy transfer, which helps maintain the interior temperature of a home. Producers report an average R-value of 2.0 - 5.5, significantly more than that of other siding products including fiber cement, brick and stucco. Homeowners also report insulated siding serves as a noise barrier to external sound. Insulated vinyl siding with added fan fold <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> insulation raises the R-value to 3.5 - 7.5. Fan fold insulation is installed under the final siding product.|$|E

50|$|UV curing is used {{whenever}} {{there is a}} need for curing and drying of inks, adhesives and coatings. UV-cured adhesive has become a high-speed replacement for two-part adhesives, eliminating the need for solvent removal, ratio mixing and potential life concern. It is used in the screen printing process where the UV curing systems are used to cure screen-printed products, which range from T-shirts to 3d and cylindrical parts. It is used in fine instrument finishing (guitars, violins, ukuleles, etc.), pool cue manufacturing and other wood craft industries. Printing with UV curable inks provides the ability to print on a very wide variety of substrates such as plastics, paper, canvas, glass, metal, <b>foam</b> <b>boards,</b> tile, films, and many other materials.|$|R
40|$|Researchers at the National Research Council (NRC) Canada-Construction Portfolio in {{association}} with the Canadian Polyisocyanurate Council conducted collaborative research activities on the long-term thermal resistance (LTTR) of polyisocyanurate (polyiso) foam insulation with impermeable facers. Polyiso boards are commonly used in building envelope constructions (roofs and walls) in cold regions. The primary objective of the research project was to contribute towards the development of a comprehensive test procedure {{that could be used to}} measure the LTTR of polyiso foam insulation products with impermeable facers. As a part of that initiative, a project was initiated in 2001 that consisted of accelerated aging tests using thin slices in parallel with a field investigation in which polyiso boards were installed in a purpose-built test hut at the NRC's Ottawa campus. The polyiso boards installed in the field were monitored for a period of 6 years and subsequently removed from the test hut and tested in the laboratory. This paper presents the field thermal performance of the rigid polyiso <b>foam</b> <b>boards</b> with impermeable facers and critically examines its relationship with the laboratory-measured thin slice aging data. It is hoped that these observations will help construction professionals and researchers to develop a better understanding on the LTTR of impermeably faced polyiso <b>foam</b> insulation <b>boards.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
