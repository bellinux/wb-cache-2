5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This may be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
