5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a <b>field</b> <b>F,</b> where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
5|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number <b>field</b> <b>F</b> splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.|$|E

40|$|A finite field K {{is said to}} be weak for {{elliptic}} curve cryptography if all instances of the discrete logarithm problem for all {{elliptic curve}}s over K can be solved in significantly less time than it takes Pollard 's rho method to solve the hardest instances. By considering the GHS Weil descent attack, it was previously shown that characteristic two finite <b>fields</b> <b>F</b> q 5 are weak. In this paper, we examine characteristic two finite fields Fq n for weakness under Hess' generalization of the GHS attack. We show that the <b>fields</b> <b>F</b> q 7 are potentially partially weak in the sense that any instance of the discrete logarithm problem for half of all elliptic curves over F q 7, namely those curves E for which #E(F q 7) is divisible by 4, can likely be solved in significantly less time than it takes Pollard's rho method to solve the hardest instances. We also show that the <b>fields</b> <b>F</b> q 3 are partially weak, that the <b>fields</b> <b>F</b> q 6 are potentially weak, and that the <b>fields</b> <b>F</b> q 8 are potentially partially weak. Finally, we argue that the other <b>fields</b> <b>F</b> 2 N where N is not divisible by 3, 5, 6, 7 or 8, are not weak under Hess' generalized GHS attack...|$|R

However, {{it has been argued}} that (due to approximations made elsewhere in the derivation) the condition kBT<0.7dF is a better working limit: this corresponds to a λ'T-value of around 1.09, and (for the example case) an upper temperature limit on the CFE regime of around 1770 K.
