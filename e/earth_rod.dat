By regarding the rod-plane gap under lightning impulses {{as a reference}} case, results are presented relating to the discharge interception probability of an <b>earthed</b> <b>rod</b> inserted in the gap; the impulse volt­age polarity, {{the length of the}} reference gap and the <b>earthed</b> <b>rod</b> height were considered as influencing parameters. Proximity effects of a neighbouring object on the interception probability distribution of an air terminal are also investigated by inserting two <b>earthed</b> <b>rods</b> in the reference rod-plane gap. Experimental results are interpreted in terms of the breakdown mechanism and electric field computations. A new lightning attachment model, statistical model, is introduced. Thus, statistical methods for the estimation of lightning incidence to air terminals, shielding design of common structures and for the evaluation of the lightning performance of overhead transmission lines are proposed. Results are compared with that obtained from other lightning attachment models from literature; the statistical model yields results in satisfactory agreement with field data reported in literature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} for LPS (Lightning Protection System) earthing system is to provide its reliable long time service. The earthing system components embedded in soil: earth electrodes, earth conductors and clamps are usually exposed to much more severe environmental factors than those installed in open air area. Main phenomenon influencing their reliable performance is the corrosion affecting earthing system components. The extensive list of different requirements for design and dimensioning of earthing system elements of LPS is given in new series of IEC 62305 on lightning protection {{as well in the}} EN standards related to the specific test requirements for lightning protection system earth electrodes and conductors. Some of these requirements are characterized in the paper. In 2003 started in Poland the long-term project of field corrosion tests of <b>earth</b> <b>rods.</b> The aim of these investigations was to compare the corrosion rate of two commonly used protective coating materials of steel earth electrodes: hot-dip zinc coatings and electrodeposited copper coatings. Preliminary results of <b>earth</b> <b>rods</b> field corrosion tests after 2 and 4 years exposure in different soil types are discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|When {{creating}} an electrical earth for a transformer with vertically driven <b>earthing</b> <b>rods,</b> problems can arise either because {{the ground is}} too hard or because the ground is too resistive to achieve the required earthing resistance. To assist in the planning of earthing installations a geographic information system (GIS) layer has been created. In its simplest form it consists of a colour coded map that indicates the most likely earthing installation: a single vertically driven rod (indicated by dark green); multiple vertically driven rods (indicated by light green); a horizontal trench, where a rod installation is unlikely (indicated by yellow); for difficult ground, a specialist installation (i. e. drilling; indicated by red). However, the GIS can be interrogated to provide site-specific information such as site conditions, likely depth of installation and quantity of earthing materials required. The GIS was created from a spatial model constructed from soil, superficial and bedrock geology that has been attributed with engineering strength and resistivity values. Calculations of expected <b>earthing</b> <b>rod</b> resistance, rod or trench length, and all possible combinations of ground conditions have been compared with the ‘likely’ conditions required {{for each of the}} four proposed installation scenarios to generate the GIS layer. The analysis has been applied to the electrical network distribution regions of Western Power Distribution, in the English Midlands, and UK Power Networks, which covers East Anglia, London and the SE of England.

By using a prism as a mirror two images were obtained from which the path in three dimensions could be computed. Three-dimensional analysis of 400 spark paths showed that each section was consistently related to the previous section; and allowed the determination of the ratio of the mean angle to the vertical of one section to that of the next section. In addition there is a wide, but definable, variation around this mean, which in turn leads to the characteristic shape of spark paths. Knowing the probability of each possible direction for the next section should allow the prediction of the probability of a spark from a high-voltage conductor striking any particular point on the earthed conductor. This has potential applications in the design of high-voltage equipment and lightning protection schemes.

Although previous {{work in this area}} has produced practical guidelines and models that may be used for lightning protection system design and analysis purposes, there has not been an investigation into the commonly encountered scenario of multiple layers of di erent soil types, particularly where high current densities cause ionisation to occur in the surrounding soil.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse {{alternative}} discharging methods of HVDC cables for a DC test in a real situation. It is necessary to research relevant data and consult contacts in order to solve the task. The project {{is based on the}} implementation of a developed system on the testing object and preceded by tests in the High Voltage Laboratory in Karlskrona. Simultaneously the main requirement is to completely exclude any human contribution in the discharging process of the DC cable and to maintain the highest safety standards in line with ABB policy. Currently the discharge process after DC testing is completed manually. Testing is carried out by increasing the voltage until the test voltage is reached and kept constant throughout the test period. Followed by switching off the voltage and allowing the cable to initially self-discharge, before it forces the discharge through the discharging water resistor. When the voltage is zero, cable termination ground by providing a secure grounding. Initially the cable charges out through self-discharge and this must continue down to the Uo. To avoid damaging the test object by maintaining the voltage for too long, discharge can begin after 45 minutes if the voltage drops below under 1, 2 Uo. The forced discharge occurs by an <b>earth</b> <b>rod</b> connecting the discharge resistance to the ground. Past tests have shown the occasional use of a linked up Water Conditioning Unit system consisting of the pump and filters to ground out by hoses filled with deionized water.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} transient overvoltages in medium voltage (33 kV) network and the research is based on feeder lines in the Uva province. Parameters which influence lightning performance of overhead distribution lines such as line height, line length, type of structure, availability of shield wire and flash density {{in the area are}} discussed in details. More over, failures due to transient overvoltages {{and its impact on the}} reliability of the network are analyzed in this study. Lightning may cause flashovers from direct strokes or induced voltage from nearby strokes. Direct lightning to power distribution lines causes insulation flashovers in great majority of the cases. Therefore the goal of this research is to estimate the lightning performance level of feeder lines and investigate improvements. Shielding effect from nearby trees, critical flashover voltages for different flashover paths and deterioration of insulation with aging are also discussed. Thus the analysis of lightning related incidents such as transformer failures, arrester failures and nuisance fuse blows are presented. The study of transformer installation reveals that arrester lead length becomes critical during a lightning discharge since it generates high voltage stress in the winding which may fail the distribution transformer. <b>Earth</b> <b>rod</b> impulse resistance is also an important parameter which increases the voltage stress. It is necessary to develop models, using, electrical parameters for simulation of transient overvoltages. The PSCAD software is especially developed to study transient simulations of power systems. Variation of transient overvoltages due to strikes to phase wires, strikes to earth wire, and variation due to striking distance are discussed in this study. Further, simulation of surge arrester performance and nuisance fuse blows are also presented. Finally, the study presents applications to achieve zero lead length in substation, introduction of surge durable fuses and procedures which can be implemented to improve lightning performance in the MV network...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{utilities}} and industries have seen various technological advancements in circuit breaker (CB) testing and analysing. Yet {{most of the}} owners underperform the maintenance activity {{when it comes to}} circuit breaker maintenance and many limit themselves to an operating time test or a static contact resistance test using inappropriate test equipment. The reasons cited for this were ‘complicated test procedures which involve longer outage time on the feeder’, ‘lack of availability of the feeder for maintenance’ and ‘lack of permission to remove the <b>earth</b> <b>rod</b> or earth switch while the breaker was in shutdown condition’. Also the decision making process and pin pointing the fault in a breaker after performing a basic circuit breaker test will often be a challenge. Though the basic tests like timing test on a circuit breaker provides preliminary information about the breaker condition, actual condition of a deteriorating breaker becomes obvious in a well matured state and often revealed only by a catastrophic failure while in service. Different utilities, switch gear manufacturers, researchers and test equipment manufacturers have stressed the importance of various advanced test methodologies to save time and money. Those tests include coil current analysis, dynamic resistance measurement, testing on dual ground conditions, vibration testing, first trip analysis, online testing and so on. These circuit breaker testing technologies often provide critical information of the circuit breaker and make the decision making process simple.

40|$|The hazards from Earth Potential Rise (EPR) at {{existing}} distribution steel poles {{installed in}} a rural farming property were investigated. Different fault scenarios were identified {{as part of the}} project. The software package CDEGS was used to determine conservative allowable voltage criteria for the various fault scenarios and applicable fault clearing times. Touch voltages modelled in CDEGS were all below the allowable voltage criteria for the different size fault currents at all fault locations. Risk was calculated to quantify the hazard. The hazard from EPR can be considered low and the risk can be categorised as negligible. Voltages were modelled in CDEGS to assess the impact on animals, especially cattle. These voltages were also below the tolerable voltage criteria for the different fault scenarios, hence no mitigation was required. A safety analysis on the transfer to the Transmission Distribution -Multiple Earth Neutral (TD MEN) using the ARGON software package indicates that at the steel poles which have distribution transformers, the probability of fatality is already below 1 in 1, 000, 000 and can be further reduced by the installation of 6 m deep <b>earth</b> <b>rods</b> adjacent and bonded to the steel poles.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fringe projection is a commonly used optical technique for measuring the shapes of objects with dimensions of up to about 1 m across. There are however many instances in the aerospace and automotive industries {{where it would be}} desirable to extend the benefits of the technique (e. g., high temporal and spatial sampling rates, non-contacting measurements) to much larger measurement volumes. This thesis describes a process that has been developed to allow the creation of a large global measurement volume from two or more independent shape measurement systems. A new 3 -D large volume calibration artefact, together with a hexapod positioning stage, have been designed and manufactured to allow calibration of volumes of up to 3 x 1 x 1 m 3. The artefact was built from carbon fibre composite tubes, chrome steel spheres, and mild steel end caps with rare <b>earth</b> <b>rod</b> magnets. The major advantage over other commonly used artefacts is the dimensionally stable relationship between features spanning multiple individual measurement volumes, thereby allowing calibration of several scanners within a global coordinate system, even when they have non-overlapping fields of view. The calibration artefact is modular, providing the scalability needed to address still larger measurement volumes and volumes of different geometries. Both it and the translation stage are easy to transport and to assemble on site. The artefact also provides traceabitity for calibration through independent measurements on a mechanical CMM. The dimensions of the assembled artefact {{have been found to be}} consistent with those of the individual tube lengths, demonstrating that gravitational distortion corrections are not needed for the artefact size considered here. Deformations due to thermal and hygral effects have also been experimentally quantified. The thesis describes the complete calibration procedure: large volume calibration artefact design, manufacture and testing; initial estimation of the sensor geometry parameters; processing of the calibration data from manually selected regions-of-interest (ROI) of the artefact features; artefact pose estimation; automated control point selection, and finally bundle adjustment.

40|$|Earthing of Distribution Transformer is very {{important}} in the sense of safety and protection of human beings, livestock and equipment. The construction personals have faced critical issues on earthing when they engage in Installations of Electrical equipment due to high values of earth resistance. The research was carried out to find solutions for two objectives. One of objectives is to design an earthing system for high resistive soil. The other objective is to find solution for earthing in restricted area. It was found that high resistive soil exists in sandy soils in coastal areas as well as hard rocky areas in central part of the Island. There are some rocks located in coastal area too. The soil resistivity plays vital role in earthing of electrical installations. Thus the research was done by using soil enhancement materials such as Charcoal, Lime and Sand of the same location. The mixture of above materials improves the electrolytic property of soil to bring down soil resistivity. The research was done in the field and at laboratory by varying the ratios of Charcoal, Lime and Sand. The test results showed that resistivity becomes minimum value, when the ratio becomes 1 : 1 : 3. of Charcoal: Lime and Sand respectively. The usage of optimum land area for earthing of distribution transformers were achieved by using the base of poles of transformer structure as alternative earth pits. A new design for earth mesh for pole base earth pits was introduced {{as a result of the}} research. An economic analysis was carried out to find the benefits of using soil enhancement materials instead of cement block earths. As a result of eliminating cement block earth, there is a financial gain of 18. 39 %. The case studies were carried in Chilaw area for two different soil types by mixing soil enhancement materials. In this study moisture content of the soil was measured to identify the effect of presence of moisture in soil. The results of the research indicated that the earth resistance drastically reduces due to the presence of moisture content and the organic substances of the soil in addition to the soil enhancement material. Finally, the Ansys-Maxwell software was used for simulate the earthing system in homogeneous medium. The results of simulation were shown that major portion of the energy absorbed by the narrow region, very close to the <b>earth</b> <b>rod.</b> Therefore, the diameter of the earth pit can be reduced to minimize the area of land required for earthing of distribution transformers. It shows the voltage distribution and energy dissipation in the critical cylinder very clearly. In this research a new conceptual design was carried out to reduce earth resistance in newly designed earthing system and in existing transformers by increasing the moisture content around the earth rods of earth pits. An external water container is introduced toprovide water drops to earth pit to keep it at wet condition in dry season to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the earthing system...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with experimental tests and computer simulations to determine the high frequency and transient performance of earth electrode systems. The work has involved an extensive review of published literature, theoretical and analytical investigations of earth electrode systems. The experimental investigations on earth electrodes were carried out an outdoor site prior to electrode testing the test site soil resistivity were undertaken. Specifically, the soil resistivity was obtained {{at the location of}} the vertical test rod. In order to obtain better understanding of the soil stratification, fourteen profiles of soil resistivity were measured at the field site. From the measurements 2 D soil models were constructed to visualise both horizontal and vertical resistivity variation. High frequency and impulse characteristics of vertical test rods up to 6 m length and horizontal electrodes up to 88 m buried in a non-uniform soil outdoor test site were tested. DC, AC and impulse test results show that increasing the length of electrode reduces the earthing resistance but not impedance. It was shown that, the earth resistance/impedance is constant over a low frequency range, while higher or lower impedance values are observed in the high-frequency range due to inductive or capacitive effects, depending on the length of earth electrode. Improved high- frequency and transient response of <b>earth</b> <b>rods</b> was determined experimentally by connecting horizontal electrode enhancements in star or cross formation at the top of vertical rods.

Using non-poisonous baits and a device which emits a small electrical correction, domestic dogs {{were trained to}} avoid commercially-available non-toxic FoxOff® baits. Fifty-six dogs were recruited through online media services (e. g., Facebook).

Each dog’s behaviour, temperament and level of trainability were monitored during each session, based on temperament and behavioural test guidelines and procedures. Dog breeds were categorised based on their level of trainability; easy (i. e., only one to two training sessions and one to two repetitions of electrified baits during those sessions were required), moderate (i. e., only two to three training sessions and two to three repetitions of electrified baits during those training sessions were required), and difficult (i. e., all four training sessions and three repetitions of electrified baits during those four training sessions were required). The results indicated that 50 dogs were successfully trained to avoid the bait and that temperament and breed significantly influenced their level of trainability. Moreover, specific temperaments of obedience, excitability, playfulness and boldness {{were significantly related to}} each of the dog breeds respectively.

The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment.

6000|$|Behind these observances, {{and behind}} the harvest-homes and the rites--half ritual, half folk-lore--which were {{expected}} to secure the fertility of the seed sown, there lurked {{in the minds of}} priests and in the recesses of sanctuaries certain mystic and secret practices of adoration. In these mysteries Demeter was doubtless worshipped in her Chthonian character as a goddess of earth, powerful over those who are buried in her bosom, over death and the dead. In these hidden mysteries of her cult, moreover, survived ancient legends of the usual ugly sort, tales of the amours of the goddess in bestial guise. Among such rites Pausanias mentions, at Hermione of Dryopian Argolis, the fete of Chthonian Demeter, a summer festival. The procession of men, women, boys and priests dragged a struggling heifer to the doors of the temple, and thrust her in unbound. Within the fane she was butchered by four old women armed with sickles. The doors were then opened, and a second and third heifer were driven in and slain by the old women. [...] "This marvel attends the sacrifice, that all the heifers fall on the same side as the first that was slain." [...] There remains somewhat undivulged. [...] "The things which they specially worship, I know not, nor any man, neither native or foreigner, but only the ancient women concerned in the rite."* In Arcadia there was a temple of Demeter, whose priests boasted a connection with Eleusis, and professed to perform the mysteries in the Eleusinian manner. Here stood two great stones, with another over them, probably (if we may guess) a prehistoric dolmen. Within the dolmen, which was so revered that the neighbours swore their chief oath by it, were kept certain sacred scriptures. These were read aloud once a year to the initiated by a priest who covered his face with a mask of Demeter. At the same time he smote the <b>earth</b> with <b>rods,</b> and called on the folk below the earth. Precisely the same practice, smiting the <b>earth</b> with <b>rods,</b> is employed by those who consult diviners among the Zulus.** The Zulu woman having a spirit of divination says, [...] "Strike the ground for them" [...] (the spirits). [...] "See, they say you came to inquire about something." [...] The custom of wearing a mask of the deity worshipped is common in the religions of animal-worship in Egypt, Mexico, the South Seas and elsewhere. The Aztec celebrant, we saw, wore a mask made of the skin of the thigh of the human victim. Whether this Arcadian Demeter was represented with the head of a beast does not appear; she had a mare's head in Phigalia.
