5000|$|The {{possibility}} of the crash having {{been the result of}} a prolonged loss of gas caused by leakage or loss through the valves was discounted since this explanation did not explain the airship's behaviour during its last moments: moreover the fact that the officers on duty had changed watch routinely implied that there had been no particular cause for alarm a few minutes before the crash. The recent change of watch was considered to be a possible contributory factor to the accident, since the new crew would not have had time to get the feel of the airship. It was also considered most unlikely that the accident had been solely caused by a sudden downdraught. A sudden and catastrophic failure was seen as the only explanation. The Inquiry discounted the {{possibility of}} structural failure of the airframe. The only major fracture found in the wreckage was {{at the rear of the}} new framework extension but it was considered that this had either occurred on impact or more probably been caused by the intense heat of the subsequent fire. The Inquiry came to the conclusion that a tear had probably developed in the <b>forward</b> <b>cover,</b> this in turn causing one or more of the forward gasbags to fail. Evidence presented by Professor Bairstow showed that this would cause the R101 to become too nose-heavy for the elevators to correct.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} results of the {{literature}} on the effects of uncertainty on trade states that uncertainty should not matter in the presence of well developed forward markets. Empirical studies, however, do not support this result. We derive the demand for <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> in a small open economy with terms of trade uncertainty. Adopting a standard and more realistic decision structure than the one usually used in this literature, we find that risk averse agents will not buy forwards at an unbiased price. Agents treat forward contracts as an asset rather than as an insurance. This is the reason why, when calibrating the model, only 17 % of imports are covered by forwards. [...] ...|$|E

The limitations of storage space, raw material availability and production capacity at plants and a requirement of maintaining a minimum level of inventory buffer or <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> have been modelled.

40|$|There {{is a huge}} {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} uncertainty on trade levels. One very strong result of that literature is that uncertainty should not matter, as long as well developed forward markets exist. The empirical implications of this result, however, are hard to find in the data. We model terms of trade uncertainty in a small open economy with uncertainty stemming from abroad and derive the equilibrium demand for forward contracts. It turns out that risk averse agents will not buy forwards at an actuarially fair price, thus rendering both the full-hedge theorem and the separation theorem of the afore-mentioned literature obsolete. Using real world data for Germany we calibrate our model. We find that in equilibrium risk averse agents will buy <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> only for investment reasons. The amount of forwards purchased is around 20 % of equilibrium imports. This is broadly in accordance with empirical observed ratios. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} {{result in}} the theory of production under price risk is that if <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> is available, production is determined in terms of the known, quoted forward or futures price, rather than expectations of future prices. In practice, however, primary production often involves joint or substitutable products, so that a natural hedge may be available. In addition, costs such as input prices or interest rates are highly variable and may be correlated with output prices. Supply risk adds to this variation. This paper considers the demand for market-based hedging instruments in relation to such natural hedges and to the possible use of storage for hedging purposes. Under normality of conditional price/cost variation it is shown that for relatively arbitrary nonlinear production technologies and attitudes to risk, producers can plan production and derive their demand for futures by decomposing the organisation into a number of activity centres, involving planning, marketing, cost, and treasury functions. Adding up the hedging demands from each centre, and equating to the effective supply of each type of hedge (natural and market), yields a linear system that may be solved for the optimum quantities of each hedge contract. exposures, forward, futures, hedging, joint products, price risk, production risk, risk, swaps, uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Bank Act of 1993 {{as part of}} the {{restructuring}} of the old Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP), which was originally established in 1949. The BSP was set up in response to substantial deficits in the CBP’s operations prior to 1993 that were incurred in connection with certain quasi-fiscal activities conducted by the CBP consistent with the policies of the national government at the time. These activities included foreign exchange <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> contracts and swaps entered into by the CBP with certain banks and government-owned and-controlled corporations; the CBP’s assumption of the foreign exchange liabilities of some of these corporations and private sector companies during the Philippines’ foreign exchange crisis in the 1980 s; development banking and financing by the CBP; and the CBP’s conduct of open market operations and incurrence of high interest expenses on its domestic securities issued in connection with such operations. The New Central Bank Act mandates the BSP “to maintain price stability conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the economy”. The Act empowers the BSP’s Monetary Board to control the expansion or contraction in monetary aggregates for the attainment or maintenance of price stability.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{quantify}} existing financial barriers among East African Community (EAC) member countries based on analysis of each member country’s foreign exchange market. The primary contribution {{of this paper}} is the generation of an aggregate measure of financial barriers for the three relatively more advanced members (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) using forward foreign exchange and interbank interest rate data. Its empirical results, which are corroborated by other evidence such as the levels of development of the financial markets and restrictions on capital flows, suggest that Kenya is the EAC’s most financially open country, followed by Uganda, and then Tanzania. The fact that the three countries exhibit different degrees of financial openness suggests that financial integration in the EAC region has a way to go.

40|$|According to a {{questionnaire}} survey, the forward-exchange market easily accommodated the demand of U. S. firms for <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> of transactions with German firms during the 1971 floatation {{of the mark}} [...] The U. S. firms employed a variety of hedging techniques. The recent experiments with quasi-floating exchange rates have produced new evidence on some old questions about exchange-rate flexibility. One of these questions is whether substantial flexibility disrupts international trade by stimulating more demand for forward-exchange cover than the market can easily satisfy. 1 For affirmative answers to this question, see the following: H. S. Houthakker, “Exchange Rate Adjustment,” in U. S.

Halm (Princeton, N. J. : Princeton Univ. Press, 1970), pp. 203 – 08. Those who answer this question in the affirmative usually reason along the following lines. Substantial exchange-rate flexibility leads business management to expect greater exchange-rate variations. Therefore, management seeks to cover more of its foreign-exchange explosure (i. e., seeks to “insure” against the greater exchange rate risk by purchasing or selling foreign currency forward. © 1973 JIBS.

This study is also the first attempt to make extensive use of the foreign exchange regulation data reported in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.

40|$|Hong Kong {{is one of}} a few economies {{that operate}} a {{variation}} of a currency board as the basis of their monetary system. This system has persisted despite dramatic changes {{in the way that the}} international monetary system operates and despite changes in Hong Kong's political status. The currency board now faces new challenges with the greater flexibility in the RMB exchange rate and the recent depreciation of the USD that has been dramatically reversed as part of the global financial crisis of 2008. This paper examines how the operations of the Exchange Fund were adapted to react to an earlier period of international monetary disorder when the pegged exchange rate system of the 1950 s and 1960 s collapsed. Based on archival evidence from the HSBC Group Archive, the HSBC Asia Pacific Archive, the Bank of England, UK Treasury and UK Foreign Office, this paper examines how the core rule of issuing currency only against foreign exchange assets was abandoned in 1972. It presents new data on the accounts of the Exchange Fund for this period and describes minutes of the meetings of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee. The evidence explores the 1972 decision in its longer term policy context and argues that it was the culmination of a series of alterations to the operation of the Exchange Fund during the collapse of the pegged exchange rate system from 1967 onward. The main argument is that the Hong Kong government's response to the crumbling of the international monetary system was to make the Exchange Fund operate as much more than a currency board well before 1972. In particular, it was used to provide <b>forward</b> <b>cover</b> for commercial banks but this proved especially costly in the volatile environment of the end of the global pegged exchange rate system, so that in 1974 the assets of the Exchange Fund fell to 77 % of the note issue. ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{developing}} countries have imposed restrictions on {{domestic and international}} financial transactions {{at one time or}} another. Such restrictions have allowed governments to generate significant proportions of their revenues from financial repression while restraining inflation. The eventual fiscal importance of the revenues from seignorage and from implicit taxation of financial intermediation pose a challenge for financial reform and liberalization. This paper presents a model of the role of financial repression in fiscal policy and exchange rate management under capital controls. We show how a balance of payments crisis arises under an exchange rate peg without capital account convertibility in the model economy and how the instruments of financial repression may be used for exchange rate management. The model is compared to the experience of India, a country that exemplifies the fiscal importance of financial restrictions, in the last two decades. In particular, we discuss the dynamics leading up to devaluation in 1991 and the role of financial repression in exchange rate intervention afterwards.
