Although, on the backdrop of russian revolution, he found his thought process very compatible to the philosophy of socialism after he caught his conscience, so only <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> won very first election of 1951 under the banner of socialist party.

500|$|Being very {{handsome}} in his person, {{and of a}} tall stature, his lordship one day attended King William's court, and being admitted into the presence-chamber, asserted the privilege of being covered before his majesty, by walking to and fro with his hat on his head. The king observing him, sent one of his attendants to inquire the reason of his appearance before him with his head covered; to whom he replied, he knew very well in whose presence <b>he</b> <b>stood,</b> <b>and</b> the reason why he wore his hat that day was, because he stood before the king of England. This answer being told the king, and his lordship approaching nearer the throne, was required by his majesty to explain himself, which he did to this effect: [...] "May it please your majesty, my name is Courcy, and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of Ireland: the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty's presence is, to assert the ancient privilege of my family, granted to sir John de Courcy, earl of Ulster, and his heirs, by John, king of England, {{for him and his}} successors for ever." [...] The king replied, he remembered he had such a nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered.|$|E

500|$|The {{campaign}} {{by the press}} lords, notably Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere for [...] "Empire Free Trade", the removal of tariffs within the Empire, culminated in a crucial by-election at which the press lords ran their own candidate {{under the banner of}} the United Empire Party. Robert Topping, the General Director at Conservative Central Office, produced a memorandum showing that Baldwin's support had eroded tremendously. Chamberlain confronted Baldwin with the memorandum. Baldwin was badly shaken, and told Chamberlain he would resign. After a day, Baldwin reconsidered, and even considered giving up his seat and standing in the by-election himself. When Chamberlain told Baldwin that if <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> lost, his successor would be badly damaged, Baldwin replied, [...] "I don't give a damn about my successor, Neville." [...] Chamberlain resigned as party chairman, though he continued as head of the Conservative Research Department, which he had founded, until his death. Baldwin did not stand in the by-election, but he retained his position and attacked the press barons as wanting [...] "power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot through the ages", and the Conservatives won the election. Baldwin and Chamberlain healed their breach, and Chamberlain helped negotiate the return of the press lords to the Conservative fold. Baldwin led the Conservative Party for another six years. In January 1931, Churchill, one of Chamberlain's leadership rivals, left the Conservative front bench in a dispute over policy on India.|$|E

2500|$|Hostettler {{was one of}} the [...] "true believers" [...] in the Republican {{freshman}} class of 1995. He believed the U.S. Constitution should be strictly interpreted and was very critical of government actions—especially those of judges—that he felt overstepped their constitutional limits. Even those who disagreed with Hostettler felt that they knew where <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> would likely give him {{the benefit of the doubt}} that he regularly voted in principle and not for political ends.|$|E

2500|$|Ord {{went forward}} and {{encouraged}} other officers {{to support the}} regulars when they charged. When he reached D Troop, he was out-of-breath, but with a wide grin. He reported to Bigelow {{what had happened and}} that other units on the right were going to support a charge. He asked his friend for permission to give the command. It was granted. Ord then drew his revolver and his sword. Then with eyes upon him <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> yelled, [...] "Forward!" [...] With a determined step he went up the hill.|$|E

According to the report, he had gone out a distance of , where he had placed warning torpedoes on the rail. He continued north a further distance of 500 to 800 feet (150 to 240 m), where <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> gave signals to Jones' train No.1.

2500|$|Formerly {{a member}} of the Conservative Party, Carswell was elected as the MP for Harwich in 2005 and Clacton in 2010. In August 2014, he changed his {{political}} allegiance to UKIP and announced his resignation as an MP, thereby necessitating a by-election in which <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> was returned as a UKIP MP. He explained that he was joining UKIP out of a desire to see [...] "fundamental change in British politics" [...] and because he believed [...] "many of those {{at the top of the}} Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren't serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs." [...] In 2016 Carswell admitted that he had [...] "jumped ship with the express goal of changing the image of UKIP and ensuring that it was an asset rather than a liability in the referendum campaign…to decontaminate the brand". On 25 March 2017 he left the UK Independence Party to sit as an independent MP. He did not stand at the 2017 general election.|$|E
2500|$|The Boondocks {{has been}} a {{frequent}} subject of controversy since its comic-strip debut in 1999, with ABC News noting, [...] "Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons: its cutting-edge humor and unapologetic, sometimes unpopular, views on various issues, including race, politics, {{the war on terrorism}} and the September 11 attacks." [...] Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut, due to its casual use of the word [...] "nigger". According to an article in The Washington Post, references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series' first completed episodes within a week of her death. In 2006, the Reverend Al Sharpton protested the first-season episode [...] "Return of the King," [...] for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s character's use of the word [...] "nigga," [...] saying [...] "Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures." [...] Cartoon Network released a statement in response defending McGruder: [...] "We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>and</b> fought for, and why even today, it is important {{for all of us to}} remember that and to continue to take action," [...] the statement said. The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being [...] "an especially daring episode".|$|E
