25|$|The {{process of}} {{electron}} penetration through a resist {{is essentially a}} stochastic process; there is a finite probability that resist exposure by released electrons can occur quite far {{from the point of}} photon absorption. Increasing the dose increases the number of far-reaching electrons, resulting in more extended resist loss. A leading EUV chemically amplified resist exposed to 80 eV electrons at a <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 80 uc/cm2 showed up to 7.5 nm resist thickness loss. For an open-source resist exposed near 200 uC/cm2 by 80 eV electrons, the resist thickness lost after post-exposure bake and development was around 13nm, while doubling the dose resulted in increasing the loss to 15nm. On the other hand, for doses >500 uc/cm2, the resist begins to thicken due to crosslinking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The use of {{panoramic}} radiography, {{due to its}} numerous advantages, is increasing. Radiographic films used in {{this technique}} are of double emulsion (DE) type which are used with intensifying screens. Single emulsion (SE) films can also be used. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the exposure parameters to achieve an appropriate optical density in these two types of films, and to estimate under such parameters, radiation doses to mandibular bone marrow (MBM), thyroid gland and parotid gland. This study was performed through a tissue equivalent phantom. First, with various tube voltage and tube current, 128 radiographs were taken of phantom with these two types of films. After examining the optical densities, the exposure parameters under which both films have the same density, were determined. Then, phantom again was exposed and MBM, thyroid gland and parotid gland absorbed doses were measured, using TLDs. It was demonstrated that: 1) SE films, in order to provide appropriate optical density, require two times radiation in comparison with double emulsion film; 2) using SE films increases MBM <b>dose,</b> <b>up</b> to 2 - 2. 5 times, thyroid gland <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 1. 7 - 2 times and parotid gland <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 1. 3 times, in comparison with DE films; 3) in DE films, under lower exposure parameters and desirable processing, MBM <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 3. 5 times, thyroid gland <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 1. 5 times and parotid gland <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 5 times will increase.

The effect of irradiation {{on some of}} the physical properties of the copolymer films was investigated. The dose level ranged from 5 to 200 kGy. The thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the thermal stability of the films increased with irradiation <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 100 kGy then it started to decrease. The results of the UV-Visible spectroscopy of the films showed a decrease in the values of optical band gap and band tail width with doses starting from 100 kGy. The DC conductivity (?DC) of the films was found to decrease to about three orders of magnitude from its original value with irradiation <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 100 kGy then it started to increase with higher doses. Moreover, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss values were found to increase with <b>dose</b> <b>up</b> to 100 kGy which may be attributed to {{the increase in the number}} of dipoles in the films due to the irradiation of the copolymer films in air.
