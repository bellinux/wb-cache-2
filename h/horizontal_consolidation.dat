The piezometric level with depth is characterized by negative drawdown starting at around 8 - 10 m depth caused by excessive withdrawal of groundwater. Instrumentation was provided to monitor both horizontal and vertical movements of the test embankment. The measured increases in undrained shear strengths with depth are in agreement with the values calculated from the SHANSEP technique. The secondary compression ratio, Calpha, was 0. 018, or within the normal values for marine clays. The coefficient of <b>horizontal</b> <b>consolidation</b> measured in the field, Ch(field), was higher for soil at 4 and 10 m depths than for the weakest soil at 6 m depth. The back-calculated Ch(field) values range from 3 to 8 m 2 /year, and the ratio of Ch(field) to Ch(lab) ranges from 4 to 5, where Ch(lab) is the coefficient of <b>horizontal</b> <b>consolidation</b> measured in the laboratory. The degree of consolidation estimated from the pore-pressure dissipation measurements agreed with those obtained from settlement measurements.

40|$|Great care {{is taken}} to ensure {{traditional}} laboratory consolidation tests operate under onedimensional conditions. In doing so, restrictions must be imposed upon specimen size (the height to diameter ratio must be less than 0. 4), loading setup (the load must be applied vertically and ensure equal strains) and drainage configuration (water must vertically drain through the top and/or bottom of the sample). These restrictions not only severely limit the versatility of an oedometer test, but unnecessarily protract the time required for testing, and only allow determination of the vertical coefficient of consolidation. A three-dimensional consolidation test, however, could significantly shorten this testing time, and allow for evaluation of consolidation anisotropy of the soil (i. e. ratio of <b>horizontal</b> to vertical <b>consolidation</b> coefficients, cr/cv). Whilst it is relatively straightforward to modify a one-dimensional oedometer test to allow for three-dimensional consolidation, the difficulty lies within the subsequent analysis of settlement-time data, which must be fitted to the theoretical curve corresponding to three-dimensional consolidation. In this paper, the curve-fitting method proposed by Casagrande for evaluation of cv from one-dimensional oedometer tests has been extended to allow for threedimensional consolidation.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} in piezocone dissipation tests that the measured pore water pressure may initially increase and then decrease with time. This phenomenon has been designated as “non-standard” dissipation. For cone penetrometers with the filter element used for measuring pore water pressure located at {{the shoulder of the}} cone, the results of numerically simulated cone penetration and pore pressure dissipation indicate that the “non-standard” dissipation curves are mainly caused by (a) shear-induced dilatancy of overconsolidated clays or dense sandy soils around the cone and (b) possible unloading effects for soil elements moving from the vicinity of the face to the shoulder of the cone. Using the results of an uncoupled radial consolidation analysis, an empirical method has been established for interpreting the field value of the <b>horizontal</b> coefficient of <b>consolidation</b> (ch) from “non-standard” dissipation curves.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{method for}} {{interpreting}} the <b>horizontal</b> coefficient of <b>consolidation</b> (Ch) from non-standard piezocone dissipation curves is proposed. The curves obtained from these tests are non-standard because the measured excess pore pressure does not decrease monotonically with time. They are mainly observed in tests where the pore pressure transducer {{is located at}} the shoulder or on the shaft of a cone penetrometer. It is suggested that possible mechanisms responsible for the non-standard dissipation curves include: (1) shear-induced dilatancy observed in over-consolidated clays and sandy soils, and (2) the unloading effect for soil elements undergoing a relative movement from the tip to the shoulder of a cone, which will result in a lower excess pore pressure at the measuring point than elsewhere around the cone. Radial plane strain consolidation analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of the initial excess pore pressure distribution on the dissipation process. Based on the results of this numerical analysis, an empirical equation is proposed to correct t 50, the time corresponding to 50 % dissipation of the measured maximum excess pore pressure. This time is then used in the standard interpretation of the value of Ch. The proposed method is applied to the interpretation of field test data from Saga, Japan.

In this study, we analyzed the consolidation by vertical drains for soil improvement considering the spatial variability of the coefficients of consolidation. The coefficients for the variation in the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> coefficients of <b>consolidation</b> in Yeonjongdo, South Korea were evaluated, and the probability density function (PDF) was assumed by the Anderson–Darling goodness-of-fit test. Standard Gaussian random fields were generated based on a Karhunen–Loeve expansion, and then transformed using Hermite polynomials in the random field with the log-Gaussian PDF of the coefficient of consolidation. The average degree of consolidation was subsequently calculated using the finite difference method coupled with log-Gaussian random fields. In addition, the stochastic response surface method (SRSM) was applied for the efficient probabilistic uncertainty propagation. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the input parameters of the random field, and the spatial variability was considered using random variables from the Karhunen–Loeve expansion as the input data for the SRSM. The results indicated that when considering the spatial variability of soil properties, the probability of failure for the target degree of consolidation was smaller when the correlation distance was taken into account than when it was not. Additionally, the probability of failure decreased when the correlation distance decreased. Compared with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) results, the SRSM analysis can achieve results of similar accuracy to those obtained using the MCS analysis with a sample size of 100, 000 (numerical runs), and a third-order SRSM expansion with only 333 numerical runs is sufficient for obtaining the probability with errors less than 0. 01...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the past}} few decades, {{increased}} population and infrastructure development have necessitated planning the development activities on soft soil deposits. In addition to treating the existing soft soils, new land areas are formed in the sea in order to expand the adjacent facilities such as Airports and Ports. Land reclamation projects are increasingly carried out in a sustainable way by reusing the maintenance dredged mud as filling materials. There are number of large scale land reclamation projects, where maintenance dredged mud is utilised to fill the reclamation site, such as Port of Brisbane expansion project, offshore expansion project at Tokyo international Airport and Kansai international airport development project, to name few. Soft soils show poor load bearing capacity and undergo large settlement under a load application, thus they should be consolidated prior to the commencement of construction activities. The soft layers are preloaded in conjunction with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) {{to speed up the}} consolidation process. In the case of land reclamation works, the dredged mud slurry is first allowed to undergo sedimentation before it is consolidated. Reliable analysis of time dependent consolidation process and settlement of the soil layer is important to plan ahead the construction activities. Accurate consolidation analysis requires appropriate theories, tools and understanding of the subsoil conditions. Several consolidation theories have been developed to model the consolidation mechanism of soils mathematically, which are solved with boundary conditions relevant to the practical problem to produce mathematical solutions. In the absence of simplistic mathematical solutions, empirical equations and approximations are used to predict the time dependent consolidation and settlement of soil layer. This dissertation focuses on enhancing the consolidation analysis of soft soil layers by the critical review of existing solutions available for the consolidation analysis of single and multi-layers. The standard mathematical solutions available for the radial consolidation of soil layer were developed considering a uniform initial excess pore water pressure distribution in the soil layer. The potential non-uniform excess pore water pressure distributions that can practically occur were not incorporated in the solutions. Within this dissertation, the effect of different non-uniform pore water pressure distributions on the radial consolidation behaviour of a soil layer, where the pore water flow is radially outwards towards a peripheral drain, is analysed through a mathematical study. Graphical solutions are developed for the average degree of consolidation and pore water pressure and degree of consolidation isochrones are plotted. To analyse the time dependent consolidation behaviour of multi-layered soil, empirical equations and approximations have been developed to overcome the difficulties associated with the complex mathematical solutions. These approximations do not have any sound theoretical basis and thus have limitation in their application. Another objective of the dissertation is to investigate the applicability of selected approximation in the consolidation analysis of double layer soil considering different properties, thicknesses and drainage conditions. For this, an error analysis is conducted utilising the advanced soft soil creep model in PLAXIS. One-dimensional consolidation of a double layer system is experimentally modelled in the laboratory. The consolidation tests are simulated in PLAXIS to validate the soft soil creep model. Further, expressions are proposed for the equivalent stiffness parameters of a composite double layer system, which was verified using the results obtained from the experiments and PLAXIS modelling. Sedimentation of soft soil is common in the land reclamations works carried out using dredged mud as filling materials. The initial conditions of the soft soil slurry, such as the water content and salt concentration, influence the settling pattern of particles during the sedimentation. This dissertation presents the extensive laboratory studies conducted to investigate the effect of settling patterns of particles in the final properties of the dredged mud sediment. In the experiments, dredged mud is mixed with sea water and freshwater at different water contents to induce various settling pattern of particles reflecting the sedimentation environment. Series of oedometer tests are conducted for the radial consolidation and vertical consolidation and the compressibility and permeability properties are assessed. From the results the depth variation of the sediment properties and anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical properties are evaluated for the different settling patterns. Further, the dissertation presents a new estimation method to calculate the <b>horizontal</b> coefficient of <b>consolidation</b> from the radial consolidation tests conducted using a peripheral drain. The proposed method was validated using series of radial consolidation tests, which is described in this dissertation...|$|R
