5|$|In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a revision of}} the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini {{on the basis of}} nuclear and mitochondrial data. They showed that the springbok and the gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) form a clade with saiga (Saiga tatarica) as sister taxon. The study pointed out that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study even suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.|$|E
5|$|Saree is the {{traditional}} dress of women in Karnataka. Women in Kodagu have a distinct style of wearing the saree, <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Karnataka. Dhoti, known as Panche in Karnataka, is {{the traditional}} attire of men. Shirt, Trousers and Salwar kameez are widely worn in Urban areas. Mysore Peta {{is the traditional}} headgear of southern Karnataka, while the pagadi or pataga (similar to the Rajasthani turban) is preferred in the northern areas of the state.|$|E
25|$|The early 1980s {{were very}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the decade, with some {{carryovers}} {{from the late}} 1970s. The early 1980s saw a minimalist approach to fashion, with less emphasis on accessories, and practicality considered {{just as much as}} aesthetics. Clothing colors were subdued, quiet and basic; varying shades of brown, tan, and orange were common.|$|E

25|$|The first {{noticeable}} {{symptom of}} breast cancer is typically a lump that feels <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the breast tissue. More than 80% {{of breast cancer}} cases are discovered when the woman feels a lump. The earliest breast cancers are detected by a mammogram. Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits can also indicate breast cancer.|$|E

The population more closely resembles that found in many typical Caribbean ports {{than the rest of}} Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|Sarriko station won the 1998 Brunel Award for Railway Design. It is noticeably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the {{stations}} in the network: {{in place of the}} standard 'fosterito', a vast glazed atrium pours natural light into the entire station, and the long, unbroken escalator ride to the ticket hall from street level gives a dramatic sense of character to the station.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the basis}} of Armia's sound has always been punk rock, the band's {{changing}} musicians have brought with them numerous other styles and material: hardcore, heavy metal, keyboard riffs, sampling, and complex, quasi-orchestral arrangements.

25|$|For {{a period}} of 20 days post {{parturition}} the cow is called a fresh cow. Milk production quickly increases during this phase but milk composition is also significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the cycle. This first milk, called colostrum, is rich in fats, protein, and also maternal immune cells. This colostrum is not usually commercially sold, but is extremely important for early calf nutrition. Perhaps most importantly, it conveys passive immunity to the calf before its immune system is fully developed.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} textual {{variants}} of Luke–Acts, the Western text-type and the Alexandrian. The oldest complete Alexandrian manuscripts date from the 4th century and the oldest Western ones from the 6th, with fragments and citations {{going back to the}} 3rd. Western texts of Acts are 6.2–8.4% longer than Alexandrian texts, the additions tending to enhance the Jewish rejection of the Messiah {{and the role of the}} Holy Spirit, in ways that are stylistically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Acts. These conflicts suggest that Luke–Acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century. The majority of scholars prefer the Alexandrian (shorter) text-type over the Western as the more authentic, but this same argument would favour the Western over the Alexandrian for the gospel of Luke, as in that case the, Western version is the shorter. The debate therefore continues.|$|E
25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E

50|$|Whitehead was {{an obsessive}} reviser, who {{would give a}} day’s {{worrying}} to a single word or rhythm. Such care served him well when writing poetry, given the genre’s linguistic concentration; when he wrote fiction, however, this same process led to near-paralysis—to hundreds (literally) of drafts, most starting from scratch, each subtly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> all drawing on the man’s considerable poetic powers.|$|R

500|$|Critically, [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] {{garnered}} {{a negative}} review from Peter Robinson of NME in 2001. In {{his review of}} Gold: Greatest Hits, he wrote [...] "Steps were only signed for one single – with good reason, for '5,6,7,8' was shit of the very highest order." [...] Similarly, Digital Spy writer Robert Copsey wrote that retrospectively, [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] was a [...] "bizarre" [...] choice of lead single in his review of The Ultimate Collection in 2011. In a review of Steps best-selling songs for the Official Charts Company in March 2017, Copsey noted how [...] "5,6,7,8" [...] is distinctly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> their discography {{in terms of its}} techno-pop genre, line dancing lyrics and lack of lead vocals solely from Claire Richards.|$|E
500|$|The castle was {{inherited}} by William d'Albini III, {{and in turn}} by his son, William IV, and grandson, William V. William V died in 1224, {{leaving it}} to his brother Hugh. Probably {{by this time the}} chapel inside the castle walls had fallen out of use as a religious building, and was instead employed for secular purposes. The top [...] of the keep's walls are distinctively <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the building, and one theory to explain this is that the castle keep was not in fact completed during William II's lifetime, and that the final work on walls was carried out between 1200 and 1230 by his descendants. Hugh died childless in 1243, and the castle then passed to Roger de Montalt.|$|E
500|$|Composer Kenji Kawai {{scored the}} film. For the main theme, Kawai {{tried to imagine}} the setting and convey the essence of that world in the music. He used Classical Japanese in the opening theme [...] "Making of a Cyborg". The {{composition}} {{is a mixture of}} Bulgarian harmony and traditional Japanese notes; the haunting chorals are a wedding song sung to dispel all evil influences. Symphony conductor Sarah Penicka-Smith notes that the song's lyrics are fitting for the union between Kusanagi and Project 2501 at the climax of the movie. Kawai originally wanted to use Bulgarian folk music singers, but used Japanese folk singers instead. [...] "See You Everyday" [...] is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the soundtrack, being a pop song sung in Cantonese by Fang Ka Wing.|$|E

50|$|After {{world war}} two concluded, it is {{possible}} that in 1947 the Hospital Train may have returned to passenger service for a few years.

Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he would like you {{to go to bed with}} him".

The Bajoran make-up was created on her, with Michael Westmore seeking to make her look <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the crew but {{in a way that would}} not detract from her appearance. Westmore created an appliance over Forbes' nose, before adding a row of ridges on her face. It was designed to be light and flexible, as he wanted the piece to move with Forbes' facial expressions. Her version of the make-up had seven ridges, while other actors in [...] "Ensign Ro" [...] had different numbers, between five and nine, with the male actors wearing larger pieces.|$|E
500|$|Front Mission Alternative was {{the second}} {{spin-off}} game in the series, and the fourth game released overall. Its soundtrack was composed by Riow Arai. Arai was a [...] "mainstream dance musician", who had previously composed the soundtrack for Sega Touring Car Championship. For the game, which unlike previous ones in the series was a real-time strategy game, Arai composed a techno soundtrack. The music {{has been described as}} [...] "drastically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the series". The soundtrack was released on the Front Mission Alternative album by DigiCube on November 21, 1997, and was reprinted by Square Enix on November 22, 2006.
