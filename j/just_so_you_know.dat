25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

[...] In an interview with MTV, Gaskarth said that the title was inspired [...] "by the subject matter on the record, where it's this toss-up of being wrapped up in what we do, and having the fun and the good times, and kind of pulling that blindfold down in order to ignore the fact that other problems are crumbling around you". Gaskarth also said [...] "one of the big things that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go". Gaskarth said the band purposely sought to [...] "step outside of the box and do some things that were a bit scary."

5000|$|The program became {{noted for}} the monologues {{delivered}} by Julia in indignation to other characters, a character trait {{that began in}} the second episode, when Julia verbally castigated a beauty queen who had made fun of Suzanne.

5000|$|The {{technique}} of embodied imagination takes dreaming as the paradigm for all work with images. While dreaming, everyone experiences dreams as embodied events {{in time and}} space; that is, the dreamer is convinced {{that he or she}} is experiencing a real event in a real environment. Bosnak describes how a dream [...] "instantaneously presents a total world, <b>so</b> real that <b>you</b> are convinced you are awake. <b>You</b> don't <b>just</b> think <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it in the same way <b>you</b> now <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are awake reading this book." [...] So from the perspective of dreaming, the image is a place. [...] Based on this notion, the dreamer can re-enter the landscape of the dream and flash back into its images to more fully and deeply explore and experience them. The dreamer explores the images of the dream while in a hypnagogic state, a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. While in this state, the dreamer is asked a series of questions that help him or her to re-experience the dream by describing details of its landscape and image.|$|R

Meanwhile, the tour began. The Chicks first performed a quick mini-leg of two concerts in London as part of their promotional activities for the June 12 international release of Taking the Long Way. Indeed, their first concert performance in almost two years (since October 2004's Vote for Change shows) was on June 15 at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, the so-called [...] "scene of the crime" [...] of Maines' remark regarding President Bush.
