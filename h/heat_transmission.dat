25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced <b>heat</b> <b>transmission,</b> moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractInternal wall {{insulation}} as a retrofit measure could help to reduce energy use and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} {{in many of the}} 6 million solid wall buildings in the UK. However during retrofit, junctions that are hard to deal with are often left uninsulated, increasing heat loss and surface mould growth risk at thermal bridges. Furthermore the effect of junctions, insulated or uninsulated is not properly taken into account in commonly used assessments of heat loss. This paper presents a study on the impact of the junctions around openings, also called reveals, on the <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient of internally insulated dwellings and a discussion on potential areas of improvement of common assessment tools for retrofit. Findings showed that reveals account {{for the majority of the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient at junctions, that thicker {{wall insulation}} is not necessarily advantageous from a heat loss perspective, and that the <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient at junctions per unit area of exposed elements was often higher than the reference value used in the UK...|$|R

Therefore, calculations of these must be carried out in a correct way to ensure a properly sized heating system and a good indoor climate. There is today a risk of misunderstanding and inconsistent use of methodology when <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer is calculated. To investigate the state of knowledge among Swedish consultants a survey was conducted regarding thermal bridges and calculations of <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. Furthermore, the impact of thermal bridges was studied by comparative calculations for a case study building with different building systems and different amounts of insulation. The study shows that the relevant standards and the building code in Sweden are interpreted in many different ways regarding calculation of <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and energy performance. There is a lack of understanding regarding the impact of different measuring methods on thermal bridges. When more insulation is used the relative impact of thermal bridges increases. It is therefore not suitable to use a single predefined percentage factor, increasing the <b>transmission</b> <b>heat</b> transfer through building elements, to account for the effect of thermal bridges. If values for normalized thermal bridges are to be used, they need to be differentiated by building system and different amounts of insulation (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
