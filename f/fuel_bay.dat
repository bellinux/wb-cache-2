40|$|Abstract: The ground {{impact of}} a {{helicopter}} in emergency represents a threat for flight safety and, therefore, crashworthiness is the main concern {{in the design of}} a helicopter tank. Up to few years ago, research made to improve tank crashworthiness consisted mainly of experimental tests. These tests are both expensive and difficult to perform. Accordingly, numerical tools that support the development of safer structures are needed. Several efforts have been provided and, nowadays, explicit codes based on Finite Element (FE) Method are successfully used to analyse crash events. The use of these codes, once the FE model reliability is demonstrated by numerical-experimental correlation, allows reducing the number of tests to be performed to achieve the airworthiness certification. Specifically, design modification can be certified without repeating experimental tests. In this work, the impact with the ground of a filled tank of a medium weight helicopter has been numerically studied. In particular, the compliance to the Civil Requirements of a helicopter fuel system equipped with the auxiliary fuel tank kit was demonstrated by means of a non-linear explicit FE code. Initially, a numerical model has been developed and validated referring to the experimental data collected during the certification impact test of the main fuel tank, without auxiliary tanks, equivalent to the real helicopter <b>fuel</b> <b>bay.</b> Subsequently, the validated model has been used to predict the impact behaviour of the fuel tank structure when the helicopter was equipped with the auxiliary fuel tank kit. The simulation allowed achieving the certification of the helicopter fuel system. 1...|$|E

30|$|Among {{the most}} {{immediate}} threats to the WNRA’s relict forests {{appears to be a}} high susceptibility to stand-replacing wildland fire that the presence of the encroachment cohort has introduced in the form of ladder fuel continuity. Crown fires were historically rare in ponderosa pine dominated forests, primarily due to the scarcity of ladder fuels (Skinner and Chang 1996). As is common for ponderosa pine forests, the forests of the WNRA are believed to have evolved under a regime of frequent fire occurrence that kept those ladder <b>fuels</b> at <b>bay</b> (USDI 2003). The incidence of fires that would have kept those ladder <b>fuels</b> at <b>bay</b> diminished substantially around 1925 (Fry and Stephens 2006). The current arrangement of understory and mid-story strata has resulted in greater vertical connectivity of fuel complexes in WNRA relict forests; in many cases, there is no spatial segregation of surface and aerial fuel complexes. Given the park’s inherently high risk of fire occurrence (presence of a major highway through the park; close proximity to the city of Redding), this hazard presents an acute condition that chronically threatens the WRNA’s relict forests.|$|R

Coupons of four different alloys of stainless steel (SS 316) and aluminium alloys (Al 6063, Al 6061 and Al 1100) in form of discs were assembled on a rack forming galvanic couples and crevice sandwiches. The rack was immersed in the spent <b>fuel</b> storage <b>bay</b> for a period of one year exposure. The monthly inspection of specimens was conducted out based on visual observation and photography. The analyses of water were done on weekly basis. After exposure of one year the rack was withdrawn and disassembled in the laboratory. The surface of each individual coupon was observed visually and by means of optical microscope. Visual observation revealed relatively more deposits of scale on aluminium samples in the galvanic couples compared to stainless steel (SS) samples. In the crevice sandwiches (Al+Al) both upper and lower samples were found almost identical with respect to scale deposits. The microscopic observations showed no pitting on any sample except at selective areas only in contact with ceramic spacers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{safeguards}} inspection, various nondestructive test {{techniques are}} used. For a long time, nondestructive assay based on radiation measurement such as gamma and neutron measurement {{have been used}} for nuclear material verification. However, due to physical access and radiological environment restrictions in verifying nuclear material, other nondestructive testing techniques are used for safeguards inspection purposes. At Wolsong nuclear power plants, spent nuclear fuel bundles are stored at spent <b>fuel</b> storage <b>bay.</b> Typically, tens of thousands of spent nuclear fuel bundles are densely stored under water. For safeguards inspection, those bundles are item counted, identified by serial numbers, and verified by nondestructive assay. In doing these activities, underwater camera and gamma radiation detectors are being used. However, due to narrow space between bundles and high radiation area, some of bundles are inaccessible. Recently, to overcome those restriction, ultrasonic and microwave techniques are introduced. Although laboratory test was successful, field test at Wolsong nuclear power plants showed that further development is necessary...|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} safety and the {{efficient}} management of spent fuel storage, detecting failed fuel {{is one of the}} most important tasks in a CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor operation. It has been successfully demonstrated that in a CANDU reactor, on-power failed fuel detection and location systems, along with alarm area gamma monitors, can detect and locate defective and suspect fuel bundles before discharging them from the reactor to the spent <b>fuel</b> storage <b>bay.</b> In the reception bay, however, only visual inspection has been used to identify suspect bundles. Gaseous fission product and delayed neutron monitoring systems cannot precisely distinguish failed fuel elements from each fuel bundle. This study reports the use of a sipping system in a CANDU reactor for the integrity assessment of spent fuel bundles. The integrity assessment of spent fuel bundles using this sipping system has shown promise as a nondestructive test for detecting a defective fuel bundle in a CANDU reactor...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this design {{calculation}} is to perform a criticality evaluation of the Fuel Handling Facility (FHF) and the operations and processes performed therein. The current intent of the FHF is to receive transportation casks whose contents will be unloaded and transferred to waste packages (WP) or MGR Specific Casks (MSC) in the <b>fuel</b> transfer <b>bays.</b> Further, the WPs will also be prepared in the FHF for transfer to the sub-surface facility (for disposal). The MSCs will {{be transferred to the}} Aging Facility for storage. The criticality evaluation of the FHF features the following: (I) Consider the types of waste to be received in the FHF as specified below: (1) Uncanistered commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF); (2) Canistered CSNF (with the exception of horizontal dual-purpose canister (DPC) and/or multi-purpose canisters (MPCs)); (3) Navy canistered SNF (long and short); (4) Department of Energy (DOE) canistered high-level waste (HLW); and (5) DOE canistered SNF (with the exception of MCOs). (II) Evaluate the criticality analyses previously performed for the existing Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) -certified transportation casks (under 10 CFR 71) to be received in the FHF to ensure that these analyses address all FHF conditions including normal operations, and Category 1 and 2 event sequences. (III) Evaluate FHF criticality conditions resulting from various Category 1 and 2 event sequences. Note that there are currently no Category 1 and 2 event sequences identified for FHF. Consequently, potential hazards from a criticality point of view will be considered as identified in the ''Internal Hazards Analysis for License Application'' document (BSC 2004 c, Section 6. 6. 4). (IV) Assess effects of potential moderator intrusion into the <b>fuel</b> transfer <b>bay</b> for defense in depth. The SNF/HLW waste transfer activity (i. e., assembly and canister transfer) that is being carried out in the FHF has been classified as safety category in the ''Q-list'' (BSC 2003, p. A- 6). Therefore, this design calculation is subject to the requirements of the ''Quality Assurance Requirements and Description'' (DOE 2004), even though the FHF itself has not yet been classified in the Q-list.
