25|$|As {{electrons}} and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an exciton may {{either be in}} a singlet state or a triplet state {{depending on how the}} spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton. Decay from triplet states (phosphorescence) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron to be excited into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> from the singlet state to a triplet state {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.|$|E

40|$|The ultrafast {{dynamics}} of benzaldehyde upon 260., 271; 284, and 287 nm excitations {{have been studied}} by femtosecond pump-probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A bi-exponential decay component model was applied to fit the transient profiles of benzaldehyde ions and fragment ions. At the S- 2 origin, the first decay of the component was attributed to the internal conversion to the high vibrational levels of S- 1 state. Lifetimes of the first component decreased with increasing vibrational energy, due {{to the influence of}} high density of the vibrational levels. The second decay was assigned to the vibrational relaxation of the S- 1 whose lifetime was about 600 fs. Upon 287 ran excitation, the first decay became ultrashort (similar to 56 fs) which was taken for the <b>intersystem</b> <b>cross</b> from S- 1 to T- 2, while the second decay component was attributed to the vibrational relaxation. The pump-probe transient of fragment was also studied with the different probe intensity at 284 nm pump...|$|R
25|$|One {{insight into}} the {{reaction}} mechanism for this photoreaction is given by an isotope scrambling experiment. The 6 vinylic protons in barrelene 1 are more acidic than the two bridgehead protons and therefore they can be replaced by deuterium with N-deuteriocyclohexylamide. Photolysis of 2 results in the initial formation of an biradical intermediate with a cyclopropane ring formed. This product rearranges to a second intermediate with a more favorable allylic radical as two mesomers. <b>Intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> and radical recombination results in equal quantities of semibullvalenes 3 and 4. The new proton distribution with allylic, vinylic and cyclopropanyl protons determined with proton NMR confirms this model. As noted, the conversion of barrelene to semibullvalene is a di-pi-methane rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E

40|$|Most red/deep-red {{fluorescent}} organic {{light-emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) {{suffer from a}} low exciton utilization efficiency (eta(gamma)) and a drastic efficiency roll-off at high brightness. This work reports a new red fluorescent emitter with a D-pi-A-pi-D architecture, namely, 4, 9 -bis(4 -(9, 9 -dimethylacridin- 10 (9 H) -yl) phenyl) naphtho[2, 3 -c][1, 2, 5]thiadiazole (NZ 2 AC). The new emitter shows a hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state, which can utilize the triplet excitons by the reverse <b>intersystem</b> <b>cross</b> process via the high-lying triplet channel. A red OLED with an emission peak at 612 nm achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6. 2 % at a doping concentration of 8 wt% NZ 2 AC in a 4, 4 '-bis(9 -carbazolyl) - 2, 2 '-biphenyl host. Moreover, the new emitter reveals a typical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property, and consequently, the nondoped OLEDs exhibit a deep-red emission at 663 nm with a maximum EQE of 2. 8 %, corresponding to a maximum exciton utilization ratio of 93 %. Attributed to the simultaneous HLCT and AIE features, both the doped and nondoped devices exhibit low efficiency roll-off at high brightness, with their EQEs remaining at high values of 3. 0 % and 2. 3 % at the high luminance of 5000 cd m(- 2), respectively, which are among the highest efficiencies at such high luminance for red/deep-red OLEDs...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence-based {{detection}} of explosive analytes {{requires an understanding}} of the nature of the excited state responsible for the luminescence response of a sensing material. Many measurements are carried out to elucidate the fundamental photophysical properties of an emissive material in solution. However, simple transfer of the understanding gained from the solution measurements to the solid-state can lead to errors. This is in part due to the absence of inter-molecular interactions of the chromophores in solution, which are present in the solid-state. To understand the role of inter-molecular interactions on the {{detection of}} explosive analytes we have chosen dendrimers from two different families, D 1 and D 2, which allow facile control of the inter-molecular interactions through the choice of dendrons and emissive chromophores. Using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy we find that the solution photoinduced absorption (PA) for both materials can be explained in terms of the generation of singlet excitons, which decay to the ground state, or <b>intersystem</b> <b>cross</b> (ISC) to form a triplet exciton. In neat films however, we observe different photophysical behaviours; first, ISC to the triplet state does not occur, and second, depending on the chromophore, charge transfer and charge separated states are formed. Furthermore, we find that when either dendrimer is interfaced with analyte vapour, the singlet state is strongly quenched, generating a charge transfer state that undergoes geminate recombination...|$|R

2500|$|The optical {{excitations}} conserve {{the spin}} state, {{but there is}} a high probability of the states [...] decaying non-radiatively to the singlet state , a phenomenon called <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> (ISC). This happens at an appreciable rate because the energy curve in function of the position of the atoms for the [...] state intersects the curve for the [...] state. Therefore, for some instant during the vibrational relaxation that the ions undergo after the excitement, it is possible for the spin to flip with little or no energy required in the transition. It {{is important to note that}} this mechanism also leads to a transition from [...] to , but the rate of this ISC is much lower than the [...] states rate, therefore this transition is indicated with a thin line.

2500|$|A type of SCO is {{affected}} by Light Induced Excited Spin State Trapping (LIESST). In this approach HS and LS states can be triggered by irradiating the sample. At low temperatures {{it is possible to}} trap compounds in the HS state - a phenomenon known as the LIESST effect. The compound can be converted back to a LS state by irradiation with a photon of different energy. Irradiation of d-d transitions of the LS metal complex or MLCT absorption bands leads to population of HS states. A good example to illustrate the LIESST effect is the complex (BF4)2. The sample was irradiated with green light at temperatures below 50 K. By doing this, a spin allowed transition is promoted which is 1A1 → 1T1. [...] However, the 1T1 excited state has a very short lifetime, decreasing the probability for the excited state to relax via a double <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> to reach the 5T2 HS state [...] [...] Since the HS state is spin forbidden the lifetime for this state is long, therefore it can be trapped at low temperatures. [...] Figure 17 shows a simplified Jablonski diagram for these transitions. [...] To recover the LS state, irradiation with a lower energy light is done. This promotes a transition from the HS state [...] 5T2 → 5E which allows for relaxation back to the LS state.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the CO ligand dissociation of fac-[Re-I(bpy) (CO) (3) P(OMe) (3) ](+) has theoretically been investigated, as the dominant process of the photochemical ligand substitution (PLS) reactions of fac-[Re-I(bpy) (CO) (3) PR 3](+), by using the (TD-) DFT method. The PLS reactivity can {{be determined by the}} topology of the T- 1 potential energy surface because the photoexcited complex is able to decay into the T- 1 state by internal conversions (through conical intersections) and <b>intersystem</b> crossings (via <b>crossing</b> seams) with sufficiently low energy barriers. The T- 1 state has a character of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer ((MLCT) -M- 3) around the Franck-Condon region, and it changes to the metal-centered ((MC) -M- 3) state as the Re-CO bond is elongated and bent. The equatorial CO ligand has a much higher energy barrier to leave than that of the axial CO, so that the axial CO ligand selectively dissociates in the PLS reaction. The single-component artificial force induced reaction (SC-AFIR) search reveals the CO dissociation pathway in photostable fac-[ReI(bpy) (CO) (3) Cl]; however, the dissociation barrier on the T- 1 state is substantially higher than that in fac-[ReI(bpy) (CO) (3) PR 3](+) and the minimum-energy seams of crossings (MESXs) are located before and below the barrier.

5000|$|When a singlet state nonradiatively {{passes to}} a triplet state, or {{conversely}} a triplet transitions to a singlet, {{that process is}} known as <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing.</b> In essence, the spin of the excited electron is reversed. The probability of this process occurring is more favorable when the vibrational levels of the two excited states overlap, since little or no energy must be gained or lost in the transition. As the spin/orbital interactions in such molecules are substantial and a change in spin is thus more favourable, <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing</b> is most common in heavy-atom molecules (e.g. those containing iodine or bromine).

50|$|<b>Intersystem</b> <b>Crossing</b> (ISC) is a photophysical process {{involving}} an isoenergetic radiationless transition between two electronic states having different multiplicities. It {{often results in}} a vibrationally excited molecular entity in the lower electronic state, which then usually decays to its lowest molecular vibrational level. ISC is forbidden by rules of conservation of angular momentum. As a consequence, ISC generally occurs on very long time scales. However the El-Sayed’s rule states {{that the rate of}} <b>intersystem</b> <b>crossing,</b> e.g. from the lowest singlet state to the triplet manifold, is relatively large if the radiationless transition involves a change of molecular orbital type. For example, a (π,π*) singlet could transition to a (n,π*) triplet state, but not to a (π,π*) triplet state and vice versa. Formulated by Prof. Mostafa. A.
