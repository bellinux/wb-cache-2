The region averages fewer than 150frost-free days per year, and the local climate swings wildly <b>from</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon's fickle climate.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, {{the sale}} of bird seed in the square was stopped and other {{measures}} were introduced to discourage the pigeons {{including the use of}} birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area.

5|$|On 30 September 1987, the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles {{performed}} The Rite {{based on}} a reconstruction of Nijinsky's 1913 choreography, until then thought lost beyond recall. The performance resulted <b>from</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> research, primarily by Millicent Hodson, who pieced the choreography together from the original prompt books, contemporary sketches and photographs, and the recollections of Marie Rambert and other survivors. Hodson's version has since been performed by the Kirov Ballet, at the Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and later that year at Covent Garden. In its 2012–13 season the Joffrey Ballet gave centennial performances at numerous venues, including the University of Texas on 5–6 March 2013, the University of Massachusetts on 14 March 2013, and with The Cleveland Orchestra on 17–18 August 2013.|$|E

5|$|Queen's was {{a result}} of an {{outgrowth}} of educational initiatives planned by Presbyterians in the 1830s. A draft plan for the university was presented at a synod meeting in Kingston in 1839, with a modified bill introduced through the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada during a session in 1840. On 16 October 1841, a royal charter was issued through Queen Victoria establishing Queen's College at Kingston. Queen's resulted <b>from</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> effort by Presbyterians of Upper Canada to found a college for the education of ministers in the growing colony and to instruct the youth in various branches of science and literature. They modelled the university after the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow.

5|$|The planet Krypton, {{unstable}} <b>from</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> industrial mining, faces impending destruction. Jor-El, chief {{advisor to}} Krypton's supreme council, recommends the council give him {{control of the}} genetics codex. Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by General Zod, {{an old friend of}} Jor-El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realizing that Krypton is doomed, Jor-El steals genetic codes sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, Jor-El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. Zod orders the rocket's destruction, only to learn that forces loyal to the council have suppressed the rebellion. In a brief trial, Zod and several of the surviving rebels are convicted of treason and sentenced to the Phantom Zone moments before Krypton explodes.|$|E

5|$|Fearing for Shae's safety, Tyrion {{breaks up}} with her and orders her to leave for Pentos. She refuses until he calls her a whore, and {{declares}} that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey. Outraged at her betrayal and finally snapping <b>from</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> mockery for his dwarfism, Tyrion demands a trial by combat. Cersei names the virtually undefeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before his execution, Tyrion is released by Jaime to be smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Tyrion decides to confront Tywin before his flight, and finds Shae in his father's bed. Tyrion strangles her to death, and then confronts Tywin on the privy. Tyrion kills his father with a crossbow bolt, and then leaves for Pentos with Varys.|$|E
