60|$|Of such, observe. Not of {{children}} themselves, but of such as children. I believe most mothers who read that text {{think that all}} heaven is {{to be full of}} babies. But that's not so. There will be children there, but the hoary head is the crown. 'Length of days, and long life and peace,' that is the blessing, not to die in babyhood. Children die but for their parents sins; God means them to live, but He can't let them always; then they have their earlier place in heaven: and the little child of David, vainly prayed for;--the little child of Jeroboam, killed by its mother's step on its own threshold,--they will be there. But weary old David, and weary old Barzillai, having learned children's lessons at last, will be there too: and the one question for us all, young or old, is, <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> our child's lesson? it is the character {{of children}} we want, and must gain at our peril; let us see, briefly, in what it consists.|$|E
6000|$|Then, after agriculture, {{the art of}} kings, {{take the}} next head of human arts--weaving; the art of queens, honoured of all noble Heathen women, {{in the person of}} their virgin goddess[242]--honoured of all Hebrew women, by the word of their wisest king--"She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff; she stretcheth out her hand to the poor. She is not afraid of the snow for her {{household}}, for all her household are clothed with scarlet. She maketh herself covering of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it, and delivereth girdles unto the merchant."[243] What have we done in all these thousands of years with this bright art of Greek maid and Christian matron? Six thousand years of weaving, and <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> to weave? Might not every naked wall have been purple with tapestry, and every feeble breast fenced with sweet colours from the cold? What have we done? Our fingers are too few, it seems, to twist together some poor covering for our bodies. We set our streams to work for us, and choke the air with fire, to turn our pinning-wheels--and,--are we yet clothed? Are not the streets of the capitals of Europe foul with the sale of cast clouts and rotten rags?[244] Is not the beauty of your sweet children left in wretchedness of disgrace, while, with better honour, nature clothes the brood of the bird in its nest, and the suckling of the wolf in her den? And does not every winter's snow robe what you have not robed, and shroud what you have not shrouded; and every winter's wind bear up to heaven its wasted souls, to witness against you hereafter, by the voice of their Christ,--"I was naked, and ye clothed me not"?[245] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a well-worn truism," [...] said the Times, [...] "that our human race are a feeble folk before the {{infinite}} latent forces which surround us. From the prophets of old and from the philosophers of our own time the same message and warning have reached us. But, like all oft-repeated truths, it has in time lost something of its actuality and cogency. A lesson, an actual experience, was needed to bring it home. It is from that salutory but terrible ordeal that we have just emerged, with minds which are still stunned by the suddenness of the blow and with spirits which are chastened by the realization of our own limitations and impotence. The world has paid a fearful price for its schooling. Hardly yet <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> the full tale of disaster, but the destruction by fire of New York, of Orleans, and of Brighton constitutes in itself {{one of the greatest}} tragedies {{in the history of our}} race. When the account of the railway and shipping accidents has been completed, it will furnish grim reading, although there is evidence to show that in the vast majority of cases the drivers of trains and engineers of steamers succeeded in shutting off their motive power before succumbing to the poison. But the material damage, enormous as it is both in life and in property, is not the consideration which will be uppermost in our minds to-day. All this may in time be forgotten. But what will not be forgotten, and what will and should continue to obsess our imaginations, is this revelation of the possibilities of the universe, this destruction of our ignorant self-complacency, and this demonstration of how narrow is the path of our material existence and what abysses may lie upon either side of it. Solemnity and humility are at the base of all our emotions to-day. May they be the foundations upon which a more earnest and reverent race may build a more worthy temple." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{assignment}} {{revolves around}} branding. We seek to investigate how different understandings of individuals {{affect the way}} branding is developed and conducted. To do this {{it has been a}} necessity for us to have knowledge about the topic. Although there are several ways of understanding the concept of branding <b>we</b> <b>have</b> chosen to rely on the way Claus Buhl perceives it. Buhl’s understanding contains two different branding approaches; branding 1. 0 and branding 2. 0. These approaches are based on two different ways of addressing the individual and this leads to our wonderment regarding how these different ways of understanding the individual will influencejhui branding approaches. Through the analysis <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> that this depends on the general focus points within the specific way of understanding the individual which lies in the particular branding approach. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> furthermore <b>learned</b> how branding can be considered through different psychological perspectives. Through our discussion <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> how branding through a social constructionist perspective can contribute to forming new perceptions of reality. Finally <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> how branding potentially is capable of influencing individuals negatively...|$|R
