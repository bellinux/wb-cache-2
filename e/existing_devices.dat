5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} <b>existing</b> <b>devices,</b> such as escapement (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E

New operating systems should benefit from the <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> driver code base without demanding legacy support from the kernel. Instead of trying to directly integrate <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> drivers we propose a more radical approach. We run the unmodified device driver, with its complete original OS, isolated in a virtual machine.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} on the detection of the invisible veins between our modified prototype <b>device</b> and an <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> in elderly hospitalized patients. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study was performed in the invisible veins in elderly patients. The major variables, skin color near the invisible veins, and diameter and depth of the invisible veins were measured. The vein visualization rate was calculated as {{the ratio of the}} visualized veins to the invisible veins by the visualization device. Results: We analyzed 53 invisible veins in the cubital fossa and 56 invisible veins in the forearm in a total of 72 patients (median age, 73 [*]years). The visualization rate for our prototype device was higher than that for an <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> in the cubital fossa and the forearm sites. The visualized veins of the prototype device had a higher intensity ratio than that of an <b>existing</b> <b>device.</b> No significant differences were observed in the body mass index, vein depth, and vein diameter of the visualized veins at the cubital fossa and forearm sites. Conclusion: The prototype surpassed the <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> in visualizing the invisible veins. However, the prototype was unable to visualize all the invisible veins. We need {{to look for ways to}} reduce noise and to visualize the invisible veins, and the visualization rate of devices needs to be investigated in further association with the percentage of success with actual intravenous access and locating time to vein...|$|R

The tokamak essentially combined a low-power pinch device with a low-power simple stellarator.

The Guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the design and}} implementation of a single channel, dual polarization pulsar timing instrument for the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO). The new timer {{is designed to be}} an improved, temporary replacement for the <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> which has been in operation for over 20 years. The <b>existing</b> <b>device</b> is no longer reliable and is di±cult to maintain. The new pulsar timer is designed to provide improved functional- ity, higher sampling speed, greater pulse resolution, more °exibility and easier maintenance over the <b>existing</b> <b>device.</b> The new device is also designed to keeping changes to the observation system to a minimum until a full de-dispersion timer can be implemented at theobservatory. The design makes use of an 8 -bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) micro-processor with external Random Access Memory (RAM). The instrument includes an IEEE- 488 subsystem for interfacing the pulsar timer to the observation computer system. The microcontroller software is written in assembler code to ensure optimal loop execution speed and deterministic code execution for the system. The design path is discussed and problems encountered during the design process are highlighted. Final testing of the new instrument indicates an improvement in the sam- pling rate of 13. 6 times and a significant reduction in 60 Hz interference over the existing instrument. ...|$|R
