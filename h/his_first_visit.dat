5|$|A {{change in}} the {{location}} of his job meant that Headley moved to the Lucas Cricket Club in 1929. He visited America and played some exhibition matches for the Jamaican Athletic Club in New York, scoring a century against a touring team from Bermuda; his parents had moved to America by then, which enabled Headley to combine the cricket with <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to his parents in ten years.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years Mendelssohn {{travelled}} widely, including making <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to England in 1829, and also visiting amongst other places Vienna, Florence, Milan, Rome and Naples, in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists. These years proved the germination for some of his most famous works, including the Hebrides Overture and the Scottish and Italian symphonies.|$|E

5|$|The Symphony No. 1 in C minor for {{full-scale}} orchestra {{was written}} in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15. This work is experimental, showing the influences of Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber. Mendelssohn conducted this symphony on <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to London in 1829, with the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. For the third movement he substituted an orchestration of the Scherzo from his Octet. In this form the piece was a success, and laid the foundations of his British reputation.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to the West he {{travelled}} to the UK twice, in 1895 and 1896, lecturing successfully there. In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish {{woman who}} would become Sister Nivedita. During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1820s, Talma was {{established}} as [...] "the dominant personality at the Comédie-Française, where he alone could still successfully impose classical tragedy upon the public".

It was reported that during his time in South Africa, he was personally recommended on the field for a commission by General Lord Methuen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the 2006–07 season, the Harris Theater hosted the New York City Ballet for five days of {{performances}} that marked the company's first visit to Chicago in over 25years. This presentation grossed $2.3million and enticed 600 new donors to support the theater, which netted $800,000 for operations and rental subsidies for its resident troupes. This contributed to the theater's first year of profitability in fiscal year 2007; it had net income of $1.3million on revenues of $8.2million. In , Mikhail Baryshnikov made <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to Chicago as a performer in seven years, with two shows at the theater.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's {{success in}} the United States came a little later, when Michigan State University Press started {{publishing}} his books. <b>His</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to the country was on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and he lectured at various universities including Michigan State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Around this time, John Updike noticed his work and compared Narayan to Charles Dickens. In a review of Narayan's works published in The New Yorker, Updike called him a writer of a vanishing breed—the writer as a citizen; one who identifies completely with his subjects and with {{a belief in the}} significance of humanity.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar {{was noted}} for his {{diplomatic}} skills, {{and both the}} British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, {{and became the first}} Malay ruler to travel to Europe during <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria {{played an important role in}} shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes.|$|E
5|$|In 1185 John made <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to Ireland, {{accompanied}} by 300 knights {{and a team}} of administrators. Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III would not agree. John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.|$|E

5|$|In 1625, James VI {{died and}} was succeeded {{by his son}} Charles I. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his {{northern}} kingdom, with <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> being for his Scottish coronation in 1633, when he was crowned in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh with full Anglican rites. Charles had relatively few important Scots in his circle and relied heavily in Scottish matters on the generally mistrusted and often indecisive James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and the bishops, particularly John Spottiswood, Archbishop of St. Andrews, eventually making him chancellor. At {{the beginning of his}} reign, Charles' revocation of alienated lands since 1542 helped secure the finances of the kirk, but it threatened the holdings of the nobility who had gained from the Reformation settlement. His pushing through of legislation and refusal to hear (or legal pursuit of) those raising objections, created further resentment among the nobility. In England his religious policies caused similar resentment and he ruled without calling a parliament from 1629.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the compliment by registering in France as {{a citizen of the}} Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with the official Soviet concept of art.|$|E
5|$|The Western Front at {{this time}} {{generally}} followed the River Rhine with two important exceptions: the American bridgehead over the Rhine at Remagen, and a large German salient west of the Rhine, the Saar–Palatinate triangle. Consideration was given to evacuating the triangle, but OKW ordered it held. When Kesselring paid <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> to the German First and Seventh Army headquarters there on 13 March 1945, the army group commander, Oberst-gruppenführer Paul Hausser, and the two army commanders all affirmed the defence of the triangle could only result in heavy losses or complete annihilation of their commands. General der Infanterie Hans Felber of the Seventh Army considered the latter the most likely outcome. Nonetheless, Kesselring insisted that the positions had to be held.|$|E
