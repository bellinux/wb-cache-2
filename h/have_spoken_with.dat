500|$|The 2006–07 season saw Brown {{emerge as}} one of the better players in the Scottish game. Brown helped Hibs win their first trophy in 16 years as they {{defeated}} Kilmarnock 5–1 in the League Cup Final. Brown handed in a transfer request to the Hibernian assistant manager, Tommy Craig, after their home game against Dundee United on 2 December 2006. The action was thought to be taken on the advice of agent Willie McKay, who Brown had recently appointed. Scotland manager Walter Smith criticised Brown and teammate Kevin Thomson for not showing enough responsibility in their dealings with Hibs, given that they had both recently agreed contracts with the club. On 31 January 2007, Brown announced that he was retracting his transfer request and was now happy to remain with Hibernian for the duration of his contract, which was due to end in mid-2009. Despite this, media rumours continued to suggest that he would move. Kevin Thomson, who had signed for Rangers in January 2007, claimed to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> Brown about joining him at Rangers. Premier League club Reading confirmed that they reached agreement with Hibernian to sign Brown, but the player refused the move, saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|Crainic, {{a trained}} theologian and expert on Romanian Orthodoxy, {{inspired}} the religious agenda of his various newspapers. In 1937, Sfarmă-Piatră was seeking a rapprochement between the Orthodox believers and adherents to a rival national church, the Romanian Greek Catholics. It saluted the Greek Catholic magazine Vestitorul for promoting a [...] "national fusion" [...] {{between the two}} congregations, to which Vestitorul replied that the only conceivable merger was for the Orthodox side to accept communion with Rome. Vestitorul did however offer praise to Gregorian's column on [...] "the threat of Pan-Slavism", which the Greek Catholics identified with pan-Orthodoxism. Around that date, Sfarmă-Piatră was also involved in promoting the sayings of Petrache Lupu, an illiterate peasant who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> God. While mainstream media suggested that Lupu was a mere lunatic, Crainic proclaimed him a saint of the Orthodox Church and a symbol of Romanian values. Also in Sfarmă-Piatră, the younger Dan Botta depicted the peasant-prophet {{as the embodiment of}} [...] "abnegation", [...] "belief in the worth of the human soul", and resistance to change.|$|E
2500|$|Yet a few {{students}} must <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> a reporter. On June 19, the Boston American ran a news story that connected the few public facts: two Harvard students, friends, both from Fall River, Massachusetts, had died within a month of one another: Cyril Wilcox [...] "accidentally killed by gas" [...] at home on May 13 and dentistry student Eugene Cummings a suicide in the infirmary on June 11. Cummings, the story went on, had told friends about [...] "an alleged inquisition, which he claimed {{was held in the}} college following Wilcox' death." [...] He had been taken to a room [...] "shrouded in gloom" [...] and [...] "questioned exhaustively." [...] College authorities denied his story and said it was the product of his [...] "disordered mind." [...] Finally, Court member Dr Roger I. Lee put an end to further inquiries. Cummings, he told the Boston American, [...] "had been acting in a queer manner," [...] using an adjective that indicated Cummings' underlying condition was not fit for public discussion. Contemporary press coverage ended with that one article.|$|E
2500|$|The role {{of ballots}} in NUM policy had been disputed {{over a number}} of years, and a series of legal {{disputes}} in 1977 left their status unclear. [...] In 1977, the implementation of an incentive scheme proved controversial, as different areas would receive different pay rates. [...] After the NUM's National Executive Conference rejected the scheme, NUM leader Joe Gormley arranged a national ballot. [...] The Kent area who opposed the scheme sought a court injunction to prevent it, but Lord Denning ruled that [...] "the conference might not <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> the true voice of all the members and in his view a ballot was a reasonable and democratic proposal". [...] The scheme was rejected by 110,634 votes to 87,901. [...] The Nottinghamshire, South Derbyshire and Leicestershire areas resolved to adopt the incentive scheme as their members would benefit from increased pay. [...] The Yorkshire, Kent and South Wales areas sought an injunction to prevent these actions {{on the grounds of the}} ballot result. [...] Mr. Justice Watkins ruled that, [...] "The result of a ballot, nationally conducted, is not binding upon the National Executive Committee in using its powers in between conferences. [...] It may serve to persuade the committee to take one action or another, or to refrain from action, but it has no great force or significance." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2015, a {{customer}} named Ricardo Brown received a bill from Comcast {{with his name}} changed to [...] "Asshole Brown". Brown's wife, Lisa, believed a Comcast employee changed the name {{in response to the}} Browns' request to cancel their cable service, an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist. Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer service outlets for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer, so the Browns turned to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott. Elliott posted the facts of the incident, along with a copy of the bill, on his blog. Shortly thereafter, Elliott contacted Comcast and Comcast offered the Browns an apology, a $60 refund, and a promise to track down and fire the responsible employee. The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family {{the last two years of}} service and provide the next two years of service at no charge. Comcast released a statement explaining: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change. We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again." ...|$|E

On 17 February 1540 Lady Rutland wrote more positively to Lady Lisle: [...] "My very good lady...And where ye be very desirous to have your daughter Mistress Basset {{to be one of the}} Queen's Grace's maids, and that ye would I should move her Grace in that behalf. These shall be to do your ladyship: to wit that I perceive right well the King's Highness' pleasure to be such that no more maids shall be taken in until such time as some of them that now be with the Queen's Grace be preferred. Albeit if ye will make some means unto Mother Lowe, who can do as much good in this matter as any one woman here, that she may make some means to get your said daughter with the Queen's said Grace; and in so doing I think ye shall obtain your purpose in every behalf and I for my part shall do the best I can to prefer her here for I would be right glad thereof both for the great honesty that is in her".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y. Bekavac also stated in a press release on the college website that Scripps will also no longer submit the Reputational Survey to U.S. News as [...] "for years we have known of flaws in the methodology; many of us <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> editors at U.S. News {{in an attempt to}} improve its approach [...] but nothing can really improve a system that seeks to reduce 3,300 educational programs in American higher education to one set of numbers, and then rank them. College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
