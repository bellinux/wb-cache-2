5000|$|Polycythemia (or polycythaemia, see {{spelling}} differences) vera (PV) (PCV) (also {{known as}} <b>erythremia,</b> primary polycythemia, Vaquez disease, Osler-Vaquez disease and polycythemia rubra vera) [...] is an uncommon neoplasm (cancer) {{in which the}} bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It may also result in the overproduction of white blood cells and platelets.|$|E
5000|$|Primary polycythemias are due {{to factors}} {{intrinsic}} to red cell precursors. Polycythemia vera (PCV), polycythemia rubra vera (PRV), or <b>erythremia,</b> occurs when excess red blood cells are produced {{as a result of}} an abnormality of the bone marrow. [...] Often, excess white blood cells and platelets are also produced. Polycythemia vera is classified as a myeloproliferative disease. Symptoms include headaches and vertigo, and signs on physical examination include an abnormally enlarged spleen and/or liver. In some cases, affected individuals may have associated conditions including high blood pressure or formation of blood clots. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment. A hallmark of polycythemia is an elevated hematocrit, with Hct > 55% seen in 83% of cases. A somatic (non-hereditary) mutation (V617F) in the JAK2 gene is found in 95% of cases, though also present in other myeloproliferative disorders.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRed {{blood cell}} samples from several {{patients}} with <b>erythremia</b> {{have been studied}} by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Quadrupole splitting and isomer shift for oxyhemoglobin from erythremic red blood cells and those of oxyhemoglobin from normal ones differ slightly, while these hyperfine parameters for deoxyhemoglobins are the same. An additional component in Mössbauer spectra of red blood cell samples was observed in some cases of <b>erythremia.</b> It is proposed that this component is related to ferritin-like iron and its content ranged from 13 - 15 % to 5 - 7 %.

40|$|Spinal transection {{of one of}} a parabiotic pair of rats is {{immediately}} followed by a state indistinguishable in visual and hematologic characteristics from spontaneous "parabiosis intoxication. " The transected rat develops <b>erythremia,</b> hyperhemoglobinemia, and an increased hematocrit count; whereas the twin concurrently shows anemia characterized by a decrease in hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, and hematocrit reading, and often also lipemia. These findings are ascribed to whole blood transfusion of one rat by the other followed by adjustments compensatory to the resulting distortion in the respective blood volumes. It is suggested that parabiosis intoxication is a manifestation of this same process and is not due, as has been contended, to an immune response...|$|E
40|$|Hemoglobin (Hb) {{variants}} {{were found}} in Japanese {{for the first time}} in 1959, ten years after the discovery of sickle cell Hb (Hb S) in USA. Hb Ms as a couse of herediatary nigremia marked the first stage of hemoglobinopahthy research in Japan, and a variety of unstable hemoglobins causing hemolytic disease the second stage. Although the prevalence of vaints of Hb A (α or β) among Japanese was estimated to be only 1 : thousands, they ware rich in varietry. Virtually all types of abnormal Hbs were found among Japanese: hereditary nigremia, unstable Hb hemolytic disease, hyperunatable Hb disease mimicking a relatively severe form of thalassemia sydrom sydrome, hereditary <b>erythremia</b> due to high oxygen affinity Hbs, and so on. Most Hb variants ware clinically silent, but some of them showed unique properties of intrest. Thalassemia (thal) traits ware more frequent than the structural variants of Hb A (1 : 1000 for β-thal, more for α-thal). Like Hb variants, mutations leading to β-thal ware rich in variety, but several of them comprized over half of all cases. Two most prevalent β-thal mutations, a base substitution producing terminator at codon 90 (with β 0 -thal expression 9 and that at - 31 within the ATA box (β+ -thal),seemed unique to Japanese...|$|E
40|$|During {{a survey}} for hemoglobinopathies in over 9000 {{residents}} of Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, a fast moving hemoglobin was identified in eight members of three generations in a Japanese family. The abnormal hemoglobin, named Hb Hiroshima, constitutes about 50 % {{of the total}} hemoglobin in hemolysates from the carriers who have a mild <b>erythremia</b> but are otherwise apparently clinically unaffected. All preparations of Hb Hiroshima have increased affinity for oxygen, by either tonometric or oxygen electrode determinations. At pH 7. 0, the oxygen pressure, P 50 required to half saturate an unfractionated hemolysate from a carrier was one-half that of Hb A, and the P 50 of a purified sample containing no Hb A was one-fourth that of Hb A. The pH dependence of the oxygen equilibrium (Bohr effect) is below normal, {{as shown by the}} absolute value of the Bohr effect factor which is about half that of Hb A, in the pH range between 7. 0 and 7. 4. The Hill constant, n, for Hb Hiroshima between pH 7. 0 and 7. 4 is 2 - 2. 4, compared to 2. 8 - 3 for Hb A under the same conditions, indicating reduction of, but not complete abolition of heme-heme interaction. Urea dissociation and canine hybridization tests located the biochemical lesion in the beta chain. Fingerprints (Ingram), carboxypeptidase digestion, and amino acid analysis demonstrated that the substitution was at residue 143 in the beta chain, where histidine was replaced by aspartic acid...|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{individuals}} with thalassemia (thal) are mostly heterozygous and asymptomatic except for microcytosis. The frequency of β-thal in Japan {{is one in}} 700 - 1000, and that of α-thal appears to be one-fifth of β-thal. Mutations for β-thal is heterogenous, with 8 types of mutation comprising almost 80 % of all Japanese β-thalassemiacs. About 40 % of the mutations {{seem to have been}} contacted from abroad. Twenty homozygotes from more than 280 thalassemiacs have been found. Eighteen homozygotes have A-G mutation at the second base of TATA box (- 31 A-G) bringing about relatively mild phenotype (β^+). The - 31 A-G mutation is most frequent of all Japanese β-thal's. Six rare mutations, despite being heterozygote, showed hemolytic anemia which is also called, ”dominant-type thalassemia”, and some of them demonstrated Heinz bodies in the red blood cells. The microcytosis which is characteristic of all thal, is well compensated for by an increased number of red blood cells. However, dominant-type and homozygotes for β-thal have not been compensated, resulting in anemia. The initiation codon mutations, in particular, have revealed remarkable <b>erythremia.</b> More than half of the α^ 0 -thal found in the Japanese have been of the Southeast Asian type ( [...] SEA), followed by the Filipino type ( [...] FIL). The precise breakpoints for nearly 40 % of the α^ 0 -thal mutations remain undetermined. However, rough estimation has suggested heterogenous deletions. The α^+ thal chromosomes which are the base for emerging HbH disease, have been found in 0. 25 - 1. 55 % of general population...|$|E
