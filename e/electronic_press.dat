500|$|In 2002 Ahrue Luster {{left the}} band and was {{temporarily}} replaced by Phil Demmel, who played in thrash band Vio-lence alongside Flynn. Demmel played some festival shows with Machine Head (including a headlining slot at the With Full Force festival in Germany). Then with Phil {{not being able to}} commit to the band, he and Machine Head parted ways. The remainder of the band starting writing songs for the next album (eventually Through the Ashes...), and hoping to get signed to a record label. They recorded a short demo, including a radio-style song called [...] "Pins and Needles", and an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Press</b> Kit for the companies, also hoping they can get signed on the strength of their previous efforts. Nearly every record label in the music industry rejected the four track demo.|$|E
500|$|In February 2001, {{during his}} {{extensive}} promotion for the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass, Harrison named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] among his three favourite tracks on the album. The <b>electronic</b> <b>press</b> kit accompanying the release included {{a scene where}} Harrison plays back the song at his Friar Park studio and isolates {{certain parts of the}} recording in turn, such as the backing vocals and slide guitars. In the CD booklet, Harrison's liner notes conclude with a thank-you to [...] "the amazing Mr. Phil Spector" [...] and the acknowledgement: [...] "He helped me so much to get this record made. In his company I came to realise the true value of the Hare Krishna Mantra." [...] The Pope-related lyrics in [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] were again omitted from the booklet; they similarly do not appear on the lyric sheet supplied with the 2014 Apple Years reissue.|$|E
500|$|On March 18, 2014, ABC aired {{a one-hour}} {{television}} special titled Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe, which documented {{the history of}} Marvel Studios {{and the development of}} the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and included exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from all of the films, One-Shots and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and sneak peeks of , Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, unaired episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Ant-Man. Brian Lowry of Variety felt the special, [...] "contains a pretty interesting business and creative story. While it might all make sense in hindsight, there was appreciable audacity in Marvel's plan to release five loosely connected movies from the same hero-filled world, beginning with the cinematically unproven Iron Man and culminating with superhero team The Avengers. As such, this fast-moving hour qualifies as more than just a cut-and-paste job from <b>electronic</b> <b>press</b> kits, although there's an element of that, certainly." [...] The special was released on September 9, 2014 on the home media for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 1.|$|E

500|$|To {{mark the}} 30th {{anniversary of the}} album's release, Harrison {{supervised}} a remastered edition of All Things Must Pass, which was issued in January 2001, {{less than a year}} before his death from cancer at the age of 58. The reissue appeared on Gnome Records, a label specifically set up by him for the project. Harrison oversaw revisions to Wilkes and Feinstein's album artwork, which included a colorised [...] "George & the Gnomes" [...] front cover and, on the two CD sleeves and the album booklet, further examples of this cover image showing an imaginary, gradual encroachment of urbanisation on the Friar Park landscape. The latter series served to illustrate Harrison's dismay at [...] "the direction the world seemed headed {{at the start of the}} millennium", Gary Tillery observes, a direction that was [...] "so far afield from the Age of Aquarius that had been the dream of the sixties". Harrison launched a website dedicated to the reissue, which offered, in the description of Chuck Miller of Goldmine magazine, [...] "graphics and sounds and little Macromedia-created gnomes dancing and giggling and playing guitars in a Terry Gilliam-esque world". As a further example of his willingness to embrace modern media, Harrison prepared an <b>electronic</b> <b>press</b> kit, which he described as [...] "not exactly an EPK but it is a threat to world order as we know it".|$|E
500|$|Although it did {{not enter}} any charts, Thom Jurek from AllMusic praised Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, {{rewarding}} the box set with {{four out of five}} stars. Jurek said it had [...] "a whopping four CDs and one DVD." [...] Jurek noted that discs one and two [...] "feature tracks from Reign in Blood, and all the albums that proceed from it, and includes bonus cuts previously only released in Japan, and cuts from soundtracks." [...] He also said that the third disc [...] "is, appropriately, titled 'Shit You Never Heard' because that's what it is— sixteen tracks that have been unissued anywhere— from rehearsals, to in-concert recordings, demos, and one 'No Remorse,' a collaboration with Atari Teenage Riot, from the Spawn soundtrack," [...] and that the fourth disc are [...] "an <b>electronic</b> <b>press</b> kit video for Diabolus in Musica, and an appearance at the Kerrang magazine awards." [...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters favoured the album, lauding the packaging but stating that [...] "like any other CD box set that has come out in recent years, the band seems torn about whom to appeal to, longtime fans, or newcomers." [...] Begrand noted that the first disc [...] "is especially great, as it captures Slayer at the peak of their career, starting with the classic 1986 album Reign in Blood." [...] PR Newswire said it was [...] "a Slayer fan's ultimate experience," [...] and The Dallas Morning News called it [...] "a fat new audiovisual box set." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, {{the band}} {{released}} the cover album Thank You. Songs from Thank You included covers of Lou Reed's [...] "Perfect Day" [...] and Melle Mel's [...] "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" [...] (with backing vocals {{from the original}} artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on [...] "Watching the Detectives" [...] and [...] "Perfect Day" [...] (as well as a cover of [...] "Jeepster" [...] by T. Rex that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album's <b>electronic</b> <b>press</b> kit, Reed said he considered Duran Duran's version the best cover ever done {{of one of his}} songs, and they received praise from Robert Plant and Jimmy Page for their cover of Led Zeppelin's [...] "Thank You".|$|E

2500|$|Although James are an {{alternative}} rock and indie rock band, and Wah Wah is characterized as an experimental rock album, {{the album is}} sometimes seen as an electronic dance and ambient album. Joseph Gallivan of The Independent described it as [...] "mainly electronic, and features lead singer Tim Booth experimenting with freely associative lyrics in a falsetto voice." [...] Emma Forrest of the NME took the album {{to be more of}} a textural record, saying [...] "it's an ambient album, with something to hook onto - moving wallpaper in the nicest possible sense. It's one of the few genuinely engaging dance albums around." [...] Besides the NME, Amost Cool, Entertainment Weekly and Q also considered it an ambient album, but the latter also noted that [...] "like all such jams, [...] the band perm grooves, riffs, chants, licks and lyrical snatches in various stages of dress but still too naked to leave the house." [...] They also considered the album to contain Eno's industrial dance sound. The Sheffield <b>Electronic</b> <b>Press</b> characterized the album as featuring an [...] "experimental dance dynamic," [...] whilst another journalist of NME later said the album contained [...] "techno experiments". Tim Peacock of Record Collector considered the jams to be [...] "Can-style." ...|$|E
2500|$|On both 13 and 14 April 1998, Starr held {{interviews}} to help promote the album. On the latter day, {{a photograph of}} Starr was taken for the album booklet by Henry Diltz. Starr planned to film a music video for [...] "La De Da" [...] at Shea Stadium in New York, though when the scheduled day arrived, filming was disrupted due to rain. As a result, filming moved {{to the streets of}} New York City, where Starr was shot sitting on a bench with an umbrella. The video is intercut with Starr and his backing band performing the song, along with footage of McCartney singing the chorus from the previous September. The original plan was for Starr to conduct a crowd singing one verse from [...] "La De Da". On 14 May, in the US, Mercury sent out <b>Electronic</b> <b>press</b> kits (EPKs) for the album. On 18 May, Entertainment Tonight aired an interview with McCartney and Starr that was filmed during the sessions at McCartney's home studio.
