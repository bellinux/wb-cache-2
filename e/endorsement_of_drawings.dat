Specifically, global attributions were expected to predict decreased <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> actions to combat discrimination among low hardy women.

High and low hardy women were exposed to a laboratory situation of discrimination, and their attributions for, and responses to, discrimination were then assessed. Results showed the expected interaction, but in the opposite direction: among low hardy women, global attributions predicted stronger <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> action. Among high hardy women, specific attributions predicted stronger <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> action. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Major {{terrorist}} events, such as {{the recent}} attacks in Ankara, Sinai, and Paris, can have profound effects on a nation’s values, attitudes, and prejudices. Yet psychological evidence testing the impact of such events via data collected immediately before and after an attack is understandably rare. In the present research, we tested the independent and joint effects of threat (the July 7, 2005, London bombings) and political ideology on <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> moral foundations and prejudices among two nationally representative samples (combined N = 2, 031) about 6 weeks before and 1 month after the London bombings. After the bombings, there was greater <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the in-group foundation, lower <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the fairness-reciprocity foundation, and stronger prejudices toward Muslims and immigrants. The differences in both the <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the foundations and the prejudices were larger among people with a liberal orientation than among those with a conservative orientation. Furthermore, the changes in <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> moral foundations among liberals explained their increases in prejudice. The results highlight the value of psychological theory and research for understanding societal changes in attitudes and prejudices after major terrorist events...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} how {{individual differences in}} <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggressive behaviors and thoughts relate to individual levels of tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants and established prejudice correlates such as social dominance orientation (SDO) and ethnic out-groups ratings among adolescents. Participants (N = 141; Age M = 16. 08, 68 % girls) completed the Readiness for Interpersonal Aggression Inventory, the Tolerance and Prejudice Questionnaire, and measures of SDO and ethnic out-groups ratings. Results indicated that higher individual <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggression was related to higher prejudice and SDO and lower tolerance and ethnic out-groups ratings. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggression related to habitual and socially determined aggressive acts or stable needs to hurt others {{as a source of}} satisfaction were significantly correlated with prejudice. Conversely, the relationship between prejudice and <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> impulsive actions lacking of emotional control resulted was less marked. The results highlight how in the cognitive spectrum of prejudice, individual levels <b>of</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> aggression may play a significant triggering role during adolescence. These findings may have implications for future studies and interventions aimed at reducing prejudice already in young ages...|$|R
