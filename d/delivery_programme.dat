50|$|In {{an effort}} to further boost the KAF's capabilities, the Americans {{initiated}} three assistance programmes. The first one, Operation Rotorhead Express, started in June 1974 when a US Army team arrived at Pochentong to give a one-time repair to the KAF UH-1 helicopter fleet. This was followed in January 1975 by Operation Flycatcher (not {{to be confused with}} the earlier namesake US aircraft <b>delivery</b> <b>programme),</b> a similar US Air Force effort directed at the KAF's T-28D fighter-bombers carried out by a USAF team also at Pochentong. That same month, a USAF Mobile Training Team began in Thailand a training programme intended to make the KAF airlift wing self-sufficient.|$|E
50|$|In May 1973, the KAF {{received}} five of {{an eventual}} eight Fairchild C-123K Provider transports on paper, which were employed extensively alongside the C-47s of the 1st Transport Squadron on air-drop resupply operations. That same month, under an accelerated <b>delivery</b> <b>programme</b> named Project Nimble Voyage, the Americans gave the KAF ten UH-1G helicopter gunships, which {{were assigned to}} the Helicopter Squadron. Five of the machines were deployed to Battambang Airbase and the other five helicopters were stationed at Pochentong, being used extensively alongside the AC-47 and AU-24A gunships in the Mekong-Bassac convoy support role. Under Project Flycatcher, an improvement programme for the KAF, the Americans delivered twelve T-28D Trojans, six UH-1H helicopters, five C-123K Providers and a smaller number of C-47 transports and O-1D Bird Dogs, later followed by a single AU-24A mini-gunship and twenty-four Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers before the programme was officially terminated on June 30, 1973. This was to be the last US delivery of aircraft to Cambodia, which nevertheless significantly improved the combat capability of the KAF.|$|E

50|$|Ypsilanti Meals on Wheels was a {{programme}} {{idea that}} originated {{from the city}} of Ypsilanti’s Mayor’s Council on Aging. As a result of the Council’s recommendation in the spring of 1973, the City Council agreed to appropriate $8000 to a meal <b>delivery</b> <b>programme</b> to begin on July 1, 1973. Pastor William Bingham, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Ypsilanti {{and a member of the}} mayor’s Council on Aging, became the first Executive Director. Volunteers prepared meals in the kitchen of the First Baptist Church. Meal service began on January 14, 1974 to 16 homebound individuals.As time passed and the demand grew, Ypsilanti meals on Wheels purchased vans and equipped them with refrigerators and microwave ovens. Up until that time, volunteers had picked up cold meals, prepared at Eastern Michigan University, and heated them at each stop.Today, Ypsilanti meals on Wheels owns four vans and delivers approximately 200 hot meals each day, Monday through Friday. Drivers pick up the meals at Eastern Michigan University Hoyt Conference center and pack them into insulated containers that maintain the appropriate temperature until the delivery of the last meal.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, the Faun {{plants were}} {{destroyed}} {{to a large}} extent. In 1946, manufacturing began again, first using pre-war and war designs. In 1948, the first new post-war design {{was introduced to the}} market: a small 4.5t truck with diesel engine with an output of between 90 and 100HP. In 1949, the L7 model was introduced providing a load-carrying capacity of 6.5t and a 150HP engine by Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz. Tractors were also built1. The L7 was available as traditional American-style truck and as cabover. From 1951 and 1950, the L8 (180HP and 8t live load) and Sepp (130HP and 6.5-7t live load) models replaced the former Faun models. From 1953 on, the triple-axle L900 truck was built, a vehicle for operating on difficult and heavy construction sites. The L900 could carry up to 16 tons. The L8 and the L900 models were produced until 1962, the Sepp until 1955. In 1955, modernised models with a new identifier system came to the market (F55, F56, F64, F66, F68), with a live load capacity of 4.5 to 5.6t. In 1955, Faun acquired a light Cab Over Engine from the Ostner plants for its own <b>delivery</b> <b>programme</b> which underwent a technical overhaul in 1957 and was built until 1968. From 1956 onwards, heavy trucks and tractor units were added to the programme, which were also available with four-wheel drive.|$|E

40|$|This paper qualitatively {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} enhance curriculum design and delivery processes in universities through the development and introduction of new information systems and procedures. It examines the experiences of 5 out of the total 27 institutions involved in the UK JISC Curriculum Design and <b>Delivery</b> <b>programme</b> as they attempted to implement campus-wide changes. Common themes that emerged across all 5 projects were the interconnectedness of university systems, proliferation of alternative ‘feral’ systems, a tendency for project remits to drift, resistance {{from other parts of}} the institution, planning imperatives, staff turnover and dependency failures. Conclusions are that cultural change underpins effective innovation and that cultural change is harder than technical innovation. It is best achieved through participatory, campus-wide approaches, although a “submarine” strategy may be necessary to deflect opposition. Stakeholders should be kept informed about benefits to them and it is important for projects to be responsive and adaptive and to recognise that participatory approaches may be institutionally risky. It concludes with practical recommendations for achieving lasting large scale change in the higher education environment. The JISC Curriculum Design and <b>Delivery</b> <b>programme</b> was arguably the largest single coordinated ICT based change management programme yet seen in the UK and the findings of this study provide insights into common barriers to effective change in universities and how to overcome them...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{recommendation}} by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) {{that the}} human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine should be routinely given to girls aged 12 – 13 raises important questions about prevention programmes to combat cervical cancer in the UK.

This paper discusses these questions within the current context of cervical cancer prevention programmes considering issues of efficacy {{and the impact of}} immunization on women and the implications for the current cervical screening programme. We argue that despite the JCVI recommendation to implement a national vaccination programme in the UK, which will undoubtedly save lives, further consideration needs to be given to key concerns about the efficacy of the <b>delivery</b> <b>programme</b> and potential risks associated with this, the additional costs of delivery of such a programme, the challenge of ensuring continued vaccination coverage among the highest risk population, the goals of the vaccination programme and the need to continue cervical cancer screening despite a vaccination programme...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that {{majority of the people}} are living in poor housing quality or totally homeless in urban center despite all governmental policies to provide housing to the public. On the supply side, various government policies in the past have been formulated towards overcoming the huge shortage through several Housing Reform Programmes. Despite these past efforts, housing continues to be a mirage to ordinary Nigerian. Currently, there are various mass housing <b>delivery</b> <b>Programmes</b> such as the affordable housing scheme that utilize the Public Private Partnership effort and several Private Finance Initiative models could only provide for about 3 % of the required stock.

The production planning of these products is complicated that considers important concerns, i. e. {{the reliability of the}} product <b>delivery</b> <b>programme,</b> the short lead-time competitiveness, and the effective utilization of purpose-built precast moulds. The planning has a high impact on the success of the production. The characteristics of the bespoke precast production are formulated with the flowshop scheduling technique so that an effective production plan can be arranged to meet these concerns. Genetic algorithm is used in the scheduling optimization. Its multi-objective function includes total flowtime, total machine idle time, and total tardiness and earliness. After the model formulation, sensitivity analyses are conducted on the three model's parameters namely the number of mould availability, the processing time changes, and the weighting of the multi-objective function. The proposed model is anticipated to support the planners to arrange economic and efficient production plans. Also, {{it can be used to}} determine the suitable number of moulds, the accuracy of the processing time estimation, and the weighting strategy of the multi-objective optimization. flowshop scheduling, bespoke {{precast concrete}}, production planning, genetic algorithm,...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the motivation of}} a cohort of first year computing students and the effects on their engagement as they progress through the revised delivery of an introductory programming unit. The purpose behind the redesign of the delivery of the unit was to maintain student engagement by ensuring that each student was able to assume responsibility for all their work, irrespective of their previous experience. One hoped-for consequence was the avoidance of the bi-modal results profile experienced in previous years. The level of engagement was {{measured in terms of}} the numbers of students submitting assignments, given that not all the assignments needed to be attempted to obtain a pass mark for the coursework component of the unit. A survey was conducted at the outset, at which it became clear that a substantial minority of the students were not particularly interested in programming. For these students the motivation was to pass the unit. The number of students expressing either some or considerable interest in programming in the survey almost directly matched the number completing a final, optional assignment. Student surveys and the lack of a bi-modal distribution in the results indicated that the revised <b>delivery</b> <b>programme</b> maintained the general level of motivation and engagement within the group throughout the academic year...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of diabetes mellitus is 12. 7 % in Singapore. Managing {{people with diabetes}} in the community {{may be needed to}} reduce unnecessary utilisation of expensive specialist resources and to reduce hospital waiting times for patients with compli-cations. Care practice: The Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Delivering on Target (DOT) Programme was launched in 2005 to right-site clini-cally stable diabetic patients from the hospital to private DOT GPs. The Chronic Disease Management Office (CDMO) was established and a fully customised DOT information technology (IT) system was developed. Three initiatives were implemented: (i) Subsidised drug <b>delivery</b> <b>programme,</b> (ii) Diagnostic tests incentive programme, and (iii) Allied healthcare incentive programme. Discussion: Right-siting was enabled through patient incentives that eased the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure. Right Siting Officers (RSOs) maintained a general oversight of the patient pathway. The integrated system supported shared care follow-up by enabling DOT GPs to share updates on the patients ’ health status with the referring specialists. Conclusion: A coherent process across all healthcare providers similar to the SGH DOT Programme may facilitate efforts to shift the care for people with diabetes to the community and to provide integrated care. Successful integration may require incentives for institutional partners and patients...|$|E
