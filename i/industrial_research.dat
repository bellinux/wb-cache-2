5|$|Samples of {{wood from}} the {{shipwreck}} were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products {{division of the}} Commonwealth Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. The analysis was conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis.|$|E
5|$|Siddiqui studied {{philosophy}} at Aligarh Muslim University and later studied chemistry at Frankfurt University, {{where he received}} his PhD in 1927. On return to British India, {{he worked at the}} Tibbia College Delhi and the Indian Council for Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research.</b> He later moved to Pakistan and worked in the Pakistan Council of Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> and went on to establish the Pakistan National Science Council and was appointed as its first chairman in 1961. In the same year he became the Fellow of the Royal Society. He later also co-founded Pakistan Academy of Sciences, and after retirement from the government he founded the Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} {{new field of}} radio astronomy sparked Bacher's interest, and he hired John Bolton and Gordon Stanley from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> Organisation in 1955. A grant from the Office of Naval Research allowed Bolton to build the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, which became an important {{center for the study}} of quasars.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{supported}} British {{involvement in}} the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, these scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research,</b> which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise {{them away from the}} wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research,</b> Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|The Australian bush fly, Musca vetustissima, {{is a major}} {{nuisance}} pest in Australia, but native decomposers {{found in}} Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, {{to reduce the amount}} of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth Forestry School was {{established}} in Westridge near the brickworks and Westbourne Woods in 1926. It opened with its first intake {{of students in the}} following year. Today the heritage-listed Forestry School and the associated principal's residence Westridge House are located on Banks Street, Yarralumla. The Commonwealth Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> Organisation (CSIRO) Forestry and Forestry Products subsumed the school in 1975. Westridge House, an impressive Tudor-style structure, underwent a A$500,000 refurbishment and is used as a residence for the chief officer of the CSIRO.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Young {{became an}} <b>industrial</b> <b>research</b> chemist, {{working in the}} lacquer {{industry}} at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became {{an assistant professor of}} chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, No. 78 Squadron moved to Deniliquin in New South Wales on 17 December {{and most of}} its personnel were sent on leave until 16 January. The squadron was rapidly reduced to a cadre, and comprised only 17 personnel in July 1946. The unit was located at RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney from May to August 1946, and then moved to RAAF Station Williamtown outside of Newcastle. On 4 August 1946 it received four P-51D Mustang fighters and a single CAC Wirraway trainer. No. 78 Squadron undertook training during 1947, including exercises with Australian and British warships in March and July. During April 1947 two of the squadron's Mustangs took part in a Commonwealth Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> Organisation cloud seeding experiment; in this role the aircraft sprayed silver iodide onto clouds from tanks beneath their wings with the goal of generating rain. No. 78 Squadron was disbanded on 1 April 1948.|$|E
5|$|From 1960 to 1965 Paton was a {{board member}} of the Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> and from 1964 to 1975 he served on the council of the Construction Industry Research and Information Association. Paton was also the British {{representative}} on the committee of the International Commission on Large Dams between 1966 and 1973. From 1968 to 1970 he was chairman of the National Economic Development Council's working party on large industrial construction sites and from 1969 to 1974 was a member of the Natural Environment Research Council. Paton was vice-chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions from 1971 to 1972 and chairman for 1972 to 1973. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food flood protection research committee. Paton was also a member emeritus of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers and served as their president in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Oliphant {{secured the}} {{services}} of fellow Australian physicist Harrie Massey, {{who had been working}} for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of the}} Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. Although based in Berkeley, he often visited Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the separation plant was, and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos. He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in the project, and had Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research,</b> release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project. He briefed Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, on the project, and urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1965, {{the station was}} established by the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> (NTNF) in 1967 in close cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) and located adjacent to Tromsø Geophysical Observatory. From its inception until 1974, it served low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operated by the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). To a lesser extent it was also used by Canadian Space Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LEO satellites. Norway's non-membership in ESRO and later the European Space Agency (ESA) caused Tromsø to not become a ground station for Landsat. A gradual increase in operations occurred from 1982, such as for the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme and the European Remote-Sensing Satellite. TSS became part of NSC in 1990, although it was partially sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) in 1995. SvalSat merged with TSS in 2002 to form KSAT.|$|E
5|$|Placzek became {{head of the}} {{theoretical}} physics division. Kowarski was designated {{to be the head}} of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to accept what he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not go without Kowarski, but Sir Edward Appleton, the permanent secretary of the British Department of Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research,</b> of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for James Chadwick. Auger became head of the experimental physics division instead. Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist Jules Guéron, who had been working for Free France at Cambridge, and Bruno Pontecorvo, an Italian scientist who had worked with Enrico Fermi in Italy before the war.|$|E

5|$|The Council for Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> {{created the}} Atomic Physics Section in 1947 led by Martin. In 1948 {{he became a}} member of the Interim Council of the Australian National University. He was {{president}} of the Australian Branch of the Institute of Physics in 1952 and 1953. From 1953 to 1963 he was a Trustee of the Science Museum of Victoria and its chairman in 1962 and 1963. He became a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1954 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1957. For his work in education and defence he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 Birthday Honours, and he was knighted to honour his outstanding contributions to science in the 1957 New Year Honours. He was a Pro-Vice-Chancellor for the University of Melbourne in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences at age forty-eight {{and was one of the}} {{founding}} members of the National Academy of Engineering.

5|$|Bruce also greatly {{strengthened}} {{the research and}} information-gathering capacity of the executive, and sought to make decisions and policy {{on the basis of}} the best available evidence and information. A record 22 Royal Commissions reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the Council for Scientific and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Research</b> (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO. He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues. By the time he left office, he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional capacity of the Australian prime minister.|$|E
