[...] "We had the Series and All-Star Game. 1966–1968's Game meant exclusivity", said NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann, who added that [...] " [...] Chet Simmons and liked him [...] with the Sox and football" [...] also, getting two network sports {{for the price of}} one.

2500|$|Subsequently, in {{a message}} to his {{subjects}} the King conveyed, [...] "Do not worry about me, he will release me soon, without any need for payment- Tong Seal {{does not seem to}} be wealthy either." [...] When Pu Tong Seal found out about La King's attitude, he secretly collected all the wealth under his province such as silver, beads, bells, (zaam) a traditional musical instrument made of copper, other house utensils, and stored them in a large house to impress La King. One evening, Pu Tong Seal revealed his treasury to La King, and said, [...] "If you do not want to meet my demand it is <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> I do not need your wealth, because I am already a very wealthy man- but in that case, you will never be released to see your kingdom and your family." [...] His determination to keep the Burman king alive but never to release him was very obvious in his stern voice. This sent a chill down La King's spine. La King then immediately sent another message to his Kingdom; this time, the King ordered them to fetch him at once with all the demanded ransom. The King also added in the message, [...] "Tong Seal isn't poor at all, as I first thought, he is actually a very wealthy man".|$|E

60|$|We {{were often}} {{crossing}} it on one errand or other, {{but now we}} were especially {{going to see the}} gipsy quarter of Seville, which disputes with that of Granada the infamy of the loathsomest purlieu imaginable. Perhaps because it was so very loathsome, I would not afterward visit the gipsy quarter in Granada, and if such a thing were possible I would willingly unvisit the gipsy quarter of Seville. All Triana is pretty squalid, though it has merits and charms to which I will try eventually to be just, and I must even now advise the reader to visit the tile potteries there. If he has our good-fortune he may see in the manager of one a type of that fusion of races with which Spain long so cruelly and vainly struggled {{after the fall of the}} last Moorish kingdom. He was beautifully lean and clean of limb, and of a grave gentleness of manner; his classically regular face was as swarthy as the darkest mulatto's, but his quiet eyes were gray. I carried the sense of his <b>fine</b> decency <b>with</b> <b>me</b> when we drove away from his warerooms, and suddenly whirled round the corner of the street into the gipsy quarter, and made it my prophylactic against the human noisomeness which instantly beset our course. Let no Romany Rye romancing Barrow, or other fond fibbing sentimentalist, ever pretend to me hereafter that those persistent savages have even the ridiculous claim of the North American Indians to the interest of the civilized man, except as something to be morally and physically scoured and washed up, and drained and fumigated, and treated with insecticides and put away in mothballs. Our own settled order of things is not agreeable at all points; it reeks and it smells, especially in Spain, when you get down to its lower levels; but it does not assail the senses with such rank offense as smites them in the gipsy quarter with sights and sounds and odors which to eye and ear, as well as nose, were all stenches.|$|R
2500|$|DeLillo {{returned}} with what {{would turn out}} to be his final novel of the decade with Falling Man in May 2007. The novel concerned the impact on one family of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, [...] "an intimate story which is encompassed by a global event." [...] According to a 2007 interview in Die Zeit, DeLillo claims that originally he [...] "didn't ever want to write a novel about 9/11" [...] and [...] "had an idea for a different book" [...] which he had [...] "been working on for half a year" [...] in 2004 when he came up with an idea for the novel, beginning work on the novel following the re-election of George W. Bush that November. Although highly anticipated and eagerly awaited by critics, who felt that DeLillo was one of the contemporary writers best equipped to tackle the events of 9/11 in novelistic form, the novel met with a mixed critical reception and garnered no major literary awards or nominations. DeLillo, however, remained unconcerned by this relative lack of critical acclaim, remarking in 2010, [...] "In the 1970s, when I started writing novels, I was a figure in the margins, and that’s where I belonged. If I’m headed back that way, that’s <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> because that’s always where I felt I belonged. Things changed for me in the 1980s and 1990s, but I’ve always preferred to be somewhere in the corner of a room, observing." ...|$|E
