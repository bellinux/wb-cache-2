25|$|The <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> used, {{especially}} in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as {{the introduction of}} rotary valves {{made it possible for}} them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100. Gustav Mahler's 1906 Symphony No. 8, for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.|$|E

There are balalaika orchestras which consist solely of different balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music {{that has been}} arranged for balalaikas. The prima balalaika is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been descant and tenor balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen, or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple). They are typically strung with three strings, and the necks are fretted.|$|E

The instrument's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in the [...] "early years of the 20th century." [...] Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of society, taken up by young men and women.

2500|$|The ocarina {{belongs to}} a very old <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{believed}} to date back over 12,000 years. Ocarina-type instruments have been of particular importance in Chinese and Mesoamerican cultures. For the Chinese, the instrument {{played an important role}} in their long history of song and dance. The ocarina has similar features to the Xun (塤), another important Chinese instrument (but is different in that Ocarina uses an internal duct, whereas Xun is blown across the outer edge). In Japan, the traditional ocarina is known as the tsuchibue (kanji: 土笛; literally [...] "earthen flute"). Different expeditions to Mesoamerica, including the one conducted by Cortés, resulted in the introduction of the ocarina to the courts of Europe. Both the Mayans and Aztecs produced versions of the ocarina, but it was the Aztecs who brought Europe the song and dance that accompanied the ocarina. The ocarina went on to become popular in European communities as a toy instrument.|$|E
2500|$|The violin family, {{including}} cello-sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> {{distinct from}} the viola da gamba family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to {{what we now call}} violins, violas, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for {{about two and a half}} centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the lira da braccio and the rebec. The earliest surviving cellos are made by Andrea Amati, the first known member of the celebrated Amati family of luthiers.|$|E
