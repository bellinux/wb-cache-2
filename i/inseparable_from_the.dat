His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona.

5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} encompasses heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which are treated as <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish heraldry is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Xu Xiake, who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature, the Chinese poet and official Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610) used travel literature {{to express his}} desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with Confucian court politics. Yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> career of a scholar-official. This anti-official sentiment in Yuan's travel literature and poetry was actually following {{in the tradition of}} the Song dynasty poet and official Su Shi (1037–1101). Yuan Hongdao and his two brothers, Yuan Zongdao (1560–1600) and Yuan Zhongdao (1570–1623), were the founders of the Gong'an School of letters. This highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the Confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism, which was also apparent in Ming vernacular novels such as the Jin Ping Mei. Yet even gentry and scholar-officials were affected by the new popular romantic literature, seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate.|$|E

Conversely, he also notes that some challenges to a contract's formation necessarily include a challenge to the arbitration clause in any event, contrary to some recent lower-court decisions.|$|E

In the following decades, developers proposed a hydropower project as <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> seaway; the various governments and seaway supporters believed that the deeper water to be created by the hydro project was necessary to make the seaway channels feasible for ocean-going ships. United States {{proposals for}} development up to and including the First World War met with little interest from the Canadian federal government. But the two national governments submitted Saint Lawrence plans to a group for study. By the early 1920s, both The Wooten-Bowden Report and the International Joint Commission recommended the project.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps Nietzsche's {{greatest}} philosophical legacy lies in his 20th century interpreters, {{among them}} Pierre Klossowski, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, Leo Strauss, Alexandre Kojève, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze (and Félix Guattari), Jacques Derrida and Albert Camus. Foucault's later writings, for example, adopt Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop anti-foundationalist theories {{of power that}} divide and fragment rather than unite politics (as evinced in the liberal tradition of political theory). The systematic institutionalisation of criminal delinquency, sexual identity and practice, and the mentally ill (to name but a few) are examples used to demonstrate how knowledge or truth is <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> institutions that formulate notions of legitimacy from 'immoralities' such as homosexuality and the like (captured in the famous power-knowledge equation). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's interpreters, used the much-maligned 'will to power' thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such the rhizome and other 'outsides' to state power as traditionally conceived.|$|E

500|$|The pied butcherbird {{was first}} {{described}} by the ornithologist John Gould in 1837 as Vanga nigrogularis. The type specimen was collected near Sydney. The species name is from the Latin words niger (black), and gula (throat). Gould described Cracticus picatus in 1848 from northern Australia, calling it [...] "A miniature representative of, and nearly allied to, but distinct from, Cracticus nigrogularis." [...] The word picatus is Latin for [...] "daubed with pitch", hence [...] "black patches. This was reclassified as a subspecies of C. nigrogularis. Gregory Mathews described subspecies inkermani from Queensland and subspecies mellori from Victoria and South Australia in 1912, {{on the basis of}} smaller and larger size than the nominate subspecies respectively. Both are now regarded as <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nominate subspecies.

500|$|The Linga Purana advocates {{the worship}} of Ardhanarishvara by devotees to attain union with Shiva upon {{dissolution}} {{of the world and}} thus attain salvation. The Ardhanarinateshvara Stotra is a popular hymn dedicated to the deity. The Nayanar saints of Tamil Nadu exault the deity in hymns. While the 8th-century Nayanar saint Cuntarar says that Shiva is always <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mother Goddess, another 7th-century Nayanar saint Campantar describes how the [...] "eternal feminine" [...] is not only his consort, but she is also part of him. The renowned Sanskrit writer Kalidasa (c. 4th–5th century) alludes Ardhanarishvara in invocations of his Raghuvamsa and Malavikagnimitram, and says that Shiva and Shakti are as inseparable as word and meaning. The 9th-century Nayanar saint Manikkavacakar casts Parvati {{in the role of the}} supreme devotee of Shiva in his hymns. He alludes to Ardhanarishvara several times and regards it the ultimate goal of a devotee to be united with Shiva as Parvati is in the Ardhanarishvara form.|$|E

He seems the depositary of the vengeance of his race; and though the long habit of brooding over daily insults and injuries has crusted over his temper with inveterate misanthropy, and hardened him against the contempt of mankind, this adds but little to the triumphant pretensions of his enemies. There is a strong, quick, and deep sense of justice mixed up with the gall and bitterness of his resentment.

2500|$|Russian Orthodox churches contain many ritualistic {{components}} that are <b>inseparable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{architecture of the}} building.

[...] Florensky refers to “wall-painting” as “that noblest form of fine art” to be found in Russian Orthodox churches. [...] The wall paintings enhance the architecture of the church and contribute to the sensory experience.
