5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{laboratory}} assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits {{the return to}} Earth of his new rocket ship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space. The rocket is at first thought to be lost, having dramatically overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> radar and returns to Earth, crash-landing in Wimbledon, London.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2009, the {{smallest}} Kuiper belt object detected is 980 m across. It is too dim (magnitude 35) {{to be seen}} by Hubble directly, but it was <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> Hubbles star tracking system when it occulted a star.|$|E
40|$|Steganography is {{the process}} by which we can hide the data into the image. Steganography and Cryptography both are different. As in {{cryptography}} a person can easily <b>detect</b> <b>by</b> naked eye that there is some change in the data but in steganography a person cannot <b>detect</b> <b>by</b> naked eye that’s why it is the art of hiding data into image. In this paper the technique of LSB is used by randomly selecting the pixels and use them for embedding. Mat lab is used to develop a tool that is GUI interface and easy to use for hiding data...|$|R

The two centres exchanged four more calls over the next 20 minutes with no new information.|$|E
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light.

30|$|Especially, since FIS has {{a better}} {{sensitivity}} and reaches longer wavelengths than IRAS, we can expect a different composition of sources: we should see objects with cool dust which were difficult to <b>detect</b> <b>by</b> IRAS bands.|$|R
30|$|Ninety-five {{patients}} had lesions evaluable by ultrasonography, whilst only 74 by digital mammography. Failure to <b>detect</b> <b>by</b> mammography occurred in younger women and/or {{in those with}} dense breasts. In 5 patients the imaging assessment was incomplete.|$|R
5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations can be <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind {{at or near the}} site of damage, inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place.|$|E
5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> proprioceptors in the muscles and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E

5|$|Ghazi, meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances. On {{the night}} of 3–4 December, a muffled {{underwater}} explosion was <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a clearance diving team was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that Ghazi had sunk in shallow waters.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its imaging equipment, MRO carries a variety of engineering instruments. The Gravity Field Investigation Package measures variations in the Martian gravitational field through variations in the spacecraft's velocity. Velocity changes are <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> measuring doppler shifts in MRO's radio signals received on Earth. The package also includes sensitive onboard accelerometers used to deduce the in situ atmospheric density of Mars during aerobraking.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features.
