His primary goal in creating Dillo was to democratize access to information. Arellano Cid believed that no one should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> new computer or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.|$|E
500|$|The deal {{attracted}} mass {{attention from}} the media. Neil Harman, then of the Daily Mail, questioned the power broadcasters and Premier League chairman now had over fixture scheduling. He concluded his piece with a warning: [...] "The game has already reached saturation coverage, now {{it is likely to}} be choked. Football on six days out of seven per week will be good for no-one." [...] The Independent noted that this was a [...] "remarkable coup" [...] for BSkyB, given the company's fluctuating fortunes. The Guardian correspondent David Lacey suggested that fans were the biggest losers: [...] "A lot of people who want to watch matches regularly in future are going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> bond or a dish." [...] Bryan Davies, Baron Davies of Oldham described the arrangement as [...] "absolutely appalling" [...] and Football Supporters' Association chairman Craig Brewin criticised the [...] "obscene" [...] amounts of money clubs earned as part of the deal.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Variety, Noel Holston said [...] " [...] is smarter and freakier {{than most of}} the prime-time {{animated}} series that have popped up in the past year." [...] Furthermore, most of the first season DVD reviews were positive towards the series as being one of the best American comedy shows. In a DVD review by Bill Treadway for DVD Verdict, he called the show [...] "the best animated American comedy since The Simpsons, it is a claim I stand behind." [...] Treadway said the show is [...] "accessible to all" [...] that [...] "adults will enjoy the witty satire and sly in-jokes subtly inserted into every episode." [...] He also mentioned that [...] "children will love the bright colors, spunky pace, and lively characters" [...] and that [...] "parents will {{not have to worry about}} violence or crude humor." [...] Jason Bovberg of DVD Talk called SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "the coolest Saturday morning cartoon since the heyday of Warner Bros." [...] In a separate review for the season's DVD release, Bovberg [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "I love the show so much, I can't see any way around giving this one a recommendation." [...] Bovberg was particular on the exclusion of the pilot episode [...] "Help Wanted", saying [...] "But why is 'Help Wanted' missing? I suppose I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> [...] "theme" [...] disc down the road to secure that one. Sigh." [...] Furthermore, he described it as [...] "the only disappointment of the set." [...] Ron J. Epstein, also from DVD Talk, said that the character of SpongeBob is [...] "one of the strangest cartoon characters I have ever had the pleasure to watch." [...] He said that [...] "Unlike most cartoons today, SpongeBob SquarePants caters to both a child and an adult audience." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{was once}} a rich old man who had two sons, and as his wife was dead, the elder lived with him, and helped him to look after his property.

'It will soon be full now, and I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> larger one,' he said to himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his money, that he did not notice how bright his son's face had grown, nor how he {{sometimes}} started when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far away.|$|E
60|$|In America {{we have no}} annual supreme day; no day whose {{approach}} {{makes the}} whole nation glad. We have the Fourth of July, and Christmas, and Thanksgiving. Neither of them can claim the primacy; neither of them can arouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal. Eight grown Americans out of ten dread {{the coming of the}} Fourth, with its pandemonium and its perils, and they rejoice when it is gone--if still alive. The approach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many excellent people. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> cart-load of presents, and they never know what to buy to hit the various tastes; they put in three weeks of hard and anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they are so dissatisfied with the result, and so disappointed that they want to sit down and cry. Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once a year. The observance of Thanksgiving Day--as a function--has become general of late years. The Thankfulness is not so general. This is natural. Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hard time during the year, and this has a calming effect upon their enthusiasm.|$|E

6000|$|We went on past {{a display}} of {{electroplate}} with a card about presents in the window, past a window full of white flowers, past a carriage-builder's and a glove shop. [...] "It's like death," [...] said my uncle; [...] "it turns up everywhere and is just the same for everybody. In that cake shop there were piles and piles of cakes, from little cakes ten inches across up to cakes of three hundredweight or so; all just the same rich, uneatable, greasy stuff, and with just the same white sugar {{on the top of}} them. I suppose every day they pack off scores. It makes one think of marrying in swarms, like the gnats. I catch myself wondering sometimes if the run of people really are separate individuals, or only a kind of replicas, without any tastes of their own. There are people who would rather not marry than marry without one of those cakes, George. To me it seems to be almost the most asinine position a couple of adults can be in, to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> stone or so of that concentrated biliousness and cut it up, or procure other people to cut it up, and send it round to other adults who would almost as soon eat arsenic.
