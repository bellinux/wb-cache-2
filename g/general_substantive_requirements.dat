50|$|The {{constitutional}} {{status of}} the <b>substantive</b> assessment <b>requirements</b> under Proposition 218 altered the standard of review analysis. The <b>substantive</b> <b>requirements</b> for assessments are contained in constitutional provisions of dignity at least equal to the constitutional separation of powers provision.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} {{the meaning of}} these latter two requirements: the requirements to include best available science and to give special consideration to the conservation of anadromous fisheries. Section II defines 2 ̆ 2 best available science 2 ̆ 2 by examining the fundamental characteristics of scientific information applied {{in the context of}} the GMA. Expanding on the work of a technical team convened by DCTED, this Article suggests an approach useful for identifying scientific information and assessing which of that information should be considered the 2 ̆ 2 best available science. 2 ̆ 2 Section III concludes that the requirement of RCW 36. 70 A. 172 (1) to include best available science is a <b>substantive</b> <b>requirement.</b> Section IV explains the relationship between the two requirements in RCW 36. 70 A. 172 (1) : the <b>substantive</b> <b>requirement</b> to include best available science and the requirement to give special consideration to anadromous fisheries...|$|R
50|$|Patentable, {{statutory}} or patent-eligible {{subject matter}} is subject matter which is susceptible of patent protection. The laws or patent practices of many countries provide that certain subject-matter is excluded from patentability, even if the invention is novel and non-obvious. Together with novelty, inventive step or nonobviousness, utility, and industrial applicability, {{the question of whether}} a particular {{subject matter is}} patentable is one of the <b>substantive</b> <b>requirements</b> for patentability.|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the ethical}} and legal aspects of reproductive genetic testing in 11 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, The Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK). The {{legal status of}} reproductive genetic testing in the countries under analysis is difficult to generalize due to the different regulatory systems adopted. These approaches are {{a reflection of the}} legal traditions and cultural and socio-religious beliefs which inform and shape public policy on assisted reproductive technologies and genetic testing. We divide approaches into two groups: public ordering (legislative, top-down approach) and private ordering (non-legislative, bottom-up approach). Even limiting our analysis to a number of countries that span the range from restrictive to pragmatic approaches, there is remarkable symmetry in both the (i) <b>substantive</b> <b>requirements</b> (i. e. gravity, health indications generally) and (ii) procedural safeguards (i. e. informed consent, counselling, confidentiality, civil status, oversight and accreditation) surrounding reproductive genetic testing. Indeed, irrespective of whether a country adopts a prohibitive or a permissive approach through legislation or self-regulation or a mix of both, the ultimate decision is [...] and should continue to be [...] a medical one. Nowhere is this more evident than in the <b>substantive</b> <b>requirements.</b> ...|$|R

The contract of sale does, however, have a number of additional <b>substantive</b> <b>requirements</b> (known as essentialia), which are assimilated into the general contractual structure. Of course, like any contract, the requirement of consensus, or agreement, is the most important general element.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: in the {{following}} section, it provides some basic data on comitology and introduces the normative concerns voiced by the European Parliament. Responding to the interinstitutional debate and reacting to the Commissions' proposal concerning a reform of comitology, the paper proceeds by asking for adequate normative justifications of supranational governance and their implications for a reform of comitology. It is argued that convincing normative justifications must not be developed in the void of general reflections about the procedural and <b>substantive</b> <b>requirements</b> of a democracy but need to take account of the very nature of the European polity...|$|R

40|$|It {{generally}} agreed that the requirement of formal general covariance (i. e. the demand that laws be written {{in a form that}} is covariant under arbitrary coordinate transformation) is a condition of the well-formedness of a spacetime theory and not a restriction on its content. Physicists commonly take the <b>substantive</b> <b>requirement</b> of <b>general</b> covariance to mean that the laws exhibit diffeomorphism invariance and that this invariance is a gauge symmetry. This latter requirement does place restrictions on the content of a spacetime theory. The present paper explores the implications of these restrictions for interpreting the ideology and ontology of classical general relativity theory and loop quantum gravity...|$|R
