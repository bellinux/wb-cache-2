2500|$|According to Pearce:"In 1986 whilst {{staying with}} Tibet in his flat in Freya Aswynn's house in north London {{over a period}} of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each {{separate}} night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When <b>I</b> <b>awoke</b> I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an 'appropriate' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a 'thumbs up' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME." ...|$|E

It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. <b>I</b> <b>awoke</b> in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."
