40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of technology and}} internet has diverted company direction to retain customer e-loyalty. Customer loyalty is becoming an area of great interest for companies and customer loyalty has {{a direct impact on}} the revenue and profitability of a company. With regard to customer loyalty’s importance, we investigate three main research problems that are the most important barriers for e-businesses to survival, which are customer too much switching, switching cost, and competition. To overcome this barriers: companies had to invest on building loyal customer in long- time relationship. Also, in this research, the influential factors of customer e-loyalty were investigated, which are e-satisfaction, e-trust, and e-quality. In this research, e-loyalty and e-satisfaction models are elaborated, then, with regard to limitations, the conceptual e-loyalty model are assumed that investigate the relationship between the e-satisfaction, e-trust, and e-quality as basic constructs of model as well as the relationship between each constructs and e-loyalty. In this study, quantitative research is best to this thesis because of linear structure between e-loyalty and its constructs. In addition, research purpose and research questions indicate that this thesis is primarily exploratory then descriptive. Since the aim of this research is to investigate the relationship of variables and to test some predefined hypothesizes among a number of <b>e-stores,</b> survey is selected as research strategy. The aim of this research is to identify influential factors of customer e-loyalty in Iranian <b>e-stores</b> which are focus on selling Book and CDs. Thus, the sample of this survey consists of online buyers who have deals with three <b>e-stores.</b> The names of <b>e-stores</b> were considered anonymous due to owner's request since they feel free to give us customer's information. Moreover, the size of the population under this study is the sample size that has been determined 280 under formula: still, 352 questionnaires were gathered out which 322 were eventually accepted. The result of this research shows that delivery time, distribution system, specific invoice as well as convenience and flexibility of online shopping is very underlying factor of e-satisfaction from customer point of view. In addition, giving Personal Data, Reliable information, Credit card information, and having Physical location have a very influential effect on E-trust from customer point of view. Also, <b>e-stores</b> brand name as well as previous user’s recommendations is the most underling factors which bring about good word of mouth and finally lead to trust in online shopping. Moreover, Experience of members in communities and chartrooms leads to developing E-trust among members. Besides, need fulfillment, advertisement / promotions, and customized attention are the influential factors of E-quality from customer perspective. Also, sending reminder, relevant information, and share of business with customer are the most underlying factors which affect cultivation and increase customer attention in online shopping and consequently increase e-quality. Moreover, one-stop shop and carry a wide selection of products are the most prominent issues which lead to e-quality. In conclusion, all factors which increase E-satisfaction and E-quality lead to e-loyalty so E-satisfaction as well as E-quality considered as two influential factors of customer E-loyalty. Also, since significant relationship between E-trust with E-loyalty and E-satisfaction rejected, we can say that preparing e-trust solely has no effect on E-loyalty and E-satisfaction. In other words, trust is sufficient condition for any e-business for transactions with customer which is not lead to e-loyalty, exclusively. Beside, since there is significant and positive relationship between E-trust and E-quality, and because E-quality has direct effect on E-satisfaction and E-loyalty, we can conclude that E-trust in companion with E-quality will lead to E-satisfaction and E-loyalty.

Ten hypotheses were developed for empirical testing on a sample of 391 online customers in Indonesia.

In order to Three <b>e-stores</b> and their websites were examined based on the model proposed. This study also mentions that security and trust work parallel and close to each other. If a consumer feels that an online deal is secured and they can trust the seller, it leads to a confident e-commerce’s trade.

In this regard, to enrich consumer’s trust in the comprehensive virtual environment, e-service providers or <b>e-stores</b> have to be trustworthy.

40|$|With the {{abundance}} of information produced by users on items (e. g., purchase or rating histories), recommender systems are a major ingredient of online systems such as <b>e-stores</b> and service providers. Recommendation algorithms use information available from users-items interactions and their contextual data to provide a list of potential items for each user. These algorithms are constructed based on similarity between users and/or items (e. g., a user is likely to purchase the same items as his/her most similar users). In this work, we introduce a novel time-aware recommendation algorithm {{that is based on}} identifying overlapping community structure among users. Users&# 039; interests might change over time, and accurate modeling of dynamic users&# 039; preferences is a challenging issue in designing efficient personalized recommendation systems. The users-items interaction network is often highly sparse in real systems, for which many recommenders fail to provide accurate predictions. The proposed overlapping community structure amongst the users helps in minimizing the sparsity effects. We apply the proposed algorithm on two real-world benchmark datasets and show that it overcomes these challenges. The proposed algorithm shows better precision than a number of state-of-the-art recommendation methods...|$|R
40|$|Electronic markets {{facilitate}} {{price discovery}} by both {{buyers and sellers}} compared to traditional, physical markets. Consumers can search a number of <b>e-stores</b> themselves, or visit price comparison sites before buying. Most past {{research has focused on}} buyers, but sellers can make use of the same search tools, and more sophisticated “pricebots ” to search out competitors’ prices. Given this information, the electronic vendor can execute a number of different pricing strategies, including setting product prices as well as the frequency and amount of price changes. This paper presents five hypotheses about price dispersion in fixed price electronic markets and tests them with data from the computer commodity market. The results demonstrate considerable spatial and temporal price dispersion in this market. As buyer demand drops over time, the marketplace exhibits greater price dispersion. There is evidence that price dispersion is less for high priced items where there are significant gains from buyer search. We found through a simulation analysis that the computer commodity market exhibits synchronized price changes, not random changes. Finally, the data suggest that some vendors change their price strategies frequently to hide information from consumers...|$|R
40|$|Web sites today serve many {{different}} functions, such as corporate sites, search engines, <b>e-stores,</b> and so forth. As sites are created for different purposes, their structure and connectivity characteristics vary. However, this research argues that sites of similar role exhibit similar structural patterns, as the functionality of a site naturally induces a typical hyperlinked structure and typical connectivity patterns {{to and from}} the rest of the Web. Thus, the functionality of Web sites is reflected in a set of structural and connectivity-based features that form a typical signature. In this paper, we automatically categorize sites into eight distinct functional classes, and highlight several search-engine related applications that could make immediate use of such technology. We purposely limit our categorization algorithms by tapping connectivity and structural data alone, making no use of any content analysis whatsoever. When applying two classification algorithms to a set of 202 sites of the eight defined functional categories, the algorithms correctly classified between 54. 5 % and 59 % of the sites. On some categories, the precision of the classification exceeded 85 %. An additional result of this work indicates that the structural signature can be used to detect spam rings and mirror sites, by clustering sites with almost identical signatures...|$|R
