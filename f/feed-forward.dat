5|$|The {{reactive}} <b>feed-forward</b> system {{refers to}} an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium. This is probably initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger vagal afferent signals to the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{researchers}} hypothesize that the enrichment of network motifs is non-adaptive. In other words, gene regulatory networks can evolve {{to a similar}} structure without the specific selection on the proposed input-output behavior. Support for this hypothesis often comes from computational simulations. For example, fluctuations in the abundance of <b>feed-forward</b> loops in a model that simulates the evolution of gene regulatory networks by randomly rewiring nodes may suggest that the enrichment of <b>feed-forward</b> loops is a side-effect of evolution. In another model of gene regulator networks evolution, {{the ratio of the}} frequencies of gene duplication and gene deletion show great influence on network topology: certain ratios lead to the enrichment of <b>feed-forward</b> loops and create networks that show features of hierarchical scale free networks.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with <b>feed-forward</b> (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The <b>feed-forward</b> value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the <b>feed-forward</b> output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
25|$|CNNs are {{suitable}} for processing visual and other two-dimensional data. They have shown superior results in both image and speech applications. They can be trained with standard backpropagation. CNNs are easier to train than other regular, deep, <b>feed-forward</b> neural networks and have many fewer parameters to estimate. Examples of applications in computer vision include DeepDream.|$|E
25|$|In Machine Learning and Computer Vision, M-Theory is a {{learning}} framework inspired by <b>feed-forward</b> processing in the ventral stream of visual cortex and originally developed for recognition and classification {{of objects in}} visual scenes. M-Theory was later applied to other areas, such as speech recognition. On certain image recognition tasks, algorithms based on a specific instantiation of M-Theory, HMAX, achieved human-level performance.|$|E
25|$|A {{convolutional}} {{neural network}} (CNN) is a class of deep, <b>feed-forward</b> networks, composed {{of one or more}} convolutional layers with fully connected layers (matching those in typical ANNs) on top. It uses tied weights and pooling layers. In particular, max-pooling is often structured via Fukushima's convolutional architecture. This architecture allows CNNs {{to take advantage of the}} 2D structure of input data.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} improvement is to incorporate <b>feed-forward</b> control with {{knowledge about the}} system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either gain scheduling in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple PID controllers.|$|E
25|$|The signal {{entering}} a compressor is split, one copy {{sent to a}} variable-gain amplifier {{and the other to}} a side-chain where the signal level is measured and a circuit controlled by the measured signal level applies the required gain to the amplifier. This design, known as a <b>feed-forward</b> type, is used today in most compressors. Earlier designs were based on a feedback layout where the signal level was measured after the amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Likened to a Bayesian network, an HTM {{comprises}} {{a collection}} of nodes that are arranged in a tree-shaped hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy discovers an array of causes in the input patterns and temporal sequences it receives. A Bayesian belief revision algorithm is used to propagate <b>feed-forward</b> and feedback beliefs from child to parent nodes and vice versa. However, the analogy to Bayesian networks is limited, because HTMs can be self-trained (such that each node has an unambiguous family relationship), cope with time-sensitive data, and grant mechanisms for covert attention.|$|E
25|$|Another widely cited {{characteristic}} of gene regulatory network is their abundance of certain repetitive sub-networks known as network motifs. Network motifs {{can be regarded}} as repetitive topological patterns when dividing a big network into small blocks. Previous analysis found several types of motifs that appeared more often in gene regulatory networks than in randomly generated networks. As an example, one such motif is called <b>feed-forward</b> loops, which consist three nodes. This motif is the most abundant among all possible motifs made up of three nodes, as is shown in the gene regulatory networks of fly, nematode, and human.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{based on}} a neuromimetic approach, a novel {{ingredient}} {{has been added to}} the field of quantum machine learning, {{in the form of a}} so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical memristor. This device can be constructed by means of a tunable resistor, weak measurements on the system, and a classical <b>feed-forward</b> mechanism. An implementation of a quantum memristor in superconducting circuits has been proposed, and an experiment with quantum dots performed. A quantum memristor would implement nonlinear interactions in the quantum dynamics which would aid the search for a fully functional quantum neural network.|$|E
25|$|As {{an attempt}} to correct some of the error due to a non-zero , the usage of local linear {{weighted}} regression with ABC to reduce the variance of the posterior estimates has been suggested. The method assigns weights to the parameters according to how well simulated summaries adhere to the observed ones and performs linear regression between the summaries and the weighted parameters {{in the vicinity of}} observed summaries. The obtained regression coefficients are used to correct sampled parameters in the direction of observed summaries. An improvement was suggested in the form of nonlinear regression using a <b>feed-forward</b> neural network model. However, {{it has been shown that}} the posterior distributions obtained with these approaches are not always consistent with the prior distribution, which did lead to a reformulation of the regression adjustment that respects the prior distribution.|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop <b>feed-forward</b> controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
500|$|Potassium {{content in}} the plasma is tightly {{controlled}} by four basic mechanisms, which have various names and classifications. [...] The four are 1) a reactive negative-feedback system, 2) a reactive <b>feed-forward</b> system, 3) a predictive or circadian system, and 4) an internal [...] or cell membrane transport system. Collectively, the first three are sometimes termed the [...] "external potassium homeostasis system"; and the first two, the [...] "reactive potassium homeostasis system".|$|E
2500|$|The enriched motifs {{have been}} {{proposed}} to follow convergent evolution, suggesting they are [...] "optimal designs" [...] for certain regulatory purposes. For example, modeling shows that <b>feed-forward</b> loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors. The galactose utilization system of E. coli contains a <b>feed-forward</b> loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization operon galETK, potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted. The <b>feed-forward</b> loop in the arabinose utilization systems of E.coli delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways. Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of Xenopus, the <b>feed-forward</b> loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, {{in the level of}} Î²-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in Î²-catenin levels. Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of <b>feed-forward</b> loops would be an adaptation for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.|$|E
2500|$|A voltage {{regulator}} {{is designed to}} automatically maintain a constant voltage level. A {{voltage regulator}} may use a simple <b>feed-forward</b> design or may include [...] negative feedback. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it {{may be used to}} regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{may occur}} either via mRNA degradation or preventing mRNA from being translated. For example, miR16 contains a sequence complementary to the AU-rich element {{found in the}} 3'UTR of many unstable mRNAs, such as TNF alpha or GM-CSF. It has been demonstrated that given complete complementarity between the miRNA and target mRNA sequence, Ago2 can cleave the mRNA and lead to direct mRNA degradation. Absent complementarity, silencing is achieved by preventing translation. The relation of miRNA and its target mRNA(s) can {{be based on the}} simple negative regulation of a target mRNA, but it seems that a common scenario is the use of a [...] "coherent <b>feed-forward</b> loop", [...] "mutual negative feedback loop" [...] (also termed double negative loop) and [...] "positive feedback/feed-forward loop" [...] Some miRNAs work as buffers of random gene expression changes arising due to stochastic events in transcription, translation and protein stability. Such regulation is typically achieved by the virtue of negative feedback loops or incoherent <b>feed-forward</b> loop uncoupling protein output from mRNA transcription.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to <b>feed-forward,</b> PID controllers are often enhanced through {{methods such as}} PID gain scheduling (changing parameters in different operating conditions), fuzzy logic, or [...] Further practical application issues can arise from instrumentation connected to the controller. A high enough sampling rate, measurement precision, and measurement accuracy are required to achieve adequate control performance. Another new method for improvement of PID controller {{is to increase the}} degree of freedom by using fractional order. The order of the integrator and differentiator add increased flexibility to the controller.|$|E
2500|$|A modular view of {{sentence}} processing {{assumes that}} each factor involved in sentence processing is computed {{in its own}} module, which has limited means of communication with the other modules. For example, syntactic analysis creation takes place without input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information, which are processed separately. A common assumption of modular accounts is a <b>feed-forward</b> architecture in which the output of one processing step is {{passed on to the}} next step without feedback mechanisms that would allow the output of the first module to be corrected. Syntactic processing is usually taken to be the most basic analysis step, which feeds into semantic processing and the inclusion of other information. A separate mental module parses sentences and lexical access happens first. Then, one syntactic hypothesis is considered at a time. There is no initial influence of meaning, or semantic. [...] Sentence processing is supported by a temporo-frontal network. Within the network, temporal regions subserve aspects of identification and frontal regions the building of syntactic and semantic relations. Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Feed-forward</b> control {{can avoid}} the {{slowness}} of feedback control. With <b>feed-forward</b> control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system. In the house example, a <b>feed-forward</b> system may measure {{the fact that the}} door is opened and automatically turn on the heater before the house can get too cold. The difficulty with <b>feed-forward</b> control is that the effect of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted, and there must not be any unmeasured disturbances. For instance, if a window were opened that was not being measured, the feed-forward-controlled thermostat might still let the house cool down.|$|E
50|$|In physiology, <b>feed-forward</b> {{control is}} {{exemplified}} by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion. <b>Feed-forward</b> control can be likened to learned anticipatory responses to known cues.

50|$|To {{achieve the}} {{benefits}} of feedback control (controlling unknown disturbances and not having to know exactly how a system will respond to disturbances) and {{the benefits of}} <b>feed-forward</b> control (responding to disturbances before they can affect the system), there are combinations of feedback and <b>feed-forward</b> that can be used.|$|E
