500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he <b>got</b> <b>mad</b> at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} {{the solitude of}} outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never <b>got</b> <b>mad,</b> he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E

500|$|Cleveland's {{next game}} {{was against the}} Yankees, who had {{the best record in}} the AAFC's eastern {{division}} and were a likely opponent in the championship game. New York took an early lead as Spec Sanders scored two rushing touchdowns in the first quarter and added a third in the second. Sanders, called [...] "Spectacular Spec" [...] by New York sportswriters, was having a career season. By the end of the year, he had compiled 1,432 rushing yards and 1,442 passing yards; his 18 touchdowns set a professional football record that was not surpassed until the 1960s. After Sanders' three touchdowns, New York's Buddy Young added a fourth in the second quarter, widening the Yankees' lead to 28–0. Cleveland's Bill Boedeker scored a touchdown on a pass from Graham at the end of the period, but the game appeared out of reach for Cleveland at the half. The Browns, however, came back in the second half. Motley rushed for two touchdowns in the third quarter and Jim Dewar ran for a score in the fourth. The game ended in a tie. At halftime, Yankees players had hurled insults at the Browns. [...] "They got us upset, got us angry," [...] Graham later said. [...] "Finally we <b>got</b> <b>mad</b> as a team and we said, 'We'll show these guys,' and we started playing football." [...] More than 70,000 fans came to watch the game, a record for a New York pro football game that stood until 1958. Attendance was boosted by the presence of about 25,000 black fans who came in part to watch the four black players in the game: Buddy Young of the Yankees and Motley, Bill Willis and Horace Gillom of the Browns. Groza was injured during the game and was not able to play.|$|E

Nonetheless, Jenna attempts to seduce Mitch once more in the episode [...] "Ludachristmas." ...|$|E

[...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather.

2500|$|During his {{decades of}} publication, Banner has been portrayed differently, but common themes persist. Banner, a physicist, is sarcastic and {{seemingly}} very self-assured {{when he first}} appears in Incredible Hulk #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions. Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate {{has been one of}} the most persistent common themes. Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: [...] "Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can’t form meaningful bonds with anyone." [...] As a child, Banner's father Brian often <b>got</b> <b>mad</b> and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the psychological complex of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.|$|E

5000|$|Joe Louis and Tony Galento {{appeared}} {{together on}} The Way It Was, a sports nostalgia program (PBS), on January 29, 1976. The episode was lively, due {{almost exclusively to}} Galento's still-direct and colorful style of engagement. Louis showed a surprising side of himself when, after fending off a question by veteran fight commentator Don Dunphy, re: any ill feeling vs. Max Schmeling (Louis stating he and Schmeling had not truly been adversaries but indeed [...] "good friends"), he then pointed at Galento and stated, [...] "But that little fellow...he really <b>got</b> me <b>mad.</b> All those mean things he said about me while training for our fight. He <b>got</b> me <b>mad,</b> all right." [...] Louis furthered this statement by revealing that his anger by fight time was such that {{he had decided to}} [...] "carry" [...] Galento, i.e. to drag the fight out in order to [...] "punish him for those nasty things". After suffering the knockdown, however, Louis changed his mind: [...] "Galento hit too hard. So I knocked him out as quickly as I could." ...|$|R
