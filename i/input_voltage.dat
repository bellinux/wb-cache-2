25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the <b>input</b> <b>voltage.</b> This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>input</b> offset <b>voltage</b> of {{amplifiers}} becomes {{important when}} trying to amplify small signals with very high gain. Because this technique creates a very low <b>input</b> offset <b>voltage</b> amplifier, and because this <b>input</b> offset <b>voltage</b> does not change much with time and temperature, these techniques are also called [...] "zero-drift" [...] amplifiers (because there is no drift in <b>input</b> offset <b>voltage</b> with time and temperature). Related techniques that also give these zero-drift advantages are auto-zero and chopper-stabilized amplifiers.|$|R

25|$|Due {{to their}} very wide <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> range, many power {{supplies}} with active PFC can automatically adjust {{to operate on}} AC power from about 100V (Japan) to 230V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{functions}} and calculations {{can be constructed}} to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing function generators—special circuits of various combinations of resistors and diodes to provide the nonlinearity. Typically, as the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> increases, progressively more diodes conduct.|$|E
25|$|Voltage {{regulators}} {{are used in}} devices like air conditioners, refrigerators, televisions etc. {{in order to protect}} them from fluctuating <b>input</b> <b>voltage.</b> The major problem faced is the use of relays in voltage regulators.

5000|$|Input stage {{non-linearity}} {{at higher}} differential <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> {{due to the}} characteristics of the input stage transistors. In the early devices, such as the CA3080, the input stage consisted of two bipolar transistors connected in the differential amplifier configuration. The transfer characteristics of this connection are approximately linear for differential <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> of 20 mV or less. This is an important limitation when the OTA is being used open loop as there is no negative feedback to linearize the output. One scheme to improve this parameter is mentioned below.|$|R

25|$|The ferroresonant {{approach}} is attractive {{due to its}} lack of active components, relying on the square loop saturation characteristics of the tank circuit to absorb variations in average <b>input</b> <b>voltage.</b> Saturating transformers provide a simple rugged method to stabilize an AC power supply.|$|E
25|$|A real {{rectifier}} characteristically drops {{part of the}} <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> (a voltage drop, for silicon devices, of typically 0.7 volts plus {{an equivalent}} resistance, in general non-linear)—and at high frequencies, distorts waveforms in other ways. Unlike an ideal rectifier, it dissipates some power.|$|E

This is a vanilla N-well complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor process technology with an added P-base layer. Second-order curvature correction for this {{reference is}} accomplished by a versatile piecewise-linear current-mode technique. The 0. 595 -V precision reference achieved a line regulation performance of 408 ppm/V for <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> between 1. 2 and 10 V.

40|$|A {{harmonic}} injection technique, {{which reduces}} the line frequency harmonics {{of the single}} switch three-phase boost rectifier, has been implemented. In this method, a periodic voltage is injected in the control circuit to vary the duty cycle of the rectifier switch within a line cycle so that the fifth-order harmonic of the input current is reduced to meet the total harmonic distortion (THD) requirement. Since the injected voltage signal, which {{is proportional to the}} inverted ac component of the rectified three-phase line-to-line <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> is employed; the injected duty cycle variations are naturally synchronized with the three-phase line-to-neutral <b>input</b> <b>voltages...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{analogue}} computer multiplier provides {{the means of}} forming the product of two physical quantities. In electronic multipliers these quantities are voltages and the multiplier output is also a voltage which {{is proportional to the}} product of the two <b>input</b> <b>voltages,</b> at any instant. Thus inputs of Vx and Vy volts will give an output K. Vx. Vy volts where K is a constant for the instrument concerned. An ideal multiplier will accept positive or negative voltages for either Vx or Vy, thereby giving four quadrant operation, and will produce an output which is exactly proportional to the instantaneous product of the <b>input</b> <b>voltages...</b>|$|R
25|$|When a {{comparator}} {{performs the}} function of telling if an <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is above or below a given threshold, it is essentially performing a 1-bit quantization. This function is used in nearly all analog to digital converters (such as flash, pipeline, successive approximation, delta-sigma modulation, folding, interpolating, dual-slope and others) {{in combination with other}} devices to achieve a multi-bit quantization.|$|E
25|$|Small {{changes in}} the voltage applied across the base–emitter {{terminals}} cause the current between the emitter and the collector to change significantly. This effect {{can be used to}} amplify the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> or current. BJTs {{can be thought of as}} voltage-controlled current sources, but are more simply characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base.|$|E
25|$|Older {{designs of}} ferroresonant {{transformers}} had an output with high harmonic content, {{leading to a}} distorted output waveform. Modern devices are used to construct a perfect sine wave. The ferroresonant action is a flux limiter rather than a voltage regulator, but with a fixed supply frequency it can maintain an almost constant average output voltage even as the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> varies widely.|$|E
30|$|Because of the delta-connected {{autotransformer}} and wye-connected autotransformer {{operating under}} step-up and step-down condition, respectively, {{under the same}} <b>input</b> <b>voltages,</b> the load voltage when using the delta-connected autotransformer is {{greater than that of}} using the wye-connected autotransformer.|$|R

5000|$|At {{common mode}} (the two <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> {{change in the}} same directions), the two voltage (emitter) {{followers}} cooperate with each other working together on the common high-resistive emitter load (the [...] "long tail"). They all together increase or decrease the voltage of the common emitter point (figuratively speaking, they together [...] "pull up" [...] or [...] "pull down" [...] {{it so that it}} moves). In addition, the dynamic load [...] "helps" [...] them by changing its instant ohmic resistance {{in the same direction as}} the <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> (it increases when the voltage increases and vice versa.) thus keeping up constant total resistance between the two supply rails. There is a full (100%) negative feedback; the two <b>input</b> base <b>voltages</b> and the emitter voltage change simultaneously while the collector currents and the total current do not change. As a result, the output collector voltages do not change as well.|$|R
