This study aims to develop, implement, and test such a method, for the particular example of the choice of partitioning methods for allocation in LCA, {{to be used in}} LCA calculations and software. Methods Monte Carlo simulations were used jointly with the CMLCA software for propagating into distributions of LCA results, uncertainty due to the choice of allocation method together with uncertainty of unit process data. In this study, a methodological preference is assigned to each partitioning method, applicable to <b>multi-functional</b> <b>processes</b> in the system. The allocation methods are sampled per process according to these preferences. A case study on rapeseed oil focusing on three greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their global warming impacts is presented to illustrate the method developed. The results of the developed method are compared with those for the same case similarly quantifying uncertainty of unit process data but accompanied by separate scenarios for the different partitioning choices. Results and discussion The median of the inventory flows (emissions) for separate scenarios varies due to the partitioning choices and unit process data uncertainties. Inventory variations are reflected in the global warming results. Results for the approach of this study vary with the methodological preference assigned to the different allocation methods per <b>multi-functional</b> <b>process</b> and with the continuous distribution of unit process data.

40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. In the {{recently}} published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA. Although the Handbook on LCA aimed {{to provide a}} 'cookbook' with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step. The guidelines for allocation largely remained {{at the level of}} principles. This restricted elaboration of economic allocation may hamper application in practice. Therefore, this paper elaborates some examples applying economic allocation. Method. Two concepts are of particular importance when applying economic allocation: functional flow and <b>multi-functional</b> <b>process.</b> The definitions of these concepts are presented and discussed. The basic principle of economic allocation is that having determined the various functional flows of a <b>multi-functional</b> <b>process,</b> all other flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to their shares in the total proceeds. Proceeds are based on prices and these are not always easy to determine for a process. A summary of possible solutions for different problems when determining prices is given. Results and Discussion. The examples presented focus on co-production and various recycling situations. All examples are hypothetical in order to avoid discussions on the data. The examples show that the prices of the functional flows determine the allocation results. It is of importance to have correct information on the relative prices of the functional flows at stake, especially whether they are negative or positive. Learning from these examples, we establish a decision tree for economic allocation. The decision tree is meant for identifying and handling multi-functionality situations starting from a defined (product) system. This decision tree is with minor adaptations also applicable to other allocation methods and has a more general value than for the economic allocation method only. Conclusions and perspective. The examples have helped us to establish a decision tree for handling the multi-functionality problem by economic allocation. The examples can be broadened to other materials and allocation situations. We would encourage others to provide other examples and experiences as we expect that these will help to further improve and refine the guidelines and decision tree for economic allocation in future...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} organisms to survive during stress {{conditions}} relies on several cellular responses. Among these responses, autophagy {{is known as}} a <b>multi-functional</b> <b>process</b> which can alleviate various cellular stresses including nutrient starvation. Although many studies have elucidated the crucial role of autophagy in response to carbon and nitrogen starvation, none of them demonstrated any essential function of autophagy during other types of starvation. Here, we use Arabidopsis as a model to show that autophagy is induced during phosphate (Pi) starvation. Time course monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staining revealed numerous autophagosome spots in the primary root tip of seedlings 4 days after transfer to media without Pi. QRT-PCR of atATG 8 s, a gene family involved in autophagosome formation, showed that relative mRNA abundance of some ATG 8 s increased at time points consistent with the observed autophagosome spots. In addition, characterization of autophagy mutant atg 5 - 4 revealed conditional lateral root growth reduction phenotype under low Pi condition. Accelerated root meristem consumption suggested by early loss of CYCB 1 ::GUS marker in atg 5 - 4 root meristem explains this defect in lateral root growth. Furthermore, time course FDA-PI viability staining results and low primary root recovery rate indicate that loss of root meristem in atg 5 - 4 is irreversible. Based on this data, we conclude that autophagy is a part of Pi starvation responses which have crucial roles in maintaining the root meristem...|$|R
40|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to harmonize guidelines for environmental footprints of food and beverages. For example, the food Sustainable Consumption and Production Roundtable, the Leap partnership, and the Environmental Footprint project, in particular within the Cattle Model Working Group. Despite all these activities, there are still many issues unresolved. This paper gives an overview of five important reasons why it is so difficult to reach consensus within the sector. In short, the issues are: 1) how to allocate deforestation to land use activities; 2) how to assess agricultural emissions profiles; 3) how to make regionalized water scarcity assessments; 4) how to choose the functional unit of food and beverages; and 5) how to deal with <b>multi-functional</b> <b>processes</b> in agro-industry. Recommendations as motivated in this paper are, in summary, to: 1) use the method to calculate the amount of land use change caused by increased pressure from growing areas per crop in each country; 2) always calculate agricultural emissions using at least an intermediate level of detail with the option to add more detail; 3) use good quality irrigation and crop evapotranspiration data, and at least country specific water scarcity factors; 4) report the environmental footprint results per unit of economic value besides per unit of mass or volume to enable fairer comparisons; 5) and apply economic allocation in all multi-functional agricultural and agri-industrial processes based on realistic prices calculated as multiple year averages...|$|R

In order to make engineering components <b>multi-functional,</b> new <b>processes</b> including post-operations have been developed in the last decade but their influence on corrosion resistance is not yet fully understood. The aim of the present study is to determine the corrosion behaviour of gas nitrocarburised steel produced on both a laboratory and industrial scale. Behaviour has been evaluated by salt spray tests as well as by electrochemical techniques (corrosion potential and polarisation resistance evolutions versus immersion time, potentiodynamic curves). All nitrocarburising treatment improves the corrosion resistance compared to untreated steel. Post-oxidising treatments have no significant influence on corrosion resistance but an impregnation step appears efficient in enhancing corrosion. The carbonitrides present in the white layer are nobler than the substrate, and promote localised corrosion through open porosity of the outlayer by a galvanic effect...|$|R

The reason is thought {{that it has a}} general-purpose power supply system and is able to move by itself. In other words, it could be considered a kind of high-powered robot. As a whole, it consists of several modules. Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a fork grapple and a loader bucket are equipped as a working module. And to carry the objectives quickly to destination, wheeled traveling system is equipped.

40|$|Cytokinesis {{involves}} {{the formation of}} a cleavage furrow, followed by abscission, the cutting of the midbody channel, the final bridge between dividing cells. Recently, the midbody ring became known as central for abscission, but its regulation remains enigmatic. This study identifies BRUCE, a 528 kDa <b>multi-functional</b> protein, which <b>processes</b> ubiquitin-conjugating activity, as a major regulator of abscission. During cytokinesis, BRUCE moves from the vesicular system to the midbody ring and serves as a platform for the membrane delivery machinery and mitotic regulators. Depletion of BRUCE in cell cultures causes defective abscission and cytokinesis-associated apoptosis, accompanied by a block of vesicular targeting and defective formation of the midbody and the midbody ring. Notably, ubiquitin relocalizes from midbody microtubules to the midbody ring during cytokinesis, and depletion of BRUCE disrupts this process. Therefore, BRUCE coordinates multiple steps required for abscission, and ubiquitylation might represent the crucial trigger...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the case study is to {{identify}} the process of optimization in island tourism by using a new conceptual development model of the tourism life cycle as well as island tourism indicators. The study also seeks an explanation as to how can we understand a complex and dynamic tourism system (Faulkner & Russell, 2003; Haywood, 2005) to develop {{more than just a}} sustainable destination, but an optimized tourism destination that satisfies both visitors and the local community. As a matter of fact, even though the concept of sustainability in tourism research has been further developed since changes to the tourism paradigm during the 1980 s, there are still several untouched implications that need to be further developed (Choi & Sirakaya, 2005; Ritchie & Crouch, 2003). Therefore, new practical approaches and different conceptual models of sustainable tourism demand that new optimization approaches be implemented. In order to understand the more sophisticated tourism operating system compared to the era of mass tourism, more systematic and empirical models are needed for conceptual change and theoretical application, rather than the traditional Newtonian research methods. This case study of Kangaroo Island has focused on benchmarking of the TOMM (Tourism Optimisation Management Model (Manidis Roberts Consultants, 1997)) that contains indicators, implication processes, and an application to the MIPC (<b>Multi-functional</b> Interactive <b>Process</b> Cycle (Lim, CCS, 2006)).

40|$|Extrusion cooking, as a multi-step, <b>multi-functional</b> and thermal/mechanical <b>process,</b> has {{permitted}} {{a large number}} of food applications. Effects of extrusion cooking on nutritional quality are ambiguous. Beneficial effects include destruction of antinutritional factors, gelatinisation of starch, increased soluble dietary fibre and reduction of lipid oxidation. On the other hand, Maillard reactions between protein and sugars reduce the nutritional value of the protein, depending on the raw material types, their composition and process conditions. Heat-labile vitamins may be lost to varying extents. Changes in proteins and amino acid profile, carbohydrates, dietary fibre, vitamins, mineral content and some non-nutrient healthful components of food may be either beneficial or deleterious. The present paper reviews the mechanisms underlying these changes, as well as the influence of process variables and feed characteristics. Mild extrusion conditions (high moisture content, low residence time, low temperature) improve the nutritional quality, while high extrusion temperatures (200 Â°C), low moisture contents (< 15 %) and/or improper formulation (e. g. presence of high-reactive sugars) can impair nutritional quality adversely. To obtain a nutritionally balanced extruded product, careful control of process parameters is essential. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{started over}} thirty years ago and with it a manufacturing revolution that moves industrial production into the personal home. With recent interest shifting into multi-functional parts fabricated through AM technologies, unified systems are being developed. Merging different manufacturing technologies into one single machine is a challenge but undergoing research has shown promise {{in the development of}} multi-functional systems. Concurrent work is being done in the software, automation, and hardware aspect of multi-functional systems. An effort to use industry compatible Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to design multi-functional parts including circuits, micro-machining, and foil embedding then exporting and processing automatically to create a hybrid g-code file is being done. The multi-functional g-code files include all the necessary information to create AM multi-functional parts without human intervention in the unified systems. ^ One advantage of AM is the ability to quickly prototype, extending this advantage to multi-functional parts means that quick multi-functional prototypes can be produce. Modern AM process are also capable of producing end use parts that are ready for commercial use, this leads to the possibility of creating end user parts with multi-functionality. This thesis explores the challenges and approaches to developing software that interfaces and <b>processes</b> <b>multi-functional</b> CADs and creates files for direct use in multi-functional AM machines. ...|$|R
40|$|Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) {{are used}} to support the modelling, analysis, and {{enactment}} of business processes. The key benefits WfMSs seek to bring to an organisation include improved efficiency, better process control and improved customer service, which are realised by modelling rigidly structured business processes that in turn derive well-defined workflow process instances. However, the proprietary process definition frameworks imposed by WfMSs {{make it difficult to}} support (i) dynamic evolution and adaptation (i. e. modifying process definitions during execution) following unexpected or developmental change in the business processes being modelled; and (ii) exceptions, or deviations from the prescribed process model at runtime, even though {{it has been shown that}} such deviations are a common occurrence for almost all processes. These limitations imply that a large subset of business processes do not easily translate to the 'system-centric' modelling frameworks imposed. This research re-examines the fundamental theoretical principles that underpin workflow technologies to derive an approach that moves forward from the productionline paradigm and thereby offers workflow management support for a wider range of work environments. It develops a sound theoretical foundation based on Activity Theory to deliver an implementation of an approach for dynamic and extensible flexibility, evolution and exception handling in workflows, based not on proprietary frameworks, but on accepted ideas of how people actually perform their work activities. The approach produces a framework called worklets to provide an extensible repertoire of self-contained selection and exception-handling processes, coupled with an extensible ripple-down rule set. Using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), a selection service provides workflow flexibility and adaptation by allowing the substitution of a task at runtime with a sub-process, dynamically selected from its repertoire depending on the context of the particular work instance. Additionally, an exceptionhandling service uses the same repertoire and rule set framework to provide targeted and <b>multi-functional</b> exception-handling <b>processes,</b> which may be dynamically invoked at the task, case or specification level, depending on the context of the work instance and the type of exception that has occurred. Seven different types of exception can be handled by the service. Both expected and unexpected exceptions are catered for in real time. The work is formalised through a series of Coloured Petri Nets and validated using two exemplary studies: one involving a structured business environment and the other a more creative setting. It has been deployed as a discrete service for the well-known, open-source workflow environment YAWL, and, having a service orientation, its applicability is in no way limited to that environment, but may be regarded as a case study in service-oriented computing whereby dynamic flexibility and exception handling for workflows, orthogonal to the underlying workflow language, is provided. Also, being open-source, it is freely available for use and extension...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial protein toxins {{are genetically}} encoded {{proteinaceous}} macromolecules that upon exposure causes perturbation of cellular metabolism in a susceptible host. A bacterial toxin can {{work at a}} distance from the site of infection, and has direct and quantifiable actions. Bacterial protein toxins can target and interfere with almost any aspect of cellular metabolism. They are among the most potent, per unit weight, of all toxic substances, and are effective even in minute concentrations. The ability to harness those very attributes can turn bacterial protein toxins into invaluable tools. Bacterial protein toxins have been instrumental in exploring host cell biology, and we owe many of our insights into cellular physiology to their use. The application range of a native bacterial toxin as a tool however will eventually be limited by its biology. By combining new possibilities of protein engineering with technological advances, and thus enhancing the tool itself, bacterial protein toxins can be increasingly precisely tailored to address specific questions. The bacterial protein toxin cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is the only known bacterial protein toxin that acts as a DNase in the nucleus. Chapter 2 and Appendix 1 describe the discovery of host proteins that are essential for bringing the enzymatically active CDT subunit CDTB to its target location. With a newly developed haploid genetic screen, we identify for the first time cellular host factors that are essential for intracellular CDT trafficking, and reveal that CDTs from different bacterial species exploit different subsets of the human proteome to achieve intoxication. Chaper 3 comprises the development of CDT as a tool via sortase-mediated trans-peptidation, to further explore CDT biology and the accompanying host cell biology. TMEM 181, not only an essential factor for E. coli CDT intoxication, but a highly conserved yet previously completely uncharacterized cellular protein, is explored in some detail. In addition, we identify GRB 2 as a novel CDT interactor, not uncovered in the haploid genetic screens possibly because of its essential nature for eukaryotic cell survival. In Chapter 4, bacterial protein toxin engineering using sortase is expanded to aerolysin, a model for pore-forming toxins. This is the first description of chemo-enzymatic engineering of aerolysin. This enzymatic means to install labels at precise predefined locations and the generation of single and double-labeled aerolysin monomers enables investigation of the fate of individual N and C-terminal domains, while preserving the functionality of the toxin. Chapter 5 describes the generation of mouse monoclonal antibodies against the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 (AF 647) by microengraving screening. As an accessory tool, it complements the bacterial protein toxin toolkit as it transforms the single purpose AF 647 into a <b>multi-functional</b> <b>handle</b> that can be used not only in fluorescence detection applications, but also in biochemical approaches such as immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Bacterial protein toxins are very precise modifiers of specific host factors, they are exact instruments to dissect basic host cell physiology. Recent advances in molecular engineering allow us now to tweak, calibrate and target those tools better. In a virtuous cycle, this drives knowledge accumulation of both toxin and host cell biology. Moreover, we are now able to tailor bacterial toxins to a variety of biomedical and molecular applications as diverse as immunotoxins, vaccines and next generation sequencing. We can expect many more exciting and surprising insights and biomedical applications to emerge from the field of bacterial protein toxin research...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative bacterium, is the causative {{agent of}} melioidosis, which is endemic in {{tropical}} {{areas such as}} South East Asia and Northern Australia and results in significant mortality. B. pseudomallei is able to invade both non-phagocytic cells and phagocytic cells, escape from the endosome/phagosome and replicate within the cytosol (Wiersinga et al., 2012). Once in the cytosol, B. pseudomallei expresses the protein, BimA, that affords the bacteria actin-based motility allowing them to spread to neighbouring cells, resulting in cell fusion and then ultimately the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) (Stevens et al., 2005 a, Kespichayawattana et al., 2000). The signalling pathways and mechanisms active during bacterial invasion and the host response {{have yet to be}} fully determined. Autophagy is a <b>multi-functional,</b> intracellular <b>process</b> that eukaryotic cells use to maintain intracellular homeostasis. The core autophagy machinery executes several steps that eventually lead to the sequestration of the targeted cellular components within double-membrane autophagosomes which subsequently fuse with lysosomes to degrade the cargo (Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014). Autophagy is often involved in the removal of old or damaged organelles, mis-folded proteins or toxin-conjugating elements (Rogov et al., 2014). Recent research has found that autophagy is associated with the host immune system to act against invading bacteria. Induction of autophagy might directly target bacteria in phagosomes or âfreeâ in the cytosol, or indirectly trigger the innate immune responses, including inflammation, in order to obtain the maximum bactericidal activity (Huang and Brumell, 2014). However, some bacterial pathogens, for example Shigella flexneri and Listeria monocytogenes, have evolved strategies to avoid autophagy or manipulate the autophagic process to facilitate survival. The fate of B. pseudomallei after escaping from phagosomes and its interactions with the host autophagic system are yet to be fully clarified. Cullinane et al. (2008) provided evidence that lack of bacterial BopA, a type III secretion system cluster 3 (T 3 SS- 3) effector, increased the proportion of bacteria co-localised with LC 3. Electron microscopy analysis of infected macrophage cell sections demonstrated that intracellular BopA mutant bacteria are located within single-membrane phagosomes rather than double-membrane autophagosomes, indicating that LC 3 is recruited directly to the phagosomes, and the bacteria are subject to LC 3 -associated phagocytosis (LAP) (Gong et al., 2011). Furthermore, bacteria that have escaped from phagosomes are not then targeted by canonical macroautophagy. BopA shows 23 % homology with IcsB of S. flexneri, which is employed in a particular system that involves competitive binding between bacterial IcsB and the host Atg 5 to the bacterial surface protein IcsA, to avoid autophagy of targeted bacteria (Ogawa and Sasakawa, 2006). Nevertheless, BopA does not act {{in the same way as}} IcsB in S. flexneri (Cullinane et al., 2008). Recent research in the Monash University laboratories has focussed on the identification of potential mechanisms by which host autophagy is avoided by B. pseudomallei following infection and then escape from phagosomes. The research reported in this thesis seeks to address this topic by investigating bacterial proteins encoded by four open reading frames, bpsl 1631, bpss 0180, bpss 1512 (tssM) and bpss 1513 (tssN), each a potential virulence factor associated with the manipulation of the host autophagy system. The basis of the experimental strategy applied here involved the modification of the B. pseudomallei genome by double-crossover allelic exchange, to generate the particular gene knockout mutant strains by which to examine whether the loss of individual encoded proteins altered bacterial invasion and intracellular growth. Further analysis included an assessment of pathogenesis using an in vivo mouse model of acute bacterial infection. The application of confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the bacterial association with cellular proteins (such as ubiquitin or p 62), and particularly LC 3 as an indicator of bacterial phagosome escape and/or autophagy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provided direct ultrastructure observation of bacteria-infected mammalian cells in order to identify the membrane structure surrounding intracellular bacteria. Thus five mutant strains have been generated from the wild-type strain B. pseudomallei K 96243 namely: Îbpsl 1631 (Chapter 3), Îbpss 0180 (Chapter 4), Îbpss 1512 (ÎtssM), Îbpss 1513 (ÎtssN) and Îbpss 1512 - 1513 (ÎtssMN) (Chapter 5). Chapter 3 addresses BPSL 1631, a putative outer membrane protein, which was chosen as an experimental target on the basis of bioinformatics analysis indicating the homology between BPSL 1631 and S. flexneri IcsA is 19 %. However, when the Atg 5 -binding region within IcsA was set as the reference sequence, three regions within BPSL 1631 were found to have 27 % amino acid identity with IcsA. The presence of this sequence homology suggested BPSL 1631 may have the capacity to bind Atg 5. It was therefore of interest to know if B. pseudomallei used BPSL 1631 as part of a mechanism to avoid autophagy and/or LAP. The results obtained from this study indicated that bacteria lacking BPSL 1631 can still escape from phagosomes and replicate in RAW 264. 7 macrophage-like cells. Furthermore, loss of BPSL 1631 did not affect virulence in vivo. Therefore, it is unlikely that this protein plays a role in the avoidance of anti-bacterial autophagy. Chapter 4 focuses on BPSS 0180, a B. pseudomallei protein that was identified by the research group of Dr Patrick Tan (Singapore Genome Institute), as having the potential to induce autophagy in mammalian cells. They observed that overexpression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with BPSS 0180 increased the number of green puncta which co-localised with LC 3 in both non-phagocytic and phagocytic cells (Singh et al., 2010 a). In order to determine whether the induction of autophagy by BPSS 0180 might affect B. pseudomallei pathogenesis, collaboration between the Singapore Genome Institute and Monash University research groups was established. A bpss 0180 -knockout mutant was generated and then used to determine if the potential induction of autophagy by BPSS 0180 is associated with bacterial virulence. Although bacteria lacking BPSS 0180 showed a significant decrease in co-localisation between bacteria and LC 3 puncta compared to wild-type infected cells, bacteria were still able to escape from phagosomes. Intracellular survival was significantly impaired by knockout of bpss 0180, however bacteria were still capable of replicating. Overall the results suggested that B. pseudomallei BPSS 0180 may serve as a virulence factor to induce bulk non-selective autophagy of host components to facilitate the supply of nutrients available for bacterial growth in the host cells, or otherwise aid bacteria in adapting to the host cytosolic environment. Chapter 5 involved investigation of the genes bpss 1512 (tssM) and bpss 1513 (tssN), with three knockout mutants being generated, ÎtssM, ÎtssN and a double-knockout ÎtssMN. Current reports suggest that for several different bacterial pathogens cytosolic âfreeâ bacteria can be ubiquitinated and targeted to autophagy by different autophagy receptors, such as p 62 and NDP 52 (Randow and Youle, 2014). However some bacteria may have evolved a mechanism to avoid ubiquitination, for example by secretion of a deubiquitinase. There is evidence to suggest that B. pseudomallei TssM which contains an ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolyase (UCH) domain, functions as a bacterial deubiquitinase. Secretion of TssM has been demonstrated to interfere with stimulation of the host innate immune response by deubiquitination of essential factors contributing to the downstream inflammatory response, such as TRAF 6, IÎºBÎ± and TRAF 3. (Tan et al., 2010). Therefore it could be hypothesised that B. pseudomallei may also utilise this deubiquitinase to escape from host autophagy by removing ubiquitin from intracellular bacteria that have escaped from phagosomes. The adjacent gene locus bpss 1513 displays 99 % homology to tssN (bmaa 0728) of B. mallei that has been reported to interact with the components of the host ubiquitination pathway, such as ubiquitin precursor (UBB) and ubiquitin ligases (E 3 s). Also, bioinformatics analysis indicated that B. mallei TssN might interact with mammalian proteins having a UCH domain, which then suggests TssN is a possible TssM-binding partner (Memisevic et al., 2013). Loss of TssM and/or TssN did not show a clear effect in altering bacterial survival in host cells, indicating that they are probably not major virulence factors. Bacteria lacking TssM or TssN showed higher co-localisation with either ubiquitin or p 62 at certain time points after infection, hinting that these two proteins might partly function to interfere with ubiquitin recognition of invading bacteria. Triple labelling of bacteria, ubiquitin and p 62 also showed a similar pattern, indicating that p 62 was recruited to ubiquitinated bacteria. However, only a small portion of mutant bacteria were targeted by ubiquitin and p 62 and subsequent LC 3 targeting was rarely seen. Interestingly, TEM observation revealed that mutant bacteria were occasionally found within multi-membrane structures, implying that a low level of xenophagy may be taking place, although the vast majority of intracellular bacteria were not associated with any membrane structure following phagosome escape. It remains unknown how B. pseudomallei avoids host autophagy following escape from phagosomes. The results presented in this thesis suggest that B. pseudomallei does not employ a Shigella-like IcsB autophagy avoidance mechanism. Furthermore the loss of the putative TssM deubiquitinase does not render intracellular bacteria more susceptible to autophagy. Either the bacteria employs other deubiquitinases to avoid ubiquitination by host mechanisms, or the ubiquitination-autophagy pathway is subverted by other, as yet unknown mechanisms. Most interestingly, conventional non-selective autophagy of host components might be induced by the secretion of the bacterial BPSS 0180 in order to supply the nutrients that facilitate bacterial replication and its particular intracellular lifecycle. Research on such ânutrient supplyâ autophagy is still in its infancy, but it may have a contribution to make to a better understanding of the complexities of host-pathogen interactions in the context of selective antibacterial autophagy (xenophagy) ...|$|R
