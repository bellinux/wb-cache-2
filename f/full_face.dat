5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the <b>full</b> <b>face</b> of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket.

His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{calls for a}} public competition, William Wyon's son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen {{interest}} in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the recall of the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at <b>full</b> <b>face</b> value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2014 at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, Devitt's fourteen-month {{reign as}} the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion {{came to an}} end, when he lost the title to Kota Ibushi in his fifth defense. Devitt {{wrestled}} the entire match in a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> and body paint, which he continued using for his bigger matches {{for the rest of}} his NJPW run. The following day, Devitt was attacked by the returning Ryusuke Taguchi, who had been sidelined with an injury for the past seven months, re-igniting the rivalry between the two former partners. On 6 April at Invasion Attack 2014, one year after the break-up of Apollo 55, Devitt faced Taguchi in a singles grudge match. During the match, Devitt repeatedly told The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson), the two newest members of Bullet Club, not to interfere in the match, which eventually led to them turning on him. In the end, Taguchi defeated Devitt, after which the two men shook hands, ending their rivalry with each other. The following day, New Japan announced Devitt's resignation from the promotion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that higher visual areas in the brain encode face viewpoint. The current study aims {{to shed light on}} the nature of this representation. Using a psychophysical adaptation paradigm based on Fang and He (2005), we compared the effects of adapting to <b>full</b> <b>faces,</b> head outline only, and internal features only, while testing with <b>full</b> <b>faces</b> in each case (12 subjects). We found reliable viewpoint aftereffects in all three conditions. The combined magnitude of the aftereffects from the two partial conditions was less than the aftereffect from <b>full</b> <b>faces,</b> suggesting a nonlinear combination of internal features and head outline. In a second experiment, we found that changing the direction of eye gaze did not modulate the viewpoint aftereffect...|$|R

25|$|A <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask {{is lighter}} and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most <b>full</b> <b>face</b> masks are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for <b>full</b> <b>face</b> masks is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask under water without assistance, so this is more an inconvenience than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|E

The Pneumo line can be tucked into the neck dam or under the skirt of a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask, and provided the helmet or mask is not leaking heavily, will supply adequate air for an assisted ascent.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{explored}} perceptual {{factors that}} {{might account for}} the other-race classification advantage (ORCA) in classifying faces by race. Testing Chinese participants in China and Israeli participants in Israel we show that: (a) The distinction between Chinese and Israeli faces is highly accurate even {{on the basis of}} isolated eyes or faces with eyes concealed, but <b>full</b> <b>faces</b> are categorized faster. (b) The ORCA is similarly robust for <b>full</b> <b>faces</b> and for face parts. (c) The ORCA was larger when the configuration of the inner-face components was distorted, reflecting delayed categorization of own-race distorted faces relative to own-race normally configured faces but no conspicuous distortion effect on other-race faces. These data demonstrate that perceptual factors can account for the ORCA independently of social bias. We suggest that one source of the ORCA in race categorization is the configural analysis applied by default while processing own-race but not other-race faces...|$|R

25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers {{are more likely to}} use <b>full</b> <b>face</b> masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|E
