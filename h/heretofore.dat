5|$|The trio {{arrives in}} Buenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cunégonde. Just then, an alcalde (a Spanish {{fortress}} commander) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees to Paraguay with his practical and <b>heretofore</b> unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of the last ten days must satisfy everyone that if freight trains are stopped on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the city of Baltimore is not only deprived of the great commercial advantages which she has <b>heretofore</b> enjoyed, but the entire community is made to feel that all business must be seriously crippled {{and the price of}} all kinds of family supplies greatly increased.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Physicist Richard A. Muller {{postulated}} that the Sun has a <b>heretofore</b> undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud. This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized {{to pass through}} {{a portion of the}} Oort cloud approximately every 26million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis or the Oort cloud have been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown their existence into doubt. Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals. Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January, the Japanese {{military}} {{changed their}} radio communication codes, {{making it more}} difficult for Allied intelligence, which had <b>heretofore</b> partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, Allied reconnaissance and radio traffic analysis noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. Allied analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to divert attention from an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. Allied intelligence personnel, however, misinterpreted the nature of the operation. On 26 January, the Allied Pacific Command's intelligence section informed Allied forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called Ke, in either the Solomons or New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our <b>heretofore</b> poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and very cautious. He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books <b>heretofore</b> ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Wes Gephart, {{though his}} {{personal}} brilliance {{and ability to}} attract investment, was able to cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen {{the end of its}} glory: after 1890, its population, <b>heretofore</b> steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring. The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of ironmaking in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County.|$|E

25|$|Archaic vocabulary: legal writing employs {{many old}} {{words and phrases}} that were {{formerly}} quotidian language, but today exist mostly or only in law, dating from the 16th century; English examples are herein, hereto, hereby, <b>heretofore,</b> herewith, whereby, and wherefore (pronominal adverbs); said and such (as adjectives).|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that consumers use information obtained from advertising {{not only to}} assess the single brand advertised, but also to infer the possible existence of brands that the consumer has, <b>heretofore,</b> not observed, {{as well as to}} infer consumer satisfaction with brands similar to the advertised brand.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that <b>heretofore</b> has not been treated by any other science. It is the biological history of mankind in all its varieties; linguistics applied to people without written languages; the ethnology of people without historic records; and prehistoric archeology.|$|E
25|$|The All-Star Game {{was dealt}} two serious blows in 2005. Not {{only was the}} game {{canceled}} {{along with the rest}} of the season as a result of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, but the subsequent CBA that ended the lockout stipulated that <b>heretofore</b> the game was to be held only in non-Olympic years. Thus, there was no All-Star Game held during the 2005–06 season either.|$|E

The train, which <b>heretofore</b> was due at Bourne at 10.58 a m, is now timed {{so as to}} reach Bourne at 11.20. By this alteration, a letter posted in London {{early in the morning}} may be delivered at Bourne the same day about noon.|$|E
25|$|Because said treaty ignores, {{not only}} the civic rights of my people, but, further, the {{hereditary}} property of their chiefs. Of the 4,000,000 acres composing the territory said treaty offers to annex, 1,000,000 or 915,000 acres has in no way been <b>heretofore</b> recognized as other than the private property of the constitutional monarch, subject to a control in now way differing from other items of a private estate.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} change in the constitutional structures of the British Commonwealth (formerly the British Empire, and {{not to be confused with}} the Commonwealth of Australia) did occur, however, in the late 1920s. Under the British Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, which implemented a decision of an earlier Commonwealth conference, the unified Crown that had <b>heretofore</b> been the centre point of the Empire was replaced by multiple crowns worn by a shared monarch.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{from the}} early {{technical}} literature concerning electrical recording suggests that it wasn't until the 1942–1949 period that there were serious efforts to standardize recording characteristics within an industry. <b>Heretofore,</b> electrical recording technology from company to company was considered a proprietary art {{all the way back}} to the 1925 Western Electric licensed method used by Columbia and Victor. For example, what Brunswick-Balke-Collender (Brunswick Corporation) did was different from the practices of Victor.|$|E
25|$|The CD+G {{format of}} a karaoke disc, which {{contains}} the lyrics on a specially encoded subcode track, has <b>heretofore</b> required special—and expensive—equipment to play. Commercial players {{have come down}} in price, though, and some unexpected devices (including the Sega Saturn video game console and XBMC Media Center on the first Xbox) can decode the graphics; in fact, karaoke machines, including video and sometimes recording capability, are often popular electronics items for sale in toy stores and electronics stores.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{reason to}} believe that the rate on {{shingles}} can be materially advanced without affecting the tonnage, as the present low price of the shingles is brought about wholly by local competition. It was not possible, however, to obtain a higher rate, except by concurrence of the Great Northern, which could not <b>heretofore</b> be obtained, on account of James Jerome Hill persistent effort to reduce the gross and net earnings of our system in order to facilitate his plans.|$|E
25|$|Kidd {{kept the}} French passes of Quedagh Merchant, {{as well as}} the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British {{admiralty}} and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) <b>heretofore</b> had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep Quedagh Merchant and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman Adventure Prize, he set sail for Madagascar.|$|E
25|$|The gatherings {{followed}} a definite ritual. First {{one of the}} members would present a paper. Then, black coffee and cakes were served; cigar and cigarettes were on the table and were consumed in great quantities. After a social quarter of an hour, the discussion would begin. The last and decisive word was always spoken by Freud himself. There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion in that room. Freud himself was its new prophet who made the <b>heretofore</b> prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial.|$|E
25|$|On February 25, 1607, Velasco hijo {{was again}} named viceroy of New Spain, {{this time by}} the new king, Philip III. He took {{possession}} of the government on July 2. Immediately he took up a project to dig the Huehuetoca canal, for flood control. <b>Heretofore</b> during the rainy season, year after year, Mexico City had been flooded. The canal project was {{under the direction of}} Enrico Martínez, an engineer, and Juan Sánchez, a mathematician of the Society of Jesus. Work on the canal commenced on November 28, 1607.|$|E
25|$|Significant new {{construction}} {{did not occur}} until the 1480s, by which time ships mounted guns regularly; the Regent of 1487 had 225 serpentines, an early type of cannon. Henry VII deserves {{a large share of}} credit in the establishment of a standing navy. Although there is no evidence for a conscious change of policy, Henry soon embarked on a program of building ships larger than <b>heretofore.</b> He also invested in dockyards, and commissioned the oldest surviving dry dock in 1495 at Portsmouth, with Sweepstake the first ship built there.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Texas are {{informed}} that, {{in accordance with}} a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection <b>heretofore</b> existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed {{that they will not}} be allowed to collect at military posts and {{that they will not be}} supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The Budd Company {{entered the}} market in 1932, just as EMC exited. <b>Heretofore</b> Budd was {{primarily}} an automotive parts subcontractor but had pioneered working with stainless steel, including the technique of shot welding to join pieces of stainless steel. This permitted the construction of cars which were both lighter and stronger. Budd partnered with Michelin to construct several rubber-tyred stainless steel rail cars powered by gasoline and Diesel engines. These saw service with the Reading Company, Pennsylvania Railroad, and Texas and Pacific Railway. The cars were underpowered, the tires proved prone to blowouts and derailments, and the cars were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational waves {{have two}} {{important}} and unique properties. First, {{there is no}} need for any type of matter to be present nearby in order for the waves to be generated by a binary system of uncharged black holes, which would emit no electromagnetic radiation. Second, gravitational waves can pass through any intervening matter without being scattered significantly. Whereas light from distant stars may be blocked out by interstellar dust, for example, gravitational waves will pass through essentially unimpeded. These two features allow gravitational waves to carry information about astronomical phenomena <b>heretofore</b> never observed by humans, and as such represent a revolution in astrophysics.|$|E
25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been <b>heretofore.</b> The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} rich and fertile, and the farms {{appear to have}} been {{advantageously}} cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, {{a large portion of the}} proprietors having abandoned their homes. On the high road where <b>heretofore</b> was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from week to week, month to month. The countryside was silent. The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds. Travelers walked along bypaths. The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their homes, where possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.|$|E
25|$|The design {{criteria}} were speed of build, improved damage-control and anti-aircraft and torpedo capabilities. The hull design was simplified and {{shorter than the}} Fubukis, partly due {{to a reduction in}} the number of boilers, which itself resulted in a significant reduction in speed. The <b>heretofore</b> standard six 5inch, 50 calibre weapons were replaced by three Type 89 5inch/40 calibre guns which performed better than its predecessor in an AA role. The enclosed turrets were also replaced by a forward single open shield and an aft twin open mounting. This major redesign delivered a significantly smaller ship (1,280 tons). A number of the class were modified to transport kaiten.|$|E

The General Assembly shall provide for the selection of trustees of The University of North Carolina and of the other {{institutions of higher education}}, in whom shall be vested all the privileges, rights, franchises, and endowments <b>heretofore</b> granted to or conferred upon the trustees of these institutions. The General Assembly may enact laws necessary and expedient for the maintenance and management of The University of North Carolina and the other public institutions of higher education.|$|E
25|$|Actor Ed Kemmer {{attended}} many of {{the important}} film festivals during the late 90s and early 2000s and discovered a renewed Space Patrol popularity that continued up until {{the time of his}} death in 2004. The emergence of electronic media during the 1990s permitted a greater interchange of Space Patrol merchandise that <b>heretofore</b> had been closely held by collectors. This stimulated new interest and in turn, production of new publications and merchandise for Space Patrol fans. A rather extensive book written by Jean Noel Bassior furthered interest in the series as did the production of a new set of Space Patrol trading cards, replicas of the program's space craft, clocks, jackets, and other period paraphernalia.|$|E
25|$|Khosrau I further {{extended}} the already vast trade network. The Sasanian state now tended toward monopolistic control of trade, with luxury goods assuming {{a far greater}} role in the trade than <b>heretofore,</b> and the great activity in building of ports, caravanserais, bridges and the like, was linked to trade and urbanization. The Persians dominated international trade, both in the Indian Ocean, Central Asia and South Russia, {{in the time of}} Khosrau, although competition with the Byzantines was at times intense. Sassanian settlements in Oman and Yemen testify to the importance of trade with India, but the silk trade with China was mainly in the hands of Sasanian vassals and the Iranian people, the Sogdians.|$|E
