40|$|Motivation: Expression-based {{analysis}} for large families of genes has recently become possible {{owing to the}} development of cDNA microarrays, which allow simultaneous measurement of transcript levels for thousands of genes. For each spot on a microarray, signals in two channels must be extracted from their backgrounds. This requires algorithms to extract signals arising from tagged mRNA <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrayed</b> cDNA locations and algorithms to determine the significance of signal ratios...|$|R
50|$|The tags {{from each}} probe used for microarray-based {{captured}} region identification should have similar melting temperatures {{as well as}} maximal orthogonal base complexities. These ensure that all tags can be <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> the <b>array</b> under similar conditions and that cross-hybridizations are minimized, respectively.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{reactions}} of carbohydrate- or lipid-derived intermediates with proteins {{lead to the}} formation of Maillard reaction products, which subsequently leads {{to the formation of}} advanced glycation/lipoxidation end products (AGE/ALEs). Levels of AGE/ALEs are increased in diseases like diabetes. Unlike AGEs, very little is known about ALE effects in vitro. We hypothesized that ALEs can have proinflammatory effects in monocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—In a profiling approach, conditioned media from THP- 1 cells either cultured in normal glucose (5. 5 mmol/l) or treated with MDA-Lys or MDA alone were <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays</b> containing antibodies <b>to</b> 120 known human cytokines/chemokines.

40|$|We report {{here that}} microarrays {{comprised}} {{of several thousand}} peptoids (oligo-N-substituted glycines) are useful tools for the identification of proteins via a “fingerprinting” approach.

40|$|A {{strategy}} using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and Affymetrix Soybean GeneChip microarrays {{was employed}} to identify genetic markers {{closely linked to the}} soybean aphid [Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) ] resistance gene in soybean [(L.) Merr. ]. Genomic DNA from the aphid-resistant cultivar Dowling and the aphid-susceptible cultivar Dwight was labeled and <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays,</b> identifying more than 1500 putative single feature polymorphisms (SFPs) between these genotypes. To find polymorphisms closely linked to the aphid-resistance locus, genomic DNA samples from two NILs developed through backcrossing from Dowling four times to Dwight were also hybridized. Comparison of hybridization signals between the NILs and the recurrent parent identified more than 70 SFPs in each NIL between the NIL and the recurrent parent genotype. There were 22 SFPs shared by both NILs, representing molecular markers putatively linked to. Four selected SFPs were converted to SNP markers and confirmed by conventional genetic mapping to be closely linked to. The technique that we describe can be used to identify polymorphisms in a genetic region of interest and generate molecular markers closely linked to an agronomically important trait using a suitable oligonucleotide microarray...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that {{suppress}} {{gene expression}} at the posttranscriptional level via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction. miRNAs used for array-based profiling are generally purified from either snap-frozen or fresh samples. Because tissues {{found in most}} pathology departments are available only in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) states, we sought to evaluate miRNA derived from FFPE samples for microarray analysis. In this study, miRNAs extracted from matched snap-frozen and FFPE samples were profiled using the Agilent miRNA array platform (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Each miRNA sample was <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays</b> containing probes interrogating 470 human miRNAs. Seven cases were compared in either duplicate or triplicate. Intrachip and interchip analyses demonstrated that the processes of miRNA extraction, labeling, and hybridization from both frozen and FFPE samples are highly reproducible and add little variation to the results; technical replicates showed high correlations with one another (Kendall tau, 0. 722 to 0. 853; Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0. 891 to 0. 954). Our results showed consistent high correlations between matched frozen and FFPE samples (Kendall tau, 0. 669 to 0. 815; Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0. 847 to 0. 948), supporting the use of FFPE-derived miRNAs for array-based, gene expression profiling...|$|R
40|$|As new {{technologies}} come within {{reach for the}} average cytogenetic laboratory, the study of chromosome structure has become increasingly more sophisticated. Resolution has improved from karyotyping (in which whole chromosomes are discernible) to {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH, with which specific megabase regions are visualized), array-based CGH (aCGH, examining hundreds of base pairs), and next-generation sequencing (providing single base pair resolution). Whole genome next-generation sequencing remains a cost-prohibitive method for many investigators. Meanwhile, the cost of aCGH has been reduced during recent years, even as resolution has increased and protocols have simplified. However, aCGH presents its own set of unique challenges. DNA of sufficient quantity and quality <b>to</b> <b>hybridize</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays</b> and provide meaningful results is required. This is especially difficult for DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Here, we compare three different methods for acquiring DNA of sufficient length, purity, and “amplifiability” for aCGH and other downstream applications. Phenol–chloroform extraction and column-based commercial kits were compared with adaptive focused acoustics (AFA). Of the three extraction methods, AFA samples showed increased amplicon length and decreased polymerase chain reaction (PCR) failure rate. These findings support AFA as an improvement over previous DNA extraction methods for FFPE tissues...|$|R

50|$|Several {{different}} methods exist for tiling an array. One protocol for analyzing gene expression involves first isolating total RNA. This is then purified of rRNA molecules. The RNA is copied into double stranded DNA, which is subsequently amplified and in vitro transcribed to cRNA.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, stable, noncoding RNAs {{involved}} in {{post-transcriptional gene silencing}} via hybridization to mRNA. Few have been thoroughly characterized in any species.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{most widely}} used {{amplification}} method for microarray analysis of gene expression uses T 7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription (IVT) to produce complementary RNA (cRNA) that can be <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays.</b> However, multiple rounds of amplification are required when assaying very small amounts of starting RNA. Moreover, certain cRNA-DNA mismatches are more stable than the analogous cDNA-DNA mismatches and this might increase non-specific hybridization. We sought {{to determine whether a}} recently developed linear isothermal amplification method (ribo-SPIA) that produces single stranded cDNA would offer advantages over traditional IVT-based methods for microarray-based analyses of transcript expression. Results A single round of ribo-SPIA amplification produced sufficient sscDNA for hybridizations when as little as 5 ng of starting total RNA was used. Comparisons of probe set signal intensities obtained from replicate amplifications showed consistently high correlations (r = 0. 99). We compared gene expression in two different human RNA samples using ribo-SPIA. Compared with one round IVT, ribo-SPIA had a larger dynamic range and correlated better with quantitative PCR results even though we used 1000 -fold less starting RNA. The improved dynamic range was associated with decreases in hybridization to mismatch control probes. Conclusion The use of amplified sscDNA may offer substantial advantages over IVT-based amplification methods, especially when very limited amounts of starting RNA are available. The use of sscDNA targets instead of cRNA targets appears to improve hybridization specificity. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{invertebrates}} and amphibians, informational macromolecules in egg cytoplasm {{are organized}} to provide direction {{to the formation}} of embryonic lineages, but it is unclear whether vestiges of such prepatterning exist in mammals. Here we examined whether twin blastomeres from 2 -cell stage mouse embryos differ in mRNA content. mRNA from 26 blastomeres derived from 13 embryos approximately mid-way through their second cell cycle was subjected to amplification. Twenty amplified samples were <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays.</b> Of those samples that hybridized successfully, 12 samples in six pairs were used in the final analysis. Probes displaying normalized values > 0. 25 (n = 4573) were examined for consistent bias in expression within blastomere pairs. Although transcript content varied between both individual embryos and twin blastomeres, no consistent asymmetries were observed for the majority of genes, with only 178 genes displaying a > 1. 4 -fold difference in expression across all six pairs. Although class discovery clustering showed that blastomere pairs separated into two distinct groups in terms of their differentially expressed genes, when the data were tested for significance of asymmetrical expression, only 39 genes with > 1. 4 -fold change ratios in six of six blastomere pairs passed the two-sample t-test (P < 0. 05). Transcripts encoding proteins implicated in RNA processing and cytoskeletal organization were among the most abundant, differentially distributed mRNA, suggesting that a stochastically based lack of synchrony in cell cycle progression between the two cells might explain at least some and possibly all of the asymmetries in transcript composition...|$|R

Such a genome-wide analysis became possible because of the recently designed GeneChip of sugarcane [6]. This array was specifically developed with sequences that were obtained from several cDNA libraries representing distinct tissue types including stem from 15 sugarcane varieties. The use of this GeneChip permitted us to directly compare gene expression data of two different sorghum cultivars with the previously generated data from sugarcane. Three independent plants for each BTx 623 and Rio were grown until anthesis and RNA was extracted from the same maturing internode for all six plants.

To {{test the}} {{feasibility}} of using short oligonucleotide probes to monitor transcript levels in Plasmodium falciparum, a microarray was manufactured containing 4, 167 (25 base single-stranded) probes derived from the predicted coding region of P. falciparum chromosome 2.

Multiplex PCR with vvh and viuB for Vibrio vulnificus, with ompU, toxR, tcpI, and hlyA for V. cholerae, and with tlh, tdh, trh, and open reading frame 8 for V. parahaemolyticus helped to ensure that total and pathogenic strains, including subtypes of the three Vibrio spp., could be detected and discriminated. For DNA microarrays, oligonucleotide probes for these targeted genes were deposited onto epoxysilane-derivatized, 12 -well, Teflon-masked slides by using a MicroGrid II arrayer. Amplified PCR products were <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrays</b> at 50 °C and detected by using tyramide signal amplification with Alexa Fluor 546 fluorescent dye. Slides were imaged by using an arrayWoRx scanner. The detection sensitivity for pure cultures without enrichment was 102 to 103 CFU/ml, and the specificity was 100 %. However, 5 h of sample enrichment followed by DNA extraction with Instagene matrix and multiplex PCR with microarray hybridization resulted in the detection of 1 CFU in 1 g of oyster tissue homogenate. Thus, enrichment of the bacterial pathogens permitted higher sensitivity in compliance with the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference guideline. Application of the DNA microarray methodology to natural oysters revealed the presence of V. vulnificus (100 %) and V. parahaemolyticus (83 %). However, V. cholerae was not detected in natural oysters.

Those regions which when inherited from a single parent result in a discernible phenotype contain imprinted gene(s). Further research showed that within these regions there were often numerous imprinted genes. Around 80% of imprinted genes are found in clusters such as these, called imprinted domains, suggesting a level of co-ordinated control.

The method involves hybridization of the unknown STR target sequence to a DNA microarray displaying complementary probes that vary in length to cover the range of possible STRs. A post-hybridization enzymatic digestion of the DNA hybrids is then used to selectively remove labeled single-stranded regions of DNA from the microarray surface. The number of repeats in the unknown target is then deduced based on the pattern of target DNA that remains <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> the <b>array.</b> This DNA profiling technique is useful for performing forensic analysis to uniquely identify individual humans or other species...|$|R

30|$|The {{first step}} {{consists}} {{in reducing the}} space bias effect for each hybridization. Space biases are due mainly to poor washing after hybridization, or a misallocation of signal, manifested by a gradient of intensity. These biases were corrected with the script SpatialSmooth of NMPP software (NimbleGen Microarray Data Processing Pipeline - NMPP) (Wang et al. 2006) through a global distance-weighted smoothing algorithm. After the spatial smooth, quantile normalization adjusts values in a microarray experiment to improve consistency and reduce technical biases and variations between hybridizations. Normalization between hybridizations was performed with the QuantileNorm script of NMPP software (Wang et al. 2006). Quantile normalizations force the arrays {{of a set of}} experiments to have absolutely identical distribution.

40|$|Influenza A viruses, {{which are}} further subtyped {{on the basis}} of {{antigenic}} differences in external hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins, and influenza B viruses are prominent among the viral causes of respiratory diseases and can cause a wide spectrum of illness. Each year these viruses are responsible for recurrent epidemics, frequently in association with genetic variation. There is a requirement for sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques in order to improve both the diagnosis of infections and the quality of surveillance systems. A new three-dimensional biochip platform (Flow-Thru Chip; MetriGenix) was used to develop a rapid and reliable molecular method for the typing and subtyping of influenza viruses. Oligonucleotide probes immobilized in microchannels of a silicon wafer were selected to recognize multiple fragments of the influenza A virus matrix protein gene; the influenza B virus NS gene; the H 1, H 3, and H 5 hemagglutinin genes; and the N 1 and N 2 neuraminidase genes. Biotinylated amplicons resulting from either multiplex or random reverse transcription-PCR were <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrayed</b> oligonucleotides on the influenza virus chip before they were stained with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and were imaged by use of a chemiluminescent substrate. The chip analysis procedure, from the time of pipetting of the sample into the chip cartridge to the time of analysis of the results, was performed in less than 5 h. The random PCR exhibited a higher level of performance than the multiplex PCR in terms of the specificity of product hybridization to the influenza virus chip. Analysis of influenza A viruses (H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, H 1 N 2, and H 5 N 1) and influenza B viruses showed that this microarray-based method is capable of the rapid and unambiguous identification of all types and subtypes of viruses by use of random PCR products.

Purified genomic DNA from combinations of one or more of the four target organisms, pure cultures of four related organisms, and environmental aerosol samples with spiked-in genomic DNA were <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> the <b>arrays.</b> Based on the success of this prototype, we plan <b>to</b> design further <b>arrays</b> in this series, with the goal of detecting all known virulence and antibiotic resistance gene families in a greatly expanded set of organisms...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{high density}} DNA <b>arrays</b> <b>to</b> monitor gene {{expression}} at a genome-wide scale constitutes a fundamental advance in biology. In particular, the expression pattern of all genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be interrogated using microarray analysis where cDNAs are <b>hybridized</b> <b>to</b> an <b>array</b> {{of more than}} 6, 000 genes in the yeast genome. In an effort to build a comprehensive Yeast Promoter Database and to develop new computational methods for mapping upstream regulatory elements, we started recently in an on going collaboration with experimental biologists on analysis of large-scale expression data. It is well-known that complex gene expression patterns result from dynamic interacting networks of genes in the genetic regulatory circuitry. Hierarchical and modular organization of regulatory DNA sequence elements are important information for our understanding of combinatorial control of gene expression. As a bioinformatics attempt in this new direction, we have done some computational exploration of various initial experimental data. We will use cell-cycle regulated gene expression as a specific example to demonstrate how one may extract promoter information computationally from such genome-wide screening. Full report of the experiments and of the complete analysis will be published elsewhere when all the experiments are to be finished later in this year (Spellman et al.). ...|$|R
