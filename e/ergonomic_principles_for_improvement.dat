40|$|Abstract. Repetitive stress injury at {{the wrist}} has been {{reported}} as a common injury among visual display terminal (VDT) users (i. e., computer users). Adjusting a VDT workstation (computer table and chair) to maintain a correct seated posture while operating a keyboard {{is perhaps the most}} frequently recommended preventive solution. This paper proposes an analytical design methodology based on <b>ergonomic</b> design <b>principles</b> <b>for</b> recommending appropriate VDT workstation settings and layout of individual computer accessories on the computer table. The proposed design methodology consists of two interrelated phases: (1) determination of VDT workstation settings, and (2) design of computer accessories layout. Based on the information about the VDT user, dominant task to be performed, typing skill, and degrees of physical and visual interactions between the user and computer accessories, adjustment and layout solutions are recommended to allow having a correct seated posture while minimizing both physical and visual movements. The results from an experiment show that when adjusting the workstation and locating the computer accessories according to the recommendations given by the proposed design methodology, the user’s hand movements can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: With {{increasing}} use {{of computers}} by young adults in educational institutions {{as well as at}} home {{there is a need to}} investigate whether students are adopting <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles</b> when using computers. Objective: To assess the practice of students on <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles</b> while working on computers and their association with the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students using pre-tested structured questionnaire on the demographic profile, practice of <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles</b> and symptoms of CVS experienced while on continuous computer work within the past one month duration. Results: Out of 416 students studied, 50 % of them viewed computer at a distance of 20 to 28 inches, 61 % viewed the computer screen at the same level, 42. 8 % placed the reference material between monitor and key board, 24. 5 % tilted screen backward, 75. 7 % took frequent breaks and 56. 0 % blinked frequently to prevent CVS. Students who viewed the computer at a distance of less than 20 inches, viewed upwards or downwards to see the computer, who did not avoid glare and did not took frequent breaks were at higher risk of developing CVS. Students who did not used adjustable chair, height adjustable keyboard and anti-glare screen were at higher risk of developing CVS.

40|$|Engineers {{have a duty}} of care to the {{end users}} of the systems they design under current {{statutes}} and at common law. Considerations such as cognitive compatibility and usability of equipment and system design are becoming issues of increasing importance, as society becomes more reliant on information technology and automation. That engineers contribute to human error in these systems through latent design error and poor management decision-making is well documented. Therefore, the role of engineers can be considered integral to positive outcomes in workplace safety. This research offers an opportunity to understand why engineering design work may be contributing to human error on part of the operator, and offers hope toward a future when engineers will embrace safe design principles. This cross sectional study examines the relationship between professional engineering education and ergonomics. This research specifically addresses the attitudes of engineers to the inclusion of <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles</b> in engineering practice and in undergraduate engineering curriculum.

The aim {{of this research was}} to understand whether <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles</b> and methods are included in the design process, whether users are involved in this process and whether the experience of the designer (in ergonomics/user involvement) has an effect on the end product usability.

Previous research has established that comprehension can be improved if signs are designed to adhere to <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles.</b> However, it may be difficult for sign designers to incorporate all the principles into a single sign and may thus have to make a judgement as to the most effective ones. This study surveyed drivers in three countries to ascertain their understanding of a range of road signs, each of which conformed in varying degrees and combinations to the <b>ergonomic</b> <b>principles.</b> We found that using three of the principles was the most effective and that the most important one was that relating to standardisation; the colours and shapes used were key to comprehension. Other concepts which related to physical and spatial characteristics were less important, whilst conceptual compatibility did not aid comprehension at all.

Road traffic quality can be quantitatively evaluated in accordance with values of losses pertaining to social and economic cost of discretionary (unenforced) expenses for road traffic process. Road traffic contains accident, ecological, economic and social risks. Accidence is considered {{as the most important}} risk for participants involved in road traffic because it directly concerns their life, health and welfare.

Methodological <b>principles</b> <b>for</b> <b>improvement</b> of road traffic quality have been developed in the paper.
