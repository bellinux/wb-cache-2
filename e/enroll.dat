40|$|This study compares drug use, injecting {{and sexual}} {{risk-taking}} behaviour among pregnant injecting drug users (IDUs) <b>enrolled</b> in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), non-pregnant women IDUs <b>enrolled</b> in MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> in treatment. There {{was no significant}} difference between pregnant IDUs <b>enrolled</b> in MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> in treatment in terms of their injecting risk-taking behaviour. Both groups reported significantly higher levels of injecting risk-taking behaviour compared to (non-pregnant) women <b>enrolled</b> in MMT. Pregnant women <b>enrolled</b> in MMT reported a significantly lower methadone dose compared to non-pregnant women in MMT. There was a trend for pregnant women <b>enrolled</b> in MMT to report a higher level of heroin use compared to non-pregnant women in MMT. The lack of evidence for a difference in level of injecting risk-taking behaviour between pregnant IDUs <b>enrolled</b> in MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> in treatment suggests the need for additional strategies among pregnant IDUs to reduce IDU and injecting risk-taking behaviour. Possible strategies include maintenance on higher doses of methadone and the application of relapse prevention strategies...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to <b>enroll,</b> and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students could choose to <b>enroll</b> in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A {{continuing}} {{shift of}} healthcare delivery from hospital {{to the community}} has increased the acuity and complexity of care provided in the home. Global financial crises and nursing shortages have prompted policies supporting two tiers of nursing and expansion of the licensed practical nurse, second level or <b>enrolled</b> nurse role and evoked debate surrounding roles traditionally undertaken by registered nurses. Community nursing offers unique challenges for <b>enrolled</b> nurses wanting to enact their full scope of practice. Aim To compare and describe registered and <b>enrolled</b> nurse opinions of their current and potential <b>enrolled</b> nurse scope of practice in the community health setting. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 136 nurses (115 registered and 21 <b>enrolled</b> nurses) was undertaken within a large community nursing team in Australia. Participants reported their opinions of <b>enrolled</b> nurse scope of practice based on 27 core community nursing skills. Results Although substantial agreement was evident, there were {{statistically significant differences between}} registered nurse and <b>enrolled</b> nurse opinions in core skill areas; â€˜Patient Educationâ€™ and â€˜Clinical Observationâ€™. Registered nurses identified some specialized skillsâ€”catheter and gastrostomy careâ€”that could be undertaken by <b>enrolled</b> nurses with further education. Conclusion We confirm that registered nurses do agree with extending the skills of <b>enrolled</b> nurses. Education approaches that build shared confidence in <b>enrolled</b> nurse advanced skills are recommended...|$|R
