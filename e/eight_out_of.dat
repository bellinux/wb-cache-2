5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although <b>eight</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|The HSBC Arena has {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 18,690, {{but it was}} reduced for The Great American Bash.

5|$|The {{results of}} the Thai Baan {{research}} were supported by several academics, including Niti Pawakapan of Chulalongkorn University. The Ubon Ratchathani University study also recommended keeping the sluice gates open {{for at least five}} years. However, the Thai government rejected all of the studies for unclear reasons and instead conducted a three-day opinion poll of a random sample of Thais, after which it decided that the gates would stay closed for <b>eight</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> twelve months of the year. In 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont decided to close the gates permanently, citing an alleged secret agreement between thousands of villagers and the Internal Security Operations Command.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With <b>eight</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to come back from a 3–0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
