Gumperz built on Hymes's work by looking at differential power between speech communities. In particular, Gumperz noted that the [...] "standard" [...] form of any given language (i.e., the form that is expected in formal situations, the form that one hears on the news) is the dialect {{of those who are}} already powerful. He called this the [...] "prestige dialect," [...] and noted that those who did not speak that dialect natively, but rather had a stigmatized or less powerful native dialect, were [...] "diglossic" [...] (fluent in their native dialects and able to use the prestige dialect, too), whereas those whose native dialect was the prestige dialect were rarely able to use other codes.Gumperz defines the speech community as [...] "any human aggregate characterized by regular and frequent <b>interaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a shared body of verbal signs and set off from similar aggregates by significant differences in language usage." ...|$|E
