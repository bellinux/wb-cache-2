500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E

The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E

2500|$|B.Rozental, {{analyzing}} Merezhkovsky's {{political and}} religious philosophy, thus summed up the writer's position: [...] "The Law amounts to violence... The difference between legitimate power that holds violence 'in reserve' and violence itself is but a matter of degree: sinful are both.

[...] Interpreting the Biblical version of the human history as a sequence of revolutionary events, Merezhkovsky saw religion and revolution as inseparable. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> for a social revolution to succeed, spiritual revolution should always come one step ahead of it. In Russia the lack of the latter brought about the former's fiasco, with Antichrist taking hold of things, he argued.|$|E
2500|$|This [...] "naked self-interest" [...] {{seems to}} {{contradict}} the idea of [...] "masking" [...] in bourgeois society.

2500|$|Wilson {{has said}} in {{reference}} to ants [...] "Karl Marx was right, socialism works, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> he had the wrong species". He meant that while ants and other eusocial species appear to live in communist-like societies, they only {{do so because they}} are forced to do so from their basic biology, as they lack reproductive independence: worker ants, being sterile, need their ant-queen in order to survive as a colony and a species, and individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen and are thus forced to live in centralised societies. Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a [...] "queen", and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only when they look after themselves and their offspring, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last step}} is that {{effectively}} capitalist market society develops {{human beings in}} an inverted way. The capitalist economy is not primarily organized for the people, but people are organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there {{is more and more}} external pressure forcing people to act in all kinds of different roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and semiotic flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the [...] "economic formation of society" [...] at the same time, even if in this society people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.|$|E
