5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or <b>epicarp),</b> which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
25|$|The outer, often edible layer, is the pericarp, {{formed from}} the ovary and {{surrounding}} the seeds, although in some species other tissues contribute to or form the edible portion. The pericarp may {{be described in}} three layers from outer to inner, the <b>epicarp,</b> mesocarp and endocarp.|$|E
25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called <b>epicarp),</b> mesocarp (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms.|$|E

40|$|Pistachio fruit components, {{including}} hulls (mesocarps and <b>epicarps),</b> seed coats (testas), and kernels (seeds), all {{contribute to}} variable aflatoxin content in pistachios. Fresh pistachio kernels were individually inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and incubated 7 or 10 days. Hulled, shelled kernels were either left intact or wounded prior to inoculation. Wounded kernels, {{with or without the}} seed coat, were readily colonized by A. flavus and after 10 days of incubation contained 37 times more aflatoxin than similarly treated unwounded kernels. The aflatoxin levels in the individual wounded pistachios were highly variable. Neither fungal colonization nor aflatoxin was detected in intact kernels without seed coats. Intact kernels with seed coats had limited fungal colonization and low aflatoxin concentrations compared with their wounded counterparts. Despite substantial fungal colonization of wounded hulls, aflatoxin was not detected in hulls. Aflatoxin levels were significantly lower in wounded kernels with hulls than in kernels of hulled pistachios. Both the seed coat and a water-soluble extract of hulls suppressed aflatoxin production by A. flavus...|$|R
500|$|There {{are also}} {{noticeable}} differences in dental morphology and tooth topography between lemurs. Indri, for instance, have teeth that are perfectly adapted for shearing leaves and crushing seeds. In the toothcomb of most lemurs, the bottom incisors and canine teeth are procumbent (face forward rather than up) and finely spaced, thus providing {{a tool for}} either grooming or feeding. For instance, indri use their toothcomb not only for grooming, but also to pry out the large seeds from the tough <b>epicarp</b> of Beilschmiedia fruits, while fork-marked lemurs use their relatively long toothcomb to cut through tree bark to induce the flow of tree sap. The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or [...] "under-tongue", a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below {{the tip of the}} tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Gaertner {{published}} a two-volume work, De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum (on the fruits and seeds of plants) between 1788 and 1792. In addition to Linnaeus' eight terms, he introduced seven more, including [...] for the berry-like fruits of cucurbits. A pepo was distinguished {{by being a}} fleshy berry with the seeds distant from the axis, and so nearer the fruit wall (i.e. by having [...] "parietal placentation" [...] in modern terminology). Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1813 used the terms [...] and [...] as further subdivisions of berries. A hesperidium, called by others [...] (berry with a cortex), had separate internal compartments ("" [...] in the original French) and a separable membraneous <b>epicarp</b> or skin.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{process of}} cystic fibrosis (CF) {{is characterized by}} production and release of cytokines and chemokines, among which interleukin 8 (IL- 8) represent {{one of the most}} important. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in developing therapies against CF {{in order to reduce the}} excessive inflammatory response in the airways of CF patients. In this respect, extracts from medicinal plants have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in several reports. In this study we report that extracts obtained from bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) <b>epicarps</b> contain two components (citropten and bergapten) displaying an strong inhibitory activity on IL- 8 expression. These effects have been confirmed both at the mRNA levels and the protein release in the CF cellular model IB 3 - 1 induced with TNF-alpha, using RT-PCR and Bio-plex technology respectively. These results indicate that bergapten and citropten could be proposed as potential anti-inflammatory molecules to reduce lung inflammation in CF patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} coating papaya fruit (Carica papaya) with cassava starch were studied, to {{determine}} the best concentration and mode of action of this material in postharvest control of anthracnose. The concentrations of starch tested were 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 %. These were prepared to give gel consistency. Surface sterilized papaya fruits were inoculated with conidia of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and incubated for 48 h in a moisture chamber. The were then treated with cassava fruit gels and dried. During the following 14 d storage period, fruit maturation and anthracnose on the fruits were assessed, and electron microscopy was used to examine fruit <b>epicarps.</b> All cassava starch coating concentrations reduced fruit maturation and anthracnose, with the 2 %, 3 % or 4 % coatings giving 100 % disease control. The 2 % starch coating is likely to be optimum, considering the lower cost efficiency of disease control. The mechanism of disease control provided by the coating is likely to be related to delay of ripening and the formation of a protective layer over the fruit. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Epicarps</b> of Citrus bergamia fruits from {{organic farming}} were {{extracted}} with the object to obtain derived products differently rich in coumarins and psoralens. The extracts were chemically characterized by 1 H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), GC-FID (gas chromatography-flame ionization detector), GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) for detecting and quantifying the main constituents. Both bergamot extracts and chemical standards {{corresponding to the}} main constituents detected were then assayed for their capacity to increase erythroid differentiation of K 562 cells and expression of gamma-globin genes in human erythroid precursor cells. Three experimental cell systems were employed: (a) the human leukemic K 562 cell line, (b) K 562 cell clones stably transfected with a pCCL construct carrying green-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) under the gamma-globin gene promoter and (c) the two-phase liquid culture of human erythroid progenitors isolated from healthy donors. The results suggest that citropten and bergapten are powerful inducers of differentiation and gamma-globin gene expression in human erythroid cells. These data could have practical relevance, since pharmacologically-mediated regulation of human gamma-globin gene expression, with the consequent induction of fetal hemoglobin, is considered a potential therapeutic approach in hematological disorders, including beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia...|$|R

40|$|Subfunctionalization is {{the process}} by which a pair of {{duplicated}} genes, or paralogs, experiences a reduction of individual expression patterns or function while still reproducing the complete expression pattern and function of the ancestral gene. Two germin-like protein (GLP) -encoding genes, GerB and GerF, are paralogs that belong to a small gene family in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Both genes share high nucleotide sequence similarity in coding and noncoding regions and encode identical apoplastic proteins. The use of RNA gel blots, coupled with single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of RT–PCR products, elucidated the developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns of each gene. Individual expression patterns provided evidence of both overlapping redundancy and early subfunctionalization. GerB is predominantly expressed in developing shoots, while GerF is predominantly expressed in seedling roots, developing spikes, and pericarp/testa. GerF promoter deletion studies located a region (− 356 /− 97) responsible for high promoter activity and showed the ability of GerB and GerF upstream regions to drive gfp expression in coleoptiles, <b>epicarps,</b> and lemma/palea of developing spikes. The observed expression patterns are consistent with proposed roles in plant development and defense mechanisms for this gene family. These roles may explain why redundancy has been selectively maintained in this duplicate gene pair...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Fruits from 86 {{ecotypes}} of Mexican plum were {{harvested from}} the states of Guerrero and Morelos during the dry season. Of these, 22 were wild ecotypes and 64 were cultivated varieties. Among the variables measured, those with the highest variation coefficients were color, flavor, and mass (> 45 %), highlighting the presence of considerable intra-species variability. Cluster analysis separated the 86 accessions into 5 groups, mainly {{on the basis of}} color, flavor, length, and mass. Members from the first three groups had red (Group I), yellow (Group II), or purple (Group III) <b>epicarps</b> and higher values of mass (12. 2 - 16 g), length (29. 6 - 33. 9 mm), pulp yield (68. 8 - 71. 9 %), TSS (11. 16 - 11. 52 °Brix) and flavor index (14. 5 - 18. 3), making them suitable for horticultural use and fresh consumption. The wild ecotypes clustered in the remaining two groups and consisted of small (23. 2 - 27. 7 mm, 5. 5 - 8. 2 g) red drupes of differing hues. The cherry-red color of the fruits from Group IV suggests possible antioxidant properties due to the presence of polyphenolic pigments which could be of interest to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Finally, fruits from Group V, being the most acidic (pH 2. 7, 2. 1 % acidity), might be better suited for the preparation of pickled products and sauces...|$|R

5000|$|The carpels of a pome are fused {{within the}} [...] "core". Although the <b>epicarp,</b> mesocarp, and {{endocarp}} {{of some other}} fruit types look {{very much like the}} skin, flesh, and core respectively of a pome, they are parts of the carpel (see diagram). The <b>epicarp</b> and mesocarp of a pome may be fleshy and difficult to distinguish from one another and from the hypanthial tissue. The endocarp forms a leathery or stony case around the seed, and corresponds to what is commonly called the core. Pome-type fruit with stony rather than leathery endocarp may be called a polypyrenous drupe. The shriveled remains of the sepals, style and stamens can sometimes be seen {{at the end of a}} pome opposite the stem, and the ovary is therefore often described as inferior in these flowers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) airway pathology is a fatal, autosomal, recessive {{genetic disease}} characterized by extensive lung inflammation. After induction by TNF-α, elevated concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (i. e. IL- 6, IL- 1 β) and chemokines (i. e. IL- 8) are released from airway epithelial cells. In {{order to reduce the}} excessive inflammatory response in the airways of CF patients, new therapies have been developed and in this respect, medicinal plant extracts have been studied. In this article we have investigated the possible use of bergamot extracts (Citrus bergamia Risso) and their identified components to alter the expression of IL- 8 associated with the cystic fibrosis airway pathology. Methods The extracts were chemically characterized by 1 H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), GC-FID (gas chromatography-flame ionization detector), GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography). Both bergamot extracts and main detected chemical constituents were assayed for their biological activity measuring (a) cytokines and chemokines in culture supernatants released from cystic fibrosis IB 3 - 1 cells treated with TNF-α by Bio-Plex cytokine assay; (b) accumulation of IL- 8 mRNA by real-time PCR. Results The extracts obtained from bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) <b>epicarps</b> contain components displaying an inhibitory activity on IL- 8. Particularly, the most active molecules were bergapten and citropten. These effects have been confirmed by analyzing mRNA levels and protein release in the CF cellular models IB 3 - 1 and CuFi- 1 induced with TNF-α or exposed to heat-inactivated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusions These obtained results clearly indicate that bergapten and citropten are strong inhibitors of IL- 8 expression and could be proposed for further studies to verify possible anti-inflammatory properties to reduce lung inflammation in CF patients. </p...|$|R
