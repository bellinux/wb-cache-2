5|$|A Cal Fire {{investigation}} {{pointed to}} <b>faulty</b> wiring {{of a hot}} tub installation {{as the cause of}} the fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia. One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis, which attributes psychosis to the mind's <b>faulty</b> interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} thirty-three {{in-flight}} anomalies were eventually reported. As {{well as the}} issues above, STS-8's more minor problems ranged from <b>faulty</b> thermostats to an unusually high amount of dust in the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{initially}} reported that Ardeshir Hosseinpour died of gas poisoning from a <b>faulty</b> heater, later reports indicated foul play. According to Stratfor, Hosseinpour died of radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Cutaneous {{congenital}} anomalies are {{a diverse}} group of disorders that result from <b>faulty</b> morphogenesis, the biological process that forms the shape of a human body.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{some early}} adopters, the 808 was a {{commercial}} failure {{and fewer than}} 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made the <b>faulty</b> transistors that were essential to its design impossible to restock.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, Apple {{admitted}} that some iPhone 6 Plus may have <b>faulty</b> cameras {{that could be}} causing photos to look blurry and initiated a replacement program.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{all three}} {{escalators}} in Entrance 1 were damaged by sprinklers activated by <b>faulty</b> sensors, causing the entire entrance to be shuttered indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} cell types {{usually have a}} single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from <b>faulty</b> cell division.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 2015, Apple {{instituted a}} repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models {{released}} between September 2014 and January 2015, citing that <b>faulty</b> rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{may also}} occur {{following}} {{the use of}} a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) due to <b>faulty</b> diving air compressors.|$|E
5|$|The War Office also {{considered}} the Tetrarch's cooling system <b>faulty,</b> making the tank unsuitable for service in hotter climates, {{such as the}} Middle East and North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{satellite}} continued operations until February 25, 1982, when it {{was removed}} from operations due to a <b>faulty</b> yaw control thruster. The satellite was placed in standby mode on March 31, 1983.|$|E
5|$|Two 2009 {{reviews of}} {{clinical}} studies determined that all {{were too small}} and <b>faulty</b> to allow strong conclusions to be drawn. One of the reviews found that Aloe has not been proven to offer protection for humans from sunburn.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the <b>faulty</b> circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers were unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|At {{that point}} in the investigation, the crash was {{generally}} {{believed to have been}} caused by <b>faulty</b> wiring in the cockpit after the entertainment system started to overheat. Certain groups issued Aviation Safety Recommendations. The TSB released its preliminary report on 30 August 2000 and the final report in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Glenn landed safely, but an {{inspection}} of his capsule revealed {{that one of}} the landing bag switches had been <b>faulty.</b> Kraft was right; the heat shield had not been loose after all. The lessons that he drew from this experience were clear.|$|E
5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or <b>faulty,</b> which can cause color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who {{had been}} an auto {{mechanic}} and early aviator. Fleming had {{become involved in the}} film industry when a friend, Marshall Neilan, recommended Fleming to film director Allan Dwan as a good mechanic. (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a <b>faulty</b> film camera.) By 1916, Fleming had become a cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|In a 1959 essay, Boris Pasternak {{compared}} Shakespeare's Macbeth to Raskolnikov, {{the protagonist}} of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Pasternak explained that neither character begins as a murderer, but becomes one {{by a set of}} <b>faulty</b> rationalizations and a belief that he is above the law.|$|E
5|$|It {{has always}} been {{important}} for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the <b>faulty</b> mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E
5|$|Keyser Creek is {{one source}} of {{flooding}} in the borough of Taylor. It is also the only recent flooding source in the borough. In 1971, the creek overflowed after a rainstorm, damaging several yards and lots near Oak Street and First Street. The flooding {{was caused by a}} <b>faulty</b> culvert, which was later replaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|Lee's plan, however, {{was based}} on <b>faulty</b> intelligence, {{exacerbated}} by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month after}} Alexander Onassis's death, McCusker had {{manslaughter}} proceedings initiated against him by the public prosecutor of Athens in connection with the crash. Six people were also charged over Onassis's death in January 1974, with their indictment indicating that <b>faulty</b> controls had been fitted to his plane.|$|E
5|$|Petterson's {{compulsory}} {{delivery of the}} talking points based on <b>faulty</b> U.S. intelligence would {{set the stage for}} strained relations between Washington and Khartoum that lasted well into Carney's early tenure as ambassador. In late 1995, Carney was also asked to deliver a similar non-paper message based on what he would later recount as having been poorly sourced U.S. intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Rodes's {{original}} <b>faulty</b> {{attack at}} 2:00 had stalled, but he launched his reserve brigade, under Ramseur, against Paul's Brigade in the salient on the Mummasburg Road, with Doles's Brigade against the left {{flank of the}} XI Corps. Daniel's Brigade resumed its attack, now to the east against Baxter on Oak Ridge. This time Rodes was more successful, mostly because Early coordinated an attack on his flank.|$|E
5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same <b>faulty</b> maintenance procedure. The <b>faulty</b> procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E
5|$|After a 40-day delay {{caused by}} <b>faulty</b> {{computer}} chips, Kvant-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's solar array {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's airlock.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was <b>faulty.</b> He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was <b>faulty,</b> as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, <b>faulty</b> furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to <b>faulty</b> equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} the Japanese {{had opened up}} with the artillery that they had brought up {{in support of the}} main defensive position on Tsimba Ridge, firing {{for the first time in}} the sector. This barrage was largely ineffective, inflicting only one casualty, as many of the shells proved to be <b>faulty</b> and did not detonate. The Australians also came across a large camp, including a field hospital, which they captured intact. Another group of huts was also discovered, from where they gained intelligence identifying the Japanese troops in the area as belonging to the 81st Infantry Regiment. They also managed to capture two 70mm guns, and ammunition for them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Faulty</b> {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{disastrous}} Battle of the Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower sent Smith forward {{to report on}} the state of affairs at the American II Corps. Smith recommended the relief of its commander, Major General Lloyd Fredendall, as did General Harold Alexander and Major Generals Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott. On their advice, Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with Major General George S. Patton, Jr. Eisenhower also relieved his Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence (G-2), Brigadier Eric Mockler-Ferryman, pinpointing <b>faulty</b> intelligence at AFHQ as a contributing factor in the defeat at Kasserine. Mockler-Ferryman was replaced by Brigadier Kenneth Strong.|$|E
5|$|Hood {{was laid}} down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was {{launched}} on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 {{at the cost}} of £926,396. Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 June as a result of <b>faulty</b> riveting and excessive strain on the hull when she had been docked. Repairs took only two days, and the ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June.|$|E
