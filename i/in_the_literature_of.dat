5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist {{in the pursuit of}} the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure of his love affair that defines the character.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{is known}} for {{borrowing}} plots and characters from other stories, but the source of A Midsummer Night's Dream has proved difficult to trace. There is no clear parallel to its plot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> his time. However, many of its characters' names and relationships are borrowed from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Philostrate is no exception. His name is the pseudonym adopted by Arcite upon covertly returning to Athens in The Knight's Tale to work for Theseus. (A Knight's Tale was dramatised nearly twenty years later by Shakespeare and Fletcher as The Two Noble Kinsmen.) Chaucer himself took the name Philostrate from Boccaccio's poem Il Filostrato, a story about Troilus and Criseyde. Because Chaucer's Arcite adopts this identity to become a servant at Theseus' court, {{it is possible that}} the Midsummer Night's Dream character is meant to be the same person in a continuation of the story. However, the two characters have little else in common. Another candidate for the source of Philostrate's character is Philostratus the Elder, the author of Comus, a play which has similarities to Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E
