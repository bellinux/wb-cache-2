40|$|Abstract. Consumers need {{a variety}} of goods and {{services}} in order to maintain their lives. The consumption patterns of consumers can vary depending on the differences in geographical and socio-economic structure, the time period during which the analysis takes place and the specific circumstances that the country is going through. For this reason, the relationship between income and expenditure has been subject to many studies till today. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the geographical diversity and the special situation that Turkey is going through on the household consumption patterns of the Burdur province. In this study, income & expenditure relations of twelve expenditure groups and their position in total expenditures and income elasticity of these expenditure groups shall be estimated with the help of Engel functions by using the data obtained from questionnaires implemented on randomly selected 695 households residing in Center County of Burdur Province between the dates January 03, 2017 and February 28, 2017. As a result of the analysis, it has been found that food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco products, housing expenses, health services, communication and clothing and foot-wear expenditure groups are in the obligatory class of goods; furniture, home appliances and home care services, culture and <b>entertainment,</b> educational <b>expenses,</b> and restaurant and hotel expenses are in luxury goods class. Therefore, it has been reached to conclusion that the period that Turkey is going through does not have any effect on the household income-consumption pattern of Burdur province. Keywords.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the 'gift-relationship' between pharmaceutical companies and doctors. Methods: The study {{was based on a}} survey questionnaire of 823 medical specialists from across Australia. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate gifts offered to medical specialists in Australia by pharmaceutical companies, financial support actively sought by medical specialists for activities other than research and to consider what is ethically appropriate. Results: A high percentage of specialists received offers of food (96 %), items for the office (94 %), personal gifts (51 %) and journals or textbooks (50 %). Most specialists were invited to product launches, symposia or educational events (75 – 84 %) and 52 % received offers of travel to conferences. A high proportion of offers were accepted (66 – 79 %) except invitations to product launches (49 %), sponsored symposia (53 %) and offers of travel that included partners (27 %). Fifteen per cent of specialists requested financial support from pharmaceutical companies for activities and items, including conferences, travel, educational activities, salaries and donations to specific funds. The study outlined guidelines on gifts from pharmaceutical companies and differing standards applying to gifts and grants for travel. We found that, although most gifts and requests for support complied with professional and pharmaceutical industry guidelines, some – including personal gifts, tickets to sporting events, <b>entertainment</b> and travel <b>expenses</b> for specialists' partners – did not. Conclusion: To ensure that physicians' judgements are free from real or perceived influence from industry and to maintain public trust, we support a shift towards more conservative standards on gifts and support for travel evident in recent guidelines...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am ready}} to allow all that has been said of the valour and {{experience}} of our troops, who have fully contributed their part to the great successes abroad; nor is it their fault, that those important victories had no better consequences at home, {{though it may be}} their advantage. War is their trade and business: to improve and cultivate the advantages of success, is an affair of the cabinet; and the neglect of this, whether proceeding from weakness or corruption, according to the usual uncertainty of wars, may be of the most fatal consequence to a nation. For, pray let me represent our condition in such a light, as I believe both parties will allow, though perhaps not the consequences I shall deduce from it. We have been for above nine years, blessed with a QUEEN, who besides all virtues that can enter into the composition of a private person, possesses every regal quality that can contribute to make a people happy: of great wisdom, yet ready to receive the advice of her counsellors: of much discernment in choosing proper instruments, when she follows her own judgment, and only capable of being deceived by that excess of goodness which makes her judge of others by herself. Frugal in her management in order to contribute to the public, which in proportion she does, and that voluntarily, beyond any of her subjects; but from her own nature, generous and charitable to all that want or deserve; and in order to exercise those virtues, denying herself all <b>entertainments</b> of <b>expense</b> which many others enjoy. Then if we look abroad, at least in Flanders, our arms have been crowned with perpetual success in battles and sieges, not to mention several fortunate actions in Spain. These facts being thus stated, which none can deny, it is natural to ask how we have improved such advantages, and to what account they have turned? I shall use no discouraging terms. When a patient grows daily worse by the tampering of mountebanks, there is nothing left but to call in the best physicians before the case grows desperate: But I would ask, whether France or any other kingdom, would have made so little use of such prodigious opportunities, the fruits whereof could never have fallen to the ground, without the extremist degree of folly and corruption, and where those have lain, let the world judge? Instead of aiming at peace, while we had the advantage of the war, which has been the perpetual maxim of all wise states, it has been reckoned factious and malignant even to express our wishes for it; and such a condition imposed, as was never offered to any prince who had an inch of ground to dispute; Quae enim est conditio pacis; in qua ei cum quo pacem facias, nihil concedi potest?[8] ...|$|R
