25|$|The North-West Yoruba dialects {{show more}} {{linguistic}} innovation than the Southeast and Central dialects. This, {{combined with the}} fact that the latter areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date for migration into Northwestern Yorubaland. According to the Kay Williamson Scale, the following is the degree of relationship between Itsekiri and other Yoruboid dialects, using a compiled word list of the most common words. A similarity of 100% would mean a total overlap of two dialects, while a similarity of 0 would mean two speech areas that <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> no relationship.|$|E

Abramoff rebutted: The IFF was a conservative group which I headed. It was vigorously anti-Communist, but it was also actively anti-apartheid. In 1987, it was one of the first conservative groups to call for the release of Nelson Mandela, a position for which it was roundly criticized by other conservatives at the time.

500|$|Moon's {{arrival in}} the Who changed the {{dynamics}} of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon's temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. [...] "We used to fight regularly," [...] remembered Moon in later years. [...] "John [...] and I used to have fights– it wasn't very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing." [...] Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: [...] "We really <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> nothing in common apart from music," [...] he said in a later interview. Although Townshend described him as a [...] "completely different person to anyone I've ever met," [...] the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon's drumming style affected the band's musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon's lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.|$|E

Ringo was the one who applied for Donna to do this course – it's like he's doing this one last thing for her."

500|$|Critics gave mixed {{opinions}} to the team-up dynamic. Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had [...] "finally [...] {{up with a}} way {{of introducing}} teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay." [...] Maragos singled this out as the main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes, a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike Advance 3, was in 3D. Maragos, GameSpot's Frank Provo, IGN's Craig Harris, and Game Informers Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought. However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro, thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took a different point of criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called [...] "pointless". Maragos noted that the [...] "mid-air trick" [...] system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3, but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating [...] "hidden areas". Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional [...] "cheapness" [...] in the level design, because [...] "most of the characters <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> no defense when hopping off items like springboards".|$|E

[...] During her stay in Saint Lucia, she also worked on new music with Salaam Remi. Island claimed that a new album would be due in 2010 with Island co-president Darcus Beese saying, [...] "I've heard a couple of song demos that <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> floored me." [...] In July 2010, Winehouse was quoted as saying her next album would be released no later than January 2011, saying [...] "It's going to be very much the same as my second album, where there's a lot of jukebox stuff and songs that are... just jukebox, really." [...] Ronson said the same month however that he had not started to record the album. She performed [...] "Valerie" [...] with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song's lyrics. In October Winehouse performed a four-song set to promote her fashion line. In December 2010, she played a 40-minute concert at a Russian oligarch's party in Moscow, the tycoon hand picking the songs.|$|E
500|$|Lasser {{provided}} {{ideas to}} his authors and commented on their drafts, attempting to improve both {{the level of}} scientific literacy {{and the quality of}} the writing. Some of his correspondence has survived, including an exchange with Jack Williamson, whom Lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader—the winning entry in one of the magazine's competitions. Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility, citing as an example a moment in the story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language: [...] "You must be sure and make it convincing how they did it; for they <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> no method of approach to a written language of another world." [...] On one occasion Lasser's work with his authors extended to collaboration: [...] "The Time Projector", a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Wonder Stories, was credited to David H. Keller and David Lasser. Both Lasser and, later, Hornig, were given almost complete editorial freedom by Gernsback, who reserved only the right to give final approval to the contents. This was in contrast to the more detailed control Gernsback had exerted over the content of Amazing Stories in the first years of its existence. Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz has suggested that the reason was the poor financial state of Wonder Stories—Gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money.|$|E
