We provide a historical look at slot allocation in the U. S. and the consequences of prior and current practices on both safety and competition. It is shown that the particular characteristics of aviation slot allocation suggest the need for three types of market mechanisms: an auction of longterm leases of arrival and/or departure slots, a market that supports inter-airline exchange of long-term leases and a near-real-time market that allows for the <b>exchange</b> of <b>slots</b> on a particular day of operation.

40|$|Whilst {{container}} shipping {{has become}} increasingly important {{over the past few}} decades due to its obvious advantages, container shipping companies have faced various risks from different sources in their operations. Systematic academic studies on this topic are few; and in light of this, this study aims to systematically explore and analyse the risks in container shipping operations and to examine the applicable risk mitigation strategies in a logistics perspective, including information flow, physical flow, and payment flow. This thesis uses Taiwan container shipping industry as a case study, and borrows four steps of risk management as the main method, which includes risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation strategies identification, and strategies evaluation. In order to ensure the analysis is inclusive and systematic, risk factors and risk mitigation strategies are identified through a related literature review and are validated through a set of interviews. Risk analysis is conducted through using questionnaires, and then through risk ranking, risk matrix, risk mapping, and P-I graph. Risk mitigation strategies are evaluated through classic AHP and fuzzy AHP analysis. A number of significant findings have been obtained. Firstly, 35 risk factors are identified and classified into three categories: risks associated with information flow, risks associated with physical flow, and risks associated with payment flow. After collecting and analysing the risk-factor survey, the results indicate that the risk associated with physical flow has the more significant impact on shipping companies’ operation. However, one risk factor associated with information flow, “shippers hiding cargo information”, has the most significant impact among the 35 risk factors. Secondly, 20 risk mitigation strategies are identified and classified into three categories: intra-organisational strategies, intra-channel strategies, and inter-channel strategies. After collecting the AHP survey and analysing through classic AHP and fuzzy AHP, the result indicates that “slot <b>exchange,</b> <b>slot</b> charter, joint fleet, ship charter with other container shipping companies” is the most important strategy. The main contributions of this thesis include: (1) based on the literature review, there have been no research on risk management in the context of container shipping operation from a broad logistics perspective, and this thesis is the first attempt to fill this research gap; (2) this thesis uses Taiwan shipping industry as a case study to apply the framework, which generates useful managerial insights; (3) the conceptual model of risk management developed in this thesis can be applied to container shipping operations in other countries and regions; (4) compared with several studies using secondary data, this thesis uses empirical data to conduct the risk analysis, and make the results more close to the reality situation in container shipping; (5) in terms of risk analysis, this thesis ranks the total 35 risk factors rather than only identify the most important one, this can be used to be generalised to the whole container shipping companies in Taiwan, or even to the whole world; (6) in terms of risk management, the previous studies usually analyse only the importance of strategies. However, this thesis analyses the results of AHP from three different angles: reducing financial loss, reducing reputation loss, and reducing safety and security incident related loss. This can provide different angles for the managers who are considering different aspects...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{development}} of the European Union (EU) framework on airport <b>slot</b> allocation and <b>exchange</b> over the past two decades. Council Regulation (EC) 95 / 93 laid down common rules for the allocation of slots at Union airports, followed by four amendments (2002, 2003, 2004 and 2009) that represent a gradual, comprehensive revision process towards developing a more flexible system of airport slot allocation. First, this article considers key changes in the Parliament’s Amendments under two headings: “streamlining the regulation” and “legalisation of slot exchange”. Next, with reference to relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the adopted “essential facilities” doctrine, this article discusses state-owned airports and possible “airport favouritism”, particularly relating to access, charges/fees and allocation of slots. Finally, this article examines the “legalisation” of market-based measures in the slot allocation system vis-à-vis <b>slot</b> <b>exchange</b> to query whether it will generate the first cases of abuse of dominance in airport slots and ultimately risk thwarting the objective of “better” European airports...|$|R

40|$|An epitope-specific {{polyclonal}} antiserum {{was produced in}} rabbits immunized against a synthetic 15 amino acid peptide (QRVTGLDFIPGLHPV) derived from the coding sequence reported for the porcine leptin gene (GenBank Accession No. U 59894). This peptide contains a core sequence comprised of eight amino acids (GLDFIPGL) that is totally conserved in all leptin proteins studied to date. Purified recombinant human, mouse, rat, pig, and chicken leptin proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electro-blotted onto PVDF membranes. Western blots were developed employing the leptin-specific peptide antiserum with an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG second antibody chromogenic system. The peptide antiserum {{was found to be}} highly specific for leptin which exhibited an estimated molecular weight of about 16 kDa for all species analyzed. The sensitivity of the Western blot assay was not sufficient to permit the direct detection of leptin in chicken serum or plasma.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{tractable}} optimization framework for network Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) {{with an eye}} towards the future. The thesis addresses two issues in ATFM research: a) fairness and collaboration amongst airlines; and b) uncertainty inherent in capacity forecasts. A unifying attraction of the overall dissertation is that the Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) paradigm, which is the current philosophy governing the design of new ATFM initiatives, is treated {{as the starting point}} in the research agenda. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we develop an optimization framework to extend the CDM paradigm from a single-airport to a network setting by incorporating both fairness and airline collaboration. We introduce different notions of fairness emanating from a) First-Scheduled First-Served (FSFS) fairness; and b) Proportional fairness. We propose exact discrete optimization models to incorporate them. The first fairness paradigm which entails controlling number of reversals and total amount of overtaking is especially appealing in the ATFM context as it is a natural extension of Ration-By-Schedule (RBS). We allow for further airline collaboration by proposing discrete optimization models for slot reallocation. We provide empirical results of the proposed optimization models on national-scale, real world datasets that show interesting tradeoffs between fairness and efficiency. In particular, schedules close to the RBS policy (with single digit reversals) are possible for a less than 10 % increase in delay costs. We utilize case studies to highlight the considerable improvements in the internal objective functions of the airlines as a result of <b>slot</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Finally, the proposed models are computationally tractable (running times of less than 30 minutes). In the second part, we address the important issue of capacity uncertainty by presenting the first application of robust and adaptive optimization in the ATFM problem. We introduce a weather-front based approach to model the uncertainty inherent in airspace capacity estimates resulting from the impact of a small number of weather fronts. We prove the equivalence of the robust problem to a modified instance of the deterministic problem; solve the LP relaxation of the adaptive problem using affine policies; and report extensive empirical results to study the inherent tradeoffs. by Shubham Gupta.

40|$|Efficient {{allocation}} of scarce resources in networks {{is an important}} problem worldwide. In this thesis, we focus on resource allocation problems in a network of congested airports. The increasing demand {{for access to the}} world's major commercial airports combined with the limited operational capacity at many of these airports have led to growing air traffic congestion resulting in several billion dollars of delay cost every year. In this thesis, we study two demand-management techniques [...] strategic and operational approaches [...] to mitigate airport congestion. As a strategic initiative, auctions have been proposed to allocate runway slot capacity. We focus on two elements in the design of such slot auctions [...] airline valuations and activity rules. An aspect of airport slot market environments, which we argue must be considered in auction design, {{is the fact that the}} participating airlines are budget-constrained. [...] The problem of finding the best bundle of slots on which to bid in an iterative combinatorial auction, also called the preference elicitation problem, is a particularly hard problem, even more in the case of airlines in a slot auction. We propose a valuation model, called the Aggregated Integrated Airline Scheduling and Fleet Assignment Model, to help airlines understand the true value of the different bundles of slots in the auction. This model is efficient and was found to be robust to data uncertainty in our experimental simulations. (cont.) [...] Activity rules are checks made by the auctioneer at the end of every round to suppress strategic behavior by bidders and to promote consistent, continual preference elicitation. These rules find applications in several real world scenarios including slot auctions. We show that the commonly used activity rules are not applicable for slot auctions as they prevent straightforward behavior by budget-constrained bidders. We propose the notion of a strong activity rule which characterizes straightforward bidding strategies. We then show how a strong activity rule in the context of budget-constrained bidders (and quasilinear bidders) can be expressed as a linear feasibility problem. This work on activity rules also applies to more general iterative combinatorial auctions. We also study operational (real-time) demand-management initiatives that are used when there are sudden drops in capacity at airports due to various uncertainties, such as bad-weather. We propose a system design that integrates the capacity allocation, airline recovery and inter-airline <b>slot</b> <b>exchange</b> procedures, and suggest metrics to evaluate the different approaches to fair allocations. by Pavithra Harsha.
