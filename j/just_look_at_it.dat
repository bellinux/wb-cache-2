In his 1997 {{biography}} Bad As I Wanna Be, he expresses his feelings for his father: [...] "I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> like this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn't mean I have a father". (He would not meet his father again until 2012.) ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as music.

500|$|Steve Perry has {{expressed}} ambivalence towards the lasting vilification of the Daddies' name, admitting it's [...] "probably the most heinous {{name in the}} history of rock" [...] while emphasizing a disparate delineation between the band's roots in the [...] "bubble" [...] of Eugene's punk subculture and their unexpected longevity in the wider cultural mainstream: [...] "I started this band a long time ago, and we just used [...] We didn't know that in 10 years we'd turn into some sort of happy, peppy, feel-good things". Though Perry has occasionally voiced regret over not having changed the Daddies' name earlier in their career, he has nevertheless acquiescently embraced the name as his [...] "Holden Caulfield red hunting hat", while outright dismissing critics who choose to demonize the name based on literal interpretation than the jazz-era jive slang it drew from. [...] "It gives outrage addicts another soapbox they can jump up on", Perry said, [...] "If people want to <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> , then that's their problem, but I don't write it that way"..."I assure you we don't cruise high schools for dates".|$|E

He forgot {{to think of it as}} a thing to eat, but began to think of it wholly as a thing to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and admire. He was glad he hadn't been able to break that shell.|$|R
