25|$|One of {{the minor}} <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> its {{existence}} is its having never actually reached Pittsburgh. Walston was {{as far south as}} it got.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed {{as one of}} the great <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> history that three Cornish-speaking Cornishmen brought the English {{language}} back from the verge of extinction - John of Cornwall, John Trevisa and Richard Pencrych.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Irony</b> <b>of</b> Fate 2 or The <b>Irony</b> <b>of</b> Fate: Continuation (Ирония Судьбы. Продолжение; Ironiya sud’by. Prodolzheniye) is a 2007 Russian {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Timur Bekmambetov {{based on a}} screenplay by Alexey Slapovskiy produced by Channel One and released by Mosfilm. It is a direct sequel of the first The <b>Irony</b> <b>of</b> Fate.|$|R
50|$|Bekmambetov {{followed}} up Day Watch (2006) with The <b>Irony</b> <b>of</b> Fate 2 (2007). This {{sequel to the}} famous Soviet's film The <b>Irony</b> <b>of</b> Fate (1971) is {{the one of the}} most successful in Russian history, second to Avatar in total box office receipts.|$|R

25|$|Adrien has co-written {{two plays}} with Jean-Louis Bauer. The first, Bug! creates a dream-journey through memory, current {{scientific}} and artistic issues, {{to provide an}} overview of civilization. The second, La Grande Nouvelle, is a contemporary variation on Le Malade imaginaire, which plays on the <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the present-day desire for immortality.|$|E
25|$|The servility stigma {{came from}} the {{accident}} of a more medically advanced society being conquered by a lesser. One of the cultural <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> these circumstances is that free men sometimes found themselves in service to the enslaved professional or dignitary, or {{the power of the}} state was entrusted to foreigners who had been conquered in battle and were technically slaves. In Greek society, physicians tended to be regarded as noble. Asclepius in the Iliad is noble.|$|E
25|$|Other popular novels include Tortilla Flat, Of Mice and Men, Cannery Row, and East of Eden. He {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. Steinbeck's contemporary, Nathanael West's two most famous short novels, Miss Lonelyhearts, which plumbs the life of its eponymous antihero, a {{reluctant}} (and, to comic effect, male) advice columnist, and the effects the tragic letters exert on it, and The Day of the Locust, which introduces a cast of Hollywood stereotypes and explores the <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the movies, {{have come to be}} avowed classics of American literature.|$|E

25|$|Long's men {{attacked}} {{in a single}} rank in three main lines, dismounted and firing their 7-shot Spencer repeating carbines. They were supported by their own artillery. The Confederates defenders replied with heavy small arms and artillery fire. In {{one of the many}} <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the Civil War, the Confederate artillery had only solid shot on hand, while just a short distance away was an arsenal which produced tons of canister, a highly effective anti-personnel ammunition. The attackers suffered many casualties, including General Long himself, but the attack continued. Once the Union troops reached the works, vicious hand-to-hand fighting broke out. Many on both sides were struck down with clubbed muskets. Still, Union troops kept pouring into the works. In less than 30 minutes, Long's men had captured the works protecting the Summerfield Road from the hopelessly outnumbered defenders.|$|E
25|$|The video {{starts off}} with some grass sinking {{down into the}} dirt, causing it to turn wet. It then cuts to a {{scorpion}} walking to where Linkin Park are performing. It explores the many <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> humanity and its ill-effects on {{the earth and the}} environment (see above). It juxtaposes various pieces of footage: a large, well-fed man eating fast food, a woman measuring her waist and a man who is so malnourished that his ribcage is visible through his skin; African Americans being hosed down by the Ku Klux Klan; nuclear explosions, the World Trade Center collapsing {{as a result of the}} September 11 attacks, children waving American flags (one of the children being Brad Delson), a Middle Eastern child holding an AK-47, clips of oil tankers torn in half and birds covered in an oil slick. The video ends with the same grass at the beginning growing out of the dirt, causing it to dry up.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of Johnson suffering from bouts {{of depression and}} what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, [...] "one of the <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense—of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality—should have begun his adult life, {{at the age of}} twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity". To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide". Boswell claimed that Johnson [...] "felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a subtle}} moralist all too {{aware of the}} <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the modern world, George Ade was perhaps the first modern American humorist. [...] Through the values {{implicit}} in the fables, Ade manifested an ambivalence between the traditional rural virtues, {{in which he was}} raised (the virtues of Horatio Alger and the McGuffey Readers), and the craftiness he saw all around him in booming Chicago.|$|E

They liberated prisoners of war while some of them had family members kept in internment camps back in the United States" ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 28, 1920, {{the nascent}} American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) {{published}} its Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice, which carefully documented unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by agents provocateur, and unlawful incommunicado detention. Such prominent lawyers and law professors as Felix Frankfurter, Roscoe Pound and Ernst Freund signed it. Harvard Professor Zechariah Chafee criticized the raids and attempts at deportations {{and the lack}} of legal process in his 1920 volume Freedom of Speech. He wrote: [...] "That a Quaker should employ prison and exile to counteract evil-thinking is one of the saddest <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> our time." ...|$|E

After leaving Pembroke College, Johnson began to experience [...] "feelings of intense anxiety" [...] along with [...] "feelings of utter hopelessness" [...] and lassitude.|$|E
2500|$|This {{agreement}} being {{de facto}} rather than de jure, it held no ground on international law. Nevertheless, {{it was the}} opinion of Canadian officials that any U.S. request for passage would only bolster Canada’s argument for sovereignty should the issue come before an international court. [...] The U.S. were diligent in honoring their word, requesting passage under this agreement for [...] in October 1988 when she was barred by an early surge of ice, preventing her return to her home port of Seattle through the Bering Strait. Regarding the U.S. cooperation in solving this diplomatic predicament, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney pointed out that [...] "One of the great <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the position taken by the United States, if followed to its logical conclusion, is that {{it could lead to}} much further freedom of navigation in the Arctic for the Soviets." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edith Terry, {{author of}} How Asia Got Rich, {{said that because}} Japanese people are [...] "mastering" [...] a [...] "Western game" [...] people have some pride {{and at the same}} time feel {{insecurity}} because the [...] "game" [...] is on [...] "Western terms" [...] rather than [...] "Japanese terms." [...] The standard presentation of Japanese names in English differs from the standard presentations of modern Chinese names, since modern Chinese names are usually not reversed to fit the western order in English, except when the Chinese person is living or traveling outside of China. The convention regarding Japanese names also differs from Korean names, which are usually in Korean order unless the Korean person is abroad. Power wrote that the difference between the treatment of Japanese names and of Chinese and Korean names often results in confusion. Terry wrote, [...] "it was one of the <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Karnad {{started writing}} plays, Kannada {{literature}} was highly {{influenced by the}} renaissance in Western literature. Writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of native soil. C. Rajagopalachari's version of the Mahabharata published in 1951, left a deep impact on him and soon, sometime in the mid-1950s, one day he experienced a rush of dialogues by characters from the Mahabharata in his adopted Kannada. [...] "I could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears ... I was just the scribe," [...] said Karnad in a later interview. Yayati was published in 1961, when he was 23 years old. It {{is based on the}} story of King Yayati, one of the ancestors of the Pandavas, who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor, Shukracharya, who was incensed at Yayati's infidelity. Yayati in turn asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him, and one of them agrees. It ridicules the <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> life through characters in Mahabharata. It became an instant success, immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages.|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{presentation}} of Chinese names in English {{differs from the}} usual presentations of modern Japanese names, since modern Japanese names are usually reversed to fit the western order in English. In English the {{presentation of}} Chinese names is {{similar to those of}} Korean names. Edith Terry, author of How Asia Got Rich, said that [...] "it was one of the <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." [...] As of 1989, Pinyin became the preferred romanization system in works discussing contemporary China, while English-language books relevant to Japanese history still used the Wade–Giles system to romanize Chinese names more often than other romanization systems. As of 1993, Wade–Giles was still used in Taiwan. Unlike mainland Chinese, Taiwanese people usually place a dash between the two characters of the given name, similar to Korean names. This is also the case for the standard styling of Hong Kong Chinese names, where the given name is hyphenated. Names of Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese people are often expressed in three parts.|$|E
