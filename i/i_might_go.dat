2500|$|Dupri also {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility for}} a duet with Jackson and American singer Mariah Carey for the album. Carey commented in April 2006, [...] "He never {{talked to me about}} that, but if Jermaine has a concept, we should go and write something. I love Janet. I’ve been a big fan of Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt it was going to happen. [...] "It depends on how quick my mind moves. We’re mixing records for [...] We’re not done yet. When I did Usher's My Way album, the last record I created was 'You Make Me Wanna...'. I'm thinking <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>go</b> back in, and I might tamper with it. [...] We gotta try to figure it out", he commented. However, the duet never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Wilton and Rockenfield had written songs for {{previous}} Queensrÿche albums that Tate discarded {{in favor of}} songs he wrote with outside writers, such as Jason Slater. However, they chose not to use them for this album, according to Wilton [...] "because {{there was such a}} renewed inspiration in the band. (...) <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>go</b> revisit [...] sometime, but for this album I wanted it all fresh and new." [...] Wilton has also said: [...] "Songs were often written in a day." [...] It became a collaborative effort without any involvement from outside writers, unlike the group's final albums with Tate. Dutch metal magazine Aardschok co-founder [...] "Metal Mike" [...] van Rijswijk says that during the Alcatraz Metal Festival on August 12, 2012, La Torre let him hear 17 demos they were working on, and he discovered that [...] "many of the fast-paced 'Queen of the Reich'-like tracks didn't make the album", in favor of the more mid-tempo songs that would have fitted well on Operation: Mindcrime or Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Firing and {{fighting}} began April 14 between Moslems and Armenians, {{which resulted in}} a number of casualties on both sides... the next morning April 15, a fresh outburst of smoke near the girls' school showed that we were threatened by fire...Mr. Maurer and I took a crowbar and an axe to the destroy the wooden porches, shutters and stairways of the houses between the fires and the girls' school...When I first climbed to the roofs near the flames armed Moslems appeared...When they understood that I was not firing on them, but had come to work against the flames, they lowered their rifles and assured me with many pledges that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>go</b> unmolested...we repeatedly begged some Armenian young men who were lurking around the street corners shielded from the Moslem fire to put away their arms and come and save the school building... we came back to the school and asked for volunteers, Mr. Rogers came at once... We had thus worked a considerable time without being harmed by the Moslems when the Armenians {{on the other end of}} the street commenced firing on the houses where the looters were at work. Suddenly two shots rang out not more than eight yards from where we were working. Mr. Rogers...was mortally wounded...The other bullet hit Mr. Maurer...Immediately after these two shots several other bullets from the Moslems, who had fired them, whizzed past me...Both men passed peacefully away. They died as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.|$|E
