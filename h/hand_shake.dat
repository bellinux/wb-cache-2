In the 1990s, the privatized enterprises have laid off employees by introducing schemes like golden <b>hand</b> <b>shake.</b>|$|E

A brisk <b>hand</b> <b>shake</b> was the best Naguib could offer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the design, modeling, and optimization of an electromagnetic energy harvesting (EMEH) device with various tube length and winding coil width. The nonlinear magnetic-spring configuration is employed for gen-erating sufficient power from <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> of irregular and low-frequency vibrations. Based on the modeling and simulation, longer tube {{length of the}} EMEH device results in lower resonant frequency and stronger nonlinearity {{of the system and}} thus is more efficient for low-frequency harvesting. From the <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> test, it is found that a longer tube length and a shorter winding coil width could induce a higher power generation. The optimized device of tube length of 66 mm and winding coil width of 10 mm has achieved maximum power outputs of 568. 66 µW at the <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> acceleration of 1 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz, which corresponds to the power density of 90. 67 µW/cm 3. Further improvement of the device has been achieved by increasing the coil length to 40 m. This device provides maximum power outputs of 825. 36 µW at the <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> acceleration of 1. 56 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz. This paper demonstrates a feasible design of nonlinear EMEH device with impressive output performance from <b>hand</b> <b>shaking.</b> Index Terms — Electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH), nonlinear, magnetic-spring, <b>hand</b> <b>shaking...</b>|$|R

2500|$|He {{then began}} {{managing}} The Motor City Machine Guns, {{but this was}} short lived before he next appeared {{in the role of}} Dr. Nash, psychiatrist and adviser to Kurt and Karen Angle. Nash then engaged in a brief program with TNA Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle, which eventually culminated in Nash aiding Angle. Nash warned the Angles about how dangerous Sting can be based on Nash's experience feuding with Sting in WCW. At Bound for Glory, Nash interfered on Angle's behalf during his World Title defense against Sting. However, it was for naught, as Sting captured the title from Angle via Scorpion Death Drop after fending off Nash and Angle's wife, Karen. The following Thursday on Impact!, Nash and Angle had an altercation because Angle blamed Nash for him losing the World Title. Angle eventually attacked Nash, who retaliated by Jackknife Powerbombing Angle {{in the middle of the}} ring. The following week, Sting defended the TNA World Title against Angle in a rematch from Bound for Glory, and Nash had a ringside seat. After the match went on a bit, Angle and Sting were out of the ring and when Angle pushed Sting onto Nash, Sting turned around and hit Nash in the face with a right hand shot, leading to Nash interfering on Angle's behalf, even though earlier he said he wasn't going to help Angle. Following the match, which Angle won, Nash offered a <b>hand</b> <b>shake</b> to Angle only to be [...] "flipped off" [...] by the new champ. An enraged Nash demanded a match with Angle, but TNA Management's public face, Jim Cornette, instead booked Nash into a tag team match as Angle's partner against Sting and a partner of his choosing, with the stipulation being that the person gaining the pinfall or submission would be crowned the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. After a red herring that Scott Hall was the mystery partner, it was revealed to be Booker T.|$|E

60|$|I saw {{his face}} turn livid, and I saw the <b>hand</b> <b>shake</b> upon the golden head of his cane. He was very {{sensitive}} upon the score of his foul infirmities. His eyes grew baleful as he controlled himself. Then he smiled, displaying a ruin of blackened teeth.|$|E

60|$|Bradley walked {{straight}} {{away into the}} country. He wanted to be alone. It seemed so strange and sweet to be thus shaken by the coming of a woman.

60|$|Next {{she insisted}} upon my getting {{into her own}} bed in the wagon to sleep, forbidding me to smoke, which she said made the <b>hand</b> <b>shake.</b> Thither, then, I went, after a brief {{conversation}} with Hans, whom I directed to clean my rifle thoroughly. For I wished to be alone and knew that I had little chance of solitude outside of that somewhat fusty couch.|$|E
60|$|I {{replied that}} I would have none, since beer made the <b>hand</b> <b>shake</b> and {{that on the}} {{steadiness}} of my hand that afternoon depended the lives of many.

6000|$|Moriarty was heavily-built and handsome, {{very quiet}} and nervously anxious to please his neighbors when he wasn't sunk {{in a brown}} study. He started a good deal at sudden noises or if spoken to without warning; and, when you watched him {{drinking}} his glass of water at dinner, {{you could see the}} <b>hand</b> <b>shake</b> a little. But all this was put down to nervousness, and the quiet, steady, [...] "sip- sip-sip, fill and sip-sip-sip, again," [...] that went on in his own room when he was by himself, was never known. Which was miraculous, seeing how everything in a man's private life is public property out here.|$|E
60|$|She {{had taken}} a lesson from him. Instead of holding the heavy weapon extended, the butt of it and her forearm rested on the table, the muzzle pointed, not at his head, but his chest. And he, looking coolly and obeying her commands, {{knew there was no}} chance of the kick-up of the recoil {{producing}} a miss. Also, he saw that the revolver did not wabble, nor the <b>hand</b> <b>shake,</b> and he was thoroughly conversant with the size of hole the soft-nosed bullets could make. He had eyes, not for her, but for the hammer, which had risen under the pressure of her forefinger on the trigger.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{she did not}} move. To merely {{take her}} <b>hand,</b> <b>shake</b> it, and go away seemed impossible, almost improper. I stooped without haste and pressed my lips to her smooth forehead. This was the moment when I {{realised}} clearly {{with a sort of}} terror my complete detachment from that unfortunate creature. And as I lingered in that cruel self-knowledge I felt the light touch of her arms falling languidly on my neck and received a hasty, awkward, haphazard kiss which missed my lips. No! She was not afraid; but I was no longer moved. Her arms slipped off my neck slowly, she made no sound, the deep wicker arm-chair creaked slightly; only a sense of my dignity prevented me fleeing headlong from that catastrophic revelation.|$|E
