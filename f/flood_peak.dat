40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the impact of {{combined}} catchment and storage upon flood occurrences and <b>flood</b> <b>peaks.</b> A significant factor that plays an important role of the combined catchment and storage is the ratio of contributing catchment area to storage area (AC/AS) where the impact significantly shows increasing frequency of storage overflow and <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> with the increasing of AC/AS. Some case studies examined in this work, i. e. Way Pegadungan (Lampung, Sumatra) and NagaraRiver (South Kalimantan) catchments show similar behavior. Swamps located on the sides of downstream of Way Pegadungan as well as Nagara River act as storages during flood events. The dyke which was planned to be built increases the ratio of AC/AS significantly as storage area reduced considerably. This has an impact on <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> which can increase considerably. The improved understanding of these process controls will be useful in assisting the management of such catchments, particularly to assist in flood prevention and mitigation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to investigates the impact of within-storm {{rainfall}} variability and catchment response time and how these interactions are critical in determining flood frequency. Using deterministic rainfall-runoff model, hydrological regimes ranging from fast to slow are identified on the basis of the catchment response time. The model uses generated hourly rainfall time series adapted to climatic condition in Lampung province coupled with a hypothetical catchment using catchment properties suitable to this region. This study highlights the importance of within-storm rainfall pattern in determining <b>flood</b> <b>peaks,</b> particularly in fast regime.

50|$|Landscape {{of rivers}} - The {{construction}} of new buildings and new roads accelerates the discharge of surface water runoff and raises <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> in the lower reachers of river catchments. River banks therefore have to be raised and flood channels have to be constructed. The adoption of sustainable urban drainage systems facilitates the reclamation of rivers. When water is detained, infiltrated and transpired near to the where it falls, <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> are lowered and rivers can be reclaimed. The high concrete walls {{in which they were}} confined can be replaced by vegetated embankments. Water quality is improved and wildlife returns to the river. Projects to achieve these objectives are described as River Reclamation or River Restoration.|$|R

40|$|This study uses a {{distributed}} hydrologic {{model to}} assess the impact of wetland loss on <b>flood</b> <b>peaks.</b> There is large agreement among hydrologists that wetlands have significant flood-mitigation potential. However, the lack of data availability and the appropriate model have generally prevented this impact from being quantified and applied to city planning. From 1980 to 2008 sixty percent of the wetlands in Houston's Cole Creek were destroyed. Because of its proximity to downtown, a wealth of historical, hydrologic data are available for the subbasin. Distributed hydrologic models, which have become more accessible with the increase of computer processing power, allow for the consideration of finite areas, such as wetlands, on watershed response.

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of floods to annual precipitation {{in space and time}} and evaluates quantitative signs of landscape-climate coevolution. For that purpose, a spatiotemporal sensitivity analysis is performed at regional scale using data from 804 catchments in Austria from 1976 to 2008. Results show that <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> are more responsive to spatial (regional) than to temporal (decadal) variability. Space-wise a 10 % increase in precipitation leads to a 23 % increase in <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> in Austria, whereas time-wise a 10 % increase in precipitation leads to an increase of just 6 % in <b>flood</b> <b>peaks.</b> Catchments from dry lowlands and high wetlands exhibit similarity between the spatial and temporal sensitivities (spatiotemporal symmetry) and low landscape-climate codependence. This suggests that such regions are not coevolving significantly. However, intermediate regions show differences between those sensitivities (symmetry breaks) and higher landscape-climate codependence, suggesting undergoing coevolution. A new coevolution index is then proposed relating spatiotemporal symmetry with relative characteristic celerities. The descriptive assessment of coevolution is complemented by a simple dynamical model of landscape-climate coevolu-tion, in which landform evolution processes take place at the millennial scale (slow dynamics), and climate adjusts in years to decades (fast dynamics). Coevolution is expressed by the interplay between slow and fast dynamics, represented, respectively, by spatial and temporal characteristics. The model captures key features of the joint landscape-climate distribution, supporting the descriptive assessment. This paper ulti-mately brings to light that coevolution needs {{to be taken into account}} through characteristic celerities in space-time trading of regional hydrology. 1...|$|R
