40|$|Children are {{vulnerable}} {{due to their}} age and developmental level. They rely on parents and other adults for survival and care. However, some children become more vulnerable than others as parents and families are poor and cannot afford {{to provide for their}} basic needs. Poverty can make children vulnerable by depriving them of their right to have their basic needs met, such as food, health care, clothing and shelter. While this situation is affected by high rates of unemployment it is also compounded by chronic illness such as HIV and AIDS. The effects of poverty, unemployment, and HIV and AIDS can {{have a negative impact on}} children’s physical, psychological, social and intellectual development. In its quest to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable children, the South African government makes provision for the establishment of <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres</b> (Children’s Act 38 of 2005). <b>Drop-in</b> <b>centres</b> are facilities aimed at addressing the physical, emotional, psychological and social developmental needs of vulnerable children within their communities and closer to their homes. <b>Drop-in</b> <b>centres</b> provide basic services such as food, clothing, school support and hygiene, as well as optional services such as counselling, guidance, life skills development and educational and recreational programmes. The goal of this study was to explore the experiences of vulnerable children regarding services they receive from <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres.</b> A qualitative research approach was followed and in-depth interviews were conducted to obtain information from a group of 12 adolescent participants on their experiences of the services they received from <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres.</b> The participants were selected based on stratified random sampling. The findings of the study indicate that participants received basic services such as food, clothing and school attendance support, as well as psychosocial support services from the <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres.</b> The participants were of the opinion that the services they received at the <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres</b> resulted in an improvement in their general appearance, self-esteem, school performance, health, friendships and life skills. It can be concluded that participants’ experiences of the services provided by <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres</b> proved positive on a number of aspects. The services enhanced their quality of life, their dignity and their general sense of well-being. The findings suggest that <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres</b> can attain their purpose as an intervention strategy for providing accessible, community-based services to meet the physical, emotional and social developmental needs of vulnerable children. The participants as a group of vulnerable children, benefited from the services which they received, which is in support of developmental social welfare. It is important that services are provided within an environment in which children’s rights to confidentiality and respect are upheld. Recommendations include that increased funding is essential for maintaining the basic services of <b>drop-in</b> <b>centres,</b> as well as expanding the optional services such as sport and recreation programmes. As the findings of the study cannot be generalised because of the small sample size, further research on the topic is recommended.

2500|$|Project Wagtail was {{the brainchild}} of {{resident}} Jez Lilley who received a £15,000 grant from Birmingham City Council in 1988 to help transform an area of wasteland to the south of the estate into a nature reserve. He campaigned to schools and businesses and around 500 people helped plant trees and shrubs in the area. Lilley also established a gardening club and was given an office at The Fort Centre, on Farnborough Road. The office became a <b>drop-in</b> <b>centre</b> for unwanted pets and a bird of prey centre was set up, housing fourteen birds. Lilley also envisaged a footpath to encircle the estate and this idea was presented to Richard Temple Cox in 1994, who later offered Lilley a job as Community Development Officer with an environmental remit. Project Wagtail became his priority and it was funded {{over the next two years}} by the HAT, Groundwork Birmingham and Birmingham City Council. The end result was a [...] network of footpaths around the perimeter of and bisecting the estate. This provided opportunities for the installation of public art and also provided pedestrian access to amenities. As part of the project, incidental open spaces were created, for example at Thomas Walk in the centre of the Watton Green area of the estate and Innsworth Green in Manby East and West. Innsworth Green is more landscaped than that at Thomas Walk.|$|E
