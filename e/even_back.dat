25|$|The first epigraphic {{reference}} to {{the name of this}} place occurs in a 6th-century AD copper plate found in Mallasarul village under Galsi Police Station.

25|$|Cannonball {{later on}} saves {{the life of}} {{international}} rock star Lila Cheney, with whom he becomes romantically involved. Due {{to the nature of}} Lila's career, their relationship went slowly. Cannonball helps lead the team through many adventures, which take them across time and space, from ancient Scotland to other galaxies, <b>even</b> <b>back</b> home to Kentucky. There, he teams up with longtime X-Man Dazzler and his own brother Jay to save Lila's life.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a USA Today/Gallup poll {{indicated}} that Barack Obama enjoyed a 13-point lead over Hillary Clinton {{three weeks after}} they were tied in the pre-primary polls at New Hampshire. <b>Even</b> <b>back</b> in December 2007, Clinton was leading in the polls with 47%, and Obama had 26%. Clinton's aides responded to this by saying {{that she had the}} money to continue a national campaign. Former President Bill Clinton's campaign failed in the first five state primaries and caucuses when he ran in 1992. Despite these circumstances, Bill Clinton not only won the Democratic nomination, but he won the election.|$|E
25|$|The first {{farmers of}} Stratford {{resided in the}} village and went out to their farms, located one to three miles away, to do the work of the farm. The Nichols and White Plains areas were the first to be {{cultivated}} and settled within the present-day bounds of Trumbull, due to the fertile soil, spring-fed ponds and natural meadows found there and their proximity to the main village located less than three miles away. In the mid-seventeenth century in the Colony of Connecticut, it was very common for freemen to establish a farm or several farms in the fertile upland or countryside while maintaining a substantial townhouse in the village or <b>even</b> <b>back</b> in England.|$|E
25|$|Donets {{suffered}} greatly <b>even</b> <b>back</b> in the 18th century, when old oaks {{were cut}} down along its banks. The industrial {{development of the}} 19th century reduced the groundwater levels of the basin. This resulted in shallowing {{of the river and}} slowed down navigation. Until the mid-19th century, the river was rich in fish which population rapidly declined since then. The water quality is graded as level IV (polluted) to V (dirty). The main pollutants are fertilizers, petroleum, phenols, zinc, chromium and copper. In Kharkiv Oblast, water is contaminated by industrial and communal wastes of Belgorod, Izyum and Shebekino cities, but the water is partially purified through the Pechenga Reservoir. The density of plants and thus the contamination increase downstream in Donetsk and Luhansk areas, especially around Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, about 400km from the mouth. Some tributaries of the Donets, such as Kozenyi Butt, Bakhmut and Lugan are so polluted that consuming fish caught there is dangerous.|$|E

500|$|Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo set his drum kit on the {{concrete}} and the kit went [...] "all over the place" [...] while playing. Lombardo asked Gene Hoglan to hold his kit together, while recording [...] "Chemical Warfare", with Hoglan thinking, [...] "I hope he does this {{in one or two}} takes, because this is rough." [...] Hoglan was coaching Lombardo how to use double-bass drums to improve his drumming ability and speed; Lombardo asserts Hoglan was [...] "an amazing double-bass player <b>even</b> <b>back</b> then", although Hoglan played double bass since a short time then. Eddy Schreyer provided audio mastering and digital remastering, with the cover art design created by Vince Gutierrez. Haunting the Chapel was darker and more thrash-oriented than Show No Mercy, and laid the groundwork for the future direction in the band's sound.|$|E

Some of our folksong exponents seem to think you have to go way back in the hills and drag out the worst singer in the world before it's authentic. Now, this is nonsense...Just because he's old and got three arthritic fingers and two strings left on the banjo doesn't prove anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|A major {{program in}} 1988 was the initial {{production}} and deployment {{phase of the}} mobile-subscriber equipment system (MSE). The MSE system called for setting up {{the equivalent of a}} mobile telephone network on a battlefield, allowing a commander or Tactical Operations Center (TOC) to connect mobile telephones and fax machines in vehicles with each other, sending and receiving secure information. Talking through signal nodes, MSE established a seamless connection from the battlefield <b>even</b> <b>back</b> to commercial telephone lines. Significant to the Signal soldiers, MSE was fielded on the backs of Humvee, rather than on the larger, less-mobile M35 2-1/2 ton cargo trucks—the [...] "deuce and a half".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the {{understanding}} of the nature of early Earth went through a transformation from a biblical or deist interpretation to a naturalistic one. <b>Even</b> <b>back</b> in the early 18th century, Plutonists had argued for an ancient Earth, but the full impact of the depth of time involved in the Pre-Adamitic period was not commonly accepted until uniformitarianism as presented in Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology of 1830. While vast aeons of time were involved, the narrative of the pre-Adamitic world was still influenced by the biblical story of creation in this transition. A striking example is a description from [...] "Memoires of Ichtyosauri and Plesiosauri", 1839: ...|$|E

2500|$|Etruscan and Roman temples {{emphasised}} {{the front}} of the building, which followed Greek temple models and typically consisted of wide steps leading to a portico with columns, a pronaos, and usually a triangular pediment above, which was filled with statuary in the most grand examples; this was as often in terracotta as stone, and no examples have survived except as fragments. [...] Especially in the earlier periods, further statuary might be placed on the roof, and the entablature [...] decorated with antefixes and other elements, all of this being brightly painted. [...] However, unlike the Greek models, which generally gave equal treatment to all sides of the temple, which could be viewed and approached from all directions, the side and rear walls of Roman temples might be largely undecorated (as in the Pantheon, Rome and Vic), inaccessible by steps (as in the Maison Carrée and Vic), and <b>even</b> <b>back</b> on to other buildings. As in the Maison Carrée, columns at the side might be half-columns, emerging from ("engaged with" [...] in architectural terminology) the wall.|$|E
2500|$|The {{form of the}} Roman {{temple was}} mainly derived from the Etruscan model, but using Greek styles.

[...] The platform on which the temple sat was typically raised higher in Roman examples than Greek, with up ten or twelve or more steps rather than the three typical in Greek temples; the Temple of Claudius was raised twenty steps. These steps were normally only at the front, and typically not the whole width of that.|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. <b>Even</b> <b>back</b> in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
