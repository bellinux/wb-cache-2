50|$|In higher-mass stars, the {{dominant}} energy production {{process is the}} CNO cycle, which is a catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries {{and in the end}} produces a helium nucleus as with the proton-proton chain. During a complete CNO cycle, 25.0 MeV of energy is released. The difference in energy production of this cycle, compared to the proton-proton chain reaction, is accounted for by the energy lost through neutrino emission. The CNO cycle is very temperature sensitive, a 10% rise of temperature would produce a 350% rise in energy production. About 90% of the CNO cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15% of the star's mass, hence it is strongly concentrated at the core. This results in such an intense outward energy flux that convective energy transfer become more important than does radiative transfer. As a result, the core region becomes a convection zone, which stirs the hydrogen <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> and keeps it well mixed with the surrounding proton-rich region. This core convection occurs in stars where the CNO cycle contributes more than 20% of the total energy. As the star ages and the core temperature increases, the region occupied by the convection zone slowly shrinks from 20% of the mass down to the inner 8% of the mass. Our Sun produces 10% of its energy from the CNO cycle.|$|E

40|$|Background and Design: Basal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC) {{is the most}} frequently observed cancer. Its ethiopathogenesis is not totally clarified. In recent years {{one of the factors}} mentioned on ethiopathogenesis is ‘fusion regions’. In our study we aimed to investigate whether the number of BCC is more or not in anatomic areas which contain more fusion regions. Materials and Methods: Three hundred twenty-eight BCC case whose anatomic region is indicated in histopathology report is taken into study. Fusion regions are determined according to the mapping system given in Tessier’s publication. First the number of total <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> for each anatomic area on face is calculated. Then, the number of BCC located in each anatomic area and the number of <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> located in the same anatomic area are compared. In conclusion findings are commented with respect to cause result relationship. Results: The most important anatomic areas with respect to <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> number were forehead and lip. In forehead and lip there were 11 fusion regions. 34 BCC on forehead and 14 BCC on lip are observed. There were 10 fusion regions on around the eye and a total of 74 BCC were observed on both periorbital area. But 9 fusion area is detected on nose area where BCC is mostly present (135). Conclusion: More BCC is not observed in anatomic areas where <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> is plenty compared to anatomic areas where <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> is less. As a result; in BCC development, it is seen that only fusion regions do not have ethiopathogenetic importance...|$|E

To better understand the muscle dysfunction after spinal fusion, this descriptive study evaluated electrophysiology and histology changes in paraspinal muscle of rabbits with and without fusion. Three New Zealand white rabbits underwent 2 -level posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. Anothor 3 rabbits underwent surgical exposure alone and served as sham control. Pre-operative and follow-up electromyography (EMG) and histological assessment were performed in a 6 -month interval. All fusion achieved solid union judged by post-mortem examination. Root mean square (RMS) of EMG showed decrease in both fusion and control group immediately after surgery, but the control group recovered to pre-operative value at 6 months follow-up. At 6 months after operation, the fusion group showed lower RMS in fused region than adjacent region. In term of median frequency (MF) changes, the control group did not show obvious difference between pre- and post-operative period. However, fusion group showed obvious decrease of MF in <b>fusion</b> <b>region,</b> but increase in lower adjacent region. Histology reviewed fatty infiltration in <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> at 6 months after spinal fusion.

To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} mechanical stimulation on posterior sclera reinforcement (PSR), the rabbit scleral fibroblasts after PSR were subjected to stretch in vitro and MMP- 2 and TIMP- 2 expression of scleral fibroblasts were evaluated. Three-week-old rabbits were monocularly performed by eyelid suturation randomly to prepare experimental myopia eye. After 60 days, the experimental myopia eyes were treated by PSR. After 6 months, the posterior pole scleral fibroblasts (normal sclera- group A, sclera after operation- group B and <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> of sclera and reinforcing band – group C) were isolated and cultured in vitro. The cells were subjected to cyclic stretch regimens (sine wave, 3 % and 6 % elongation amplitude, 0. 1 Hz, 48 h duration) by FX- 4000 Tension System. The MMP- 2 and TIMP- 2 expression of scleral fibroblasts were evaluated by ELISA method. The results show that after cyclic stretch to the scleral fibroblasts of the normal sclera and the sclera after operation, the MMP- 2 expression was significantly reduced and the TIMP- 2 expression was significantly increased, the MMP- 2 and TIMP- 2 expression of the scleral fibroblasts of the <b>fusion</b> <b>region</b> after operation was no changed.

40|$|Various {{cellular}} {{and molecular}} events {{are involved in}} palatogenesis, including apoptosis, epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell proliferation, and cell migration. Smad 2 and Snail, which are well-known key mediators of the transforming growth factor beta (Tgf-β) pathway, {{play a crucial role}} in the regulation of palate development. Regulatory effects of microRNA 200 b (miR- 200 b) on Smad 2 and Snail in palatogenesis have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between palate development regulators miR- 200 b and Tgf-β-mediated genes. Expression of miR- 200 b, E-cadherin, Smad 2, and Snail was detected in the mesenchyme of the mouse palate, while miR- 200 b was expressed in the medial edge epithelium (MEE) and palatal mesenchyme. After the contact of palatal shelves, miR- 200 b was no longer expressed in the mesenchyme around the <b>fusion</b> <b>region.</b> The binding activity of miR- 200 b to both Smad 2 and Snail was examined using a luciferase assay. MiR- 200 b directly targeted Smad 2 and Snail at both cellular and molecular levels. The function of miR- 200 b was determined by overexpression via a lentiviral vector in the palatal shelves. Ectopic expression of miR- 200 b resulted in suppression of these Tgf-β-mediated regulators and changes of apoptosis and cell proliferation in the palatal <b>fusion</b> <b>region.</b> These results suggest that miR- 200 b plays a crucial role in regulating the Smad 2, Snail, and in apoptosis during palatogenesis by acting as a direct non-coding, influencing factor. Furthermore, the molecular interactions between miR- 200 b and Tgf-β signaling are important for proper palatogenesis and especially for palate fusion.

Here, we used molecular modeling techniques to assess membrane interactions, structure, and hydrophobic properties of the fusion-active peptide representing this region, several of its homologs from different HIV- 1 strains, as well as a peptide - defective gp 41 phenotype - unable to mediate cell-cell fusion and virus entry. It is shown that the wild-type peptides bind to the water-membrane interface in alpha-helical conformation, while the mutant adopts partly destabilized helix-break-helix structure on the membrane surface. The wild-type peptides reveal specific "tilted oblique-oriented" pattern of hydrophobicity on their surfaces - the property specific for <b>fusion</b> <b>regions</b> of other viruses. Fusion peptides penetrate into the membrane with their N-termini and reveal "fine-tuning" interactions with membrane and water environments: the shift of this balance (e. g., due to point mutations) may dramatically change the mode of membrane binding, and therefore, may cause loss of fusion activity.

40|$|In {{this work}} a new PU Algorithm is {{addressed}} {{which is based}} on the <b>fusion</b> of a <b>region</b> growing and an iteratively working 2 -D least-square PU. A quality assessment is made by several comparisons of the SAR-DEM with a military DEM of the area of Athens/Greece which shows that the performance of the presented PU fusion is significantly better in comparison to the performance of the conventional PU methods...|$|R
