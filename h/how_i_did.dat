500|$|Adams' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] {{was at the}} 80th Academy Awards ceremony in 2008. Performing at approximately 6:01 pm local time, Adams was reportedly very nervous during and after her performance, revealing to The Huffington Post, [...] "I don't know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that. It's {{the thing that was}} the most terrifying that I've ever done, and the thing I'm most proud of in my career." [...] Subsequently, Adams told Vulture.com that she would likely perform at the Academy Awards again [...] "As long as [...] wasn't doing it by self".|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anne Hutchinson (1591–1643) was the {{daughter}} of Francis Marbury, a school teacher and Anglican clergyman in England with strong Puritan leanings. She was deeply imbued with religious thought as a youngster, but as a young woman had come to mistrust the priests of the Church of England who did not seem to act according to their principles. [...] Her religious beliefs were leaning toward atheism when she claimed to hear the voice of God, and [...] "at last he let me see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> oppose Jesus Christ... and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> turne in upon a Covenant of works... from which time the Lord did discover to me all sorts of Ministers, and how they taught, and to know what voyce I heard". [...] From this point forward, this inner voice became the source of her guidance.|$|E

Harrison told British DJ Nicky Horne in August 1974: [...] "It just blew my mind, because I heard it from my pop background. I said , 'That's a hit … It's a lovely song – you should write more of these, Ravi.' And he said, 'Oh, you know, I've been trying not to write these for years.'" ...|$|E
