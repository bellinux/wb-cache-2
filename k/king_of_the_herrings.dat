40|$|Catch {{distributions}} {{and results}} of acoustic surveys indicate that North Sea herring had an unusually northern distribution during <b>the</b> summers <b>of</b> 1988 - 1990. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> {{may even have}} temporarily left the North Sea, and migrated to the Faroe plateau. <b>The</b> anomalous distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> in 1988 - 1990 appears {{to be related to}} a short-term climatic variation. The years were characterized by high water temperatures during the preceding winter, and by a low abundance <b>of</b> Calanus finmarchicus, <b>the</b> principal food <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring.</b> <b>The</b> low abundance <b>of</b> C. finmarchicus was probably related to the high water temperatures. Both the high temperature and <b>the</b> scarcity <b>of</b> food could explain <b>the</b> northern distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring.</b> Apart from <b>the</b> 1988 - 1990 anomaly, a long-term northward shift of catches occurred from 1960 to 1990. This northward trend in catches coincided with a gradual increase in winter temperature, and a sustained decrease <b>of</b> C. finmarchicus. <b>The</b> long-term shift in herring catches, therefore, could signify a gradual change in distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock, brought about by the same factors that caused the 1988 - 1990 anomaly. If the recent climatic trend towards higher winter temperatures continues, <b>the</b> anomalous distribution <b>of</b> <b>herring</b> in 1988 - 1990 could become the normal pattern in future years...|$|R

Current accepted theory points to a change in oceanic current and the subsequent decrease in salinity in the North Sea region, resulting in a change in plankton availability for larval <b>herring</b> as <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recruitment failure during the 1970 's. <b>The</b> vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> population to large fluctuations in recruitment makes <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> this fishery a difficult prospect.

40|$|During {{the first}} years after <b>the</b> {{re-opening}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Sea <b>herring</b> fishery in 1983, a relatively high proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catches in early summer was taken in the eastern North Sea. After 1986, <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catch in the eastern North Sea gradually declined. It is assumed that the high catches in the eastern North Sea in the early 1980 s were due to a delayed migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> from <b>the</b> eastern to <b>the</b> western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Sea. This delayed departure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> from <b>the</b> eastern North Sea could {{have been caused by}} favourable food conditions in this area. Data on Calanus finmarchicus from the Continuous Plankton Recorder show that <b>the</b> seasonal cycle <b>of</b> this copepod in the eastern North Sea was delayed during the period 1976 – 1984, which resulted in an prolonged food supply for <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> in this area. It is likely that this extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding season induced <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> to delay their departures from the eastern North Sea. When the Calanus season shortened after 1985, <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> advanced their departure from the eastern North Sea. There was a delay of one or two years between <b>the</b> shortening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding season and <b>the</b> earlier departure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring</b> from <b>the</b> eastern North Sea. This suggests <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a certain conservatism in <b>the</b> migrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herring.</b> It seems that <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> departure from <b>the</b> eastern North Sea is based not only on the food situation in the current year, but also on <b>the</b> average timing <b>of</b> food production in earlier years...|$|R
