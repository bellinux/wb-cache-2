We focus on GUN (Global Understanding Environment) framework proposed by IOG (Industrial Ontologies Group) for intelligent services on industrial resources. The resources and infrastructure of the electricity power network are distributed. The interoperability, automation and integration features of GUN allow us to joint and arrange cooperation among heterogeneous resources of electricity network domain. The interaction and cooperation among resources in GUN platform are realized via resource agents. Based on discussions held with the domain expert we also decided to use agent approach for automated collection of additional information from heterogeneous resources and integrate this information to the operator interface (Dashboard).

50|$|The {{history of}} power {{generation}} and distribution in Dhaka city is eventful. Tradition goes that the Nawab of Dhaka introduced electricity in Dhaka in 1901 when he installed a small generator in his residence Ahsan Manzil. Power generation for public use started in 1930 when a privately owned company M/S DEVCO developed an <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Private companies managed power generation and distribution system in Dhaka {{until the end}} of British rule in 1947. In 1957 the Government of Pakistan took over the private owned companies in Dhaka and in 1959 they were placed under the newly established East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA). After the liberation of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) replaced EPWAPDA's Power wing in 1972. The power generation and distribution system of Dhaka was managed by BPDB until 1991. An autonomous organisation named Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) was created by an ordinance promulgated by the President in March 1990 to improve services to the consumers and to enhance revenue collection by reducing the prevailing high system loss. DESA took over the <b>electricity</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> in and around Dhaka city in October 1991, but the jurisdiction of power generation remained with BPDB. Later in 1998, a subsidiary company Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO) was formed to take over a few areas of the Dhaka city from DESA. And in 2008, DESA was abolished and replaced by DPDC.|$|E
