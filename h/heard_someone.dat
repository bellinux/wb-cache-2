25|$|After {{capsizing}} {{the main}} engines of Finn-Baltic immediately {{went out and}} the emergency diesel generator started automatically. However, it ran only {{for a short time}} and after a while even battery-operated lights dimmed and died out. The chief engineer <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> yelling in the darkness and found the chief officer from the corridor outside the control room in a shock-like state. After getting a case of soft drinks from the ship's stores and dry clothes for the chief officer they waited several hours in the switchboard room, until the rising water forced them to move to the aftmost part of the engine room next to the propeller shaft. Even before the accident the chief engineer had planned to find his way to this location in case the vessel capsized because there was no double bottom and, once free of its cargo, the combination would stay afloat upside-down. After 20 minutes they <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> banging the hull outside the ship.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of July 14, 1924, 9-year-old Francis McDonnell was {{reported}} missing by his parents. He failed to return home after playing catch with friends in the Port Richmond neighbourhood of Staten Island. A search was organised and his body was found—hanging by a tree—in a wooded area near his home. He had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with his suspenders. According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left hamstring had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated {{that he intended to}} castrate the boy but fled when he <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> approaching the area.|$|E
25|$|At first Genie {{usually did}} {{not listen to}} anyone unless someone {{directly}} addressed her or if Curtiss played classical music on the piano, and if someone spoke to her she almost never acknowledged the other person and usually walked away after a while. In {{an effort to get}} Genie to listen to other people Curtiss began reading children's stories to her, and at first she did not seem to engage, but one day in mid-October 1971 Curtiss saw that Genie was clearly listening and responding to her. After that she paid attention to people even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. She became somewhat more sociable in her interactions with people and became somewhat more responsive, although she still frequently showed no obvious signs that she <b>heard</b> <b>someone.</b> Her reactions to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took several minutes before giving a response to somebody.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|That month Arnold {{offered the}} theme to Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson, {{who was very}} enthusiastic; Arnold said he [...] "never <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> {{screaming}} down the phone". A week later he sent the band the rough demo, which they approved. Manson requested a small change in the lyrics, disliking the line [...] "I know when to kiss and I know when to kill", so Arnold and Black changed [...] "I" [...] to [...] "we" [...] for the final version.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, {{documentary}} filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, who {{was greatly}} moved by Till's open-casket photograph, started background research for {{a feature film}} he planned to make about Till's murder.

Mose Wright <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> with [...] "a lighter voice" [...] affirm that Till was the one in his front yard immediately before Bryant and Milam drove away with the boy. Beauchamp spent the next nine years producing The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, released in 2003.|$|E

500|$|Reports {{conflict}} {{about who}} shot first, {{but after two}} members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: [...] "He got behind me in the wood , and he put the gun on my shoulder, and them crackers was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz' Syl let him have it." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|According to Wiesenthal, on 20 April 1943, Second Lieutenant Gustav Wilhaus, {{second in}} command at the Janowska camp, decided to shoot 54 Jewish intellectuals in celebration of Hitler's 54th birthday. Unable to find enough such people still alive at Janowska, Wilhaus ordered a roundup of prisoners from the {{satellite}} camps. Wiesenthal and two other inmates {{were taken from the}} Eastern Railway camp to the execution site, a trench [...] deep and [...] long at a nearby sandpit. The men were stripped and led through [...] "the Hose", a six- or seven-foot wide barbed wire corridor to the execution ground. The victims were shot and their bodies allowed to fall into the pit. Wiesenthal, waiting to be shot, <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> called out his name. He was returned alive to the camp; Kohlrautz had convinced his superiors that Wiesenthal was the best man available to paint a giant poster in honour of Hitler's birthday.|$|E

500|$|While {{the trial}} progressed, Leflore County Sheriff George Smith, Howard, and several reporters, {{both black and}} white, {{attempted}} to locate Collins and Loggins. They could not, but found three witnesses who had seen Collins and Loggins with Milam and Bryant on Leslie Milam's property. Two of them testified that they <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> being beaten, blows, and cries. One testified so quietly the judge ordered him several times to speak louder; he said he heard the victim call out, [...] "Mama, Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy." [...] Judge Curtis Swango allowed Carolyn Bryant to testify, but {{not in front of}} the jury, after the prosecution objected that her testimony was irrelevant to Till's abduction and murder. It may have been leaked in any case to the jury. Sheriff Strider testified for the defense his theory that Till was alive, and that the body retrieved from the river was white. A doctor from Greenwood stated on the stand that the body was too decomposed to identify, and therefore had been in the water too long for it to be Till.|$|E
500|$|Raised in Columbia, Maryland, Greenwald {{first went}} to a Guitar Center store at age 14 to buy his first {{electric}} guitar. After that however, he rarely went to the former shop and instead bought equipment from local stores like Atomic Music in Beltsville, Maryland {{for most of his}} life. He disliked Guitar Center for its [...] "dystopian" [...] and [...] "unpleasant" [...] environment, {{which was one of the}} major parts of him being influenced to make No Stairway: [...] "I wanted to take something unattractive and be able to extract beauty from it. I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud. [...] I wanted to inspect little nuances, capture them, and paint with them." [...] While living in New York City, there was a point where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great-sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software. While waiting for the train one day, he went to a Guitar Center store near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom. At the store, he <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> playing a Green Day song on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument's poor tone: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} game of the 1994–95 season against Leyton Orient, Primus made his debut as a {{substitute}} coming on for the injured Mark Newson. His next appearance for Barnet, against Scarborough, was described as the [...] "worst performance of [...] career" [...] in his autobiography. He {{went on to say}} that he was [...] "weighed down by the burden of expectation" [...] and <b>heard</b> <b>someone</b> say he was the [...] "worst player we've ever had at Barnet". He was often nervous before matches and recited the Lord's Prayer as a way of coping with his anxiety. At the end of the season, Primus was runner-up in the voting for the Player of the Season and was man of the match on several occasions. Barnet had a poor start to the next season and they were at the bottom of the table in mid-September. After beating Northampton Town 2–0, Barnet went on an 11-game winning streak which ended at Colchester United despite Primus scoring a goal. He would go on to score five goals in the season; more than any other season in his career. Once again, he was runner-up in the Player of the Season award, this time to the goalkeeper Maik Taylor.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of tinnitus: {{subjective}} tinnitus and objective tinnitus. Tinnitus is usually subjective, meaning that others cannot hear it.

Occasionally, tinnitus may be <b>heard</b> by <b>someone</b> else using a stethoscope: in which case, it is objective tinnitus.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of tinnitus is usually {{based on the}} person's description. A number of questionnaires exist that assess how much tinnitus is interfering with a person's life. The diagnosis is commonly assisted with an audiogram and neurological exam. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as with MRI, may be performed. Other tests are suitable when tinnitus occurs with the same rhythm as the heartbeat. Occasionally, the sound may be <b>heard</b> by <b>someone</b> else using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as objective tinnitus.|$|R
