30|$|First, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of <b>demand,</b> the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> human <b>capital</b> is from the enterprises. Because the level of human capital in the industrial sector is higher than that in the agricultural sector, the government should support the development of industrial sectors in natural resources-rich areas. Only when the industrial sectors in these areas develop, the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> human <b>capital</b> increases, and the gains from human capital increase, do residents have the desire to invest more in human capital. In this way, the development of the industrial sector will bring about a general improvement in the level of human capital.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to its own specialist manufacturing role, Birmingham retained its position as the commercial and mercantile centre for an integrated regional economy that included the more basic manufacturing and raw material production areas of Staffordshire and Worcestershire. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> to feed rapid economic expansion saw the town become a major financial centre with extensive international connections. During the early 18th century finance was largely provided by the iron merchants and by extensive systems of trade credit between manufacturers; it was an iron merchant Sampson Lloyd and major manufacturer John Taylor who combined to form the town's first bank – the early Lloyds Bank – in 1765. Further establishments followed and by 1800 the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain, including London. Birmingham's booming economy gave the town a growing professional sector, {{with the number of}} physicians and lawyers increasing by 25% between 1767 and 1788. It has been estimated that between a quarter and a third of Birmingham's inhabitants could be thought of as middle class {{in the last quarter of}} the 18th century and this fuelled a large growth in the demand for tailors, mercers and drapers. Trade directories reveal that there more drapers than edge tool makers in 1767, and insurance records from 1777 to 1786 suggest that well over half of local businesses were engaged in the trading or service sectors rather than directly in industry.|$|E

50|$|In the {{classical}} theory supply and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> determines the optimal interest rates. The {{rate of interest}} that {{is determined by the}} intersection of investment and saving is the price of investible resource (capital). The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> is done by the entrepreneur for further investment and for the productive purpose. But the productivity of capital is dependent on the law of variable proportion. Which means as more and more of capital is employed the productivity from capital goes on decreasing. Therefore, the entrepreneur will employ only capital up to that level where the rate of interest is equal to the Marginal productivity of capital(MPK).,where MPK is the marginal productivity of capital and R/P is real rental for capital. It shows that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>capital</b> is inversely related to rate of interest.There are many other factors which affect the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>capital.</b> On the other hand, supply of capital is positively related to the rate of interest. As the rate of interest increases the savings increases and vice versa. Thus the entrepreneur will employ the capital where MPK is equal to real price of capital.The optimal rate of interest rate is determined by the intersection of demand and supply curves. If the rate of interest rises above the equilibrium interest rates the demand for the investment will decline and the supply of savings will increase. As there is excess of savings than demand in the economy the market forces will bring the interest rate to the original interest rates.Now, if the interest rates fall below the optimal level then the there is excess of demand than supply in the economy and hence, the market forces will adjust the interest rates.|$|E

40|$|Background : International {{research}} has shown that workers have a rather low level of financial literacy. Financial literacy is associated with lifetime planning and saving for retirement. This article focuses on the role of financial literacy in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> human <b>capital</b> and on-the-job training among older workers in Japan. Workers with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to demand human capital, plan to enter training programs, and desire to work after retirement. Objective : Does financial literacy affect the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> additional human <b>capital</b> among older Japanese workers? How does the level of financial literacy affect the age of retirement and plans for working after retirement from a career job in Japan? Methods : This paper analyzes data from a national survey of Japanese employees. We estimate the effect of financial literacy on the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> additional human <b>capital</b> to remain competitive for promotions and for finding employment after retirement. Results : Higher levels of financial literacy are associated with greater <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> additional human <b>capital</b> and <b>for</b> participation in on-the-job training programs among older workers in Japan. Conclusions : Given the rapid aging of the Japanese population and the decline in the total population, providing employment opportunities for older workers (ages 60 and older) is a key to sustaining economic growth and per capita income. The analysis indicates that greater levels of financial literacy are associated with a desire for more training and human capital. Thus, enhancing the level of financial literacy among older workers may be a key to maintaining economic wellbeing...|$|R
