5|$|In {{his first}} cabinet decision, Modi {{set up a}} team to {{investigate}} black money. On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament. In the days following the <b>demonetisation,</b> banks across the country faced severe cash shortages, which had detrimental effects {{on a number of}} small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. Following Modi's announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply. There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced. Post the <b>demonetisation,</b> the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% and Self assessment tax collections rose by 34.25%.|$|E
5|$|One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing {{purposes}} at the Royal Mint, {{and intended}} for melting, but recovered from circulation. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the <b>demonetisation</b> of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, the Union Bank of Burma {{formed a}} Currency Board which took {{over control of}} the issuing of {{currency}} and a more important change to the currency was the introduction of the decimal system in which 1 kyat was decimalised into 100 pyas. On 12 February 1958, the Union Bank of Burma introduced the first kyat notes, in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 100 kyats. These were very similar in design to the last series of rupee notes, issued earlier. Later on, 21 August 1958, 20 and 50 kyats notes were introduced. The 50 and 100 kyat notes were demonetised on 15 May 1964. This was the first of several <b>demonetisations,</b> ostensibly carried out with the aim of fighting black marketeering.|$|R

25|$|In 2003, rumours {{of another}} pending <b>demonetisation</b> {{swept through the}} country, {{resulting}} in the junta issuing official denials, but this time, the demonetization did not materialise. In 2004, the sizes of the 200, 500, and 1,000 kyats were reduced in size (to make all Burmese banknotes uniform in size) but larger notes were allowed to remain in circulation. 50 pyas, 1, 5, and 10 kyat banknotes are now rarely seen, because of their low value.|$|E

Inflation in 1965 was 635%. In late 1965, the 'new rupiah' was brought in, at 1 new rupiah to 1,000 old rupiah. The official exchange rate was set initially at Rp 0.25 to US$1 as of 13 December 1965, a rate that did not represent reality, as the multiple exchange rate system remained {{in place for the}} time being.|$|E
25|$|Between 2005 and 2008 new, lighter fifty-paise, one-, two- and five-rupee coins were introduced, {{made from}} {{ferritic}} stainless steel. The move {{was prompted by}} the melting-down of older coins, whose face value was less than their scrap value. The <b>demonetisation</b> of the 25-(chawanni) paise coin and all paise coins below it took place, and {{a new series of}} coins (50 paise– nicknamed athanni– one, two, five and ten rupees, with the new rupee symbol) were put into circulation in 2011. Coins commonly in circulation are one, two, five and ten rupees. Although it is still legal tender, the 50-paise (athanni) coin is rarely seen in circulation.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labor laws, {{to make it harder}} for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt laborers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1% to 3% over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5%, making it the fastest growing large economy. This was basis a revised formula introduced a year after he took office, which surprised a lot of economists. However, this rate of growth had fallen significantly to 6.1%, even by the revised metric, by his third year in office. This fall has been blamed on the exercise of <b>demonetisation</b> of currency.|$|E
