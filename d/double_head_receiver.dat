30|$|The APTEEN is a single-cluster head-based {{protocol}} with nodes of {{the same}} initial energy. The cluster head (CH) needs to perform extra computations which bring about imbalanced node energy consumption and premature death of nodes. Yet, the algorithm based on <b>double</b> cluster <b>heads</b> (DCH), commonly used for LEACH, can eliminate the defects. The proposed <b>double</b> <b>heads</b> static cluster (DHSC) algorithm [11] considers the area density, but does not consider the node residual energy; whereas, a <b>double</b> cluster <b>heads</b> topology control algorithm based on the energy threshold which cater to heterogeneous wireless sensor network (DCCCA) [12] considers those factors but too complicated.|$|R
