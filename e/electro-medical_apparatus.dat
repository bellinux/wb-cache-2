We also presented a methodology for recording and analyzing the information from a force plate used to give the values of forces and moments during the walking process. For that we used a complex computerized system with a high-speed video cam, an <b>electro-medical</b> <b>apparatus</b> set and a force plate with amplified signal. In the final part of the paper we presented the results and conclusions of these analyses...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based {{wireless}} services employing Radio over Optical Wireless (RoOW) {{to get a}} {{high performance}} transmission while eliminating the drawback of possible radio wave interference to <b>electro-medical</b> <b>apparatus</b> in indoor communication system. An optical Intensity-modulated Direct-detection (IM/DD) system using RF subcarrier modulation is considered and OFDM RF signals are assumed as the subcarrier. The transmission performance is evaluated by simulation considering the influence of peak clip of OFDM signal and different radio fading scenarios. Simulation result shows that the modulation index m, optical transmit power, radio environments are important factors which affect the communication performance significantly. It also shows when the received optical power is larger than - 20 dBm, {{which is a very}} practical power level, the value of BER becomes almost independent of the optical power and the radio environment becomes more important. That means the indoor optical wireless communication (OWC) has high transmission performance and the proposed relay system is a very available system as long as the radio environment is eligible. We believe that the proposed system is a practical system and can provide a low-cost, high-quality wireless services for RF sensitive areas...|$|E
50|$|The United States {{medical device}} {{industry}} {{is one of}} the largest markets globally, exceeding $110 billion annually. In 2012 it represented 38% of the global market and currently more than 6500 medical device companies exist nationwide. These companies are primarily small-scale operations with fewer than 50 employees. The most medical device companies are in the states: California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, and Georgia. Washington, Wisconsin, and Texas also have high employment levels in the medical device industry. The industry is divided into the following branches: <b>Electro-Medical</b> Equipment, Irradiation <b>Apparatuses,</b> Surgical and Medical Instruments, Surgical Appliances and Supplies, and Dental Equipment and Supplies.|$|R
