5|$|It {{was created}} in the 1950s, to {{overcome}} the problems with supersonic planes taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. The program was canceled after a series of unsatisfactory results and a tragic accident on 4 November 1954, when test pilot Charles E. Richbourg was killed when the Sea Dart he was piloting disintegrated <b>in</b> <b>midair.</b> The four surviving planes were retired in 1957, but some were kept in reserve until 1962.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1957, a B-52 {{returning}} to Loring Air Force Base from a routine instrument training mission broke apart <b>in</b> <b>midair</b> and crashed near Morrell, New Brunswick, Canada, killing {{eight of the}} nine crew on board. Co-pilot Captain Joseph L. Church parachuted to safety.

5|$|The Model 1897 {{was used}} by American troops for {{purposes}} in World War I other than a force multiplier. American soldiers who were skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed where they could fire at enemy hand grenades <b>in</b> <b>midair.</b> This would deflect the grenades from falling into the American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the ground, where it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies <b>in</b> <b>midair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft <b>in</b> <b>midair</b> by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E

Equipment players collect include the Screw Attack, which allows Samus to somersault <b>in</b> <b>midair</b> and off certain surfaces, and new beam weapons that have limited ammunition.|$|E
5|$|National Airlines Flight 2511 was a {{domestic}} passenger flight from New York City, New York to Miami, Florida that exploded <b>in</b> <b>midair</b> on January 6, 1960.

5|$|The Adventure of Link has a {{more complex}} combat system than its predecessor. Armed with a sword and shield, Link must {{alternate}} between standing and crouching positions in order to attack enemies and defend himself; for example, the Iron Knuckle enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances until {{he has a chance}} to attack safely. Link has the ability to jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies, and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for downward and upward stabs <b>in</b> <b>midair.</b>|$|E

5|$|The ad {{opens on}} a young man {{dribbling}} in place. The music starts with a simple ostinato C–G–B–C line played by a muted synth bass. At 0:05, a young man wags his tongue while dribbling. This is a signature move of Jordan's. At 0:09, a player drives to the basket with his tongue hanging out.

5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them <b>in</b> <b>midair,</b> changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{prevalent}} hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning, {{in which the}} tit-tyrant flies upwards from its perch and then hovers midair while grabbing prey from the vegetation. A third and less frequently used strategy is flycatching, in which the bird flies away from its shrub to grab prey <b>in</b> <b>midair.</b> Prey can be grabbed either close to the bird's perch or at a short distance, which often requires the bird to pursue its prey. When pairs flycatch cooperatively, one bird quietly lurks within the shrub while the other snatches nearby insects; after about a dozen attacks, the birds switch positions.|$|E

5|$|With Panay dead, the {{situation}} in Panau becomes a free-for-all as foreign nations scramble to claim the oil. Russia, China and Japan send a fleet of supertankers to Panau, and the U.S. begins scrambling its military forces to defend the island. Rico is tasked with holding off the supertankers until reinforcements arrive, but a nuclear submarine suddenly surfaces. Rico investigates the submarine and finds Panay, alive but injured. Although Panay fires nuclear missiles at Russia, China, Japan and the U.S., his clothing snags {{on one of the}} missiles and he goes up with it. In pursuit, Rico grapples onto the missile; the men battle <b>in</b> <b>midair</b> as he disarms each missile.|$|E
5|$|Clear Rivers is {{introduced}} in the 2000 film Final Destination {{as one of the}} seniors from the fictional Mt.

Thirty nine days later, while at the memorial for the victims, she presents Alex a white rose as gratitude for saving her life.|$|E
5|$|The second {{prototype}} was canceled, so {{the first}} service test aircraft was built and flown. This was fitted with the J46 engines, which performed below specification. However, speeds in excess of Mach1 were attained in a shallow dive with this aircraft, making it the only supersonic seaplane to date. On 4 November 1954, Sea Dart BuNo 135762 disintegrated <b>in</b> <b>midair</b> over San Diego Bay during a demonstration for naval officials and the press, killing Convair test pilot Charles E. Richbourg when he inadvertently exceeded the airframe's limitations. Richbourg was a 31-year-old Navy veteran of the Second World War.
