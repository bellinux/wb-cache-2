25|$|Molar incisor hypomineralization, {{which seems}} to be {{increasingly}} common. While the cause is unknown it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Possible contributing factors that have been investigated include systemic factors such as high levels of dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the mother’s milk, premature birth and oxygen deprivation at birth, and certain disorders during the child’s first 3 years such as such as mumps, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, hypoparathyroidism, malnutrition, malabsorption, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D, chronic respiratory diseases, or undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease, which usually presents with mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Examples are vitamin A deficiency, folate deficiency, (scurvy), vitamin D deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, {{and vitamin}} K deficiency. In the medical literature, {{any of these}} may also be called by names on the pattern of <b>hypovitaminosis</b> or {{avitaminosis}} + of vitamin, for example, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> A, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> C, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is {{described}} as any deficiency of vitamin D. A vitamin D blood concentration standard for diagnosing <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D does not exist. In the past, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D has been defined by blood concentrations lower than 20 ng/ mL. [...] However, in more recent literature many researchers have considered 30 ng/ mL to be an insufficient concentration of vitamin D. [...] Subnormal levels of vitamin D are usually caused by poor nutrition {{or a lack of}} sun exposure. Risk factors for <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D include premature birth, darker skin pigmentation, obesity, malabsorption, and older age.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is a {{risk factor}} for depression; some studies have found that low levels of vitamin D are {{correlated}} with depressed feelings and are found in patients who have been diagnosed with depression. [...] <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is linked to the development and severity of depression ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is {{associated}} with several neuropsychiatric disorders including dementia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. There are several proposed mechanisms by which <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D may impact these disorders. One of these mechanisms is through neuronal apoptosis. Neuronal apoptosis is the programmed death of the neurons. <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D causes this specific apoptosis by decreasing the expression of cytochrome C and decreasing the cell cycle of neurons. Cytochrome C is a protein that promotes the activation of pro-apoptotic factors. A second mechanism is through the association of neurotrophic factors like nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). These neurotrophic factors are proteins {{that are involved in}} the growth and survival of developing neurons and they are involved in the maintenance of mature neurons.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin K {{deficiency}} or <b>hypovitaminosis</b> K {{is a form}} of avitaminosis [...] {{resulting from}} insufficient vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 or both.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D {{has also}} been {{associated}} with many other conditions, including both neurological and non neurological conditions. These include {{but are not limited}} to autism, diabetes, and osteoporosis.|$|E
50|$|Megaloblastic anemia {{not due to}} <b>hypovitaminosis</b> may {{be caused}} by antimetabolites that poison DNA {{production}} directly, such as some chemotherapeutic or antimicrobial agents (for example azathioprine or trimethoprim).|$|E
50|$|Vitamin E {{deficiency}} or <b>hypovitaminosis</b> E is {{a deficiency}} of vitamin E. It causes nerve problems due to poor conduction of electrical impulses along nerves due {{to changes in}} nerve membrane structure and function.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{is typically}} diagnosed {{by measuring the}} concentration of the prehormone calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) in the blood. which is a precursor to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol).

Iron Overload Disorder, Delayed onset muscle soreness, AIDS, HIV, Tumor-induced osteomalacia, <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D, infarction ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D {{has been}} {{associated}} with urbanisation in terms of both air pollution, which blocks UV light, and {{an increase in the number}} of people working indoors. The elderly are generally exposed to less UV light due to hospitalisation, immobility, institutionalisation, and being housebound, leading to decreased levels of vitamin D.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D {{has been}} {{associated}} with many neurological conditions. However, an actual mechanism of attack for each of the conditions has yet to be solidified. Many researchers have questioned whether the depletion of vitamin D actually causes these disorders or if vitamin D is a symptom of these disorders. Future research is needed to fully answer these questions.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} (VAD) or <b>hypovitaminosis</b> A {{is a lack}} {{of vitamin}} A in blood and tissues. It is common in poorer countries but rarely seen in more developed countries. Nyctalopia (night blindness) {{is one of the first}} signs of VAD. Xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, and complete blindness can also occur since Vitamin A has a major role in phototransduction.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin D is a {{steroid hormone}} that plays {{a vital role}} in calcium and {{phosphate}} absorption. In recent studies, several associations between low levels of vitamin D, or <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D, and neuropsychiatric disorders have begun to surface. [...] These disorders include, but are not limited to: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism.|$|E
50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D {{may be associated}} with a worse outcome for some cancers, but evidence is insufficient to recommend that vitamin D be prescribed for people with cancer. Taking vitamin D supplements has no significant effect on cancer risk. Vitamin D3, however, appears to decrease the risk of death from cancer but concerns with the quality of the data exist.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin D deficiency, or <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D, {{can result}} from {{inadequate}} nutritional intake of vitamin D, inadequate sunlight exposure (in particular sunlight with adequate ultraviolet B rays), disorders limiting vitamin D absorption, and conditions impairing vitamin D conversion into active metabolites—including certain liver, kidney, and hereditary disorders. Deficiency impairs bone mineralization, leading to bone softening diseases as rickets in children and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults.|$|E
5000|$|Obese {{individuals}} have {{lower levels of}} the circulating form of vitamin D, due to the likelihood of decreased bioavailability of vitamin D3 from food and sunlight due to the distribution in adipose tissue. A population-based cohort study in Spain tested 1226 subjects to determine the connection between obesity and <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D; the study reported, [...] "vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase risk of developing obesity." ...|$|E
50|$|The gold {{standard}} for the diagnosis of Vitamin B deficiency is a low blood level of Vitamin B. A low level of blood Vitamin B is a finding that normally {{can and should be}} treated by injections, supplementation, or dietary or lifestyle advice, {{but it is not a}} diagnosis. <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> B can result from a number of mechanisms, including those listed above. For determination of cause, further patient history, testing, and empirical therapy may be clinically indicated.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin D {{supplements}} {{have been}} widely marketed {{on the internet and}} elsewhere for their claimed anti-cancer properties. There is however insufficient evidence to recommend that vitamin D be prescribed for people with cancer, although {{there is some evidence that}} <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D may be associated with a worse outcome for some cancers. A 2014 systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found, [...] "no firm evidence that vitamin D supplementation decreases or increases cancer occurrence in predominantly elderly community-dwelling women." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} where bone {{resorption}} outpaces ossification, the bone is broken down {{much faster than}} it can be renewed. The bone becomes more porous and fragile, exposing people {{to the risk of}} fractures. Depending on where in the body bone resorption occurs, additional problems like tooth loss can arise. This can be caused by conditions such as hypoparathyroidism and <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D or even decreased hormonal production in the elderly. Some diseases with symptoms of decreased bone density are osteoporosis, and rickets.|$|E
50|$|A vitamin {{deficiency}} {{can cause a}} disease or syndrome known as an avitaminosis or <b>hypovitaminosis.</b> This usually refers to a long-term deficiency of a vitamin. When caused by inadequate nutrition it can be classed as a primary deficiency, and when due to an underlying disorder such as malabsorption it can be classed as a secondary deficiency. An underlying disorder may be metabolic as in a defect converting tryptophan to niacin. It can also {{be the result of}} lifestyle choices including smoking and alcohol consumption.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{sunscreen}} with a {{sun protection}} factor of 8 can theoretically inhibit more than 95% of vitamin D {{production in the}} skin. In practice, however, sunscreen is applied so as to have a negligible effect on vitamin D status. The vitamin D status of those in Australia and New Zealand is unlikely to {{have been affected by}} campaigns advocating sunscreen. Instead, wearing clothing is more effective at reducing the amount of skin exposed to UVB and reducing natural vitamin D synthesis. Clothing which covers {{a large portion of the}} skin, when worn on a consistent and regular basis, such as the burqa, is correlated with lower vitamin D levels and an increased prevalence of <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D.|$|E
50|$|Given {{that the}} {{population}} of Hylomantis Lemur is on the decline in South America, there exist efforts to create and enact a plan of conservation to save the species. A stumbling block to the conservation of Hylomantis Lemur is its tendency to develop a vitamin A defiency when given insect-based diets. Lesions develop shortly after vitamin A deficiency comes into effect. The tongue of the Hylomantis Lemur is the region most prominently affected by squamous metaplasia. Other metaplastic injuries occur else, however, and {{are found in the}} oral and nasal cavities, the esophagus, stomach, reproductive tract and bladder. Better procedures for analyzing postmotem amphibian samples are needed if we are to develop a more accurate correlative model for the relationship between <b>hypovitaminosis</b> A and pathologic lesions.|$|E
5000|$|Epidemiologic {{research}} {{to date has}} led to the identification of a number of risk factors for frailty, including: (a) chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, depression, and cognitive impairment; (b) physiologic impairments, such as activation of inflammation and coagulation systems, anemia, atherosclerosis, autonomic dysfunction, hormonal abnormalities, obesity, [...] <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D in men, and environment-related factors such as life space and neighborhood characteristics. [...] Advances about potentially modifiable risk factors for frailty now offer the basis for translational research effort aimed at prevention and treatment of frailty in older adults. A recent systematic review found that exercise interventions can increase muscle strength and improve physical function; however, results are inconsistent in frail older adults living in the community.|$|E
5000|$|The Chvostek sign (...) is a {{clinical}} sign of existing nerve hyperexcitability (tetany) seen in hypocalcemia. It {{refers to an}} abnormal reaction to the stimulation of the facial nerve. When the facial nerve is tapped in front of tragus the facial muscles {{on the same side}} of the face will contract momentarily (typically a twitch of the nose or lips) because of hypocalcemia (i.e. from hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D) with resultant hyperexcitability of nerves. Though classically described in hypocalcemia, this sign may also be encountered in respiratory alkalosis, such as that seen in hyperventilation, which causes decreased serum Ca2+ with a normal calcium level due to a shift of Ca2+ from the blood to albumin which has become more negative in the alkalotic state.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} occurs if {{the calcium}} level is abnormally low. The normal glands respond by secreting parathyroid hormone at a persistently high rate. This typically {{occurs when the}} 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels in the blood are low and there is hypocalcemia. A lack of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 can result from a deficient dietary intake of vitamin D, or {{from a lack of}} exposure of the skin to sunlight, so the body cannot make its own vitamin D from cholesterol. The resulting <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D is usually due to a partial combination of both factors. Vitamin D3 (or cholecalciferol) is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (or calcidiol) by the liver, from where it is transported via the circulation to the kidneys where it is converted into the active hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. Thus a third cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is chronic kidney disease. Here the ability to manufacture 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is compromised, resulting in hypocalcemia.|$|E
50|$|The {{damage to}} the cornea in vitamin A {{associated}} xerophthalmia {{is quite different from}} {{damage to the}} retina {{at the back of the}} globe, a type of damage which can also be due to lack of vitamin A, but which is caused by lack of other forms of vitamin A which work in the visual system. Xerophthalmia from <b>hypovitaminosis</b> A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid, since (along with certain growth-stunting effects) the condition can be reversed in vitamin A deficient rats by retinoic acid supplementation (however the retinal damage continues). Since retinoic acid cannot be reduced to retinal or retinol, these effects on the cornea must be specific to retinoic acid. This is in keeping with retinoic acid's known requirement for good health in epithelial cells, such as those in the cornea. The term is from Greek Ξηροφθαλμία = ξηρός, dry and οφθαλμός, eye.|$|E
50|$|Megaloblastic anemia (or {{megaloblastic}} anaemia) is an anemia (of macrocytic classification) {{that results}} from inhibition of DNA synthesis during red blood cell production. When DNA synthesis is impaired, the cell cycle cannot progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis (M) stage. This leads to continuing cell growth without division, which presents as macrocytosis.Megaloblastic anemia has a rather slow onset, especially when {{compared to that of}} other anemias.The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to <b>hypovitaminosis,</b> specifically a deficiency of vitamin B and/or folic acid. Vitamin B deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate, as the mechanism is loss of B dependent folate recycling, followed by folate-deficiency loss of nucleic acid synthesis (specifically thymine), leading to defects in DNA synthesis. Folic acid supplementation in the absence of vitamin B prevents this type of anemia (although other vitamin B-specific pathologies may be present). Loss of micronutrients may also be a cause. Copper deficiency resulting from an excess of zinc from unusually high oral consumption of zinc-containing denture-fixation creams {{has been found to be}} a cause.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} vitamin D {{recommended}} for all infants, children, and adolescents has recently increased - from 400 to 600 IU per day. The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) released the Consensus Report on Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D on November 30, 2010. The recommendation was for 600 IU of vitamin D {{a day for}} those 1-70 and 800 IU for those over 70 years of age. [...] As of October 2008, the American Pediatric Association advises vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day (10 μg/d) from birth onwards. (1 IU vitamin D is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol.) The daily dose of 400 IU is required to prevent rickets and possibly also {{a wide range of}} chronic nonskeletal diseases. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that pregnant or breastfeeding women consider taking 2000 IU/day, that all babies who are exclusively breastfed receive a supplement of 400 IU/day, and that babies living north of 55°N get 800 IU/day from October to April. Health Canada recommends 400IU/day (10 μg/d). Infant formula is generally fortified with vitamin D. <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is common in postmenopausal women, regardless of whether they are healthy or have other medical conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an {{autoimmune disease}} causing demyelination within {{the central nervous}} system. [...] In the central nervous system, there are many cells encased in a fatty coating called the myelin sheath. This sheath allows for informational signals to be transmitted at greater speeds down through the cell. In multiple sclerosis, this sheath deterioration causes a slower transmission of nerve signals. This ultimately results in severe motor deficits.There is a well-established global correlation between multiple sclerosis and latitude; there is a higher multiple sclerosis prevalence in northeastern regions than {{in the south and}} western regions. At the same time, on average higher vitamin D levels are found in the south and western regions than in the northeast. [...] Based on this correlation and other studies, the higher intake of vitamin D is associated with a lower risk for MS.Research has also shown that in relation to geological position (latitude), patients who later developed MS saw an earlier age of onset of symptoms in the more northern latitudes than in the Southern Hemisphere The mechanism for this association is not fully established, however, a proposed mechanism involves inflammatory cytokines. <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines. The increase in these specific cytokines is associated with the degradation of the myelin sheath.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D is {{associated}} with cognitive decline in the elderly, but the issue of causality remains unresolved. Definitive evidence would include the visualization of brain lesions resulting from <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D. The aim of the present article is to determine, through a literature review, the location and nature of possible brain disorders in <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D. We found limited brain-imaging data, which reported ischemic infarcts and white matter hyperintensities in <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D, though did not provide their specific location or report any focal atrophy. Based on the finding of executive dysfunctions (i. e., mental shifting and information updating impairments) {{in the presence of}} <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D, we suggest that <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D {{is associated}} with a dysfunction of the frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits, particularly the dorsolateral circuit. Further imaging studies are required to corroborate this assumption and to determine whether <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D results in degenerative and / or vascular lesions...|$|E
40|$|Prospective {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D can predict the onset of obesity, but they relied mainly on body mass index, which could be scarcely reliable in older people. We investigated whether baseline <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D could predict higher fat mass (FM) levels using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a sample of 116 fit and healthy older subjects. Although no significant differences in FM estimates emerged between subjects with and without <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D at the baseline, abdominal FM was found significantly higher in the former group (with <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D at the baseline) than in the latter after 3 years of follow-up. Adjusted logistic regression analysis confirmed these findings: <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D coincided with an approximately sixfold higher risk of subjects having higher abdominal FM levels at the follow-up. In conclusion, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D predicts higher abdominal FM levels in the elderl...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D {{and stress}} are common {{problems}} among the elderly. The {{aim of this}} cross-sectional nationally representative study was to evaluate the association between <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D and stress perception using large-scale nationally representative data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2012 – 2013). In our study, a total of 1393 elders (≥ 65 years old) were included to evaluate the association between <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D and stress perception. Serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels were determined using radioimmunoassay, and perceived stress status was assessed by a self-reporting questionnaire. The association between <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D and stress perception according to sex was examined using logistic regression analysis. After multivariate adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and comorbidities, <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D {{was significantly associated with}} perceived stress (odds ratio, 2. 73; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 10 – 6. 77; p = 0. 029) among women; however, this association was not significant among men. <b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D was a risk factor for higher stress perception in older Korean women. Even though the role of vitamin D in stress perception is still unclear, we suggest screening for <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D among the elderly...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypovitaminosis</b> D occurs {{early in}} the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its {{association}} with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well known. in this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the degree of <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D may differently affect blood pressure (BP) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in nondialyzed CKD patients. This study included 80 CKD patients with a creatinine clearance between 15 and 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) and serum 25 hydroxivitamin D [25 (OH) D] level 17. 2 ng/ml; M-group]. No {{differences were found between the}} S and M-group in terms of diastolic BP and the presence of coronary calcification. in the multiple linear regression analysis, severe <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D was a predictor of 24 -h, daytime and nighttime BP after controlling for a number of confounders. the severity of <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D was associated with increased BP in nondialyzed CKD patients. the degree of <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D was not related to CAC, which was equally elevated in both the severe and mild <b>hypovitaminosis</b> D groups.
