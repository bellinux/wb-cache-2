It's {{malleability}} makes <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> bend into the various shapes required and allows considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
5|$|During the war Zinn {{allowed it}} to be run around the clock, and its design made <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> conduct experiments. This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that {{might be used to}} construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis makes <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E

5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color makes <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> overlook.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> synthesize them.|$|E

5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|In 62 BC, Pompey {{returned}} victorious from Asia, but {{the senate}} refused to ratify the arrangements {{that he had made}} with his soldiers. Pompey, in effect, became powerless, and thus when Julius Caesar returned from his governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements in Asia were to be ratified, and his soldiers were to be given land. Caesar was to be elected Consul in 59 BC, and then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship.|$|E

5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought that Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial made <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> learn.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, tessellations can be {{extended}} to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation to make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation {{makes it possible to}} describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 2014, {{the news}} {{reported}} that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders {{due to an}} unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included {{a stop at the}} famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to take <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Perl's text-handling {{capabilities}} can be {{used for}} generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, and automatic memory management make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> collect and process the returned data. For example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of data for post-processing by a Perl subprogram.|$|E
5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site made <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E

5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest. Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
