5000|$|In 1932, {{this new}} engine was {{replaced}} by a prototype diesel-electric plant. This was a MAN-type [...] 16-cylinder engine running at even higher speed, driving an electrical generator, built by General Dynamics Electric Boat and designated 16VM1. Electricity produced by the generator was used to drive a high-speed <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>geared</b> to the shaft; there was no direct connection between the diesel engine and the shaft. Diesel-electric propulsion was then adopted for many U.S. submarines through World War II, starting with the 1932 Porpoise class; other navies did not follow suit until after the war.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{it proved}} {{successful}} with improved equipment {{beginning with the}} Tambor class of 1940, the diesel-electric drive was troublesome at first. In this arrangement, the boat's four main diesel engines drove only electric generators, which supplied power to high-speed <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> <b>geared</b> to the propeller shafts. The engines themselves were not connected to the propeller shafts. For submerged propulsion, massive storage batteries supplied electricity to the motors. Problems arose with flashover and arcing in the main electric motors. There was also a loss of [...] in transmission through the electrical system. The Winton Model 16-201A 16-cylinder diesels also proved problematic, and were eventually replaced with 12-278As.|$|R

The extruder is designed to accommodate approximately 1 cubic centimeter samples at accurately controllable rates corresponding to take-up from a single orifice of a 25 micron fiber at speeds in the 1000 feet/minute region.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a series}} viscous actuator, {{composed}} of a viscous rotary damper connected to the output of a <b>geared</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> is proposed as a novel solution to the high actuator impedances encountered when using such a motor. High impedances can be undesirable when interacting with the environment or animal subjects as unexpected forces may damage already-compromised joints. A state space model for the series viscous actuator was derived and verified by measurements upon a physical system. Physical design considerations for implementing a series viscous actuator, such as the appropriate gearing ratio and damper selection, are discussed and supported using the derived model. by Nicholas Eric Wiltsie.

5000|$|The fourth type of {{electric}} ice cream maker uses an outer tub filled with ice and salt for chilling. An inner canister holds {{the ice cream}} mixture and churn and scraper assembly. A high-speed <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> <b>geared</b> at approximately 75RPM, drives a mechanism that simultaneously rotates the canister, counter-rotates the scraper and holds the churn paddles stationary. As the canister turns, the ice cream mixture freezes against the inner wall of the canister. The counter-rotating scraper constantly removes the frozen product from the canister wall and returns it to the mixture. The continuing turning motion of the canister against the stationary churn paddles causes the mixture to become increasingly thick. Enough time, ice and salt produces a smooth [...] "hard packed" [...] ice cream.|$|R
50|$|The {{order was}} placed on 18 June 1928 and {{construction}} began on 28 June 1928, when her keel was laid. The work was slowed by a dispute over the powerplant; Lord Kylsant which controlled the White Star Line wanted to use diesel-electric instead of the traditional steam power. White Star proposed having over 40 diesel generator sets driving four propellers through <b>geared</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> Harland & Wolff was reluctant to adopt this system, preferring to continue the use of trusted steam turbine propulsion. A compromise of sorts was reached and the final design used four conventional low-speed 'cathedral' diesel engines, each directly driving one propeller shaft - which would have made Oceanic the first (and only) quadruple-screw Motor ship. But by the time all parties had settled {{on the use of}} diesel, the Great Depression was underway and hitting the shipping business.|$|R

For this project, power window design of the Proton Gen- 2 was selected, where the improvement had been made at main arm and slider. The main arm and slider was designed using CAD software.

There is one design for main arm and two designs for slider had been done. The analysis showed that both of the new designs are better compared to current design. For the both designs, the result showed that when force are applied, the displacement of improvement design that occur is lowest than current design. In conclusion, this improvement can reduce the cost of repairing because the improvement made can hopefully reduce the failure occurrence for that specific power window mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we use optimal control on a <b>geared</b> <b>electric</b> DC <b>motor</b> {{to compare the}} {{energetic}} efficiency of a simulation of conceptual monoped hoppers with either parallel elastic actuation (PEA) or series elastic actuation (SEA). The energy is measured using three cost functions: positive actuator work, electrical losses, and positive electrical work. For PEA, {{the presence of the}} motor inertia in the collision losses leads to increased collision losses at large transmission ratios, which lead to energetically costly compensatory strategies where the SEA is at its most efficient. At small transmission ratios, the motor force increases for both cases, leading to increased thermal losses. In agreement with those theoretical predictions, our work shows that for positive actuator work and positive electrical work the optimal parameter choice for SEA is significantly more energetically efficient than the optimal choice for PEA. For electrical losses, a suitable choice of the transmission ratio can lead to negligible cost values for both actuator concepts. I...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{machinery}} room measures 55 ft long by 78 ft wide and 32 ft high. The main control room is immediately aft of the machinery room, from which engineers controlled both the reactor and the steam propulsion plant. A window separates {{the control room}} from the machinery room. The control room is visible from the viewing gallery on [...] "C" [...] Deck above. The steam plant is a relatively standard steam plant in its general characteristics, with a nine-stage high-pressure turbine and a 7-stage low-pressure turbine driving a single propeller shaft. The turbines were specially adapted to use the saturated steam typically provided by a nuclear power source. It was also unusual in having a 750 hp <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>geared</b> to the high-pressure turbine for use in an emergency. The motor was driven by either the ship's steam turbogenerators or the 750 KW emergency diesel generators located {{in the rear of}} the pilothouse. These generators could provide basic propulsion to the motor while running the reactor coolant pumps. The motor was upgraded to provide greater torque and reversibility to allow it to move the ship away from a pier in the event of a reactor accident.|$|R

In most cases, these tests are adequate to address the performance characteristics under environmental and loading effects with some uncertainties and decent power/torque margins.
