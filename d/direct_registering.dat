40|$|Abstract. Estimating planar {{projective}} transform (homography) {{from a pair}} {{of images}} is a classical problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for <b>direct</b> <b>registering</b> two point sets in R 2 using projective transform without using intensity values. In this very general context, there is no easily established correspondences {{that can be used to}} estimate the projective transform, and most of the existing techniques become either inadequate or inappropriate. While the planar projective transforms form an eight-dimensional Lie group, we show that for registering 2 D point sets, the search space for the homographies can be effectively reduced to a three-dimensional space. To further improve on the running time without significantly reducing the accuracy of the registration, we propose a matching cost function constructed using local polynomial moments of the point sets and a coarse to fine approach. The resulting registration algorithm has linear time complexity with respect to the number of input points. We have validated the algorithm using points sets collected from real images. Preliminary experimental results are encouraging and they show that the proposed method is both efficient and accurate. ...|$|E
40|$|As the {{neutrino}} fluxes {{can bring}} {{information from the}} internal layers of the collapsing star, {{the problem of the}} neutrino burst detection is of importance for both the <b>direct</b> <b>registering</b> of the collapse itself and the investigation of its dynamics. The main characteristics of the neutrino fluxes have been obtained by simulations. The total neutrino flux energy is estimated as 2. 5 x 10 to the 53 to 1. 4 x 10 to the 54 erg, the energy of NU sub E flux being 10 to the 53 erg. Predictions on neutrino energy spectra are quite different. Two models of the collapse will be used: the model by Bowers and Wilson, hereafter BW, and the model by Nadyozhin and Otroschenko (NO). The NU sub e spectrum in the BW-model reaches the maximum at E max sub NU = 8 MeV. Average energy of NU sub E E sub nu approx. = 10 MeV. The NO-model gives E max sub Nu = 10. 5 MeV and E sub nu = 12. 6 MeV. The NU sub E-burst duration is DELTA tau sub NU = 20 s for the NO-model. As the black hole formation {{is the result of the}} star collapse in the BW-model, DELTA tau sub nu is taken to be 5 s...|$|E

The main {{objective is to}} check embedded C code including typical hardware specific ingredients like embedded assembly statements, direct memory accesses, <b>direct</b> <b>register</b> accesses, interrupts, and timers, without any further manual preprocessing. For this purpose, the state space is generated directly from the assembly code that is generated from C code for the specific microcontroller, in our case the ATMEL ATmega family. The properties to be checked can refer to the global C variables {{as well as to}} the microcontroller registers and the SRAM. By this approach we are able to find bugs which cannot be found if one looks at the C code or the assembly code alone.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relative}} performance of voting technologies by studying presidential, gubernatorial, and senatorial election returns across hundreds of {{counties in the}} United States from 1988 to 2000. Relying on a fixed-effects regression applied to an unbalanced panel of counties, we find that in pres-idential elections, traditional paper ballots produce the lowest rates of uncounted votes (i. e., “resid-ual votes”), followed by optically scanned ballots, mechanical lever machines, <b>direct</b> <b>register</b> electronic machines (DREs), and punch cards. In gubernatorial and senatorial races, paper, optical scan ballots, and DREs are significantly better in minimizing the residual vote rate than mechanical lever machines and punch cards. If all jurisdictions in the United States that used punch cards in 2000 had used optically scanned ballots instead, we estimate that approximately 500, 000 more votes would {{have been attributed to}} presidential candidates nationwide.

While the programming languages community has developed rich high-level languages and run-time systems that make programming traditional large systems easy and fun, the microcontroller developer languishes {{in a world of}} <b>direct</b> <b>register</b> access, incomplete C compilers, and manual memory management. For the past four years, the Rice Computer Architecture Group has been addressing this by developing Owl, an open-source microcon- troller development system for the modern world. Owl includes support for the proven and easy-to-use language Python. It also supports Medusa, a new language designed specif- ically for embedded, concurrent programming. Finally, it introduces Hoot, a distributed computing environment that allows a programmer to treat a heterogeneous collection of controllers and networks as a single large application. This thesis presents the design of Owl as well as a detailed quantitative evaluation of it. These results show that not only is it possible to run sophisticated system software on a microcontroller, but that doing so makes building applications much easier. The results and innovations presented here are adaptable to the embedded run-times of the future and have the potential to make microcontroller development easier for everyone...|$|R

In the course of the development of an up-scaled system for the European XFEL and the migration of control hardware to the modern MTCA. 4 (Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture) platform, all involved components of the system will be replaced with new developments. The front-end devices are upgraded. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are performing the data processing and feedback calculations. In order to facilitate the firmware development, a toolset (Rapid-X) was established which allows application engineers to develop, simulate, and generate their code without help from FPGA experts in a simple and efficient way.

40|$|Amyloid fibrils {{are a major}} {{pathological}} feature of Alzheimer's disease {{as well as other}} amyloidoses including the prion diseases. They are an unusual phenomenon, being made up of different, normally soluble proteins which undergo a profound conformational change and assemble to form very stable, insoluble fibrils which accumulate in the extracellular spaces. In Alzheimer's disease the amyloid fibrils are composed of the Aß protein. Knowledge of the structure of amyloid is essential for understanding the abnormal assembly and deposition of these fibrils and could lead to the rational design of therapeutic agents for their prevention or disaggregation. Here we reveal the core structure of an Alzheimer's amyloid fibril by direct visualisation using cryo-electron microscopy. Synthetic amyloid fibrils composed of Aß residues 11 to 25 and 1 to 42 were examined. The Aß(11 - 25) fibrils are clearly composed of ß-sheet structure that is observable as striations across the fibres. The ß-strands run perpendicular to the fibre axis and the projections show that the fibres are composed of ß-sheets with the strands in <b>direct</b> <b>register.</b> This observation has implications not only for the further understanding of amyloid, but also for the development of cryo-electron microscopy for direct visualisation of secondary structure...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to real mode, the Intel 80286 supports protected mode, expanding addressable physical memory to 16 MB and addressable virtual memory to 1 GB, and providing protected memory, which prevents programs from corrupting one another. This {{is done by}} using the segment registers only for storing an index into a descriptor table that is stored in memory. There are two such tables, the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and the Local Descriptor Table (LDT), each holding up to 8192 segment descriptors, each segment giving access to 64 KB of memory. In the 80286, a segment descriptor provides a 24-bit base address, and this base address is added to a 16-bit offset to create an absolute address. The base address from the table fulfills the same role that the literal value of the segment register fulfills in real mode; the segment registers have been converted from <b>direct</b> <b>registers</b> to indirect registers. Each segment can be assigned one of four ring levels used for hardware-based computer security. Each segment descriptor also contains a segment limit field which specifies the maximum offset {{that may be used}} with the segment. Because offsets are 16 bits, segments are still limited to 64 KB each in 80286 protected mode.|$|R
