5|$|Nevertheless, the new {{values were}} still {{higher than the}} levels that Vespasian and Titus <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> during their reigns. Domitian's {{rigorous}} taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years. Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.|$|E

Imprisoned, the deposed king appealed to Justinian.|$|E

5|$|As Emperor, Domitian quickly {{dispensed}} {{with the republican}} facade his father and brother <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> during their reign. by moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head.|$|E
5|$|Before {{this the}} church <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> a {{distance}} from the Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E
5|$|By 1588, Gebhard's {{joint pain}} (Gelenkenschmerz) {{prevented}} him from riding a horse; the climate of Cologne, damp and cold, made his condition worse, so he relinquished his claim on the Electorate {{to the protection of}} Adolf von Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, which they pursued until their deaths later that year. In the summer 1588, Gebhard established his residence at Strassburg, where he had held the office of dean of the cathedral since 1574and <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> it concurrently with his position in Cologne.|$|E

5|$|During the war era, Nguyễn Ánh <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> an {{embryonic}} bureaucracy in {{an attempt}} to prove his leadership ability to the people. Due to the incessant warfare, military officers were generally the most prominent members of his inner circle. This dependency on military backing continued to manifest itself throughout his reign. Vietnam was divided into three administrative regions. The old patrimony of the Nguyễn formed {{the central part of the}} empire (vùng Kinh Kỳ), with nine provinces, five of which were directly ruled by Gia Long and his mandarins from Huế.|$|E
5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project headquarters {{on the fifth floor}} of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, {{who was in charge of}} the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district did not change.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> his previous prediction; with an active {{start of the}} season, {{the rest of the}} season was forecast to have been only slightly above average, due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the Atlantic Ocean.

The Royal Navy destroyers sailed back to Ist with empty magazines.|$|E
5|$|So Artavasdes I <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> {{his ground}} against the Romans but his domain had been {{severely}} ravaged. Besides his stronger ally Phraates IV treated him condescending {{and gave him}} only little booty and was near depriving him of his dominion. Therefore, in 35 BC Artavasdes I offered Antony an alliance against Parthia, and Antony gladly accepted. To deepen this friendship Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra VII, was betrothed to Artavasdes I’s daughter Iotapa, although both were infants in 34 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 to arrest the Bounty mutineers. Edwards named it in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, under whom he had served earlier in his career. HMS Pandora turned northwards from Ducie and, because of this change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS Pandora <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> its course, it would eventually have reached Pitcairn Island and found the Bounty mutineers.|$|E

In 2008, the station saw about 5,900 daily riders, compared to 3,000 for the tram, which <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> steady ridership. Over {{the next eight}} years, the station experienced additional ridership growth. In 2016, an average of 6,630 daily riders used the station on an average weekday. This amounted to 2,110,471 total riders entering the station in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Ashby de la Zouch was {{converted}} into a castle by William, Lord Hastings, a favourite of Edward IV; as a minor nobleman he had fought alongside Edward at Towton, but was then knighted and later became the chamberlain of the royal household and the Lieutenant of Calais. William acquired extensive estates across the Midlands during the wars, much of them confiscated from his enemies. Amongst these was Ashby de la Zouch, which was given to William in 1462. His father, Sir Leonard, <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> the family seat at nearby Kirby Muxloe, but after 1471 William began to use Ashby de la Zouch as his primary residence.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{maintained}} military forces since federation {{as a nation}} in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states <b>had</b> <b>maintained.</b> In 1911, the Government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.|$|E

Kyle Busch made a pit stop one lap later, handing the lead back to Kenseth. By lap 60, Kenseth had built up his lead over Reutimann by over two seconds. Eight laps later, Stewart passed Reutimann for second.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habré greatly {{strengthened}} his position thanks to western support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. From 1984 onwards, the GUNT also suffered increasing factional tensions, centered on the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over {{the leadership of the}} organization. Taking advantage of the GUNT's difficulties, Habré struck a series of accords with smaller rebel factions, which left the GUNT at the beginning of 1986 with only three of the eleven factions that had originally signed the Lagos Accord in 1979. The remaining factions were Goukouni's People's Armed Forces (FAP), Acheikh's armed branch of the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) and that part of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT) which <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> its loyalty to Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom <b>had</b> <b>maintained</b> that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
