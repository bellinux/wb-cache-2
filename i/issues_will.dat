Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
25|$|Before the Doha ministerial, WTO members {{resolved}} a {{small number}} of these implementation issues.

Outstanding implementation issues are found in the area of market access, investment measures, safeguards, rules of origin, and subsidies and countervailing measures, among others.|$|E

25|$|Paris {{talks were}} hanging {{over a few}} issues: France protested moves to cut {{subsidies}} to farmers, while the US, Australia, the EU, Brazil and India failed to agree on issues relating to chicken, beef and rice.

25|$|Although {{the reserve}} covers {{a large portion}} of Honduras, very little is {{recorded}} about the biological diversity within it. While previous management plans have proven successful, a continued investigation into ongoing management plans and future conservation <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> be necessary to keep this valuable reserve safe. Currently there are threats to the conservation of the reserve which include illegal hunting, logging and clearing of land to graze cattle. Recent rafting expeditions from the Rio Plátano headwaters through all three zones of the reserve (cultural, buffer and core) have documented cattle grazing in the core zone, commercial fishing and hunting camps along the river and clear cutting of forest near Las Marias.|$|E
25|$|Hamas {{and other}} Islamist groups in Gaza fired rockets and mortars at Israeli towns and villages. Despite Israel's {{use of the}} Iron Dome missile defense systems, six civilians were killed, {{including}} an Arab Israeli and a Thai civilian worker. An Israeli teen was seriously injured in a rocket strike {{in the city of}} Ashkelon. Medical health professionals have noted that Israeli teens prone to mental health problems suffer increasingly during both short-term and long-term conflicts. Experts have identified a number of mental health symptoms which rise during conflict, including anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, phobias, and paranoia. There is some doubt whether these <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> dissipate after the conflict is resolved.|$|E

40|$|The Japanese Economy after World War II {{has greatly}} changed. It {{is a general}} {{understood}} that the changes or the transition of Japanese Economy could be explained not with linear dynamics but with nonlinear dynamics.

25|$|The {{preference}} {{of virtual reality}} exposure therapy over in-vivo exposure therapy is often debated, {{but there are many}} obvious advantages of virtual reality exposure therapy that make it more desirable. For example, the proximity between the client and therapist can cause problems when in-vivo therapy is used and transportation is not reliable for the client or it is impractical for them to travel as far as needed. However, virtual reality exposure therapy can be done from anywhere in the world if given the necessary tools. Going along with the idea of unavailable transportation and proximity, there are many individuals who require therapy but due to various forms of immobilizations (paralysis, extreme obesity, etc..) they can not physically be moved to where the therapy is conducted. Again, because virtual reality exposure therapy can be conducted anywhere in the world, those with mobility <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> no longer be discriminated against. Another major advantage is fewer ethical concerns than in-vivo exposure therapy. Once again, considering the idea of close proximity no longer being a requirement, this decreases the chances of inappropriate client-therapist relations taking place.|$|E
