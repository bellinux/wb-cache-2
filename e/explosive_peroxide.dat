25|$|To {{minimize}} this problem, {{commercial samples}} of THF are often inhibited with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). THF {{should not be}} distilled to dryness, because the <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> concentrate in the residue.|$|R
5000|$|Tetrafluoroethylene is a colorless, odorless gas. Like all {{unsaturated}} fluorocarbons it is {{susceptible to}} nucleophilic attack. It is unstable towards decomposition to C and [...] and prone to form <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> in contact with air.|$|R
50|$|There {{is little}} {{research}} on Nysted reagent {{because of the}} hazards and high reactivity {{and the difficulty of}} keeping the reagent stable while it is in use. More specifically, it can form <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> when exposed to air and is extremely flammable. Also, it reacts violently with water. These make this reagent very dangerous to work with.|$|R
25|$|MTBE is {{extensively}} used {{in industry}} as a safer alternative to diethyl ether (which is commonly used in academic research) as the tert-butyl group prevents MTBE from forming potentially <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides.</b> It is also used as a solvent in academic research, although it is less commonly used than diethyl ether. Although an ether, MTBE is a poor Lewis base and does not support formation of Grignard reagents. It is also unstable toward strong acids. It reacts dangerously with bromine.|$|R
50|$|Ether is {{sensitive}} to light and air, tending to form <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides.</b> Ether peroxides have a higher boiling point than ether and are contact explosives when dry. Commercial diethyl ether is typically supplied with trace amounts of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which reduces the formation of peroxides. Storage over sodium hydroxide precipitates the intermediate ether hydroperoxides. Water and peroxides can be removed by either distillation from sodium and benzophenone, or by passing through a column of activated alumina.|$|R

50|$|When {{stored in}} the {{presence}} of air or oxygen, ethers tend to form <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides,</b> such as diethyl ether peroxide. The reaction is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and aldehydes. In addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form peroxides, it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any peroxides that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid.|$|R
50|$|Unsaturated {{aliphatic}} hydrocarbons are generally much more reactive than alkanes (saturated {{aliphatic hydrocarbons}}). Strong oxidizers may react vigorously with them. Reducing agents can react exothermically to release gaseous hydrogen gas. In {{the presence of}} various catalysts (such as acids) or initiators, compounds in this class can undergo very exothermic addition polymerization reactions. Many of these compounds undergo autoxidation upon exposure to the air to form <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides,</b> which is generally a slow process. These peroxides and polyperoxide substances are usually extremely unstable and prone to detonation.|$|R
50|$|As {{is typical}} of ethers, dipropyl ether may slowly form <b>explosive</b> organic <b>peroxides</b> over long periods in storage. Antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene are often added to ethers to prevent this process.|$|R
50|$|Diisopropyl ether {{can form}} <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> upon {{standing}} in air for long periods. This reaction proceeds {{more easily than}} for ethyl ether, due to the secondary carbon next to the oxygen atom. Antioxidants {{can be used to}} prevent this process. The stored solvent should therefore be tested for the presence of peroxides more often (recommended once every 3 months for diisopropyl ether vs. once every 12 months for ethyl ether). Peroxides may be removed by shaking the ether with a solution of iron(II) sulfate. For safety reasons, methyl tert-butyl ether is often used as an alternative solvent.|$|R

50|$|Paramilitaries use Acetone <b>peroxide</b> in <b>explosives,</b> {{despite its}} instability, {{because of its}} ease of {{manufacture}} and lack of telltale nitrate signature.

25|$|Ethers like {{diethyl ether}} and {{tetrahydrofuran}} (THF) can form highly <b>explosive</b> organic <b>peroxides</b> upon exposure to oxygen and light. THF is normally {{more likely to}} form such peroxides than diethyl ether.

25|$|Because COT is {{unstable}} and easily forms <b>explosive</b> organic <b>peroxides,</b> {{a small amount}} of hydroquinone is usually added to commercially available material.

40|$|In 2000, {{a bottle}} of dibutyl ether was {{discovered}} in a flammable storage cabinet in the Petrie Science building and was suspected to contain peroxides. A crystalline material had formed {{in the bottom of}} the bottle and appeared to be adhering to the sides close to the cap. Crystal formation is one of the indicators that peroxide has formed. The bottle was eventually removed by a waste disposal company and destroyed outside the campus. The disposal was an expensive process in addition to the disruption caused in the building and the time spent by Faculty members and DOHS hygienists. The purpose of this notice is to help laboratory users identify the types of chemicals that may form peroxides and the precautions that should be taken when using and storing these chemicals. Materials that are susceptible to peroxide formation are ones that typically react with air, moisture or impurities and produce a change in their chemical composition in normal storage. Peroxides may detonate with extreme violence when concentrated by evaporation or distillation, when combined with other compounds, or when disturbed by unusual heat, shock or friction. Chemicals that are sensitive to peroxide formation can be broken into three categories (Jackson, J. Chem. Ed., 1970), as shown in the following lists: A. Form potentially <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> without concentration. All have been responsible for fatalities. Test for peroxide formation or discard after 3 months. Isopropyl ethe...|$|R
50|$|Organic {{peroxides}} are {{organic compounds}} containing the peroxide functional group (ROOR′). If the R′ is hydrogen, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Peresters have general structure RC(O)OOR. The O−O bond easily breaks, producing free radicals {{of the form}} RO•. Thus, organic peroxides are useful as initiators for some types of polymerisation, such as the epoxy resins used in glass-reinforced plastics. MEKP and benzoyl peroxide are commonly used for this purpose. However, the same property also means that organic peroxides can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and this process {{has been used in}} <b>explosives.</b> Organic <b>peroxides,</b> like their inorganic counterparts, are powerful bleaching agents.|$|R
50|$|The use of Colorimetric {{test kits}} for {{explosive}} detection {{is one of}} the oldest, simplest, and most widely used methods for the detection of explosives. Colorimetric detection of explosives involves applying a chemical reagent to an unknown material or sample and observing a color reaction. Common color reactions are known and indicate to the user if there is an explosive material present and in many cases the group of explosive from which the material is derived. The major groups of explosives are nitroaromatic explosives, nitrate ester and nitramine explosives, improvised explosives not containing nitro groups which includes inorganic nitrate based explosives, chlorate based <b>explosives,</b> and <b>peroxide</b> based <b>explosives.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{has been}} used for creating organic peroxide-based explosives, such as acetone <b>peroxide,</b> for improvised <b>explosive</b> devices.

25|$|In the {{presence}} of limited quantities of air and moisture, such as in a poorly closed container, <b>explosive</b> mixtures of <b>peroxides</b> may form.

40|$|Peroxides are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds with unusual stability problems and {{are one of the}} most hazardous classes of chemicals routinely handled in the laboratory. Peroxides can be formed via intentional chemical reactions (i. e., ozonolysis), but just as hazardous is the inadvertent peroxide formation during storage of certain compounds. Some compounds form <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> and others are polymerizable unsaturated compounds that can initiate a runaway, explosive polymerization reaction. To varying degrees, shock, heat or friction may cause unexpected explosion of peroxidized organic chemicals. Common classes of compounds that form peroxides include: 1. Ethers, acetals, and ketals, especially cyclic ethers and those with primary and/or secondary alkyl groups 2. Aldehydes, including acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde 3. Compounds containing benzylic hydrogens 4. Compounds containing allylic hydrogens, including most alkenes; vinyl and vinylidene compounds, and dienes Refer to Appendix A for a list of common peroxide forming chemicals and recommendations on safe storage durations. STORAGE AND HANDLING y The quantity of peroxide-forming chemicals kept should be restricted to the minimum amount needed. y Store peroxide-formers in airtight bottles, away from light and heat. Avoid using containers with loose-fitting lids and glass ground stoppers. y Certain peroxide formers, including those in Appendix A-List A, should be stored under nitrogen if possible. y Evaluate for peroxide formation regularly and always prior to distillation (see right). Some materials may need evaluation as often as every 3 months. y Crystallization, discoloration, and stratification are signs a peroxide former may have become shock sensitive – Do not move the container, and call EH&S promptly at 725 - 9999. y If evaporation or distillation is necessary, do not distill to a dry residue. Always leave at least 10 - 20 % residual bottoms. LABELING All peroxide-forming compounds should be labeled as shown below with date received and date opened.

40|$|As one {{important}} kind of sensitive analytical technology, fluorescence method is widely applied in environmental science, materials, medicine pharmacy and nowadays much popularly in cellular biological science, which requires {{the development of}} diverse fluorescent sensors to meet various analytical and researching demands. During my Ph. D. study, my work focuses {{on the development of}} novel fluorescent sensors for the detection and specific recognition of functional and bio-interesting small molecules and metal ions, and the contents are described in this dissertation using three sections. In the first part, novel fluorescent sensors for the specific recognition of bio-toxic thiophenols have been developed based on ICT and PET mechanism separately. These sensors were designed with an 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulfonamide as the recognition moiety and consequently are able to differentiate thiophenols from bio-active aliphatic thiols such as cysteine in neutral aqueous solution due to their different pKa values. Moreover, the sensor constructed on NBD fluorophore has a long-wavelength emission (> 500 nm) and were employed as the first fluorescent sensor to detect selenocysteine, a special amine acid in body, without interference with other amino acids including similar cysteine. In the second part, we have made our efforts on the detection of <b>explosive</b> <b>peroxides</b> and discovered a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent sensor for peroxy acids. This sensor took advantage of the ring-open mechanism so as to achieve complete “on-off” switch in the recognition process. Significant fluorescence signals were observed upon addition of peroxy acids while other peroxides and ROS couldn’t make influence on the sensor. In the third part, we turned our attention to the bio-interesting metal ions. A turn-on fluorescent sensor has been developed for the detection of bio-active Zn 2 + with based on PET mechanism. This sensor is highly selective for Zn 2 + and showed no response to numerous metal ions such as K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Fe 3 +, Cu 2 +, Co 2 +, Cd 2 +, etc. Moreover, we successfully designed an unprecedented chemodosimeter for the detection of highly toxic Hg 2 + in the aqueous solution, which came from a unique Hg 2 + facilitated desulfurization–lactonization cascade reaction by transforming a weakly fluorescent precursor to a highly fluorescent coumarin derivative.
