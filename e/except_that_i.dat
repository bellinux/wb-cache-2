500|$|I {{will end}} with a great line by the poet who, in the seventeenth century, took the strangely real and poetic name of Angelus Silesius. It is the summary of all I have said tonight — <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have said it by means of {{reasoning}} and simulated reasoning. I will say it first in Spanish and then in German: ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the {{wilfully}} unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid." ...|$|E

"Give {{yourself}} {{no trouble}} for them, Sir Count," [...] replied the King, [...] "they are men accustomed to set hardships at defiance; and, to speak truth, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wish to see}} Galeotti, I would desire as little farther communication from without this night as may be consistent with your instructions." ...|$|R

2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I {{tried to}} imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. <b>Except</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The Council of State of {{the first}} Arab {{government}} in Mesopotamia since the (thirteenth century) Abbasid’s” as Bell described it, met on Tuesday, 2 November 1920. Along with Sassoon as Minister of Finance, Jafar Pasha al-Askari as Minister of Defence and six other ministers including Sayid Talib as Minister of the Interior. The {{next step was to}} choose a King to unite the tribally fractured country. Sassoon had already offered his opinions on the matter as was recounted again by Miss Bell: “I had a long and interesting talk with Sasun Eff. the other day—I went to call on his sister in law and found all the men there eager to embark on talk. Sasun Eff. said he felt sure that no local man would be acceptable as head of the state because every other local man would be jealous of him. He went on to throw out feelers in different directions—one might think of a son of the Sharif, or {{a member of the family}} of the Sultan of Egypt, if there was a suitable individual, or of the family of the Sultan of Turkey? I said I for my part felt sure that Sir Percy didn't and couldn't mind whom they selected <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought the Turkish family was ruled out—it ought to be an Arab prince. Sasun Eff. said [...] "If they think you are backing S. Talib they will all agree outwardly to S. Talib, whatever they think of him. I remember when once I happened to be on the same boat with him coming back from Constantinople —it was when S. Talib was a deputy. Almost without exception the people of Basrah hated and feared him, and if you'll believe me they all came down to Muhammarah to welcome him! and the ones that hated him most gave him the most cordial reception. They were afraid of him. So it would be now." [...] I again insisted that we could find no interest or advantage in backing anyone; it was entirely a matter for the people themselves to decide, but whether he believed me or not I can't say. He had, however, hit on the root of the matter. Anyone they think we're backing they will agree to—and then intrigue against him without intermission. It's not an easy furrow to plough!” ...|$|E

60|$|The 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not far, {{and killed}} a sea-fowl or two, {{resembling}} a brand goose, which, however, I cared not to eat when I brought them home, but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the evening I renewed my medicine, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not take so large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke: but the next day, which was the 1st of July, having a little return of the cold fit, I again took my medicine as I did the first time.|$|R
