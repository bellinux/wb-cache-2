5000|$|Treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections is {{becoming}} increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered {{by the fact that}} Mycoplasma genitalium infections are not routinely detected. Azithromycin is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin. An alternative five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Efficacy of azithromycin against Mycoplasma genitalium has decreased substantially, which is thought to occur through SNPs in the 23S rRNA gene. The same SNPs are thought to be responsible for resistance against <b>josamycin</b> which is prescribed in some countries. [...] Moxifloxacin {{can be used as a}} second-line treatment in case azithromycin is not able to eradicate the infection. However, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to parC SNPs. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, have a low clinical eradication rate for Mycoplasma genitalium infections. A few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but pristinamycin was still able to eradicate the infection.|$|E

It was found that extraction columns could be used twice for the extraction of serum samples and up to four times for the extraction of urine samples. The difference between the re-usability of extraction columns for serum and urine samples was ascribed to various differences in the composition of the sample matrix. The stability of <b>josamycin</b> in stored serum and urine samples was also assessed. <b>Josamycin</b> was found to be stable for up to 72 hrs at + 4 °C and up to 84 days at - 15 °C in ex-vivo and in-vitro serum samples. However, <b>josamycin</b> was less stable in urine samples and a significant change in concentration was detected during the storage periods studied. Intrinsic dissolution rate-pH and solubility-pH profiles were determined over the pH range of the gastro-intestinal tract to assess the possible role of dissolution in the absorption of <b>josamycin.</b> Furthermore, intrinsic dissolution rales at each pH were determined at 50, 100, 200 and 300 rpm, and then at infinite rotation speed (G∞) by an extrapolation procedure. G∞ was determined in order to compare dissolution rates in different dissolution media without the influence of a diffusion layer. The intrinsic dissolution rate and solubility were found to be highly pH dependent. G∞ decreased > 8500 fold from 5. 15 mg. cm⁻². s⁻¹ at pH 1. 2 to 5. 815 x 10 ⁻⁴ mg. cm⁻². s⁻¹ at pH 7. 5. The solubility of <b>josamycin</b> decreased from 212 mg. ml⁻¹ at pH 5. 45 to 0. 18 mg. ml⁻¹ at about 9. 0. These profiles suggest that <b>josamycin</b> may be subject to dissolution and solubility limited absorption from the intestinal tract, particularly at higher intestinal pH's. This hypothesis is supported by the reduced bioavailability of <b>josamycin</b> from a powder compared to a solution. Determination of intrinsic dissolution rates at infinite rotation speed (when the diffusion layer is theoretically equal to zero) proved to be a useful means by which the dissolution characteristics of pure drug in different dissolution media could be compared. Dissolution profiles of <b>josamycin</b> powder and two tablet preparations used in bioavailability studies were determined at various pH's over the gastro-intestinal pH-range. The effect of formulation on dissolution from the tablet preparations was assessed by comparison of the powder with tablet dissolution profiles at each pH. Dissolution profiles of <b>Josamycin</b> 200 mg tablets from pH 1. 2 to 5. 0 showed rapid dissolution and were similar to powder dissolution profiles. However, above pH 5. 0, dissolution of the powder was retarded by reduced intrinsic dissolution rate and solubility. Dissolution from the tablet preparation above pH 5. 0 was further reduced by formulation factors. Dissolution of these tablets will therefore be rapid in acidic gastric fluids. However, if intact tablets or granules pass into the less acidic environment of the duodenum, dissolution will be significantly reduced and absorption is likely to be dissolution rate limited. Comparison of <b>josamycin</b> powder with Josacine 500 mg tablet profiles showed that dissolution from these tablets was severely limited by formulation factors over the entire pH range, particularly at higher pH's. Absorption from these tablets is therefore likely to be dissolution rate limited whether dissolution occurs in gastric or intestinal fluids. Although macrolide antibiotics are known to be susceptible to acid degradation, there is a dearth of information on the stability of <b>josamycin.</b> This prompted a comprehensive investigation into the stability of <b>josamycin</b> from pH 1. 0 to 12. 0, together with the effect of ionic strength and buffer concentration on the rate of degradation in acid. Further studies were conducted utilising simulated gastric and intestinal fluids to assess the extent of degradation after an oral dose. The pH-rate profile for <b>josamycin</b> over the pH range 1 - 12 was comprehensively characterised and the equation describing the profile determined. Results indicated that <b>josamycin</b> is subject to specific acid catalysis but catalysis in alkali media appeared to be more complex. The rate constant for catalysis by hydronium ion (k₁) was 54. 11 M⁻¹. hr⁻¹ whilst the rate constant for catalysis by hydroxide ion (k₃) was 60. 35 M⁻¹. hr⁻¹. Catalysis due to water was insignificant and the water catalysed rate constant was found to be 3. 370 x 10 ⁻⁵ hr⁻¹. The pH of maximum stability was determined as pH 6. 5 whilst degradation at pH 1. 0 and 12. 0 is about five orders of magnitude greater than at pH 6. 5. The degradation of <b>josamycin</b> in acid is subject to a significant primary salt effect, however, no secondary salt effect was evident. Consideration of the ionic strength of the reaction medium is therefore essential when undertaking stability studies of <b>josamycin</b> in aqueous media. Concentration vs. time profiles for <b>josamycin</b> in acidic media were biphasic which indicated that the degradation reaction did not follow a simple pathway whereby <b>josamycin</b> degrades directly to products. Further investigations demonstrated that <b>josamycin</b> undergoes a reversible isomerisation step, with subsequent degradation of <b>josamycin</b> and possibly its isomer, by cleavage of the mycarose moiety to the desmycarose compounds. Studies to determine the stability of <b>josamycin</b> in simulated gastric fluids demonstrated that acid degradation could be appreciable after oral administration. However, extensive degradation in-vivo will only occur at the most acidic gastric pH's of about pH 1. 0 to 2. 0. <b>Josamycin</b> was, however, found to be significantly more stable than erythromycin, suggesting that problems with acid degradation in-vivo would be less for <b>josamycin</b> than the extensively used macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin. The administration of <b>josamycin</b> as a solution and powder have hitherto not been reported and the bioavailability of <b>josamycin</b> without the influence of formulation factors has not been established. Bioavailability of <b>josamycin</b> from a solution and powder were therefore conducted. Furthermore, tbe bioavailability of two tablet preparations was assessed. A multiple dose study was also conducted and parameters obtained from pharmacokinetic modelling of both single dose solution and multiple dose solution profiles compared. The results showed that <b>josamycin</b> is inherently rapidly absorbed from a buffered solution. After a 1 gram dose, a mean Cmax of 1. 64 μg/ml was reached within a mean tmax of 0. 39 hrs after a lag time of about 10 mins. Absorption from powder, however, is slower and a mean Cmax of 0. 755 μg/ml was attained with a mean tmax = 0. 50 hrs. Furthermore, the bioavailability of the powder was only ± 50 % that of the solution. It was therefore concluded that absorption from the powder was limited by the dissolution rate and solubility. The bioavailability from two different tablet formulations was still lower than from the powder, with absorption hindered not only by the intrinsic dissolution rate and solubility, but also by formulation factors. Furthermore, absorption from the tablets was highly erratic. It was concluded that intact tablets or granules passed into the duodenum, after which dissolution from the tablets or granules was retarded and pH-dependent. Investigations into the in-vitro dissolution characteristics of the tablet preparations and comparison with powder dissolution profiles over the entire gastro-intestinal pH range rather than at a limited number of pH's provided invaluable information for the explanation of the poor profiles obtained after tablet administration. Modelling of single dose solution data showed that the pharmacokinetics of <b>josamycin</b> can be adequately described by a two body-compartment model with rapid and extensive distribution into a peripheral compartment (∝ = 6. 50 hr⁻¹, k₂₁ = 1. 46 hr⁻¹). The mean volume of distribution was 161. 7 l which suggests that <b>josamycin</b> distributes to "deep" tissue and is consistent with the considerable accumulation of <b>josamycin</b> observed in various organs. <b>Josamycin</b> was 51 % bioavailable in this study and had a t½ of 1. 66 hrs with a total clearance of 4. 71 l. kg⁻¹. hr⁻¹. The pharmacokinetics of <b>josamycin</b> however, changed significantly after multiple dosing. Both distribution coefficients decreased (∝ = 2. 99 hr⁻¹, k₂₁ = 0. 41 hr⁻¹) as did the volume of distribution (Vd = 34. 3 l). This suggested that saturation of the peripheral compartment occurred. Furthermore, a decrease in clearance (Cl = 0. 63 l. kg⁻¹. hr⁻¹) with a corresponding increase in elimination half-life (t½ = 3. 61) were also observed. This suggested possible saturation of metabolic enzyme pathways. These changes in pharmacokinetic parameters were presumably responsible for the non-linear kinetics observed during the multiple dose studies. ...|$|E

The method was further extended to the in vitro determination of <b>josamycin</b> in spiked human plasma. The recovery (n = 8) was 100. 76 +/- 3. 43 %. The stoichiometry of the reaction between the drug and the reagent was studied by adopting the limiting logarithmic method, and a proposal of the reaction pathway was presented...|$|E
40|$|It {{has proved}} {{difficult}} {{to develop a}} standard method for the determination of mini-mum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics against the Legionellaceae. A major obstacle has been the inactivation of certain antibiotics by components of Charcoal Yeast Extract agar, especially charcoal. To determine the MICs of eight macrolides and related agents (erythromycin, spiramycin, oleandomycin, <b>josamycin,</b> midecamycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin) for 36 strains of Legionella, we used two charcoal-free media. Buffered Yeast Extract agar and Buffered Antibiotic Medium no. 1 (BAM,), the latter having been developed in our own laboratory. The inhibitory effect of charcoal was most marked on <b>josamycin</b> and pristinamy-cin. This effect was absent on the charcoal-free media, which both, however, inhibited spiramyan. BAM, agar seemed the better of the two charcoal-free media as it gave more consistent growth. The most active agents were <b>josamycin</b> (0 - 06 - 0 - 25 mg/ 1), pristinamycin (0 - 06 - 0 - 5 mg/ 1) and erythromycin (0 - 12 - 0 - 5 mg/ 1). Midecamycin (0 - 12 - 1 mg/ 1) and spiramycin (1 - 5 mg/ 1) also had useful activity...|$|E
40|$|Two simple, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric methods for {{the determination of}} <b>josamycin</b> and ciprofloxacin in their pharmaceutical dosage forms are described. Method (A) {{is based on the}} reaction of aldehyde group of <b>josamycin</b> with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hydrazine in methanolic hydrochloric acid to yield a yellow product which absorbs maxima at 411 nm, whereas method (B) depends on the reaction of ciprofloxacin with 1, 2 -naphthaquinone- 4 -sodium sulphonate in alkaline medium to form an orange coloured product measurable at 487 nm. The working conditions of both methods have been optimized and the reactions pathways were postulated. Regression analysis of Beer's law plots showed good correlation in the concentration ranges 10 - 160 and 5 - 120 μg/mL for <b>josamycin</b> and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Detection and quantification limits for both methods are calculated. The methods were successfully applied to the determination of both drugs in bulk drugs and their formulations. Statistical treatment of the experimental results indicates that the accuracy and precision of the methods are analytically acceptable. The validity of the methods was evaluated by parallel determinations by established procedures and by recovery studies. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|<b>Josamycin</b> and {{erythromycin}} {{have been}} compared for their in-vitro interaction with bactericidal killing by human neutrophils. The mechanism of this interaction was studied in two ways. First, the target organisms {Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were incubated for 60 min with <b>josamycin,</b> erythromycin or control buffer prior {{to use in}} a human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) killing assay. Second the macrolides were added directly to acellular killing systems mimicking those acting inside the phagolysosome; oxygen-independent systems were obtained from a crude granule extract of PMN and oxygen-dependent systems consisted either of a mixture of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or of a solution of H 2 O 2. Whereas josamycin-pretreated P. aeruginosa were twice as sensitive to killing by PMN than were control cells, {{this was not the}} case for S. aureus. Both oxidant generating systems were more effective in destroying S. aureus in the presence of <b>josamycin</b> (3 and 30 mg/ 1). Erythromycin showed a similar synergy but only with the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system. This synergy was observed with neither of the Oj-independent systems for S. aureus, nor with any acellular system for P. aeruginosa. These data suggest that at least two kinds of mechanism may explain the bactericidal synergy observed between macrolides and PMN. The first (for macrolide-resistant species such as P. aeruginosa) could be due to alterations in the bacteria by the antibiotics, while the second (for macrolide-sensitive species such as 5. aureus) could be based upon an as yet unexplained transformation of the molecules by reactive oxygen species into more "toxic " forms. These differences between <b>josamycin</b> and erythromycin could arise from differences in their chemical structure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Josamycin,</b> a new {{macrolide}} antibiotic, {{was compared}} with ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin in vitro against 25 isolates each of pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and nonenterococcal hemolytic streptococci and against 25 anaerobes including 10 Bacteroides fragilis. Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration {{data were obtained}} for the aerobic organisms, using serial twofold tube dilutions in Mueller-Hinton broth. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for the anaerobes by the agar dilution technique. <b>Josamycin</b> was comparable to erythromycin and clindamycin in activity against the pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci and was more active than clindamycin against enterococci. It was somewhat less active than ampicillin against enterococci and S. epidermidis and showed its greatest in vitro activity against anaerobes, being comparable to clindamycin...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty-six anthraco-silicotic coal-miners {{presenting}} with a clinical picture of broncho-pulmonary infection were {{submitted to a}} transtracheal puncture. Out of 143 assessable samples, 77 (53. 8 %) yielded positive cultures. A single organism was recovered in 69 patients (H. influenzae: 34 cases; Str. pneumoniae: 20 cases; Neisseria sp. 8 cases; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 6 cases; Corynebacterium pseudo-diphteriticum: 1 case) and 2 organisms in 8 patients (H. influenzae+Str. pneumoniae). In 58 patients, the efficacy of co-trimoxazole, ampicillin and <b>josamycin</b> was assessed in a double-blind comparative trial on clinical and bacteriological grounds. A second transtracheal aspiration was performed 48 h after completion of a 10 -day course of treatment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{possibility}} of essential oils and flavonoids improving the performance of antibiotics, proving a higher efficacy in the presence of natural substances against Edwardsiella tarda and Streptococcus iniae. Increased efficacy was observed in several cases: both essential oils and flavonoids increased antibacterial efficacy of oxytetracycline and flumequine against E. tarda by 2 -fold; essential oils and flavonoids increased antibacterial efficacy of nalidixic acid against E. tarda by 4 -fold; flavonoids increased antibacterial efficacy of <b>josamycin</b> against S. iniae by 4 -fold. The results obtained in this study suggest that essential oils and flavonoids might be especially useful in increasing the antimicrobial activity of nalidixic acid and <b>josamycin</b> against E. tarda and S. iniae in fish.
