5|$|In the C++ {{programming}} language, decltype is {{a keyword}} used to query {{the type of}} an expression. Introduced in C++11, its primary intended use is in generic programming, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult,</b> or even impossible, to express types that depend on template parameters.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as {{its shape}} and {{movements}} are well disguised. The Queensland variety is quite easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety is quite troublesome to maintain.|$|E
5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement {{near the top of}} the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
50|$|Stage6 also {{featured}} its own search engine profiling the videos by the user-generated tags and their popularity. Because the search engine used the tags, {{rather than the}} title, as a primary search criteria, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to find a video based on its name.|$|R

"When I {{was trying}} to engage myself as young Jason Tanamor <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to get back in}} that frame of mind or recall {{specific}} emotions that surrounded that experience." [...] He stated that the bulk of this novel was written during the DoD Furlough which resulted in United States budget sequestration in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Pew Research Center, [...] "between the 1970s and 1990s, the European {{activities}} of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Muslim World League and the World Assembly of Muslim Youth became so intertwined that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to tell them apart". According to Pew the influence of WAMY and MWL has waned somewhat as social media and blogs have [...] "made it easier for other groups to reach wide audiences".|$|R
5|$|In 2001, {{scientists}} in Australia successfully implanted a Poitou donkey embryo created by artificial insemination {{in the womb}} of a Standardbred mare. Worries that joint problems might prevent a healthy pregnancy in the foal's biological mother led to the initiative. The resultant foal became one of three Poitou donkeys in Australia. The procedure was unusual because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for members of one Equus species to accept implanted embryos from another species in the same genus.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to superficially {{distinguish}} {{between male and}} female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Survivals {{from late}} Medieval church {{fittings}} and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E
50|$|As these {{sequences}} {{were different}} for different platforms, elaborate libraries such as termcap {{had to be}} created so programs could use the same API to work with any terminal. Most of these systems required sending numbers (such as row and column) as the binary values of the characters; for some programming languages, and for systems that did not use ASCII internally, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> or impossible to turn a number into the correct character.|$|R
50|$|In practice, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> very <b>difficult</b> to {{calculate}} the natural parametrization of a parametric curve, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> useful for theoretical arguments.|$|R
500|$|Another way {{to judge}} {{the value of the}} Como show to the network {{can be found in the}} following: during sound checks at rehearsals, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to hear Como's soft voice without having a large {{microphone}} ruin a camera shot. NBC had RCA design a microphone for the show, which was known as the [...] "Como mike"; the microphone was able to pick up Como's voice properly and was small enough not to interfere with camera shots.|$|R
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, {{and the advent of}} generic programming techniques pioneered by the Standard Template Library, the need for a mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized. In generic programming, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> or impossible to express types that depend on template parameters, in particular the return type of function template instantiations.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to tell {{precisely}} where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, {{the sound is}} continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{know whether or not}} spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
50|$|The Protestant missionary {{movement}} distributed numerous {{copies of}} the Bible, {{as well as other}} printed works of history and science. They established and developed schools and hospitals practicing Western medicine. Traditional Chinese teachers viewed the mission schools with suspicion and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Christian schools to attract pupils. The schools offered basic education to poor Chinese, both boys and girls. Before the time of the Chinese Republic, they would have otherwise received no formal schooling.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, British Railways {{found that}} the cost of manning some 2,400 level {{crossings}} had risen past £1 million per annum, with some locations seeing a tenfold increase. In the postwar labour market <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to recruit crossing keepers, the job itself being a responsible but rather dull occupation. In addition, manually operated crossings often caused long delays to road traffic because of the need to close the gates and clear the distant signal before the approaching train reached it.|$|R

25|$|The end goal of any {{marketing}} effort is to generate sales. Although social media {{is a useful}} marketing tool, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to quantify to what extent it is contributing to profit. ROI can be measured by comparing marketing analytic value to contact database or CRM and connect {{marketing effort}}s directly to sales activity.|$|E
25|$|The most {{elaborated}} chopping {{tools and}} partial hand axes are linked and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to distinguish between}} them. The concept of chopping tools is based on their lack of formal standardization (which is typical of hand axes) and includes {{the possibility that the}} pieces are shallow cores, which is unthinkable for the bifaces (except the nucleiforms).|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} hotelships in Germany {{can be traced}} back to the 1970s. During {{international}} trade fairs <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to find good quality accommodation in a convenient location because of shortages of hotel rooms. During the International Textile Trade Fair in Frankfurt, the idea was born to moor a river cruiser on the banks of the Main and thus increase bed capacity in the city centre. Even today, the Frankfurt am Main harbour authorities offer moorings for hotelships on the Nizza Werft.|$|R
50|$|Before David O. McKay {{visited the}} South Africa mission in 1954, {{the policy was}} that any man {{desiring}} to receive the priesthood in the mission was required to prove a lack of African ancestors in his genealogy. Six missionaries were tasked with assisting in the necessary genealogical research but even then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to establish lack of African ancestry. McKay changed the policy to presume non-African ancestry except when there was evidence to the contrary. This change allowed many more people to be ordained without establishing genealogical proof.|$|R
50|$|Rommel {{diverted}} the Afrika Korps inland some 15 mi {{to try to}} cut {{off more}} of the retreating Eighth Army. Small columns from both sides raced across the broken ground of the desert toward El Alamein. Units became intermingled and disorganized and opposing columns ran parallel to each other, with German columns sometimes running {{in front of the}} retreating British. The columns sometimes exchanged fire, and as about 85 percent of the Afrika Korps transport was captured British or American equipment, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish friend from foe.|$|R
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for fathers in {{financial}} hardship or who {{take on a}} larger caregiving role with their children to have their child support payments lowered. He also states that unemployment is {{the primary cause of}} child support arrears, and further states that these arrearages make the father subject to arrest and imprisonment without due process.|$|E
25|$|Note: Because Ives {{often made}} several {{different}} versions of the same piece, and because his work was generally ignored during his life, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to put exact dates on his compositions. The dates given here are sometimes best guesses. There have also been controversial speculations that he purposely misdated his own pieces earlier or later than actually written.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{high-level}} programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, {{because they}} have features such as exception handling and type checking that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C or assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to see where the}} initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugger tools may be needed.|$|E
50|$|Settlers, or squatters as {{they were}} also called, began to arrive in the Santa Clara River Valley seeking public lands during {{the mid to late}} 1860s, {{following}} the American Civil War. Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy to the west was subdivided in 1867, and many settlers purchased land in the area west of Santa Paula. Settlers hoping to avail themselves of free land offered by the Homestead Act had to locate available public lands. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for homesteaders to know if they were settling on public or private lands.|$|R
5000|$|Gouldman and Stewart {{opened a}} second studio, Strawberry Studios South, {{in a former}} cinema in Dorking, Surrey, in 1976 {{following}} the departure of Godley and Creme. The studio had been planned before the band's split, with Stewart pointing out the Stockport studio had been in such great demand <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for 10cc to use it. He said: [...] "Initially the studio will be just for 10cc, but we will <b>be</b> letting <b>it</b> out for block bookings of two {{months at a time}} for selected customers, other groups who want to record in comfort." ...|$|R
50|$|Roy Culpepper {{notes that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> very <b>difficult</b> to {{establish}} who owns what among the poor. He {{also notes that}} the titling is biased against those who are completely landless and propertyless.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to decide}} where to draw the {{boundary}} between a language and a dialect, causing some minor disagreement among scholars regarding the inventory of Formosan languages. There is even more uncertainty regarding many extinct or assimilated Formosan peoples, since our knowledge of these is often sketchy at best. Frequently cited examples of Formosan languages are given below, but the list {{should not be considered}} exhaustive.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the language. Some proper names of Burgundians are recorded, and some words used {{in the area in}} modern times are thought to be derived from the ancient Burgundian language, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{distinguish}} these from Germanic words of other origin, and in any case the modern form of the words is rarely suitable to infer much about the form in the old language.|$|E
25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E
30|$|Like this provider, {{a number}} of others were willing to provide care for {{children}} with disabilities, and home-based care <b>was</b> <b>often</b> a good setting for personalized programming. However, lack of financial and/or training resources impeded their ability to do so. Similarly, respondents <b>were</b> <b>often</b> the first to identify children with developmental delays or learning disabilities. They sometimes encountered resistance when trying to persuad parents to obtain a professional evaluation of these children.  Even when parents were willing to follow through and request evaluations, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for them to get the evaluations and recieve services in a timely way.|$|R
50|$|Only a few fraggers were {{identified}} and prosecuted. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish between fragging and enemy action. A grenade thrown into a foxhole or tent could be a fragging, or the action of an enemy infiltrator or saboteur. Enlisted men <b>were</b> <b>often</b> close-mouthed in fragging investigations, refusing to inform on their colleagues out of fear or solidarity. Although the sentences prescribed for fragging were severe, the few men convicted often served fairly brief prison sentences. Ten fraggers were convicted of murder and served sentences ranging from ten months to thirty years with a mean prison time of about nine years.|$|R
40|$|Finding optimal or {{at least}} good {{monitoring}} strategies is an important consideration when designing an agent. We have applied genetic programming to this task, with mixed results. Since the agentcontrol language was kept purposefully general, the set of monitoring strategies constitutes {{only a small part}} of the overall space of possible behaviors. Because of this, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for the genetic algorithm to evolve them, even though their performance was superior. These results raise questions as to how easy <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> for genetic programming to scale up as the areas <b>it</b> <b>is</b> applied to become more complex...|$|R
