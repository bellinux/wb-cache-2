40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryXiuzhi Susan SunRenewable {{materials}} are desirable for many applications {{due to the}} finite fossil resources and environmental issues. Plant oil {{is one of the}} most promising renewable feedstocks. Plant oils and functionalized oleo-chemicals including functionalized soybean oils have become attractive sustainable chemicals for industrial applications. Especially, epoxidized oleo-chemicals such as epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) are one of the most well-known readily available inexpensive functionalized plant oils. In this study, novel polymers and nanocomposites for sustainable materials applications were designed and prepared via ring-opening of epoxide in plant oils, and their chemical and physical properties were characterized. The novel transparent elastomers derived from functionalized plant oils have a great potential as flexible electronic and biological applications with their inherent low toxicity. Especially, their rheological properties showed a potential for pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs). The dominant thermal stability and transparency were obtained via green processing: one pot, single step, fast reactions in moderate conditions, or solvent-free UV curing conditions. These oleo-based elastomers presented excellent end-use properties for PSAs application comparable to commercial PSA tapes. Based on the principal chemical studies, the roles of the each component have been identified: polymer derived from the ring-opening of epoxides as an elastomer, and dihydroxylated triglycerides as a tackifier. Their interaction was also elucidated with an <b>element</b> <b>label</b> analysis. The mechanical and rheological properties of the oleo-polymer as PSAs were able to be improved with a rosin ester tackifier. In addition, biogreases and bio-thermoplastics were developed via the environmentally benign process, which will contribute to further application on the production of new bio-based materials. Further, this study essays a novel acid functionalized iron/iron oxide nanoparticles catalyst with excellent product yields for epoxide ring opening of oleochemicals for a greener synthetic method of biopolyols, and excellent environmental benefits with life cycle assessment of syntheses. Those functionalized iron/iron oxide core shell nanoparticles catalysts has great potential for biomedical engineering process with the highest magnetization of Fe(0) core among all metals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{is common}} for large and complex {{organizations}} to maintain repositories of business process models in order to document and to continuously improve their operations. Given such a repository, this paper deals {{with the problem of}} retrieving those process models in the repository that most closely resemble a given process model or fragment thereof. The paper presents three similarity metrics {{that can be used to}} answer such queries: (i) label matching similarity that compares the labels attached to process model elements; (ii) structural similarity that compares <b>element</b> <b>labels</b> as well as the topology of process models; and (iii) behavioral similarity that compares <b>element</b> <b>labels</b> as well as causal relations captured in the process model. These similarity metrics are experimentally evaluated in terms of precision and recall, and in terms of correlation of the metrics with respect to human judgement. The experimental results show that all three metrics yield comparable results, with structural similarity slightly outperforming the other two metrics. Also, all three metrics outperform traditional search engines when it comes to searching through a repository for similar business process models...|$|R

Given such a repository, this paper deals {{with the problem of}} retrieving those models in the repository that most closely resemble a given process model or fragment thereof. Up to now, there is a notable research gap on comparing different approaches to this problem and on evaluating them in the same setting. Therefore, this paper presents three similarity metrics {{that can be used to}} answer queries on process repositories: (i) node matching similarity that compares the labels and attributes attached to process model elements; (ii) structural similarity that compares <b>element</b> <b>labels</b> as well as the topology of process models; and (iii) behavioral similarity that compares <b>element</b> <b>labels</b> as well as causal relations captured in the process model. These metrics are experimentally evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The results show that all three metrics yield comparable results, with structural similarity slightly outperforming the other two metrics.
