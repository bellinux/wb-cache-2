5|$|The bark beetle, <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> and the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack elm trees. Bark beetles (Scolytidae) carry Dutch elm disease as they move from {{infected}} breeding sites to healthy trees. The disease has devastated elm trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
25|$|Most serious of the elm pests is the <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Xanthogaleruca luteola, {{which can}} decimate foliage, {{although}} rarely with fatal results. The beetle was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe. Another unwelcome immigrant to North America is the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica. In both instances the beetles cause far more damage in North America {{owing to the}} absence of the predators present in their native lands. In Australia, introduced elm trees are sometimes used as foodplants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down.|$|E

50|$|Xanthogaleruca is {{a species}} of beetles {{belonging}} to the family Chrysomelidae. These <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> are pests that feed on ornamental plants until they are stripped of their leaves entirely.|$|R
50|$|Xanthogaleruca luteola is {{a serious}} pest of the elm. Both the adults and larvae feed on the {{emergent}} leaves of the elm. Repeated heavy infestation rarely kills the tree outright but weakens it, rendering it vulnerable to disease. Falling branches encourage elm bark beetles to proliferate; the beetles are vectors of Dutch elm disease. However, <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> do not transmit the disease.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{populations of}} U. laciniata {{have only a}} {{marginal}} resistance to Dutch elm disease (DED), rated 2 out of 5, below that of the Japanese Elm. Moreover, in trials in Italy and the USA, U. laciniata was severely damaged by <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> Xanthogaleruca luteola, indeed in Italy chemical controls were necessary to ensure the tree's survival, unlike its compatriots U. parvifolia and U. davidiana var. japonica which survived unscathed. The species is also susceptible to Elm Yellows.|$|R

5000|$|In {{trials in}} eastern Arizona http://www.for.nau.edu/cms/content/view/512/706/, 'Frontier' and another American hybrid, 'Regal', {{were found to}} have the highest {{tolerance}} of the hot and arid climate, notably exhibiting minimal leaf scorch. However, 'Frontier' is known to have sustained winter damage where planted in the Great Plains http://www.oznet.k-state.edu/path-ext/factSheets/Trees/Dutch%20Elm%20Disease.asp. This failing was repeated in the elm trials conducted by the University of Minnesota, although the tree often recovered the following year. It was also criticized for its form and integrity, considered [...] "unsuitable" [...] for urban forestry. 'Frontier' fared better in 10-year trials at Atherton, California, to evaluate replacements for Californian elms lost to disease: [...] "Strong structure, rapid growth rate, attractive leaf color in spring and fall, and relatively low pruning requirement suggest that Frontier has promise...", although the tree again proved only moderately tolerant of <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> The tree is currently being evaluated in the National Elm Trial http://treehealth.agsci.colostate.edu/research/nationalelmtrial/NET_Cultivars.htm coordinated by Colorado State University.|$|R

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> (Chrysomelidae) {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse {{families}} of herbivorous insects. Many of them are important agricultural pests and cause remarkable loss of crop and money as well. Plant leaves and roots are primary food source of both larva and adults of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Plants produce many secondary metabolites in reaction to herbivore insects. It is a well-known phenomenon that quantity and variety of secondary metabolites in plant leaves may change in response to insect attacks. Herbivore insects have to deal with such defensive secondary chemicals and overcome either by detoxifying or storing them. Accordingly, many specialist herbivores coevolved with their host plant. Certain phenolic glycosides may reduce <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding. Condensed tannins are anti-herbivore defenses against <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>beetles,</b> including <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Flavonoid compounds are feeding deterrents for many flea <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Cinnamic acid derivatives are other known feeding deterrents for <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Secondary metabolites quantity and nutritional quality of host plants are not only important for feeding but also for providing enemy-free space and suitable oviposition sites. </p...|$|R
