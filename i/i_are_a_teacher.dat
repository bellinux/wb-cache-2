40|$|In this paper, I explore {{my journey}} of {{discovering}} {{the meaning of}} pedagogy and phenomenology as a research methodology while doing my master’s thesis. Like new researchers in any field, we have a journey that we travel which is often marked with uncertainty {{and a lack of}} clarity, especially with regard to methodological considerations. I describe what seeing pedagogy entails for me as I write phenomenologically. I also outline the difficulties and tensions present as I weave my way into writing. I use personal examples of struggles that I encountered in the writing process that are characteristic of phenomenological methodology.

These students were "Community-Based" where they develop functional skills for living in a community. The children did not have enough reading skills to be able to read a simple unknown story independently. My cooperative teachers had already developed a routine of discussing pictures in the newspapers. Afterwards, the students helped in creating a caption for each picture. I added another step in this routine: answering written wh-questions asking about the structures: character, setting, and plot. The results of this studu consisted of lesson plans, captions written by the class, written questions, and students' responses. B. S. Ed. (Bachelor of Science in Education...|$|R

40|$|Summary: A {{literacy}} coach compares {{working in}} public schools to building homes for learning, with the teacher as the builder, the coach as entrenched in the building’s frame. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>teacher,</b> <b>I</b> {{thought of myself as}} a builder: every year I had nine months to build a home for the reading, writing, and thinking lives of my students. So I learned the skills of an architect and carefully drew plans for our curriculum. Then I learned how to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> contractor and <b>I</b> operated the machines that scraped the land for the foundation. I also became an electrician, a carpenter, a plumber, and a landscaper. Sparks of ideas flowed through our house; beautiful built-in furniture held our ever-growing library; we flushed away doubts about whether we could succeed; we walked through lush gardens and smelled the flowers. Students thrived in clean bright rooms. I built a home for learning. But not every year in my classroom stands out as a picture from Architectural Digest.
