5|$|First Officer William R. Records, 48, {{was hired}} by National Airlines in 1969. He {{subsequently}} worked for Pan American World Airways. <b>He</b> <b>estimated</b> that he had approximately 20,000 hours of total flight time. He had 665 hours as a DC-10 first officer.|$|E
5|$|Second Officer Dudley J. Dvorak, 51, {{was hired}} by United Airlines in 1986. <b>He</b> <b>estimated</b> that he had {{approximately}} 15,000 hours of total flying time. He had 1,900 hours as a second officer in the Boeing 727 and 33 hours as a second officer in the DC-10.|$|E
5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. The older one, who <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed {{the foundation of the}} relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.|$|E

5|$|Castle House in {{the outer}} bailey was leased to the diplomat Sir Alexander Stephen in 1901, who carried out {{extensive}} work on the property in 1904, extending and modernising {{the north end of}} the house, including constructing a billiard room and a library; <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> the cost of the work to be around £800. Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the Second World War. One such lessee, Richard Henderson observed that he had spent around £4,000 maintaining and upgrading the property, and the rentable value of the property rose from £76 to £150 over the period.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Selfe's {{version of}} the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an {{economic}} slowdown and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe {{and asked him to}} collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> to be worth more than £20,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E

5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E
5|$|Malaria was endemic in the marshlands {{of eastern}} Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army {{suffered}} greatly from the disease; <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> during the surrender {{that half of}} his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members {{had grown up with}} malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had {{turned it into a}} conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, <b>he</b> <b>estimated,</b> 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} {{requested that}} the city engineer produce a design for a memorial garden with an archway and a cenotaph. The city engineer reported back with a design which <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> would cost around £7,000 and the war memorial committee appointed Lutyens to oversee the project. Lutyens had recently been commissioned to design a memorial for the North Eastern Railway Company (NER) which was based in York and planned to erect its own memorial in the city dedicated to those of its staff who fought and died in the war.|$|E
5|$|Training Check Airman Captain Dennis E. Fitch, 46, {{was hired}} by United Airlines in 1968. <b>He</b> <b>estimated</b> that, prior to working for United, he had accrued at least 1,400 hours of flight time with the Air National Guard. His total DC-10 time with United was 3,000 hours, of which 2,000 hours were accrued as a second officer, 1000 hours as a first officer, and 79 hours as a captain.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Graf Spees Arado {{floatplane}} {{located the}} merchant ship Doric Star: Langsdorff fired a shot across her bow {{to stop the}} ship. Doric Star was able to send out a distress signal before she was sunk, which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers {{to the mouth of}} the River Plate, which <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> would be Langsdorff's next target. On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route information. Based on that information, Langsdorff decided to head for the seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance. The ship's disguise was removed, so it would not hinder the ship in battle.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} with Mötley Crüe, Sixx became {{addicted}} to heroin. He is quoted in The Heroin Diaries as saying: [...] "Alcohol, acid, cocaine... they were just affairs. When I met heroin it was true love." [...] <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>he</b> overdosed [...] "about half a dozen times".|$|R
25|$|Gordon C. Rhea {{acknowledges}} the officially reported Union casualties of 17,666, but suspects {{that some of}} the returns—particularly in Warren's corps—were falsified on the low side, to minimize the negative impact of the battle on the public. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> Grant's loss at 17%. <b>He</b> accepts Union <b>estimates</b> of 11,000 Confederate casualties.|$|R
50|$|Alai's {{social media}} {{footprint}} is huge, by average African standards. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> that <b>he</b> makes 50 million weekly social media impressions, making him perhaps Africa's most visible private citizen on the internet.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. <b>He</b> <b>estimated</b> {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} blight {{had affected}} {{the area and}} many of the houses had become home to a community of artists and squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E
5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{the chapter}} covers Pre-Roman, Western (i.e. Celtic) and Roman Britain. <b>He</b> <b>estimates</b> very roughly that 750,000 acres at most were in use as arable or {{grassland}} in Roman times, compared to 27 million acres in 1914.|$|R
5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year {{and there are two}} to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50days old, were already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> that animals were unlikely to live {{for more than a year}} in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9months.|$|E
5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and <b>he</b> <b>estimated</b> that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E
5|$|Iwadare {{was asked}} to create memorable melodies, but found {{creating}} suitable tracks difficult as many of his initial pieces were thrown out. For Kameoka, recording the live orchestral segments proved a time-consuming and difficult business: each element of a track was recorded separately, then mixed into a single track, then each orchestral element needed to be adjusted for speed and tone so they lined up correctly. According to Mitsuda, the live recording of music spanned seven full sessions, estimated by him as being the largest-scale musical production for a video game to that date. He was entirely dedicated to orchestration and recording for four months. Mitsuda was tasked with creating the music for the game's 2010 reveal trailer, which he knew was an important task {{as it would have}} an international audience. <b>He</b> <b>estimated</b> that around 150 people in total worked on the score throughout its creation.|$|E
