40|$|In quantum mechanics, {{effective}} (i. e., subspace-constrained) Hamiltonians become, by construction, energy-dependent, H = H(E). At {{the same}} time, all the energy-dependent forces prove non-linear because the energy E itself {{is merely an}} eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. One of the most natural resolutions of such a puzzle is proposed via an introduction of a doublet of separate linear representants K and L of the respective right and left action of H(E). Both these energy-independent operators are non-Hermitian so that the formalism admits a natural extension to non-Hermitian initial <b>H(E)</b> <b>s.</b> <b>In</b> non-relativistic quantum mechanics the role of time is exceptional as it remains, up to a few really exotic models [1], unquantized. This makes the current Schrödinger equation i ¯h ∂tψ(t) = H ψ(t) easily integrated in all the time-independent cases where we get ψ(t) = exp[i (t−t 0) H] ψ(t 0). This mean...|$|E

For H(2 s) + He+(1 s) collisions, we find a strong isotope effect at energies below 1 eV/amu for both singlet and triplet states. We find a much smaller isotopic dependence of the cross section for H(2 p) + <b>He</b> +(1 <b>s)</b> collisions <b>in</b> triplet states, and no isotope effect in singlet states.
