40|$|Finding useful {{information}} from large multimodal document collections {{such as the}} WWW {{is one of the}} major challenges of Information Retrieval (IR). The many sources of information now available- text, images, audio, video and more- increases the need for multimodal search. Particularly important is also the recognition, that each information item is inherently multimodal (i. e. has aspects in its <b>information</b> <b>character</b> that stem from di↵erent modalities) and forms part of a networked set of related information items. In this paper we propose a graph-based model for multimodal information retrieval based on a faceted view of information objects. For retrieval purposes, we consider both relatedness and similarity relations between objects. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to develop the methods and {{algorithms}} for decreasing the dimension of initial character description space for character recognition problem, to improve the methods for numbering of non-quantitative characters, to create the interactive integrated system of data analysis. The new results have been obtained at forming <b>information</b> <b>character</b> set, and the methods for character type conversion and the methods for integrated data analysis have been developed. The practical results are expressed in creation of the software for developed methods and algorithms and in development of the data analysis system for computers of type ES and SM. The data analysis system for computers of type ES and SM has been introduced.

40|$|The {{subject of}} my diploma thesis {{is the issue}} of a student's {{educational}} plan processes with health handicap and their importance for a pedagogical practice but also for a parental public and students themselves. Theoretical chapters deal with the preparation planning and the implementation of the educational process with the application of an individual educational plan. In other words it tries to cover technique during the education of students with special demands and integrated students preferentially. This work mentions some principles during student's education according to an individual educational plans. These plans should be in agreement with legal rules for student's education in this sphere and respect some rules. These rules should lead to formation of truly optimal conditions for education and integration of these students. Practical part finds out the most common form and <b>information</b> <b>character</b> of the individual educational plan of integrated students in one school.

40|$|Erwin Schrodinger famously and presciently {{ascribed}} {{the vehicle}} transmitting the hereditary information underlying life to an `aperiodic crystal'. We {{compare and contrast}} this, only later discovered to be stored in the linear biomolecule DNA, with the information bearing, layered quasi-one-dimensional materials investigated by the emerging field of chaotic crystallography. Despite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the <b>information</b> <b>character</b> of biotic and abiotic matter [...] -a broadly applicable physics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of how information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to understand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to apply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii) we discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we recount recent experimental results on tris(bicyclo[2. 1. 1]hexeno) benzene TBHB), showing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into its structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing Maxwell's Demon and {{a new class of}} molecular devices that act as information catalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from informational materials science may impact biology. Comment: 27 pages, 9 figures, 104 citations; [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{photography}} in children’s picturebooks {{and its ability}} to extend image-making and reading by creating a hybrid genre that merges real and non-real worlds. In analysing the use of {{photography in}} such a hybrid genre, the work of Lauren Child (2006, 2001 a, 2001 b, 2000), Polly Borland (2006), Shaun Tan (2007, 2000, 1998) and Dave McKean (2004 a, 2004 b, 1995) is deconstructed. These artists utilise photography in contemporary picturebooks that are fictional. In addition, David Doubilet’s images (1990, 1989, 1984, 1980) are discussed, which fuse underwater photojournalism with art, for factual outputs. This research uncovers a gap in picturebook literature and creates a new hybrid by merging genres to produce a work that is both factual and fictional. The research methodology in this study includes a brief overview of photography and notions of truth, contemporary picturebook trend theory, use of a student focus group, industry collaborations and workshops, and environmental education pedagogy. This thesis outlines summaries of research outcomes, {{not the least of which}} is the capacity for photography to enrich narrative accounts by providing multilayered <b>information,</b> <b>character</b> perspectives and/ or a metafictive experience. These research outcomes are then applied to the process of creating such a hybrid children’s picturebook...|$|E

This paper analyses distinctive aspects of the assessment process, dropped in a formative setting and striving to understand the didactic action multidimensionality’s always more oriented to promote meaningful learning. Sure enough, evaluation, assumes an <b>information</b> <b>character</b> designed to understand the path taken {{in relation to the}} objectives and to the project that has been earlier developed. Planning, assessment and teaching actions are part of a systemic nature perspective, that is the expression of the construct of competence, as a consequence, these three moments are considered part of a single process. Planning procedures, activity doing and assessment techniques deeply change. Starting from a plural description of the concept of competence, {{in the first part of}} this paper, it outlines the theoretical framework in which are included new forms of learning assessment, oriented to the acquisition of self-assessment and co-assessment processes of learner, not only the typical teaching practices made by tradition assessment. It follows an alternative assessment, the so-called authentic assessment, which measures the students ability to mobilize their knowledge to resolve problem, refusing traditional testing. Authentic evaluation is closely related to a constructivist mold of didactic that is aimed to develop complex competences. Following the theoretical first part, the second part of this paper has a practical-operative nature, wherein are inserted the actions to be implemented for the construction of authentic tasks. Competence assessment depends on the type of task addressed that permits to capture the plurality of performance through which the competence is clear. It is necessary to adopt a multiperspective approach to build assessment tools focused and differentiated. Newness and complexity become the characteristic features of the authentic tasks, that aim to highlight the ways in which the student uses his knowledge, starts his cognitive processes and adopts resolved strategies to achieve the goal...|$|E
