5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses <b>hope</b> <b>in</b> the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include <b>Hope</b> <b>in</b> this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E

Most recently, the 36th Engineer Group (Construction) has twice deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, executing a wide variety of construction missions in support of combat operations, including the construction of enemy prisoner of war camps, theater convoy support centers, and soldier life support areas. Some of the soldiers from the unit were still in Iraq as late as October 2007.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing.

Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E

III Corps units were sent to Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the fall of 1990, two 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) units deployed to Iraq during Operation Desert Shield. One of those units was 2nd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, a Chinook battalion from Fort Hood. Other corps units also provided humanitarian support for Operation Restore <b>Hope</b> <b>in</b> Somalia. III Corps elements supported Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.|$|E
5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive <b>Hope</b> (<b>in</b> French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E

Later that year he sold his collection of medals and international caps to raise funds. In 2002, he was reported as living alone in a bungalow in New Hartley. In an interview two years later, he revealed that he suffers from loneliness and hallucinations due to his condition and {{the side effects of}} his medication. Following the interview a Liverpool fan bought Kennedy a computer, which allowed him to make friends on football chat rooms. Kennedy remained a favourite amongst Liverpool supporters decades after leaving the club, and was voted in at No.25 on the 2013 poll '100 Players Who Shook The Kop'.|$|E

5|$|He {{was made}} {{commander-in-chief}} in the Leeward Islands Station {{and given the}} task of transporting a large troop convoy. Twice he attempted the crossing of the Atlantic, and twice he was forced back by severe gales which ravaged his fleet and wrecked {{a number of the}} merchant ships in the convoy. He made a third attempt in 1796, and succeeded in shepherding the fleet to its destination. He was then active in using the troops and his naval forces to capture the islands of Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenada, before returning to England. He was made second in command at the Cape of Good <b>Hope</b> <b>in</b> 1797, succeeding to commander-in-chief the following year, and he died while in command there in November 1798.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's <b>hope</b> <b>in</b> tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the {{countries}} of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good <b>Hope</b> <b>in</b> 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas.
