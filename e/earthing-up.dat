40|$|A {{field study}} {{pertaining}} to different intertillage practices on maize {{was conducted in}} spring 1998. Different intertillage practices comprised of no intertillage + no <b>earthing-up,</b> no intertillage + <b>earthing-up,</b> intertillage twice with Tarphali + no earthing up, intertillage twice with Tarphali + <b>earthing-up,</b> manual weeding + no earthing up, intertillage twice with spade + <b>earthing-up.</b> The significant maximum grain yield (4. 3 t ha - 1) of maize and net income (Rs. 27713) was obtained by intertillage twice with spade and <b>earthing-up</b> as against the minimum grain yield (3. 02 t ha - 1) with net income of Rs. 20385 /- ha - 1 in case of no intertillage + no earthing up treatment...|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{cultural}} and chemical weed control methods on weed population and yield of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivar “CIM- 443 ” was studied under field conditions during 1999. Weed control treatments were: no weeding (control), two hoeings [(3 + 6 weeks after sowing (WAS) ], one hoeing (3 WAS) + one <b>earthing-up</b> (6 WAS), S-metolachlor @ 2. 4 kg a. i. ha- 1, S-metolachlor @ 2. 4 kg a. i. ha- 1 + one hoeing (6 WAS), S-metolachlor @ 2. 4 kg a. i. ha- 1 + one <b>earthing-up</b> (6 WAS). All weed control treatments increased sympodial branches per plant, total number of bolls per plant, number of open bolls per plant, seed cotton yield and decreased weed biomass significantly over control. Maximum seed cotton yield (2207. 77 kg ha- 1) was obtained in S-metolachlor treated plots and minimum from weedy check (1377. 77 kg ha- 1). Different wee...|$|E
40|$|Various control {{tactics are}} being studied for {{incorporation}} in an overall {{strategy for the}} management of bean stem maggot (Ophiomyia spp.) in beans. These include host plant resistance, cultural practices and chemical pesticides. Moderate sources of resistance have been identified and these are in use in breeding programmes to incorporate resistance in local varieties. An evaluation of various cultural methods such as <b>earthing-up,</b> mulching and increased fertility indicate that mulching of field plots reduced plant mortality from BSM attack by 38 percent compared to the control and that mulching combined with increased soil fertility reduced plant mortality even further. Foliar application of certain botanical pesticides such as alcohol extract of neem seed powder and aqueous extract of Tephrosia leaves also reduced infestation by bean stem maggot and increased yields. Field evaluations of the use of these and other tactics in an integrated system in small scale farmers` situation are now underway...|$|E
40|$|Aims: This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the performance of different varieties of potato under various nitrogen levels for growth, yield and quality {{as well as their}} economics. Study Design: Sixteen treatment combinations comprising of four varieties (V 1 -Kufri Jyoti, V 2 -Kufri Chipsona- 2, V 3 -Kufri Chipsona- 1 and V 4 -Kufri Pushkar) and four nitrogen doses (N 1 - 100 kg/ha, N 2 - 125 kg/ha, N 3 - 150 kg/ha and N 4 - 175 kg/ha). The {{experiment was}} laid in Factorial Randomized Block Design with three replications. Place and Duration of Study: A field experiment was conducted at research field, Department of Vegetable Science College of Horticulture, Mandsaur during rabi season 2010 - 11. Methodology: The healthy, uniform size tubers were planted at a spacing of 60 × 20 cm on 21 October, 2010. Phosphorus (P 2 O 5 80 kg/ha), potassium (K 2 O 100 kg/ha) and different doses of nitrogen (as per treatment) were provided through Urea, DAP and Muriate of Potash. Full dose of phosphorus, potash and half dose of nitrogen were applied as basal in furrows at the time of planting. While the remaining quantity of nitrogen was applied in two split doses, 1 st at first <b>earthing-up</b> and 2 nd at second <b>earthing-up</b> (25 and 45 days after planting, respectively). Thereafter recommended package of practices were followed to raise the healthy crop. The crop was harvested on 15 February, 2011. Results: The findings of present study revealed that among the varieties, Kufri Pushkar recorded maximum yield showing its superior performance over other varieties. With respect to quality attributes, variety Kufri Chipsona- 2 exhibited high dry matter content, high starch content and low reducing sugar content which are the desired attributes for processing. Variety Kufri Chipsona- 1 and Kufri Jyoti were next to Kufri Chipsona- 2. Among the different doses of nitrogen, application of 150 kg N/ha resulted in maximum growth and yield attributes as well as total yield. It has also exhibited better quality parameters except reducing sugar. Combined effect of varieties and nitrogen levels showed highest economic return under application of 150 kg N/ha with variety Kufri Pushkar. Conclusion: It may be concluded that combination of potato variety Kufri Pushkar along with application of nitrogen 150 kg/ha had proved to be superior over other combinations for growth, yield and economic returns...|$|E
