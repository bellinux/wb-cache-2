40|$|The sound {{produced}} by a dental air turbine handpiece (<b>dental</b> <b>drill)</b> can markedly influence the sound environment in a dental clinic. Indeed, many patients report that {{the sound of a}} <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> elicits an unpleasant feeling. Although several manufacturers have attempted to reduce the sound pressure levels {{produced by}} <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> during idling based on ISO 14457, the sound emitted by such drills under active drilling conditions may negatively influence the dental clinic sound environment. The physical metrics related to the unpleasant impressions associated with <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds have not been determined. In the present study, psychological measurements of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds were conducted with the aim of facilitating improvement of the sound environment at dental clinics. Specifically, we examined the impressions elicited by the sounds of 12 types of <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> in idling and drilling conditions using a semantic differential. The analysis revealed that the impressions of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds varied considerably between idling and drilling conditions and among the examined drills. This finding suggests that measuring the sound of a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> in idling conditions alone may be insufficient for evaluating the effects of the sound. We related the results of the psychological evaluations to those of measurements of the physical metrics of equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels (LAeq) and sharpness. Factor analysis indicated that impressions of the <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds consisted of two factors: "metallic and unpleasant" and "powerful". LAeq had a strong relationship with "powerful impression", calculated sharpness was positively related to "metallic impression", and "unpleasant impression" was predicted by the combination of both LAeq and calculated sharpness. The present analyses indicate that, in addition to a reduction in sound pressure level, refining the frequency components of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds is important for creating a comfortable sound environment in dental clinics...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the effect of music vs. the sound of a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> paired with or without the vibrotactile stimulation of a Somatron™, on continuous, com puterized recording of subject comfort and heart rate and intermittent recording of peripheral finger temperature. Sub jects ware 130 music majors divided into five auditory stimuli conditions (N= 26) with 13 ma/es and 13 females in each group: (a) vibrotactile stimulation with music followed by den tal drill; (b) vibrotactile stimulation with <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> followed by music; (c) free field music then <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> (no vibrarion); (d) free field <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> then music (no vibration); and (e) no auditory or vibrotactile stimuli. Each condition lasted 6. 5 min utes. Results showed that the vibrotactile stimulation blunted perception, thereby reducing levels both of comfort and dis comfort; this stimulation also reversed the effects of the two auditory stimuli on heart rate from those caused by free field presentation, and raised significantly finger temperature for both auditory strimuli. Overall, music preceding the <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> genera//y reduced the drill’s aversive effects while the drill preceding music generally enhanced music’s positive effects. Heart rate responses to music were varied. The initiation of all stimuli created an arousal response with acclimation oc curring in approximately 30 seconds. Neither music nor the <b>dental</b> <b>drill,</b> alone or in combination with vibrotactile stimu lation, produced a consistent heart rate response. Changes in heart rate seemed to be affected most by the sequence of stimuli across time. When music followed the drill, music decreased heart rate; however, when used in combination with the Somatron™, heart rate was increased. These results were identical to the effects of the drill following music whe...|$|R
40|$|Guided {{surgeries}} {{are becoming}} common in modern dental industry, {{and are used}} {{for a variety of}} treatments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply a dental software toolkit for virtual simulation of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided surgery. The hypothesis is that if a virtual simulation of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided surgery can be done, then the preplanned surgery can also be verified before the actual surgery. The <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided concept is a planning and surgical implementation system that enables surgery with the help of a drill guide based on planning supported by computer aided design tools and CT-scan. The variation simulation predicts the final positions of the pre-defined critical production dimension at the apical part of the fixture. The results are based on variation simulation of two <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> guided surgeries: Maxilla, seven implants and Mandible, nine implants. Maxilla resulted in a safe surgery while Mandible needed an optimization of the implant positions before the surgery. By analyzing the results, it was also found that both plans could be optimized in order to minimize the geometrical variation. Finally, it was found that the method used was suitable for predicting guided surgeries to achieve safer treatments...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>drills</b> {{produce a}} {{characteristic}} noise that is uncomfortable for patients {{and is also}} known to be harmful to dentists under prolonged exposure. It is therefore desirable to protect the patient and dentist whilst allowing two-way communication. A solution {{is to use a}} combination of the three main noise cancellation methods, namely, Passive Noise Control, Adaptive Filtering and Active Noise Control. <b>Dental</b> <b>drill</b> noise occurs at very high frequency ranges in relation to conventional ANC, typically 2 kHz to 6 kHz and it has a narrow band characteristic due to the direct relation of the noise to the rotational speed of the bearing. This paper presents a design of an experimental rig where first applications of ANC on <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> noise are executed using the standard filtered reference Least Mean Square (FXLMS) algorithm. The secondary path is kept as simple as possible, due to the high frequency range of interest, and hence is chosen as the space between headphone loudspeaker and error microphone placed in the ear (input of the headphone loudspeaker and the output of the error microphone). A standard headphone loudspeaker is used for the control source and the microphone inside of an “Ear and Cheek Simulator Type 43 AG ” is used as the error microphone.

5000|$|The Indus Valley Civilization {{has yielded}} {{evidence}} of dentistry being practiced {{as far back}} as 7000 BC. This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen.

The age of the teeth has been estimated at 9000 years. In later times, mechanical hand drills were used. Like most hand drills, they were quite slow, with speeds of up to 15 rpm.
