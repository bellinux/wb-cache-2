5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable <b>inhaler</b> {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer <b>inhaler</b> was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox <b>inhaler.</b> Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma <b>inhaler,</b> which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E
5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his <b>inhaler,</b> but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E

5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic <b>inhaler</b> only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an <b>inhaler</b> to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{estimating}} the use of bronchodilators in asthma management as prescribed by primary health physicians (PHCP) in Greece, 62 PHCP answered a questionnaire about the manner of choice of treatment, the person who trained the patients {{in the use of}} <b>inhalers,</b> and the pharmacological treatment. 65 % of PHCP selected the treatment according to the pulmonologist's recommendations and 34 % by themselves. 26 % of the PHCP trained their patients in the use of <b>inhalers,</b> and 40 % considered that it was done by another physician. Forty-three physicians used adrenergic <b>inhalers</b> as the first choice of medicine. The second most popular medicine in asthma management is theophylline tablets (15 % of all medicines).

40|$|Syed Mohammad Tariq, 1 Enson C Thomas 2 1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Luton, 2 Respiratory Unit, Bedford Hospital, Bedford, UK Abstract: Long-term {{maintenance}} therapy for COPD is evolving rapidly. Dual bronchodilation with new long-acting muscarinic antagonist and long-acting beta-agonist (LAMA/LABA) fixed dose combination <b>inhalers</b> were introduced {{over the past}} 2 years. In clinical trials, these <b>inhalers</b> significantly improved lung function (trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second), patient-reported outcomes, {{and quality of life}} measures compared with placebo, their respective monocomponents, and tiotropium. The recorded adverse events of these new <b>inhalers</b> were also similar to those of their monocomponents or placebo. There are concerns regarding long-term complications (weight gain, osteoporosis, cataract) and increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia with the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The new LAMA/LABA <b>inhalers</b> could potentially reduce the use of ICS as part and parcel of {{maintenance therapy}} in COPD. Recent studies compared these LAMA/LABA <b>inhalers</b> with ICS/LABA combination <b>inhalers</b> in moderate-to-severe COPD. The results are promising and favor the LAMA/LABA <b>inhalers,</b> especially in the longer duration trials. Furthermore, there is a clearer picture emerging as to the subgroup of COPD patients who may be able to successfully switch from their current ICS/LABA therapy to these new LAMA/LABA <b>inhalers.</b> Keywords: COPD, dual bronchodilation, exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting beta-agonist, long-acting muscarinic antagonis...|$|R
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Indications for the use of long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with COPD are described in the various international guidelines, but no special recommendations are made concerning the use of combination <b>inhalers</b> containing a LABA as well as an ICS. To determine the place of combination <b>inhalers</b> in the treatment of COPD we reviewed recent literature concerning this subject. On molecular level ICS/LABA combination therapy has anti-inflammatory properties which cannot be attributed to ICS alone. All clinical studies indicate that the two available combinations (salmeterol/fluticasone and formoterol/budesonide) significantly reduce exacerbation rate of moderate/severe exacerbations when compared with placebo. Some studies also showed a significant reduction in exacerbation rate compared with LABA monotherapy, but not compared with ICS monotherapy. From the patient’s perspective, ICS/LABA combination <b>inhalers</b> are the first choice when both need to be prescribed, possibly improving patient compliance for ICS. Currently little evidence is available to predict if flexible treatment with LABA/ICS combination <b>inhalers</b> will improve disease control in COPD.

40|$|The {{stratospheric ozone}} layer {{plays a crucial role}} in {{protecting}} living organisms against ultraviolet radiation.

40|$|Asthma is chronic {{respiratory}} disease commonly treated using inhaled beta-agonist medications, or bronchodilators, such as albuterol.

25|$|Since Asthma is {{an ongoing}} disease and {{patients}} may go through periods where {{they do not have}} symptoms, this can interfere with proper use of steroid inhalers.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAlthough {{understanding}} of the scientific basis of aerosol therapy with dry powder <b>inhalers</b> (DPIs) has increased, some misconceptions still persist. These include the beliefs that high resistance <b>inhalers</b> are unsuitable for some patients, that extra fine (5 μm may impact on the oropharynx. For DPIs with a constant FPF at all flow rates, less of the delivered dose reaches the central and peripheral lung when the flow rate increases, risking under-dosing of the required medication. In contrast, flow rate-dependent <b>inhalers</b> increase their FPF output at higher flow rates, which compensates for the greater impaction on the upper airways as flow rate increases. ConclusionsThe technical characteristics of different <b>inhalers</b> and the delivery and deposition of the fine particle dose to the lungs may be important additional considerations to help the physician to select the most appropriate device for the individual patient to optimise their treatment...|$|R
