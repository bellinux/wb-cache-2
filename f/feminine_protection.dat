Mme. de Pompadour's good graces which she never wholly withdrew from him {{had given him}} a certain position of influence and power, from which his lack of wealth would otherwise have debarred him. But even with the uncertain and fickle Marquise's help Gaston de Stainville was far from attaining a position such as his alliance with Lydie would literally have thrown into his lap, such, of course, as fell to the share of the amiable milor, who had succeeded in capturing the golden prey.

Dr. Soriano believed in women with self-capacity and autonomy, all of which was mainly provided by education. She supported women to make them realize {{that they were not}} the weak sex, and that they did not depend on a patriarchal system. The end of World War I meant the beginning of the struggle for women’s rights. At the end of 1918, the National Association of Spanish Women (ANME) was created and Elisa was one of its members. Some of the organization’s most desired objectives were: to obtain the right and access to education, to work with equal pay, i.e. the same salary for the same work regardless of who has done it, to defend <b>feminine</b> rights, the <b>protection</b> to all <b>feminine</b> initiativex and humanitarian ideax. The first piece of information that was published in “El Globo” press on December 8th, under the title “The Force that is born” was a manifesto that ends with these words: “Woman’s redemption, perfection of societies, elevation of humanity”. Other ANME activists were Benitas Asas, Dolores Velasco and Julia Peguero who were led by María Espinosa de los Monteros. The organization’s ideology was considered as center feminist. Redención, a monthly feminist magazine, was the first publication to refer to the Female University Youth (JUF). Elisa affirmed the university’s authority to support its own specific feminist actions at the university and in conferences. Two years later, specifically at the Great Meeting of the National Association of Spanish Women, Soriano was selected as one of the permanent members of the new board of directors.|$|R
