5|$|There {{was some}} {{specific}} work {{required by the}} make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go {{through a series of}} levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> make them bloodshot.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met {{face to face with}} Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>to</b> which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E

25|$|Among {{several other}} awards in the {{following}} years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the University of Heidelberg. He lived {{in the nursing home}} in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and paranoia about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier. There were even days when Dunant insisted that the cook of the nursing home first taste his food before <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> protect him against possible poisoning. In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and organized religion generally. He was said to be agnostic.|$|E
25|$|A {{high school}} English teacher {{convinced}} {{him to go to}} college. He enrolled at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas, in 1965, intending to major in engineering. Living in south Texas made him curious about his roots there, and he enrolled in a Texas history which, he said, opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> the exploitation of Mexican Americans and farmworkers. A local Roman Catholic priest assisted him in obtaining financial aid, and he transferred to Ohio Northern College (a private, United Methodist Church-affiliated school) in 1966. He transferred to Bluffton College (a private, Mennonite-affiliated school) a year later. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was suddenly changed, however, and Philip was tardily forced {{again into the}} opposition against the Emperor, by the Treaty of Crépy of 1544, which opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> the danger threatening Protestantism. He prevented the Roman Catholic Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Lüneburg from taking forcible possession of his dominions and unsuccessfully planned a new alliance with German princes against Austria, pledging its members to prevent {{the acceptance of the}} decrees of the projected Council of Trent. When this failed, he sought to secure the neutrality of Bavaria in a possible war against the Protestants and proposed a new Protestant alliance {{to take the place of}} the Schmalkaldic League.|$|E

25|$|The judges {{stated in}} the verdict that Orić had reason to know about murder and cruel {{treatment}} of Serbs on two specific occasions in the Police station, but acquitted him of all other crimes. Orić was acquitted of direct involvement {{in the murder of}} prisoners {{in the early years of}} the 1992–95 Bosnia war. But the court found he had closed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> their mistreatment and failed to punish their killers. The three judges acquitted him of all charges related to the wanton destruction of Serb villages. The judges also took into account the lack of food and supplies and resulting lack of order and law during the Serbian siege on Srebrenica.|$|E
25|$|Directly east of Verona was {{the suburb}} of Veronetta, which the Austrians had heavily fortified. In addition, the bridges between Verona and Veronetta were well-covered by Austrian artillery. Therefore, Masséna turned <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> {{the west side}} of Verona, to the suburb of San Giorgio, which was {{accessible}} by a stone bridge known as the Castelvecchio Bridge (Ponte di Castelvecchio). Vukassovich was responsible for defending the area. The Austrian division commander had a wall built across the center of the bridge and fortified San Giorgio. However, Vukassovich only allocated two battalions to its defense. He deployed six battalions in the hills northeast of Verona, while the remainder of his division lay farther north, maintaining contact with Hiller's corps.|$|E
25|$|Steamboat Willie {{was first}} {{released}} on November 18, 1928, in New York. It was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks again {{served as the}} head animator, assisted by Johnny Cannon, Les Clark, Wilfred Jackson and Dick Lundy. This short {{was intended as a}} parody of Buster Keaton's Steamboat Bill, Jr., first released on May 12 of the same year. Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced, it was the first to find a distributor, and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey's debut. Willie featured changes to Mickey's appearance (in particular, simplifying <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> large dots) that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous Walt Disney films.|$|E

25|$|A reborn Fry {{suddenly}} {{emerges from}} the birth machine. Robot Fry and Robot Leela declare their love for each other, and leave together, leaving human Fry to tell human Leela that he will wait {{as long as it}} takes for her. Bender decides he is fed up with constantly partying and begins to vibrate from the buildup of excess energy. The Cyclophage suddenly emerges and attempts to eat Leela. Bender's severe vibrations cause one of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> fall out, and the Cyclophage swallows Bender, believing him to be a cyclops. The device explodes, killing the creature. Bender emerges intact and the Professor declares that Bender expended his excess energy and is now stable. The crew leave to celebrate, and the episode ends with Zapp Brannigan rapidly emerging from the birth machine.|$|E

Kumar, however, remains loyal to Hamilton and tries to open <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> all that is going on.|$|E
25|$|In Norden's {{version of}} the system, the bombardier first looked up the {{expected}} time {{it would take for}} the bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a countdown stopwatch, and the bombardier waited for the target to line up with a set of iron sights {{at the front of the}} bombsight. When the target passed through the sights, the timer was started, and the bombardier then rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they approached it. This movement was linked to a second sight through a gearing system that caused the second to move twice as fast as the first. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second sight was now at the correct aiming angle, or range angle; the bombardier moved <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> look through this second set of sights to time the drop.|$|E

25|$|Grand Master Oogway, an old {{tortoise}} and Shifu's mentor, has {{a vision}} that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison {{and return to the}} Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and opens <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> see Oogway pointing his finger at him. To the shock of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.|$|E
500|$|Haley Joel Osment as David, an {{innovative}} Mecha created by Cybertronics and programmed {{with the ability}} to love. He is adopted by Henry and Monica Swinton, but a sibling rivalry ensues once their son Martin comes out of suspended animation. Osment was Spielberg's first and only choice for the role. Osment avoided blinking <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> perfectly portray the character, and [...] "programmed" [...] himself with good posture for realism.|$|E
500|$|Darsheel Safary as Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi: In {{looking for}} an actor to play the central figure of Ishaan, writer Amole Gupte turned to Shiamak Davar's Summer Funk workshops.

Of his decision to cast Darsheel Safary, Gupte recalls that [...] "it was a tough call. But Darsheel has the mischief in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> be Ishaan.

500|$|Washington, {{with his}} hat in his hand, rode forward and waved the Americans forward, while he rode ahead on his horse. At this point, Mawhood had moved his troops {{slightly}} to the left {{to get out of}} the range of the American artillery fire.
