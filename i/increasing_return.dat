40|$|The {{theory of}} path {{dependence}} provides important claims to explain institutional development, {{relating to the}} roles of self-reinforcing process called 'increasing returns' since the theory is based on insights from economics. Countries remain locked-in onto a given trajectory. Reversals are possible only due to exogenous shocks. Path dependence has been criticized because it provides an overly static {{view of the world}} and for its poor treatment of institutional change. The thesis seeks to remedy these shortcomings and presents a case study based on <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> and institutional change. It asks whether <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> affect institutional reform and, if so, how and why. The case study proposed concerns the trajectory of Italian telecommunications institutions between 1979 and 2007. The trajectory of British telecommunications institutions is used as a benchmark to offer a structured comparison. In answer to the research question, the thesis argues that, between 1979 and 1992, there were <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> arising out of the relationships between telecommunications providers and elected politicians. These <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> contributed to the failure of proposals for reform, thus confirming that <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> keep countries on a steady trajectory. But, between 1992 and 1997 remarkable reforms took place. The thesis shows that new institutions were designed with a view to 'cut off' the opportunities for <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> to arise, thus indicating that <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> can contribute to institutional reform too. The new institutional trajectory of Italian telecommunications since 1997 continues to be shaped by <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> through a complex pattern of reactions and counter reactions by elected politicians. Thus, the thesis makes a contribution to path dependence insofar as it demonstrates that <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> can also bring institutional change. New paths can arise without exogenous shocks. In addition, the thesis' findings illustrate that path dependence needs to specify the relationships between <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> and actors...|$|R

A justification for <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> rather than linearity in the equation for technological progress is the fundamental insight of the idea-based growth literature according to this view.

40|$|The <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> {{revolution}} in trade is incomplete {{in an important}} respect there exists no compelling empirical demonstration {{of the role of}} <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> in determining production and trade structure. One reason is that trade patterns of the canonical <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> models are a consequence simply of specialization, which all theories permit. Krugman (1980) shows that <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> models with costs of trade economic geography do allow a simple test: home market effects of demand on production. Davis and Weinstein (1996) reject the simple Krugman (1980) model on OECD data. Here we pair the model with a richer geography structure and find evidence of the importance of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns,</b> in combination with comparative advantage, in affecting OECD manufacturing production structure. The results underscore the importance of market access in implementing models of economic geography. ...|$|R

This paper {{demonstrates}} that the Kennedy – Goodwin macroeconomic model of capital accumulation (KGM) does not reflect direct <b>increasing</b> <b>return.</b> The author presents its two versions: KGM-I with weakening roundabout <b>increasing</b> <b>return</b> and KGM-II with reinforcing roundabout <b>increasing</b> <b>return.</b> Both have the common intensive form and same asymptotically stable stationary state. KGM-II is changed to allow for direct <b>increasing</b> <b>return,</b> whereby {{the growth rate of}} employment ratio positively influences the growth rate of labour productivity. If the latter effect is strong enough, the dynamic stationary state is locally repelling and bifurcates into closed orbits. Their period is estimated. This paper supposes a closed loop control that stabilizes the oscillatory dynamics of the main macroeconomic variables, maintaining profitability and employment under direct and reinforcing roundabout increasing returns. It is proved that the supposed policy would be destabilizing if the direct scale effect were powerfully negative that is not empirically correct. Simulation runs confirm analytical findings.

40|$|Strange {{argued that}} {{barriers}} to trade have fallen because <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> in product development and production: rising R&D costs, short product life cycles and low marginal costs of production raise the relative cost of producing for protected national markets. As an explanation for global (as opposed to regional) liberalization, Strange's argument requires that <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> be extreme. The class of products exhibiting the most extreme <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> is that of information products-goods such as general purpose computer software and digitized entertainment. Following Strange's reasoning, it might seem that the technological nature of information products {{is one of the}} drivers of global trade liberalization. The trouble with this argument is that while the technological properties of information products are necessary for extreme <b>increasing</b> <b>returns,</b> they are not sufficient. <b>Increasing</b> <b>returns</b> in information products are cemented by business models which leverage small portfolios of intellectual property into the control of markets. Information products are, however, equally well suited to other business models in which <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> are slight and competitors are many. To continue with the software and entertainment examples earlier, these include models based on free software, and on disintermediated markets for digitized entertainment. At present, the institutional structures within which information products are made and sold, are contested. The outcome of these contests could result either in the maintenance of monopoly power and <b>increasing</b> <b>returns,</b> or a shift to far more competitive and decentralized market structures. If the latter occurs, the <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> imperative for global trade liberalization would be weakened...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The US {{macroeconomic}} {{statistics for}} 1948 – 2004 {{are used to}} calibrate a neoclassi-cal model of growth cycle damped by firms profit maximisation (NM). This paper proves that NM mirrors neither direct nor reinforcing roundabout increasing returns. An encompassing simple model (SM-I) of capital accumulation with the Kaldorian technical progress function and Glombowski – Krüger mechanization function relaxes the NM assumption of profit maximisation. It reflects reinforcing roundabout <b>increasing</b> <b>return.</b> The conditions for re-stricted local equivalence in vicinity of the same stationary state for these models are derived. Both models imply employment – labour productivity trade-off which is not supported empiri-cally.

40|$|This paper investigates {{some issues}} {{relating}} to the phenomenon of increasing returns: (1) What {{is the role of}} economies of scale in the theory of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns?</b> (2) Do pecuniary external economies lead to market failure and justify intervention in the market mechanism? (3) Are <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> sector-specific or generalised, and if they are sector specific, is it possible to identify and promote these sectors from a policy point of view? We argue that economies of scale are incidental to the broader phenomenon of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> and therefore cannot adequately explain their existence. On the second question, we argue that the presence of pecuniary external economies is characteristic of a well-functioning market system rather than an indication of its failure. Finally, <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> are generalised, so that policies intended to identify and promote specific sectors will tend to distort intersectoral relationships.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{increasing}} returns: positive feedback effects in mar-kets and firms. Positive feedback means that success causes further {{success and failure}} causes further failure. There are two market-based mechanisms of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns,</b> network effects and social interaction effects, and two firm-based mechanisms of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns,</b> scale effects and learning effects. Empirical research into the relations between these mechanisms and into the consequences of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> for firm performance is relatively scarce. The aim of the researcher with this thesis is to fill part of this gap. Concepts taken from economics and management sciences are used, building on the industrial organization theory of the firm. Three empirical studies were conducted for which new measurement models were constructed and tested and for which primary and secondary data was collected and analyzed. The {{results show that the}} presence of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> in the market influences firm per-formance, but always through the realization of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> in the firm. This means that in an <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> market, mana-gement is an important factor determining firm performance. It is therefore essential for managers to understand the mechanisms of <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> in their markets and firms and for {{them to be able to}} act strategically upon those mechanisms. This will enable managers to exploit business opportunities arising from <b>increasing</b> <b>returns</b> and to avoid pitfalls, which should result in better firm performance.
