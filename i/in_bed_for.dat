Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
5|$|The Moreno {{family was}} poor, but {{could afford a}} house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, {{was one of the}} few literate women in Buenos Aires. Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of {{fourteen}} children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money. The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later. Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.|$|E

Initially the symptoms appeared to have faded, but the acute pain returned, and Hancock required an operation for appendicitis. The operation was successful, and Hancock was making a good recovery until four days later. He died of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis the following day.|$|E
25|$|Court {{officials}} {{noted that}} the queen consort was exclusive in choosing who she associated with and confided in. She chose to not consummate her marriage on her wedding night as court tradition dictated her to, but later had immense difficulty in conceiving a healthy heir. Her first pregnancy five years after marriage ended in despair and humiliation when her infant son died shortly after birth. Her second son, Sunjong, was never a healthy child, often catching illnesses and convalescing <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> weeks. While Min was unable to truly connect with Gojong in the early years, trials during their later marriage brought them together.|$|E

25|$|In late 1898, {{physicians}} diagnosed the Empress Dowager with inoperable breast cancer, {{forcing her}} to stay <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> long periods. The cancer spread to her spine by the autumn of 1900, and as she worried about her personal letters (in which she detailed her concern over Germany's future under her son) falling {{into the hands of}} the Emperor, she requested that the letters be brought back to Great Britain in a cloak-and-dagger operation by her godson Frederick Ponsonby, the private secretary of her brother King Edward VII, who was making his final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg on 23 February 1901. These letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{they visit}} Johnny at the {{hospital}} when he is in critical condition. On their way home, Pony spots Cherry and they talk. Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her boyfriend. Pony calls her a traitor, but after explaining herself, they come to good terms. After escaping the hospital, Dally shows up {{just in time for}} the rumble. The Greasers win the fight. Afterward, Pony and Dally hurry back to see Johnny. He dies while they are in the hospital and a maniacal Dally runs out of the room. Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented. Dally calls the house to say that he has robbed a store and is running from the police. The Greasers find him, but see that Dally is pointing an unloaded gun at the police. They shoot Dally and he dies instantly. Ponyboy becomes overwhelmed and faints. He regains consciousness and is sick <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> several days due to a concussion. When the hearing finally approaches, the judge is generous and Pony is free from responsibility for Bob’s death. Pony will be allowed to remain at home with Darry and Soda.|$|E

Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete.

500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> a week. And do you know why he is like that? He told me. The pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Less {{successfully}} {{during this}} period, Kneale completed screenplays for adaptations of the novels Lord of the Flies by William Golding and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them {{went out of}} business—Kneale commented in a 2003 interview that [...] "I reckon I closed down at least two film companies." [...] Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of teenage suicides called The Big Giggle, or The Big, Big Giggle. Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> a long period, the concept started life as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation had second thoughts {{about the nature of}} the storyline and the possibility of copycat suicides; Kneale later agreed that they were probably right not to make it for television. The production was nearly made as a film by 20th Century Fox, but John Trevelyan, Chief Executive of the British Board of Film Censors, forbade the script's production.|$|E
500|$|Although he gave-up day-to-day {{running of}} the party's organization, he stayed on the {{national}} executive as the English-speaking vice-president from 1950 to 1954. After four years of comparatively limited involvement with CCF internal politics, Lewis became the party's national chairman, by winning the election to replace Percy Wright. He, along with Lorne Ingle, the person that replaced him as national secretary in 1950, became the main drafters of the 1956 Winnipeg Declaration, which replaced the Regina Manifesto. [...] The lead-up to the August 1956 CCF convention had Lewis working full-time in his labour practice, including work on the merger of the Canadian Congress of Labour and the Trades and Labour Congress to form the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), and putting in long hours organizing the committee that wrote the Declaration. He collapsed {{in his office in}} May 1956; after administering several tests for a possible cardiac condition, the doctors concluded that Lewis collapsed of exhaustion. [...] He stayed <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> a week and recovered enough to help the Declaration pass ten weeks later. [...] The Winnipeg convention was the CCF's swan song. [...] Even with the Declarations modified tone, which removed state planning and nationalization of industry as central tenets of the party's platform, the CCF suffered a crippling defeat in the 1958 federal election, which became known as the [...] "Diefenbaker sweep". It was obvious to Lewis, Coldwell {{and the rest of the}} CCF executive that the CCF could not continue as it was, and, with the co-operation of the CLC, they started exploring how to broaden its appeal.|$|E

500|$|The two secondhand vessels [...] {{were joined}} in January 1899 by the newly built Manchester City of 7,696 grt, {{constructed}} by Raylton Dixon & Co of Middlesbrough. This steamship carried [...] of coal, burned at [...] per day, giving {{a speed of}} , fast for her day. [...] She was a refrigerated vessel, designed to carry frozen meat and live cattle, and was claimed {{to be one of}} the largest meat-carrying ships then afloat. She made a successful maiden voyage from Canada and up the new canal to Manchester, taking two days and stopping overnight at Irlam to give the crew a rest. The Manchester Guardian reported on 16 January 1899 that [...] "there were many shakings of the head, not only in Liverpool, at the audacity of the attempt" [...] and that [...] "the canal pilots, on reaching Irlam, looked as if they had not been <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> a week, as their eyes were bleared with exhaustion". The City discharged 450cattle and 150sheep at Manchester Corporation's Foreign Animals Wharf near the Mode Wheel locks in Salford. With an overall length of , she was by far the largest vessel to have ventured up the waterway, and her successful navigation disproved the claim of Liverpool owners that only ships of [...] or less could safely reach Manchester. The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port. On her first voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1899, the City took nine days and sixteen hours; and arrived before the mail boat, which had left the Mersey twelve hours ahead of her.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
