5|$|Aspirin causes an {{increased}} risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches. Such cerebral microbleeds are important, since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage, Binswanger disease, and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|In TgPVR1 mice, the {{transgene}} encoding {{the human}} PVR {{was incorporated into}} mouse chromosome 4. These mice express {{the highest levels of}} the transgene and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, <b>intracerebral,</b> intramuscular, and intravenous pathways, but not through the oral route.|$|E
5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the <b>intracerebral</b> route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice {{have been shown to}} be susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.|$|E
5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or <b>intracerebral</b> contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The only {{common side}} effect of {{warfarin}} is bleeding. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (<b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270mg per day {{estimated}} an average absolute risk increase in <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within {{three months after the}} ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).|$|E
5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. <b>Intracerebral</b> hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 {{the first}} {{adequately}} large scale {{study on the}} natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or impairments, and 8.3% had died. Severe impairment or death were more likely in those aged over 37 years, male, affected by coma, mental status disorder, <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection and cancer. A subsequent systematic review of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that mortality is about 5.6% during hospitalisation and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery. After several months, {{two thirds of the}} cases has resolution ("recanalisation") of the clot. The rate of recurrence was low (2.8%).|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of <b>intracerebral</b> hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
25|$|A {{ruptured}} microaneurysm {{may cause}} an <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage, presenting as a focal neurological deficit.|$|E
25|$|Dioxaborolane {{chemistry}} enables radioactive fluoride (18F) {{labeling of}} red blood cells, {{which allows for}} positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intracerebral</b> {{hemorrhage}} – {{bleeding in}} the brain caused by the rupture of a blood vessel within the head. See also hemorrhagic stroke.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>intracerebral</b> {{hemorrhage}} require supportive care, including {{blood pressure}} control if required. People are monitored {{for changes in}} the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible). A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location {{and the size of the}} hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage may benefit.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{hemorrhage}} (also {{known as}} <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage), {{which is basically}} bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue) or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain's ventricular system).|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have also}} tried {{directly}} instilling the deficient enzyme hexosaminidaseA into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which bathes the brain. However, <b>intracerebral</b> neurons seem {{unable to take}} up this physically large molecule efficiently {{even when it is}} directly by them. Therefore, this approach to treatment of Tay–Sachs disease has also been ineffective so far.|$|E
25|$|Hypertension is an {{important}} risk factor for brain infarction and hemorrhage. Approximately 85% of strokes are due to infarction and the remainder are due to hemorrhage, either <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of stroke rises progressively with increasing blood pressure levels, particularly systolic blood pressure in individuals >65 years. Treatment of hypertension convincingly decreases the incidence of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive {{swelling of the}} bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, ecchymosis, erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, melena, epistaxis, hematuria, <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage and renal failure secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the cervid species in which CWD is known to naturally occur, Black-tailed deer and European red deer have been clinically demonstrated to be naturally susceptible to CWD. Other cervid species, including reindeer and caribou, are also suspected to be naturally vulnerable to this disease. Many other non-cervid mammalian species have been experimentally infected with CWD, either orally or via <b>intracerebral</b> inoculation. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets.|$|E
25|$|Serious and {{possibly}} fatal complications due to extremely low counts (<5,000 per μl) include subarachnoid or <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull or brain), lower gastrointestinal bleeding or other internal bleeding. An ITP patient with an extremely low count {{is vulnerable to}} internal bleeding caused by blunt abdominal trauma, as might be experienced in a motor vehicle crash. These complications are not likely when the platelet count is above 20,000 per μl.|$|E
25|$|Caterpillar hair {{can be a}} {{cause of}} human health problems. Caterpillar hairs {{sometimes}} have venoms in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ranging from urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis, consumption coagulopathy, renal failure, and <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage. Skin rashes are the most common, {{but there have been}} fatalities. Lonomia is a frequent cause of envenomation in Brazil, with 354 cases reported between 1989 and 2005. Lethality ranging up to 20% with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|Coagulopathy {{is another}} {{cardinal}} feature of ALF. The liver has {{the central role}} in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor the severity of hepatic injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects). Progressive thrombocytopenia with the loss of larger and more active platelets is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without DIC increases risk of <b>intracerebral</b> bleeding.|$|E
25|$|While a large {{meta-analysis}} {{found the}} outcomes and risks of surgical clipping and endovascular coiling to be statistically similar, no consensus has been reached. In particular, the large randomised control trial International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial appears {{to indicate a}} higher rate of recurrence when <b>intracerebral</b> aneurysms are treated using endovascular coiling. Analysis of data from this trial has indicated a 7% lower eight-year mortality rate with coiling, a high rate of aneurysm recurrence in aneurysms treated with coiling—from 28.6-33.6% within a year, a 6.9 times greater rate of late retreatment for coiled aneurysms, and a rate of rebleeding 8 times higher than surgically-clipped aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|It {{generally}} {{occurs in}} small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension, intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred. Other potential causes are trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, {{illicit drug use}} (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of <b>intracerebral</b> bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a mortality rate of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (which technically may also be classified {{as a type of}} stroke).|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} modifiable {{risk factors for}} stroke are {{high blood pressure and}} atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking (active and passive), drinking lots of alcohol and drug use, lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption and unhealthy diet. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and <b>intracerebral</b> and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Excessive vitamin A {{consumption}} {{can lead}} to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. In chronic cases, hair loss, dry skin, drying of the mucous membranes, fever, insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, bone fractures, anemia, and diarrhea can all be evident {{on top of the}} symptoms associated with less serious toxicity. Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased <b>intracerebral</b> pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.|$|E
500|$|Recently, {{a fourth}} TgPVR mouse model was developed. These [...] "cPVR" [...] mice carry hPVR cDNA, {{driven by a}} β-actin promoter, and have proven {{susceptible}} to poliovirus through <b>intracerebral,</b> intramuscular, and intranasal routes. In addition, these mice are capable of developing the bulbar form of polio after intranasal inoculation.|$|E
500|$|Nerves may be {{compressed}} {{because of}} increased intracranial pressure, a mass effect of an <b>intracerebral</b> haemorrhage, or tumour that presses against the nerves and interferes with the transmission of impulses along the nerve. [...] A loss of functionality of a single cranial nerve may sometimes be the first symptom of an intracranial or skull base cancer.|$|E
500|$|As only 10 {{percent of}} people {{admitted}} to the emergency department with a thunderclap headache are having an SAH, other possible causes are usually considered simultaneously, such as meningitis, migraine, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. <b>Intracerebral</b> hemorrhage, in which bleeding occurs within the brain itself, is twice as common as SAH and is often misdiagnosed as the latter. It {{is not unusual for}} SAH to be initially misdiagnosed as a migraine or tension headache, which can lead to a delay in obtaining a CT scan. In a 2004 study, this occurred in 12 percent of all cases and was more likely in people who had smaller hemorrhages and no impairment in their mental status. The delay in diagnosis led to a worse outcome. In some people, the headache resolves by itself, and no other symptoms are present. This type of headache is referred to as [...] "sentinel headache", because it is presumed to result from a small leak (a [...] "warning leak") from an aneurysm. A sentinel headache still warrants investigations with CT scan and lumbar puncture, as further bleeding may occur in the subsequent three weeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{combination}} of <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure (if present) {{leads to a}} [...] "sympathetic surge", i.e. over-activation of the sympathetic system. This is thought to occur through two mechanisms, a direct effect on the medulla that leads to activation of the descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to the peripheral circulation where they activate the sympathetic system. As {{a consequence of the}} sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure; mediated by increased contractility of the ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance. The consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden, severe, and are frequently life-threatening. The high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm), electrocardiographic changes (in 27 percent of cases) and cardiac arrest (in 3 percent of cases) may occur rapidly after the onset of hemorrhage. A further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema where a process of increased pressure within the pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the air spaces, the alveoli, of the lung.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the head trauma also {{influences}} the risk of PTE. [...] People who suffer depressed skull fractures, penetrating head trauma, early PTS, and <b>intracerebral</b> and subdural haematomas due to the TBI are especially likely to suffer PTE, which occurs in more than 30% of people with {{any one of these}} findings. About 50% of patients with penetrating head trauma develop PTE, and missile injuries and loss of brain volume are associated with an especially high likelihood of developing the condition. [...] Injuries that occur in military settings carry higher-than-usual risk for PTE, probably because they more commonly involve penetrating brain injury and brain damage over a more widespread area. [...] Intracranial hematomas, in which blood accumulates inside the skull, {{are one of the most}} important risk factors for PTE. [...] Subdural hematoma confers a higher risk of PTE than does epidural hematoma, possibly because it causes more damage to brain tissue. Repeated intracranial surgery confers a high risk for late PTE, possibly because people who need more surgery are more likely to have factors associated with worse brain trauma such as large hematomas or cerebral swelling. [...] In addition, the chances of developing PTE differ by the location of the brain lesion: brain contusion that occurs on in one or the other of the frontal lobes has been found to carry a 20% PTE risk, while a contusion in one of the parietal lobes carries a 19% risk and one in a temporal lobe carries a 16% chance. [...] When contusions occur in both hemispheres, the risk is 26% for the frontal lobes, 66% for the parietal, and 31% for the temporal.|$|E
