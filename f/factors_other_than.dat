Stanley said he would not oppose the Gray Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of <b>factors</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that the Gray Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E
5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial <b>factors</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm. Studies also indicate that males who self-harm may also be at {{a greater risk of}} completing suicide.|$|E
