The wide range of this parameter is because it is a [...] "storage energy density" [...] which translates into plasma energy density with different efficiency depending on the widely differing performance of different machines.

50|$|As a type {{of honey}} bee, Apis cerana must collect and store around {{a third of its}} nectar in a {{concentrated}} form in order to ensure an adequate supply for consumption during the harsh winter. The nest is multi-combed and somewhat insulated, allowing the species to achieve optimal nest temperatures and thereby optimize foraging at early hours. The nest itself is a simple vertical comb made from wax secreted by workers, while the thermoregulation is generated by fanning and water evaporation from water collected in the field. This large-scale storage tactic requires the construction of a stable and sturdy comb structure for such honey storage. However, as the production of beeswax for a comb is an energetically expensive endeavor, colonies do not generally build the entire structure very early on. Instead, the colony builds a smaller set of combs that satisfies the <b>initial</b> <b>storage</b> needs. Upon moving into the new nest, the colony will then continue to enlarge the combs until there are enough storage units to sufficiently account for all of the required honey. In general, the initial set of combs may account for around 20,000 cells, while the final, completed structure may contain up to 100,000. These nests are typically large enough to host around 6,000 to 7,000 individuals and are found {{in a wide range of}} external environments.|$|E

After that this information either vanishes or is moved to next system of memory. Short-term memory has limited capacity and {{is often referred to}} as [...] "working-memory", however these are not the same. Working memory involves a different part of the brain and allows you to manipulate it after <b>initial</b> <b>storage.</b> The information that travels from sensory memory to short-term memory must pass through the Attention gateway. The filter of attention keeps a check between sensory memory and short-term memory. You cannot skip systems of memory, such as jumping directly from sensory input to long-term memory. Sensory input must be actively relayed and filtered by the thalamus to the cortex for short term memory storage.https://www.quora.com/Neurologically-how-does-the-brain-filter-sensory-inputs Interestingly enough, olfactory sensory input is the most prevalent in our memory, contrary to the popular belief, as it mostly bypasses the thalamus, and all such information gets encoded directly.

5000|$|The precise {{impact of}} the dam on the {{downstream}} countries is not known. Egypt fears a temporary reduction of water availability due to the filling of the dam and a permanent reduction because of evaporation from the reservoir. Studies indicate that the primary factors which will govern the impacts during the reservoir filling phase include the initial reservoir elevation of the Aswan High Dam, the rainfall that occurs during the filling period and the negotiated arrangement between the three countries. These studies also show that only through close and continuous coordination, the risks of negative impacts can be minimized or eliminated. The reservoir volume (74 billion cubic meters) is about 1.5 times the average annual flow (49 billion cubic meters) of the Blue Nile at the Sudanese-Egyptian border. This loss to downstream countries could be spread over several years if the countries reach an agreement. Depending on the <b>initial</b> <b>storage</b> in the Aswan High Dam and this filling schedule of the GERD, flows into Egypt could be temporarily reduced, which may affect the income of two million farmers {{during the period of}} filling the reservoir. Allegedly, it would also [...] "affect Egypt's electricity supply by 25 to 40 percent, while the dam is being built". However, hydropower accounts for less than 12 percent of total electricity production in Egypt in 2010 (14 out of 121 billion kWh), so that a temporary reduction of 25 percent in hydropower production translates into an overall temporary reduction in Egyptian electricity production of less than 3 percent. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam could also lead to a permanent lowering of the water level in Lake Nasser, if floods are stored instead in Ethiopia. This would reduce the current evaporation of more than 10 billion cubic meter per year, but it would also reduce the ability of the Aswan High Dam to produce hydropower to the tune of a 100 MW loss of generating capacity for a 3 m reduction of the water level. Significantly however, the increased storage in Ethiopia can provide a greater buffer to shortages in Sudan and Egypt during years of future drought, if the countries can reach a compromise.|$|E

40|$|To achieve {{social and}} {{economic}} sustainability in and and semi-arid areas under water scarce situations, {{it is vital to}} promote efficient use of water through improved management of water resources. This paper presents a swarm optimization based solution to a detailed operational model for short-term reservoir operation for irrigation of multiple crops. The model integrates the dynamics associated with the water released from a reservoir to the actual water utilized by crops at farm level. It takes into account the nonlinear relationship of root growth, soil heterogeneity, soil moisture dynamics for multiple crops, yield response to water deficit at various growth stages of the crops and economic benefits from the crops. As the developed model is a nonlinear one, it is solved using a novel global optimization technique, namely elitist-mutation particle swarm optimization (EMPSO). The model's applicability is demonstrated through a case study of Malaprabha Reservoir system in Southern India. The performance of the model is examined for different water deficit conditions and the sensitivity of the crop yield is analysed for water shortage at various growth stages. Also, the consideration of economic benefits in the objective function and its effect on the water allocation decisions for multiple crops are studied. Consequently, the output from the model includes <b>initial</b> <b>storages,</b> releases, overflows and evaporation losses for each 10 -day period on the reservoir side; and allocation of water, actual evapotranspiration and initial soil moisture for each crop for each 10 -day period on the field side, thus facilitating decision making for optimal utilization of the available water resources...|$|R
