This article summarizes the key claims of the informational mind hypothesis and considers them in relation to Tononi’s information integration theory of consciousness.

40|$|We use {{alternative}} {{assumptions about}} the divisibility of goods and money {{and the ability of}} agents to use lotteries on money to investigate to what extent the <b>indivisibility</b> <b>of</b> money is the cause for the typically inefficient production and consumption decisions in search-theoretic models of money. Our framework potentially generates three types of inefficiencies: the no-trade inefficiency, where no trade takes place even though it would be socially efficient to trade; and the too-much-trade and too-little-trade inefficiencies, where the quantities produced and exchanged are either larger or smaller than what the solution to a social planner’s problem would mandate. It is shown that while the no-trade and the too-much-trade inefficiencies are caused by the <b>indivisibility</b> <b>of</b> money, the too-little-trade ine. ciency remains even when money is divisible unless it is sufficiently valued.

50|$|Urban {{theory is}} an {{agglomeration}} of social theories - classical, neo-classical and modern.

Sustainability is increasingly becoming the lynch-pin of urban studies with triple-line accountability (social, environment and economics) given more emphasis though not necessarily translated to practice. Here, urbanomics, by default, renders environmental and social concerns to subservience.|$|R
