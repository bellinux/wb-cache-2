6000|$|I {{proceed to}} show that the Homeric corslet did not avail against a spear at close quarters, but could turn an arrow point (once), and could {{sometimes}} turn a spear which had perforated a shield. So far, and not further, the Homeric corslet was serviceable. But if a warrior's breast or back was not covered by the shield, and received a thrust at close quarters, the corslet was pierced more easily than the pad of paper which was said to have been used as secret armour in a duel by the Master of Sinclair (1708). [Footnote: Proceedings in Court Marshal held upon John, Master of Sinclair. Sir Walter Scott. Roxburghe Club. (<b>Date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> 1708.)] It is desirable to prove this feebleness of the corslet, because the poet often says that a man was smitten with the spear in breast or back when unprotected by the shield, without mentioning the corslet, whence it is argued by the critics that corslets were not worn when the original lays were fashioned, and that they have only been sporadically introduced, in an after age when the corslet was universal, by [...] "modernising" [...] later rhapsodists aiming at the up-to-date.|$|E

40|$|Background: Primary {{angioplasty}} {{is superior}} to intravenous thrombolysis as reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Aim: To compare the results of available reperfusion strategies for initial management of acute myocardial infarction during hospitalization and 5 years follow up. Patients and Methods: Historical cohort study from a prospective registry of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction to our center. Patients treated with primary angioplasty were identified and were then matched by age, sex and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> with patients treated with throm-bolysis. The clinical outcomes were compared including hospitalization and 5 -years follow-up. Results: From March 1993 to August 2001, 98 patients were treated with primary angioplasty and matched with 98 thrombolyzed patients. The groups were comparable. Compared to thrombolysis, angioplasty had a higher success rate (68 and 91 % respectively), resulted in less complications and reduced mortality (11 and 2 % respectively), required less revascularization procedures and shorter hospital stay (17 and 13 days, respectively). During the follow-up of survivors, no differences in events or additional mortality were detected at 1 or 5 years. Conclusions: Primary angioplasty is superior as treatment in terms of achieving success and reducing mortality during hospitalization.

40|$|Introduction Single unprovoked {{seizures}} {{occur in}} about 4 % {{of the population}} and they have significant psychosocial consequences for the patients and their families. Little information is available on the timeliness and safety of assessment of first unprovoked seizures. In this study, we review the timeliness of the referral and evaluation of patients with first unprovoked seizure in a Canadian neurological provincial referral center. Method Retrospective analysis of 51 patients over a 3. 5 year period was performed and data were collected on patient demographics, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> and time to evaluation by the epileptologist, evaluations completed, treatments initiated and patient outcomes. Results We found that most patients were seen by the epileptologist within 6 months, there was only a 9 % discrepancy in final diagnoses between the epileptologist and the referring physician, and there were no fatalities or serious complications in the patients we studied. However, a few patients waited very long periods before imaging and evaluation by the epileptologist, and restrictions on driving privileges were recommended in only 3 % of the patients. Conclusions We conclude that the referral process for a first unprovoked seizure is timely.

40|$|Suicide is {{the number}} one cause of death among incarcerated youth. We {{examined}} the demographic and forensic risk factors for self-harm in youth in juvenile detention using a Canadian provincial correctional database. We analyzed data from de-identified youth aged 12 to 18 {{at the time of their}} offense who were in custody in a Manitoba youth correctional facility between January 1, 2005 and December 30, 2010 (N = 5, 102). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined the association between staff-identified self-harm events in custody and demographic and custodial variables. Time to the event was examined based on the admission date and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event.</b> Demographic variables associated with self-harm included female sex, lower educational achievement, older age, and child welfare involvement. Custodial variables associated with self-harm included higher criminal severity profiles, younger age at first incarceration, longer sentence length, disruptive institutional behavior, and a history of attempting escape. Youth identified at entry as being at risk for suicide were more likely to self-harm. Events tended to occur earlier in the custodial admission. Self-harm events tended to occur within the first 3 months of an admission stay. Youth with more serious offenses and disruptive behaviors were more likely to self-harm. Individuals with problematic custodial profiles were more likely to self-harm. Suicide screening identified youth at risk for self-harm.

40|$|Background: So far {{few studies}} were done to {{determine}} predictors of neonatal mortality in Ethiopia. This study was aimed {{to provide information}} on the incidence and risk factors of neonatal survival in Eastern Ethiopia from September, 2007 to August, 2012. Methods: The study uses data extracted from Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance (Kersa HDSS) System database, which {{is located in the}} Oromiya Regional State, Eastern Ethiopia. The surveillance system is an open cohort, which was established in 2007. Data extraction includes all live births recorded in the system. The main outcome variable was the occurrence of death within 28 days after birth (neonatal death). The survival time was calculated in days using the time interval between the date of birth and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> (death). Kaplan-Meier model and Cox-proportional hazard techniques were used to identify predictors of neonatal death. Results: The overall, Early and Late Neonatal Mortality Rate was 28. 37, 19. 55 and 8. 82 per 1000 live births, respectively.   A Neonatal Mortality Incidence Rate was 1 per 1000 (95 % CI, 0. 87 - 1. 15) person days. Risk factors of neonatal survival include birth type (HR= 5. 40; 95 % CI, 3. 64 - 8. 02), preterm birth (HR= 11. 17; 95 % CI, 7. 17 - 17. 40), and previous infant sibling born (died HR= 2. 15; 95 % CI, 1. 39 - 3. 33 : no previous birth HR= 1. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 2. 72). Conclusion: A significantly high level of neonatal mortality incidence rate was observed, which majority of the neonatal deaths were found to occur at early neonatal period. Therefore, efforts needs to be exerted in addressing the risk factors identified as predictors of neonatal mortality. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) suicides {{have been}} {{frequent}} in Japan in recent years. This study {{was performed to}} describe the epidemiologic profile of an outbreak of H 2 S suicides in Japan. Methods: In September 2008, questionnaires about patients involved in H 2 S suicides were sent to 250 hospitals in Japan. Data collected from each patient included gender, age, clinical manifestations, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event,</b> location of suicide, source of H 2 S, treatments and neurological outcome. Results: A total of 90 subjects (60 men, 30 women) were enrolled in this study. In this outbreak, the first case was reported in September 2006 and subsequent cases reached a peak in April 2008. There were 60 cases of attempted suicide by generating H 2 S gas (suicide group) and 30 cases of secondary exposure (secondary exposure group). The suicide group included mostly subjects in their twenties. Cardiopulmonary arrest at the scene was reported in 39 cases (65 %). Clinical features of the suicide group inpatients included coma (14 cases), convulsion (1 case), and lung edema (1 case). Patients in suicide group were significantly younger than secondary exposure group (P < 0. 001). The development of cardiopulmonary arrest was significantly higher in suicide group (65 % vs. 10 %; P < 0. 001). Death was more frequent in suicide group (70 % vs. 10 %; P < 0. 001) and patients with secondary exposure were discharged with better neurological outcomes (Table 1).     Conclusion: Suicide with H 2 S poisoning has recently been a serious social problem especially in younger generation in Japan. There is extensive information on H 2 S suicide methods on the internet. Management of access to websites describing suicide methods is an immediate necessity together with counseling for suicide prevention.   How to cite this article: Iseki K, Ozawa A, Seino K, Goto K, Tase C.

30|$|A {{strength}} {{of the present study}} is that we included all distances and all strokes of freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, butterfly and individual medley out of one data set in contrast to other studies investigating only single strokes. The present study is, however, limited in terms of missing data for anthropometric (Siders et al. 1993; Jagomägi and Jürimäe 2005; Zampagni et al. 2008; Charles and Bejan 2009; Lätt et al. 2010), biological (Schulz and Curnow 1988; Larsson et al. 1979; Rodrigues et al. 2006; Lata and Walia 2007), and physiological (Tanaka and Seals 2003; Zamparo 2006; Jürimäe et al. 2007) characteristics. Swimming performance and probably also the changes in the age of peak swimming performance are affected by anthropometric characteristics such as body height and body mass (Charles and Bejan 2009). Thus, the comparison between data of the aforementioned investigations in different time periods with the main findings of the present studies might also have been affected by that fact. The age of finalists at the specific events was calculated for each swimmer by the swimmer’s year of birth and the exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>event.</b> The exact year of birth could not have been detected for each swimmer. Thus, we assumed that the deviations from the very exact age will compensate one another by a normal distribution. Therefore, we need further research about the age of peak swimming performance, its changes over time, its differences between the sexes, and its behaviour in different strokes and distances in recent years and also at international level. Future studies should approve our findings in other competitions at world-class level such as for example the Commonwealth Games and the Pan Pacific Championships. Furthermore, we probably have not examined a time period that is large enough to assess progression in swimming performance with validity. Therefore, further research has to be done with an appropriate timeframe. Future studies that can establish a model for swimming performance with sufficient data before 2009 and after 2010 (when the FINA rules changed for the wetsuit) would be really interesting.|$|E
