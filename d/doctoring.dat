He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any <b>doctoring</b> was ever done on the card.|$|E
5|$|After Árbenz's resignation, {{his family}} {{remained}} for 73 {{days at the}} Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which was crowded with almost 300 exiles. During this period, the CIA initiated {{a new set of}} operations against Árbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. The CIA obtained some of Árbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after <b>doctoring</b> the documents. The CIA also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as Árbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, Jacobo Árbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry he had bought for his wife, María Cristina Villanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of Árbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced largely by the CIA's campaign.|$|E

Declan follows Paul and becomes angry with him. Donna is injured at the site and Paul decides to frame Declan by <b>doctoring</b> the CCTV footage. Declan finds out and asks Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to help him. Toadie tells Declan that Paul has embezzled money from Lassiter's Hotel and Declan tells Diana Marshall (Jane Badler). Diana comes to Erinsborough and Declan tells her {{he made a mistake}} to protect Rebecca. Diana does not believe him and she finds the evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Paul asks Declan to take his place as manager of Lassiter's for six months and Declan and Diana team up to bring Paul down. Declan neglects Kate and she ends their relationship. He later kisses Candace Carey, which Kate witnesses. Paul discovers Diana and Declan's plan and threatens Declan. Paul is later pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. Declan is questioned by Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) over the accident. Declan and Kate sleep together, but Kate tells him that it was a mistake. Declan encourages Rebecca to divorce Paul, but she tells him that Paul knows everything. Declan tells her that they need to leave. When Kate finds them packing, Declan tells her that he pushed Paul. However, he is covering for his mother.|$|E

5|$|The {{railway network}} joined Burton in August 1839, {{which made it}} much more {{economical}} to distribute beer throughout the country. In 1842 William Worthington entered into partnership with Thomas Robinson, and the business traded as Worthington & Robinson. By 1861 Worthington employed 191 men and boys. Worthington dissolved the Robinson partnership in 1864, in order for his sons to acquire the business. The company became known as Worthington and Company, the co-partners being: William (1799-1871), {{with two of his}} sons, William Henry (1826-1894) and Calvert (1830-1871), who were joined two years later by his youngest son, Albert Octavius (1844-1918). After the introduction of agencies in British conurbations from the mid-1860s, the company began to rapidly expand. In 1866 the Prince of Wales awarded the company the Royal Warrant. Worthington pioneered brewing science from 1866 by employing a chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, who led the world in separation and cultivation of pure yeast strains. From 1872 the Worthington brewery was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company had previously resisted employing a laboratory, for fear that the public would perceive the scientific apparatus as a means of <b>doctoring</b> the beer. In order to differentiate themselves from other brewers, Worthington labelled their beers with alphabetical letters: their Burton Ales were called G, F and D, their light dinner ale was labelled M. Worthington E was an India Pale Ale, a competitor to Bass Pale Ale. By 1880, Worthington's IPA was challenging Bass's sales in the home market.|$|E

25|$|Sanding of {{the bowling}} ball surface was another {{technique}} {{to soften the}} ball's surface.

Pia was startled by the visible image of the negative plate, implying that the shroud is effectively a negative of some kind. Pia was at first accused of <b>doctoring</b> his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's.

Everything was heavily decayed, and building and <b>doctoring</b> progressed together for months. He now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann, joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out {{with the help of}} local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included Germanin and tryparsamide. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.|$|E
