40|$|Over {{the last}} decades several {{achievements}} have emerged in Nordic state societies concerning gender equality, {{particularly with regard to}} political representation, salaries, and shared parental leave. In most newsrooms one may find a near equal distribution of women and men working alongside one another. Additionally, in the larger newsrooms of Sweden, there is a gender balance at the manageriallevel. Yet in terms of news content, women remain a minority. By using qualitative and quantitative data from two projects, The Global Media Monitoring Project and The Global Status of Women in the News Media, this article assesses some of the challenges and best practice solutions for gender equality in Scandinavian newsrooms. The major gender discrepancies between newsrooms can often be explained by the level of gender awareness at the societal-level. Further, capable leadership, policies, and <b>gender</b> <b>monitoring</b> seem to benefit a gender balance in the news.

40|$|Neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic {{studies suggest}} that {{grammatical}} (gender) and phonological information are retrieved independently and that gender can be accessed before phonological information. This study investigated the relative time courses of gender and phonological encoding using topographic evoked potentials mapping methods. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded using a high resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) system (128 channels) during gender and phoneme monitoring in silent picture naming. Behavioural results showed similar reaction times (RT) between gender and word onset (first phoneme) monitoring, and longer RT when monitoring the second syllable onset. Temporal segmentation analysis (defining dominant map topographies using cluster analysis) revealed no timing difference between <b>gender</b> <b>monitoring</b> and word onset monitoring: both effects fall within the same time window at about 270 – 290 ms after picture presentation. Monitoring a second syllable onset generated a later effect at about 480 ms. Direct comparison between gender and first phoneme monitoring revealed a difference of only 10 ms between tasks at approximately 200 ms. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} lemma retrieval and phonological encoding may proceed in parallel or overlap. Word onset is retrieved simultaneously with gender, while the longer RT and the later ERP effect for second syllable onset reflect that segmental encoding continues incrementally to the following phonemes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{temporal}} changes in meat/poultry/fish consumption patterns between 1995 and 2011 – 2012 in the Australian population. Meat/poultry/fish consumption from all food sources, including recipes, was analysed by gender, age group, and socio-economic status using 24 -h recall data from the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (n = 13, 858) and the 2011 – 2012 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n = 12, 153). The overall proportion of people consuming meat/poultry/fish remained stable (91. 7 % versus 91. 3 %, p = 0. 55), but a shift in the type of meat consumed was observed. Red meat, including beef and lamb, was consumed by fewer people over the time period (from 56 % to 49 %), whereas poultry consumption increased (from 29 % to 38 %). Amounts of all meat/poultry/fish consumed were reportedly higher in 2011 – 2012 compared with 1995. This resulted in similar (red meat, and processed meat) or slightly higher (poultry, and fish) per-capita intakes in 2011 – 2012.

40|$|Two new {{procedures}} {{were employed to}} investigate the effects of semantic and grammatical gender on lexical access in Italian and to investigate the interaction of gender with other factors that are known to influence lexical access in other languages. The gender-monitoring task requires a conscious decision about the gender of each noun, whereas the word repetition task does not require explicit attention to gender. In both tasks, single words are presented out of context, under speeded conditions. Both procedures proved to be sensitive indices of word recognition, with reaction times that are {{closely tied to the}} point at which words can be uniquely identified (although some processing before and after the uniqueness point was seen). In both tasks, reaction times were strongly affected by phonological factors (e. g., length, number of syllables, and presence of frication on the initial consonant). Phonological transparency of gender marking had a reliable effect on <b>gender</b> <b>monitoring</b> but had no effect on word repetition, suggesting that explicit attention to gender may be a factor affecting utilization of this phonological cue. Semantic factors (including semantic gender) had no effect on performance. Frequency and age of acquisition had very small effects when other factors were controlled.

40|$|Two {{procedures}} {{were used to}} explore the effects of semantic and grammatical gender on the recognition and processing of Bulgarian nouns, {{in relation to other}} factors that are known to affect lexical access. This study in a three-gender language was modeled on previous work in Italian, a two-gender language (Bates, Devescovi, Pizzamiglio, D’Amico, & Hernandez, 1995). Words were presented auditorily in randomized lists in two tasks: (1) repeat the word as quickly as possible and (2) determine the grammatical gender of the noun as soon as possible and indicate the decision by pressing a button. Reaction times in both tasks were influenced by phonological factors, word frequency, and irregularity of gender marking, but semantic and grammatical gender affected only <b>gender</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The significant contribution of semantic gender to processing in Bulgarian contrasts with previous findings for Italian. Also, we obtained an interaction between sex of the subject and noun gender, reflecting a bias toward one’s own grammatical gender “counterpart ” (especially for females). Reanalysis of the prior study in Italian showed a similar interaction but confirmed no effects of the semantic gender of the noun, suggesting that these two natural gender effects can dissociate. Possible reasons for cross-linguistic differences are discussed, with implications for comparative studies of gender and lexical access.

Results showed a clear effect of gender priming, involving both facilitation and inhibition. Priming was observed whether or not the subjects ’ attention was directed to gender per se. Results suggest that gender priming involves a combination of controlled, post-lexical processing and automatic, pre-lexical processing. Implications for different models of lexical access are discussed, with special reference to modular vs. interactive-activation theories. Why grammatical priming? The issue of whether gender can be a useful prime in lexical access is a particular example of a more general problem: How can context influence the nature and timing of information access during lexical processing? The answer to this question has consequences for theories of language comprehension, including the contrast between modularity and interactive models of lexical access (for reviews, see Balota, 1992; Frauenfelder & Tyler (Eds.), 1987; Levelt (Ed.), 1992). If grammatical gender does contribute to word recognition, then it can be said to constitute an example of grammatical priming. Two earlier studies provided evidence for faster lexical decisions when the prime and target are preceded by a syntactically appropriate context (Goodman, McClelland & Gibbs, 1981, in a study of English), or when they were preceded by an appropriat...|$|E

Cross sectional data from the Second National Health Sur-vey in Thailand was analysed. This set of data collected by the Ministry of Pub-lic Health from 1996 to 1997 was ob-tained from a total of 998 subjects (com-prising 396 men and 602 women) aged 45 - 50. Results from the Receiver Oper-ating Characteristic curve (ROC curve) identified those with health risk factors demonstrating cut-off points for WC between 81. 5 - 84 centimeters for men and 76 - 80. 5 centimeters for women and BMI between 23. 3 - 23. 9 kg/m 2 for both genders, respectively. Results from the Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated lower risks of having high blood cholesterol, high fasting blood sugar and high blood pressure with cut-off points 84 cm for men, 80 cm for women and BMI 23 kg/m 2 for both gen-ders compared to cut-off points 102 cm for men, 88 cm for women and BMI 25 kg/m 2 for both genders as specified for the population in Western countries.
