5|$|Carmarthenshire is {{a county}} of rich, fertile {{farmland}} and productive seas and estuaries, {{that give the}} county a range of <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> motivate many home cooks and restaurateurs. Carmarthenshire has ambitions to become the premier food-producing county of Wales, based on its strong reputation for first class products.|$|E
5|$|Long before European contact, Cucurbita {{had been}} a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas, and the species became an {{important}} food for European settlers, including the Pilgrims, even featuring at the first Thanksgiving. Commercially produced pumpkin commonly used in pumpkin pie is most often varieties of C.moschata; Libby's, {{by far the largest}} producer of processed pumpkin, uses a proprietary strain of the Dickinson pumpkin variety of C.moschata for its canned pumpkin. Other <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> can be made using members of this genus include biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, granola, ice cream, lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter, salads, soups, and stuffing. Squash soup is a dish in African cuisine. The xerophytic species are proving useful in the search for nutritious <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> grow well in arid regions. C.ficifolia is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks.|$|E

5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to {{a wider range of}} foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{examining}} the health impact of sugars are inconclusive. The United Nations meta-analysis and WHO studies showed contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms. Other studies indicated variable results between health effects, particularly on obesity, {{and whether the}} research {{was funded by the}} sugar industry or those by independent sponsors. The 'empty calories' argument is that a diet high in added sugar will reduce consumption of <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> contain essential nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> feature peanut butter and marshmallow fluff, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces Marshmallow Fluff, a brand of marshmallow fluff, produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, frosting, pie and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured peanut butter and Marshmallow Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|A 2006 {{study found}} that goats {{exhibited}} intricate social behaviours indicative of high-level cognitive processes, particularly in competitive situations. The study included an experiment in which a subordinate animal was allowed to choose between <b>food</b> <b>that</b> a dominant animal could also see and <b>food</b> <b>that</b> it could not; those who were subject to aggressive behaviour selected the <b>food</b> <b>that</b> the dominant animal could not see, suggesting {{that they are able}} to perceive a threat based on being within the dominant animal's view [...] - [...] in other words, visual perspective taking.|$|R
50|$|This {{classifier}} {{indicates that}} the referent of the possessee noun is a food item. This {{can be used for}} any edible item including <b>food</b> <b>that</b> has already been eaten, <b>food</b> <b>that</b> has ben prepared and ready to eat, unprepared or uncooked food, and so on. Usually, the ga- relational classifier is used only to refer to <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is ready to be eaten, so an animal yet to be slaughtered or plant yet to be harvested would be referred to using the bula- classifier (Hyslop, 2001, p. 177).|$|R
5000|$|Emeril {{sometimes}} let {{the audience}} taste the <b>food</b> <b>that</b> he prepares.

5|$|There {{are some}} {{variations}} in the <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> are eaten around the different areas of Wales. These variations trace their roots back to medieval cooking. Ingredients were historically limited by what could be grown; the wetter climate in highland areas meant that crops were restricted to oats, whilst the more fertile lowland areas allowed the growth of barley or wheat. Coastal inhabitants {{were more likely to}} include seafood or seaweed in their meals, whilst those living inland would supplement their farmed cereals with the seeds of land weeds to ensure there was enough to eat.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} the series' setting became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. Starting with the second game, the series {{localization}} direction has been handled by Janet Hsu; One of the first decisions {{she had to make}} was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the idea}} that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> were not widely known in the West were changed.|$|E

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{hypothesis of}} blood type diets {{is that people}} with different blood types digest lectins differently, and that if people eat <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is not compatible with their blood type, they will experience many health problems. On the other hand, if a person eats <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is compatible, they will be healthier.|$|R
5|$|Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, {{the main}} heroine of Clannad, {{at the onset}} of the story. Nagisa is a shy, soft-spoken girl who has very low {{self-esteem}} and self-confidence which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of Clannad heroines, is an aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan.

This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese <b>foods</b> <b>that</b> were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E
