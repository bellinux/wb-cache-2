500|$|During a {{scene in}} the van, Tom Haverford tells Leslie he changed his name because his {{original}} name was too foreign sounding {{for a career in}} politics. When Leslie points about U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, [...] "I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would think I was a very effective speaker. But <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was being facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Audrey Pauley" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Maeda and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. The entry was Maeda's second ninth season entry after [...] "4-D". The episode features guest star Tracey Ellis as the titular Audrey Pauley. Ellis had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode [...] "Oubliette". Annabeth Gish later noted that the episode, along with [...] "4-D", were her [...] "two favorite episodes" [...] because they [...] "are stand-alone episodes about Reyes and Doggett. Wonderful acting challenges, and the stories were fantastic." [...] Robert Patrick, whose friend Ted Demme had recently died, was worried about bringing too much emotion onto the set. He later noted, [...] "I was kind of raw. I remember being a little worried about bringing too much emotion to it. I felt safe with Kim; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was going through a}} tough time." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron Swanson {{was created}} by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, {{although}} Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that [...] "NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said {{they wanted me to}} play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally acquiesced." [...] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job [...] [...] [...] I'm aware of the irony." [...] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache {{was one of the first}} ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: [...] "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was full of shit." ...|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Balderstone later remembered, [...] "Ray Illingworth {{took me to}} Leicestershire. I {{might be}} a decent bloke on the outside but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was mentally hard through football. Cricketers might think they're pretty hard but they're not {{compared}} to footballers. It was a great move for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, of his {{performance}} that series, Payton said [...] "You’ve {{got to get}} back at Jordan, you can’t back down on him. If you do, he's like a wolf, he's going to eat everything. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t going to back down. I had to realize or see if he is really about being a dog, about this neighborhood stuff. I went at him. It was just me being me." ...|$|E

2500|$|A fellow gentleman rider – Arthur Yates – {{was quoted}} as saying of Baird, [...] "I liked him very much, but {{unfortunately}} he did not choose his friends wisely, and the results were disastrous. None of his companions, however, came with him to Bishop Sutton, for <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> would not tolerate any of them, and thus I always saw the best side of his nature, which was, at bottom, very gentle and pleasant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baye {{was cast}} as Cécilia after having {{worked with her}} in Day for Night and The Man Who Loved Women. Baye later stated that [...] "If Francois asked me to perform with him, it was because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> wasn't the kind of actress who caused problems. He could rely on me, which was very reassuring to him." [...] Truffaut filled out the cast with Jean Dasté as Davenne's boss at The Globe, Antoine Vitez as a clergyman, Jean-Pierre Moulin as a widower that Davenne comforts in the film and Patrick Maléon as the {{deaf-mute}} child. Truffaut also cast technicians and personnel from his production company in small roles.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997 Killing Heidi had {{acquired}} a new rhythm section with Warren Jenkin on bass guitar (Rick Price, Merril Bainbridge, Deborah Conway) and Adam Pedretti on drums (ex-Non-Intentional Lifeform aka NIL). Pendretti described his recruitment, [...] " [...] had worked with NIL as producer, so <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could play a little bit off the wall... dropped off a Killing Heidi demo and I started learning the songs. It just took off from there." [...] Killing Heidi recorded {{the rest of their}} first studio album, Reflector, throughout 1998 and into 1999. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Kosky was [...] "meticulously shaping the band's début album"; he worked as their engineer, producer, talent manager and record label co-owner.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why does he {{go after}} me?" [...] Haney asked, irritably. [...] "I'm out of it. 'Tis like the fool tenderfoot. Don't <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{had nothing to}} do with his bust-up?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Zhong Hui {{received}} a letter from Sima Zhao, which read: [...] "I fear Deng Ai might not submit. I have ordered Jia Chong to lead 10,000 infantry and cavalry into the Xie Valley and station at Yuecheng. I will lead 100,000 troops to garrison at Chang'an. We will be meeting each other soon." [...] After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, [...] "When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours. If we fail, we can retreat back to Shu Han and do as Liu Bei did before us. It is widely known that my plans have never failed once since the Shouchun rebellions. How can I be contented with such fame?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in The Life-Giving Church. Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in [...] "cumbersome systems" [...] in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its [...] "brightest and best future leaders". Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even {{to the point of}} disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard's book, Primary Purpose, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This [...] "Philippians 2 Attitude" [...] comes from the scripture that states, [...] "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others." [...] "I took a free-market approach to that and just wanted to empower people to minister whatever was in their hearts." [...] Some of the best-known results of this model are the Mill, the Desperation Band and Desperation interns, the Furnace and World Prayer Center, 24/7 leadership training and New Life Groups, a unique brand of free-market small groups as well as many others. As an example of his coaching of young leaders, John Bolin, in the book Confident Parents, Exceptional Teens that he co-wrote with Haggard, says [...] " [...] talked about communicating with people by improving my posture, poise, and delivery. He painstakingly coached me to stand up tall, to speak with confidence, to look people in the eye, and to articulate with concise clarity... <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't be effective... unless I understood the principle of communication and connection by presenting myself well".|$|E

6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} young lady, forcing him down upon a stool, [...] "sit ye there and attend my {{sovereign}} good pleasure. I have {{life and death}} over you, and I will not scruple to abuse my power. Look to yourself; y' 'ave cruelly mauled my arm. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> not <b>I</b> was a maid, quoth <b>he!</b> Had <b>he</b> <b>known</b> <b>I</b> was a maid, he had ta'en his belt to me, forsooth!" ...|$|R
