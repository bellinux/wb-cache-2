5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motivesâ€”she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>around</b> to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one.

Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger.

2500|$|Durant {{and one of}} his men- Skip (who has a false left leg)- {{intercept}} Julie, kidnapping her as {{the prelude}} to his attack on Westlake's lair. Two of his men, Guzman and Smiley, then enter the lab to locate and kill him, only to be outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant fires upon him from a helicopter, as Westlake dangles from a cable attached to the aircraft, until he succeeds in causing the helicopter to crash.

[...] Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed on the inside as well, and can not subject anyone to his new vicious nature. In the final scene, he runs from Julie as they exit an elevator, and is seen from behind pulling on a mask which, when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>around,</b> reveals the face of Bruce Campbell. During this scene, Westlake can be heard off-screen: [...] "...I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me... Darkman." ...|$|E
