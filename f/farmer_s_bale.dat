40|$|That amazing {{newspaper}} The <b>Farmer</b> <b>s</b> Voice {{has taken}} another confident leap forward {{and is now}} available online on the World Wide Web at the moment in French only, but soon in English. It is the best-known, {{but by no means}} only, service provided by the Cameroon-based NGO Service d appui aux initiatives locales de développement (SAILD; Support service for local development initiatives). SAILD also has a high reputation for its useful technical handbooks, its reliable question-and-answer service and its wide range of field support activities with farmers groups across the country, from disseminating market price information to establishing tree nurseries. The monthly newspaper is now in its 15 th year of publication. With its rich content of informative articles on all aspects of agriculture and rural life, not only has it become a household name amongst farmers and farmers organisations in Cameroon and neighbouring countries, but it has also won the respect of development organisations and agricultural media professionals worldwide. Its straightforward tone, resolute and no-nonsense, often takes bureaucracies of whatever level or sector to task if their activities are {{getting in the way of}} farmers getting on with their lives. Over the years, not a few extension services, price boards and input suppliers have been encouraged by The <b>Farmer</b> <b>s</b> Voice to improve their service. But it is not only a campaigning force; each issue is stuffed with practical tips for the field and the workshop, with guidelines for drawing up business plans or marketing strategies, even at the most modest level, as well as a lively readers section, background articles and dossiers, profiles of plants, animals and organisations, book reviews and more. Until August 2002, The <b>Farmer</b> <b>s</b> Voice was available only in print, in several editions the French edition for Cameroon and Chad (circulation 20, 000), the English edition, read mainly in Cameroon (6, 000) and the two Arabic editions for Chad and the western Sahel region (5, 000 and 10, 000, respectively). The high quality of the Website edition attests to the dedication and skill of the editorial team. It has embarked not just on publishing the latest edition online, but also on opening up the archives of earlier issues. At the moment the French edition of the newspaper, La Voix du Paysan, is online (www. lavoixdupaysan. net). Work is underway to put the English edition online too, and it will be announced soon in Spore. Everything on the site is accessible free-of-charge and is clearly presented in thematic sections, with a large choice of articles just a click away. Even SAILD s famous cartoons have been included. All in all, a thoroughly professional approach which will no doubt inspire similar newspapers and bulletins in other countries to follow in SAILD s electronic footsteps, just as they have with their printed products. The printed edition of The <b>Farmer</b> <b>s</b> Voice is available on a year s subscription of FCFA 6, 000 (9. 25) in Cameroon and FCFA 13, 000 (t 20) elsewhere in Africa.

Our discussion stems from the argument some scholars have made that American consumers can import their food more cheaply from other countries than it can produce it. We {{consider the}} distinction between U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> and agriculture and the effect of the U. S. food footprint on developing nations to argue there might be an important role for U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers,</b> even if it appears Americans don’t need them. For instance, we may need to protect U. S. farmland and, by implication, U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers,</b> for future food security needs both domestic and international. We also explore the role of U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> by considering the question of whether food is a privilege or a right. Although Americans seem to accept that food is a privilege, many scholars and commentators argue that, at least on a global scale, food is a right, particularly for the world’s poor and hungry. If this is the case, then U. <b>S.</b> <b>farmers</b> might have a role in meeting the associated obligation to ensure that the poor of the world have enough food to eat. We look at the consequences of determining that food is a right versus a privilege and the implications of that decision for agricultural subsidies as well as U.
