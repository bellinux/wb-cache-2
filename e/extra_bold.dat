500|$|The basic letter {{shapes of}} Gill Sans {{do not look}} {{consistent}} across styles (or even in the metal type era all the sizes of the same style), especially in <b>Extra</b> <b>Bold</b> and Extra Condensed widths, while the Ultra Bold style is effectively a different design altogether and was originally marketed as such. Digital-period Monotype designer Dan Rhatigan, author of an article on Gill Sans's development after Gill's death, has commented: [...] "Gill Sans grew organically... takes a very 'asystematic' approach to type. Very characteristic of when it was designed and of when it was used." [...] (At this time the idea that sans-serif typefaces should form a consistent family, with glyph shapes as consistent as possible between all weights and sizes, had not fully developed: it was quite normal for families to vary as seemed appropriate for their weight until developments such as the groundbreaking release of Univers in 1957.) ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the end of}} mass use {{of metal}} type, Akzidenz-Grotesk has been rereleased and adapted in {{versions}} for the new phototypesetting and digital technologies. Contemporary versions of Akzidenz-Grotesk descend from a late-1950s project, directed by Jimmy Lazar at Berthold, to enlarge the typeface family, adding a larger character set, but retaining idiosyncrasies. Under the direction of Günter Gerhard Lange, he had designed 33 font styles to the Akzidenz-Grotesk family, including AG Extra (1958), AG <b>Extra</b> <b>Bold</b> (1966) and AG Super (1968), AG Super Italic (2001) and <b>Extra</b> <b>Bold</b> italic (2001). Karl Gerstner and other designers at his company GGK Basel launched a project in the 1960s to build Akzidenz-Grotesk into a coherent series, to match the new families appearing in the same style; it was used by Berthold for its Diatype system in the late 60s {{under the name of}} [...] "Gerstner-Programm".|$|E

5000|$|Attempts to systematize a {{range of}} weights led to a {{numerical}} classification first used by Adrian Frutiger with the Univers typeface: 35 Extra Light, 45 Light, 55 Medium or Regular, 65 Bold, 75 <b>Extra</b> <b>Bold,</b> 85 <b>Extra</b> <b>Bold,</b> 95 Ultra Bold or Black.Deviants of these were the [...] "6 series" [...] (italics), e.g. 46 Light Italics etc., the [...] "7 series" [...] (condensed versions), e.g. 57 Medium Condensed etc., and the [...] "8 series" [...] (condensed italics), e.g. 68 Bold Condensed Italics.From this brief numerical system {{it is easier to}} determine exactly what a font's characteristics are, for instance [...] "Helvetica 67" [...] (HE67) translates to [...] "Helvetica Bold Condensed".|$|E
