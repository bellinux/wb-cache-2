One branch synapses the Ib inhibitory interneuron. The other branch synapses onto an <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron.</b> This <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron</b> innervates the alpha motor neuron that controls the antagonist muscle.

50|$|An {{important}} reflex {{initiated by}} cutaneous receptors and pain receptors is the flexor reflex. This reflex mechanism allows for quick {{removal of the}} body parts, {{in this case a}} limb, from the harmful stimulus. The signal travels to the spinal cord and a response is initiated even before it travels up to the brain centers for a conscious decision to be made. The reflex circuit involves the activation of the Group III afferents of pain receptors due to a stimulus affecting the foot. These afferents enter the spinal cord and travel up to the lumbar region, where they synapse an <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron.</b> This interneuron excites the alpha motor neuron that causes contraction of the thigh flexor muscle. Also, Group III afferent travels up to L2 vertebra, where they branch onto another <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron.</b> This interneuron excites the alpha motor neurons, which then excite the hip flexor muscle. This synchronized communication allows for the removal of the whole leg from the painful stimulus. This {{is an example of the}} spinal cord circuitry coordinating movement at several joints simultaneously. In addition, during flexor reflex, when the knee joints and hip joints are flexed, the antagonist extensor muscles must be inhibited. This inhibitory effect is achieved when Group III afferents synapse inhibitory interneurons that in turn synapse the alpha motor neurons innervating the antagonists muscle.|$|E
50|$|The flexor reflex {{not only}} {{coordinates}} {{the activity of}} the leg being removed but also {{the activity of the}} other leg. When one leg is removed, the weight of the body needs to be distributed to the opposite leg to maintain the body’s balance. Thus, the flexor reflex incorporates a crossed extension reflex. A branch of the Group III afferent synapse an <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron,</b> which extends its axon across the midline into the contralateral spinal cord. At that location, the interneuron excites the alpha motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles of the opposite leg. This allows for balance and body posture to be maintained.|$|E
40|$|SummaryTo {{what extent}} dorsal horn interneurons {{contribute}} to the modality specific processing of pain and itch messages is not known. Here, we report that loxp/cre-mediated CNS deletion of TR 4, a testicular orphan nuclear receptor, results in loss of many <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons</b> in the superficial dorsal horn but preservation of primary afferents and spinal projection neurons. The interneuron loss {{is associated with a}} near complete absence of supraspinally integrated pain and itch behaviors, elevated mechanical withdrawal thresholds and loss of nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, but reflex responsiveness to noxious heat, nerve injury-induced heat hypersensitivity, and tissue injury-induced heat and mechanical hypersensitivity are intact. We conclude that different subsets of dorsal horn <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons</b> contribute to tissue and nerve injury-induced heat and mechanical pain and that the full expression of supraspinally mediated pain and itch behaviors cannot be generated solely by nociceptor and pruritoceptor activation of projection neurons; concurrent activation of <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons</b> is essential...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe ventral {{spinal cord}} generates {{multiple}} inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron</b> subtypes from four cardinal progenitor domains (p 0, p 1, p 2, p 3). Here {{we show that}} cell-cell interactions mediated by the Notch receptor play a critical evolutionarily conserved role in the generation of excitatory v 2 aIN and inhibitory v 2 bIN interneurons. Lineage-tracing experiments show that the v 2 aIN and v 2 bIN develop from genetically identical p 2 progenitors. The p 2 daughter cell fate is controlled by Delta 4 activation of Notch receptors together with MAML factors. Cells receiving Notch signals activate a transcription factor code that specifies the v 2 bIN fate, whereas cells deprived of Notch signaling express another code for v 2 aIN formation. Thus, our study provides insight into the cell-extrinsic signaling that controls combinatorial transcription factor profiles involved in regulating the process of interneuron subtype diversification...|$|E

40|$|Substantia gelatinosa (SG, lamina II) is {{a spinal}} cord region where most unmyelinated primary afferents {{terminate}} {{and the central}} nociceptive processing begins. It is formed by several distinct groups of interneurons whose functional properties and synaptic connections are poorly understood, in part, because recordings from synaptically coupled pairs of SG neurons are quite challenging due to a very low probability of finding connected cells. Here, we describe an efficient method for identifying synaptically coupled interneurons in rat spinal cord slices and characterizing their excitatory or inhibitory function. Using tight-seal whole-cell recordings and a cell-attached stimulation technique, we routinely tested about 1500 SG interneurons, classifying 102 of them as monosynaptically connected to neurons in lamina I–III. Surprisingly, {{the vast majority of}} SG interneurons (n = 87) were excitatory and glutamatergic, while only 15 neurons were inhibitory.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Two {{groups of}} interneurons, Tr 1 and DRI, have been {{identified}} in the escape swim circuit of the marine mollusc Tritonia diomedea that have important roles in behavioral initiation. DRI functions as a command neuron, receiving direct excitatory input from the afferent neurons, and in turn directly exciting the DSI neurons of the central pattern generator. DRI fires throughout the swim motor program, and activity in DRI is both necessary and sufficient for sensory input to elicit the swim motor program. Tr 1 is an <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron</b> that fires briefly in response to sensory input and then remains silent during the motor program. Tr 1 excites DRI with an excitatory connection that has fast and slow components and thus appears to have a role in converting brief afferent neuron activity to long-lasting firing in downstream circuit elements.

Dense EM 2 -, MOR- and GABA-IR fibers and terminals were mainly observed in lamina II of the Vc. Within lamina II, GABA- and MOR-neuronal cell bodies were also encountered. The results of immunofluorescent histochemical triple-staining showed that approximately 14. 2 % or 18. 9 % of GABA-IR or MOR-IR neurons also showed MOR- or GABA-immunopositive staining in lamina II; approximately 45. 2 % and 36. 1 % of the GABA-IR and MOR-IR neurons, respectively, expressed FOS protein in their nuclei induced by injecting formalin into the left lower lip of the mouth.

40|$|Locomotion {{relies on}} a {{precisely}} timed activation of sets of motoneurons. A fundamental question is how this is achieved. In the lamprey, fin and myotomal motoneurons located {{on the same side}} of the spinal cord display alternating activity during straight swimming. The neural mechanism underlying this alternation is studied here during fictive locomotion induced by superfusion with NMDA, or locomotor bursting induced by electrical stimulation. If the spinal cord is split longitudinally, each hemicord still displays rhythmic locomotor related burst activity, but now fin and myotomal motoneurons become active in-phase. The out-of-phase activation of fin motoneurons persists only when at least three segments are left intact in the rostral part of the spinal cord. Proper coordination of fin motoneurons thus requires input from contralateral rostral segments. We show that commissural <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons</b> with long descending axons, previously reported to be active in phase with their ipsilateral myotomal motoneurons, provide monosynaptic excitation to contralateral fin motoneurons. Together, these results strongly indicate that, although myotomal motoneurons receive their phasic excitation from ipsilateral <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons,</b> fin motoneurons are mainly driven from the contralateral segmental network during bilateral locomotor activity. However, during unilateral bursting, fin and myotomal motoneurons instead receive a common input, which is apparently masked during normal fictive swimming. The spinal organization thus also provides circuitry for different patterns of coordination, i. e., alternation or coactivation of the two pools of motoneurons, which may subserve different forms of locomotor behavior...|$|R
40|$|The spinal network {{coordinating}} locomotion in the lamprey {{serves as}} a model system, {{in which it has}} been possible to elucidate connec- tivity and cellular mechanisms using the isolated spinal cord. Locomotor burst activity alternates between the left and right side of a segment through reciprocal inhibition. We have recently shown that the burst generation itself in a hemisegment does not require inhibitory mechanisms. The focus of this study is the intrinsic operation of this hemisegmental burst-generating component of the locomotor network. Brief electrical stimulation (0. 3 s) of the hemicord evokes long-lasting bouts (2 min) of bursts (2 – 15 Hz) in the mid to high-frequency range of locomotion. Bout release is an all-or-none phenomenon requiring a threshold intensity of stimulation and glutamatergic transmission within a population of <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons,</b> with axons extending over several segments. The progressive activity- dependent decrease in burst frequency that takes place during a bout is followed by a slow recovery process lasting 20 min. Intracellular recordings of single motoneurons, <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons,</b> and inhibitory interneurons show that locomotor bouts, in general, are accompanied by a marked depolarization. Membrane potential oscillations and spikes occur in phase with the ventral root (VR) bursts. Active motoneurons and interneurons fire one spike per VR burst, as also confirmed by axonal recordings. Thus, the reciprocal inhibition between opposite hemisegments in the intact cord not only ensures left–right alternation and lowers the locomotor frequency but also promotes a shift from single to multiple action potentials per cycle in network neurons...|$|R

We recently defined three non-overlapping populations among the excitatory neurons, based on the expression of neurotensin, neurokinin B (NKB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Here we identify and characterise another population: neurons that express the tachykinin peptide substance P. We show with immunocytochemistry that its precursor protein (preprotachykinin A, PPTA) can be detected in ~ 14 % of lamina I-II neurons, and these are concentrated in the outer part of lamina II. Over 80 % of the PPTA-positive cells lack the transcription factor Pax 2 (which determines an inhibitory phenotype), and these account for ~ 15 % of the excitatory neurons in this region.

40|$|During {{vertebrate}} locomotion, spinal neurons act as oscillators when {{initiated by}} glutamate release from descending systems. Activation of NMDA receptors initiates Ca 2 +-mediated intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in {{central pattern generator}} (CPG) neurons. NMDA receptor-dependent intrinsic oscillations require Ca 2 +-dependent K+ (KCa 2) channels for burst termination. However, the location of Ca 2 + entry mediating KCa 2 channel activation, and type of Ca 2 + channel – which includes NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (VGCCs) – remains elusive. NMDA receptor-dependent Ca 2 + entry necessitates presynaptic release of glutamate, implying a location at active synapses within dendrites, whereas VGCC-dependent Ca 2 + entry is not similarly constrained. Where Ca 2 + enters relative to KCa 2 channels is crucial to information processing of synaptic inputs necessary to coordinate locomotion. We demonstrate that Ca 2 + permeating NMDA receptors is the dominant source of Ca 2 + during NMDA-dependent oscillations in lamprey spinal neurons. This Ca 2 + entry is synaptically located, NMDA receptor-dependent, and sufficient to activate KCa 2 channels at <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron</b> synapses onto other CPG neurons. Selective blockade of VGCCs reduces whole-cell Ca 2 + entry but leaves membrane potential and Ca 2 + oscillations unaffected. Furthermore, repetitive oscillations are prevented by fast, but not slow, Ca 2 + chelation.

In this study, we compared morphology, neurotransmitter content, electrophysiological and pharmacological properties for 61 lamina II neurons recorded in slices from adult rat spinal cord. Morphology was related to transmitter content, since islet cells were GABAergic, while radial and most vertical cells were glutamatergic. However, there was considerable diversity among the remaining cells, some of which could not be classified morphologically. Transmitter phenotype was related to firing pattern, since most (18 / 22) excitatory cells, but few (2 / 23) inhibitory cells had delayed, gap or reluctant patterns, which are associated with A-type potassium (I A) currents. Somatostatin was identified in axons of 14 / 24 excitatory neurons. These had variable morphology, but most of those tested showed delayed-firing. Excitatory interneurons are therefore likely to contribute to pain states associated with synaptic plasticity involving I A currents. Although noradrenaline and serotonin evoked outward currents in both inhibitory and excitatory cells, somatostatin produced these currents only in inhibitory neurons, suggesting that its pro-nociceptive effects are mediated by disinhibition. Our results demonstrate that certain distinctive populations of inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron</b> can be recognised in lamina II. Combining this approach with identification of other neurochemical markers should allow further clarification of neuronal circuitry in the superficial dorsal horn...|$|E
40|$|Neurons in the {{superficial}} dorsal horn (SDH) of {{the spinal cord}} {{play an important role}} in nociceptive, thermal, itch and light touch sensations. Excitatory interneurons comprise ~ 65 % of all SDH neurons but surprisingly few studies have investigated their role in spinal sensory processing. Here we use a transgenic mouse to study putative excitatory SDH neurons that express the calcium binding protein calretinin (CR). Our immunocytochemical, morphological and electrophysiological analysis identified two distinct populations of CR-expressing neurons, which we termed 'Typical' and 'Atypical'. Typical CR-expressing neurons comprised ~ 85 % of the population and exhibited characteristic <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneuron</b> properties including delayed firing discharge, large rapid A-type potassium currents, and central, radial or vertical cell morphologies. Atypical neurons exhibited properties consistent with inhibitory interneurons, including tonic firing or initial bursting discharge, I h currents, and islet cell morphology. Although both Typical and Atypical CR-expressing neurons responded to noxious peripheral stimulation, the excitatory drive onto Typical CR-expressing neurons was much stronger. Furthermore, Atypical CR-expressing cells comprise at least two functionally distinct subpopulations based on their responsiveness to noxious peripheral stimulation and neurochemical profile. Together our data suggest CR expression is not restricted to excitatory neurons in the SDH. Under normal conditions, the contribution of 'Typical' excitatory CR-expressing neurons to overall SDH excitability may be limited by the presence of A-type potassium currents, which limit the effectiveness of their strong excitatory input. Their contribution may, however, be increased in pathological situations where A-type potassium currents are decreased. By contrast, 'Atypical' inhibitory neurons with their excitable phenotype but weak excitatory input may be more easily recruited during increased peripheral stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The tachykinin {{substance}} P modulates the lamprey locomotor network {{by increasing}} the frequency of NMDA-evoked ventral root bursts and by making the burst activity more regular. These effects can last in excess of 24 hr. In this paper, the effects of substance P on the synaptic and cellular properties of motor neurons and identified network interneurons have been examined. Substance P potentiated the amplitude of monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons</b> and reticulospinal axons. The amplitude and frequency of miniature EPSPs was increased, suggesting that the synaptic modulation was mediated presynaptically and postsynaptically. The postsynaptic modulation {{was caused by a}} specific effect of substance P on the NMDA component of the synaptic input, whereas the presynaptic component was calciumindependent...|$|R
5000|$|This {{layer is}} also known as the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando and has the highest density of neurons. [...] These neurons mediate the {{activity}} of nociceptive and temperature afferent fibers. [...] It is almost entirely made up of interneurons which can be further divided by their morphology. The four main morphological classes, based on the shape of their dendritic structure, are islet, central, vertical, and radial cells. The interneurons can also be divided by their function: excitatory or inhibitory. The <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons</b> release glutamate as their main neurotransmitter and the inhibitory interneurons use GABA and/or glycine as their main neurotransmitter. The neurons of this layer are only C fibers and contain almost no myelin.|$|R

Proposed roles for this region include sound localization in the vertical plane, head orientation to sounds of interest, and suppression of sensitivity to expected sounds. Auditory and non-auditory information streams to the DCN are refined by a remarkably complex array of inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>interneurons,</b> {{and the role of}} each cell type is gaining increasing attention. One inhibitory neuron that has been poorly appreciated to date is the superficial stellate cell. Here we review previous studies and describe new results that reveal the surprisingly rich interactions that this tiny interneuron has with its neighbors, interactions which enable it to respond to both multisensory and auditory afferents...|$|R
