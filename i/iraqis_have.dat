25|$|The Iraqi {{government}} also compiles {{the number of}} wounded from these three categories, {{as well as the}} number of killed and captured insurgents. From the beginning of December 2011 until the end of March 2014, at least 19,829 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> been injured according to these reports, including 2,688 police officers and 2,319 members of the Iraqi Army. During the same period, 1,350 insurgents were killed, while a total of 4,403 suspects were arrested.|$|E
500|$|More than 20 nations (most {{notably the}} United Kingdom), {{designated}} the [...] "coalition of the willing" [...] joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared {{the end of}} major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing {{that there was a}} full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was [...] "grave and deteriorating". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.|$|E

500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{estimate}} that between March 18, 2003, and June, 2006, an additional 654,965 (392,979–942,636) <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> died above {{what would have}} been expected {{on the basis of the}} pre-invasion crude mortality rate as a consequence of the coalition invasion. Of these deaths, we {{estimate that}} 601,027 (426,369–793,663) were due to violence." ...|$|E
2500|$|By late September, the {{operation}} to retake Ramadi {{was considered to}} have stalled, with Iraqi security forces positioned {{on the outskirts of}} Ramadi, but unable to mount an incursion into the city. Political squabbles between Iranian backed militias and the Abadi administration were also hampering potential offensives. On September 25, the United States urged the Iraqi Army to hasten {{the operation}}, acknowledging that [...] "...the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> not made any significant forward movement recently." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iraqi</b> forces <b>had</b> several air bases within {{striking}} distance of the city that could be ready in minutes, all housing MIG-29s. The <b>Iraqi</b> forces also <b>had</b> thousands of AAA and SAM sites throughout the city, ranging from World War II-era flak guns to surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles on state of the art interceptors and fighters. Overall the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> the resources to inflict many casualties on the strike force.|$|R
50|$|Once the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> {{completed}} their searches and attention {{was drawn to}} the areas southwest of Kirkuk, operations quickly shifted to the Hawija and Riyadh areas.|$|R
50|$|As of 2007 more <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> {{lost their}} homes and become {{refugees}} than the population of any other country. Over 3.9 million people, close to 16 percent of the <b>Iraqi</b> population, <b>have</b> become uprooted. Of these, around 2 million have fled Iraq and flooded other countries, and 1.9 million {{are estimated to be}} refugees inside Iraq.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{since this}} event the UN country team's expatriates and leaders {{relocated}} in Amman (Jordan) {{and continued to}} work remotely. Only some <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> continued under drastic security measures {{all around the country}} (except in Kurdistan where they are more numerous and can move more freely). Few expatriates are, 5 years later, authorized to go inside Iraq (including Kurdistan) and only inside huge security compounds such as the so-called [...] "Green Zone" [...] in Baghdad. Humanitarian support is now entirely conducted inside the country by NGOs, under UN remote supervision.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{has been}} sharply {{critical}} of the Bush administration's handling of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In September 2003 he wrote that [...] "most of the assumptions behind our invasion have been proven wrong: The intelligence {{did not support the}} imminence of a threat, the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> not broadly welcomed us as liberators, the idea that we could manage this action almost unilaterally is giving way to pleas for troops and money from other nations, the aversion to giving the U.N. a meaningful role is eroding daily, and the reluctance to get involved in nation building is being supplanted by just that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... a tiny minority, {{from within}} the non-Iraqi British Muslim communities, reacted with {{violence}} on 7 July 2005. To interpret this simply as a [...] "nationalist struggle" [...] to remove occupation ignores the blatantly obvious fact that, first, the terrorists were not Iraqis, they were British-Pakistanis (though British <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> lived {{here for a long}} time); second, {{the vast majority of the}} Stop the War protesters were non-Muslims, yet only a handful from among a minority of Muslims reacted to the war with terrorism. Even though occupation may have caused agitation among the 7 July bombers, these northern-born lads with thick Yorkshire accents confessed in their suicide tapes to considering themselves soldiers with a mission to kill our people (Britons) on behalf of their people (Iraqis). The prerequisite to such a disavowal of one's country of birth is a recalibration of identity; this is the undeniable role of ideological narratives.|$|E
50|$|It was {{claimed that}} eleven <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> been {{severely}} beaten {{by members of}} the SAS in Majar al-Kabir; they were released and paid compensation for their injuries.|$|R
50|$|With such static defenses, the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> {{effectively}} made frontal assault {{through the}} flat lands {{virtually impossible for}} the Iranians. Thus the Iranians would launch their amphibious attacks.|$|R
5000|$|Since August 2014, and the {{expansion}} of ISIS in Iraq, the number of internally displaced <b>Iraqis</b> <b>has</b> risen from 1.7 to 3 million, peaking at 3.4 million in March 2016 [...]|$|R
2500|$|Aside from Palestinians, Lebanese made up {{the next}} biggest group of {{immigrants}} during this time. From 1965 to 2005 around 135,000 Lebanese came to the United States. The overwhelming majority, roughly 120,000, came after the commencement of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. Furthering the emigration from Lebanon was Israel's 1982 invasion. Egyptians and Iraqis also immigrated to the United States in large numbers during this period. From 1967 to 2003 more than 120,000 Egyptians have immigrated to the US. Of this population, around 50,000 were Coptic Christians. Also, since 1967, 108,000 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> come to the US. Many fled during the country's drawn-out war with Iran lasting from 1980–1988. Again, {{in keeping with the}} [...] "brain-drain" [...] trend of the region, a large portion of these immigrants were educated professionals not willing to serve in the army. Harsh United Nations sanctions following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait further deteriorated Iraq's economy, increasing emigration. Between the first and second US invasions of Iraq roughly 53,000 Iraqis immigrated to the United States. [...] Large numbers of Syrians and Yemenis immigrated to the United States during this wave as well. Since 1967, some 36,000 Syrians have immigrated to the US.|$|E
50|$|The current Iraqi {{population}} in Kuwait {{is difficult to}} determine, as there are no official figures, but estimates range from 10,000 to 13,000.

5000|$|In 2003, the UNCHR {{estimated}} that 65% of 200,00 refugees in Iran are Feyli Kurds who were forcefully deported during the genocide. Most refugees {{who returned to}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>had</b> difficulties {{to apply for the}} citizenship.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Reuters {{reported}} that Iraq returned [...] "98 truckloads of medical equipment stolen from Kuwait, including two of the baby incubators". Abdul Rahim al-Zeid, an assistant under-secretary at the Kuwaiti Public Health Ministry, said that by returning the incubators the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> unwittingly provided proof that they took them. Kuwait's chief ambulance officer, Abdul Reda Abbas, stated that [...] "We think the <b>Iraqis</b> might <b>have</b> returned the incubators by mistake." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> fought hard, {{shooting}} down an A-10 Thunderbolt II,and two AH-64 Apache helicopters.Most {{of the units}} belonging to the 1st Armored Division and the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division were awarded Valorous Unit Award Citations.|$|R

50|$|Since 2003, 36 700 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> {{applied for}} asylum in Sweden. The peak year was 2007 with 18 600 {{applications}}. About 50 per cent of all asylum applications from Iraqis to European countries in 2006 and 2007 {{were made in}} Sweden. Since 2003, about 38 000 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> been granted a residence permit in Sweden; more than 20 000 of these were granted after an application for asylum, more than 15 000 {{for the purpose of}} family reunion and over 1 000 for resettlement.|$|E
50|$|As of November 4, 2006, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees {{estimated}} that 1.8 million <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> been displaced to neighboring countries, and 1.6 million were displaced internally, with nearly 100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003 and the {{beginning}} of the Iraq War, large numbers of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>have</b> immigrated to Jaramana, swelling the population from around 100,000 to over 250,000. According to the 2004 official census, the population of the city was 114,363.|$|R
25|$|Refusing to back down, Thomas responded {{immediately}} by asking Perino {{if she knew}} how many innocent <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> been killed and then questioned the worth of regret when Perino responded that the administration regretted the loss of all innocent Iraqi lives.|$|R
5000|$|... "Iraqis {{have been}} waiting for justice to be executed, and I think that <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} the news that they've been waiting for, for too many years", said Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani.|$|E
50|$|Garbage removal has improved. Americans are {{clearing}} rubble, {{and young}} <b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> {{been hired to}} pick up trash, but people often burn garbage at the huge trash dumps nearby, which is a nuisance for residents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iraqis</b> <b>have</b> {{historically}} been a multilingual, multiethnic people, conversant in several languages but having a Semitic lingua franca. Iraqi identity transcends ethnic and language boundaries, {{and is more}} associated with geography; the Tigris-Euphrates alluvial plain and its environs.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the British Mandate of Iraq caused considerable unease among the Assyrians who felt betrayed by the British. For them, any treaty with the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> {{to take into consideration}} their desire for an autonomous position similar to the Ottoman Millet system.|$|R
50|$|For {{the second}} battle of Faw the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> {{concentrated}} over 100,000 soldiers, of whom approximately 60% where from the Republican Guard, against some 15,000 Iranian Basij volunteers. The <b>Iraqi</b> command <b>had</b> expected {{the battle to}} take several weeks, but Iraq managed to seize the peninsula {{in a single day}} due to the collapse of the Iranian units present, with only minimal losses. This stunning success led the Iraqi command to decide to expand the original battle into a larger offensive campaign against Iran.|$|R
50|$|Following the Iraq War, nearly 3 million <b>Iraqis</b> <b>had</b> been {{displaced}} as of 2011, with 1.3 million within Iraq and 1.6 million in neighboring countries, mainly Jordan and Syria.
