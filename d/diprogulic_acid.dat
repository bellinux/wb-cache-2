5000|$|<b>Diprogulic</b> <b>acid</b> (also {{known as}} dikegulac) is a {{precursor}} used in commercial ascorbic acid production. [...] In agriculture, its sodium salt, dikegulac sodium, {{is used as}} a plant growth regulator, primarily used as a branching agent. When it is taken up by a plant, dikegulac sodium is translocated to its apical meristems, where it inhibits DNA synthesis. [...] This suppresses apical dominance in the plant and can stimulate lateral branching, resulting in a bushier growth habit. [...] Dikegulac sodium is sometimes used to inhibit fruiting and flowering.|$|E
