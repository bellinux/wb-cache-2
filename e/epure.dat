A number of major building sites (including Westminster Abbey, Wells Cathedral and York Minster) originally had dedicated tracery chambers, where the architects could prepare their designs in relative comfort. The availability of a large flat floor surface meant that designs could be drawn life-size and the individual elements of bar tracery laid out on the plan to test their goodness of fit, before hoisting them up the scaffolding for installation in the actual window openings. This also meant that masons could carry on working through the winter season, when building work would normally grind to a halt.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{repair and}} {{recovery}} vehicle body operations {{become more and}} more popular. A special place here is taken by equipment that provides performance of given repair operations. The most interesting things are methods for recovery of car body panels that allow the straightening without disassembling of car body panels and damaging of existing protective coating. Now, there are several technologies for repair and recovery of car body panels without their disassembly and dismantling. The most perspective is magnetic-pulse technology of external noncontact straightening. Basics of magnetic-pulse attraction, both ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic thin-walled sheet metal, are explored. Inductor system calculation models of magnetic-pulse straightening tools are presented. Final analytical expressions for excited efforts calculation in the tools under consideration are introduced. According to the obtained analytical expressions, numerical evaluations of excited forces were executed. The volumetric <b>epures</b> of the attractive force radial distributions for different types of inductors were built.

It supplies the researcher with the possibility to describe the input data on the object under analyses and the problem scheme based upon the variational principles within one task. The particular feature of System is possibility to describe the information concerning the object of any geometrical shape and the computation sheme according to the program defined for purpose. The Methods allow to compute the tasks with indefinite functional and indefinite geometry of the object (or the set of objects). The System provides the possibility to compute the tasks with indefinite sheme based upon the Finite Element Method (FEM).

At {{the problem}} solving about {{determination}} of deflected mode (DM) of build constructions by the {{finite element method}} (FEM) on accuracy of solving substantial influence is rendered by the sizes of effective area of foundation. It is suggested to develop the criteria of determining the size of effective area. Presently at the calculation of vertical fallouts of earth dams with the trapeziform section (fig. 1), is assumed that the <b>epure</b> of contact pressures has a rectangular form [2, 6]. Thus actual <b>epure</b> of contact pressures on the sole of dam has form of trapezoid (fig. 1). Thus, there is a disparity between actual and accepted in the normative documents in the contact pressures on the sole of earth dams. Purpose. At writing of this article we were pursue a purpose to calculate the value of damping coefficient of vertical dead stress on the depth of foundation, trapeziform loading determined and to foundation attached. About it has been already written not a bit in scientific literature [2; 5; 6; 7; 13]. In our view, for determination of vertical fallouts of foundation of earth dams {{it is necessary to}} use the formula of D- 1 DBN [7], corrected in it the damping coefficient of vertical stress on a depth, conditioned of dam weight, that is to calculate a trapezoidal form of environmental stress (fig. 1). Conclusion. The damping coefficients of vertical stress calculated by us on a depth (tablas. 1) allow more exactly to determine their values, than coefficients, presented in normative documents [7]. This is caused by more complete, than it takes a place in normative documents, in the light of configuration of the environmental stress...|$|E

To directly test the efficiency analysis using the GEI indicators in the production function, we use a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) frontier method. DEA is a non-parametric technique that yields a production possibilities frontier through linear programming (Cooper et al., 2011). For the applications in diverse and heterogeneous contexts analysts use DEA models for its flexible nature (Grifell-Tatje´ and Lovell, 1999; <b>Epure</b> and Lafuente, 2015).

Alternatively, a board’s outside directors represent shareholders as well as varied stakeholders by closely monitoring the firm’s environmental policy, regulations, and performance (de Villiers et al. 2011; Oh et al. 2011). Thus, the strong presence of a board of directors can reduce the agency problem by the monitoring, supervising, and controlling of management’s short- and long-term interests and goals regarding ESRP (Ntim et al. 2013; Chang et al. 2017; Hillman and Dalziel 2003). Therefore, ESRP is the process of social and organizational engagement that differ across the country and organizational management uses it communicating with any circumstances mitigating agency conflicts as well as cost.|$|E
30|$|Independent {{directors}} are generally treated as experts to monitor, control, and supervise management, and provide effective suggestions and advice for management’s decisions on environmental performance (de Villiers et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2017; Oh et al. 2011). They play a moderating role between management and different stakeholders to solve agency conflicts.

30|$|Not all {{actors in}} the biofuel debate have been keen to accept the {{findings}} of the Searchinger report. In Europe representatives of the biofuel industry have been complaining about the unfavorable investment climate resulting from the current political indecision in Europe, resulting from the research on ILUC effects. For instance, Robert Wright, secretary-general of <b>ePure,</b> the association of the European ethanol industry, laments that the “ILUC cloud” hanging over the industry and the Commission’s policy turn have destroyed investor confidence: “For investments to take place we need stable, clear and long-term policies and no policy u-turns” (Wright quoted in Maler 2014). In a similar vein the Danish biotech firm Novozymes, which has a strong interest in the development of second-generation biofuels (because it specializes in making enzymes, which will be needed if cellulose is to be broken down), opposes accounting for ILUC effects. As a company spokesman explains: “ILUC is a controversial concept. The belief behind the concept is that the displacement of other land-using activities, caused by biofuels expansion, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere—and this should be factored into the lifecycle analysis of biofuels. As such, ILUC cannot be calculated but only modelled, and variations in models show very different figures. It is therefore also very difficult to base legislation on it” (Amrani 2015; Novozymes, n.d.).|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{deposition}} is {{an important}} source of trace elements (TEs) to the surface ocean. Due to the proximity to the Sahara and Sahel Deserts, the North Atlantic receives some of the highest inputs of mineral dust globally (~ 100 - 220 Tg yr- 1). In terms of biological production, this significant input of TEs contributes to the greater efficiency of the Canary Current Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (CC-EBUS) relative to its Pacific counterpart; both of which support socio-economically important fisheries. However, mineral dust is just one component of atmospheric aerosols. Human activities (e. g. fossil fuel combustion, agricultural practices) also contribute to the atmospheric load, resulting in changes in the elemental ratios with respect to crustal composition. In order to investigate the TE composition of aerosols to the CC-EBUS, aerosol samples were collected from three coastal locations in Morocco (Agadir, Laayoune and Dakhla) as part of the <b>EPURE</b> project, over an annual cycle (March 2015 - 2016). Here, we present TE composition data, with a focus on cadmium (Cd); an element of concern for human health, which is toxic to phytoplankton above a certain threshold, despite being essential for carbon uptake in some genera. A poor correlation between aerosol aluminium (Al; a tracer for mineral dust inputs) and Cd (r 2 = 0. 31, P = 0. 091) suggests that mineral dust was not the dominant source of Cd during this study. However, coincident peaks of Al and Cd did occur occasionally, suggesting that during dust events mineral dust could be {{an important source of}} Cd. In addition, despite the presence of phosphate mining activities south of Laayoune, we did not observe significantly different ratios of Cd/Al relative to the other two stations. Using aerosol samples collected during the AWA campaigns off Senegal (2013, 2014) we have estimated the solubility of TEs from West African/European aerosols to provide an estimate of the flux of potentially bioavailable TEs for marine micro-organisms...|$|E
40|$|Ce travail a porté sur l'application du lagunage anaérobie pour le {{traitement}} primaire des eaux résiduaires urbaines sous climat méditerranéen. Il a été réalisé sur les lagunes anaérobies de l' Ecosite de Mèze (Hérault, France). Les lagunes anaérobies constituent un traitement primaire satisfaisant avec des rendements moyens de 55 % pour les MES et 30 % pour la DBO 5, pour une faible emprise au sol. Le taux d'accumulation des boues est de seulement 0, 017 m 3 /EH. an, notamment du fait de l'efficacité de la dégradation anaérobie. L'équilibre du métabolisme anaérobie des boues est atteint après un an de fonctionnement. L'accumulation des boues se fait alors de façon saisonnière avec une forte accumulation en hiver et une digestion du stock en été. Cette évolution est liée à l'influence de la température sur la méthanogénèse. La production de biogaz (83 % CH 4) a pu être mesurée par des collecteurs à gaz mis au point pour cette étude et dépend également fortement de la température. Le bilan du carbone {{montre que}} 74 % du carbone organique <b>épuré</b> est converti en CH 4, 13 % en carbone inorganique dissous et seulement 15 % est stocké dans les boues. Toutefois, les lagunes anaérobies présentent un risque de créer des nuisances olfactives dues à l'émission de H 2 S. This project examined {{the application of}} anaerobic ponds for the primary treatment of urban wastewater under a Mediterranean climate. The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine removal performances and to study sludge accumulation and the production of biogas. Together, these results allowed us to calculate the carbon mass balance in the anaerobic ponds. This work was carried out in the two large primary anaerobic ponds of the waste stabilization pond system at the Ecosite of Mèze (Hérault, France), treating domestic wastewater for 13, 800 person-equivalents (PE). Anaerobic ponds were 5, 000 m 3 in volume, 3. 1 m in depth and presented a retention time of 4. 6 d with a mean volumetric organic loading of 83 g BOD 5 /m 3 ×d× The characteristics of the influent and effluent (including: suspended solids (SS); chemical oxygen demand (COD); biological oxygen demand (BOD 5); bicarbonate (HCO 3 -); total organic carbon (TOC); and volatile fatty acids (VFA)) were determined twice-monthly. The volume of sludge and its characteristics (including: SS; volatile solids (VS); TOC; and VFA) were measured monthly. The production of biogas and its composition (CH 4, CO 2, H 2 S) were measured with gas collectors specially developed for this study. Results showed that the anaerobic ponds constituted a good primary treatment with mean removal rates of 55 % for SS, 30 % for BOD and 22 % for COD. Removal performances were relatively constant over the year. Indeed, removal rates were essentially due to the removal of particulate organic matter by sedimentation. Anaerobic degradation occurred essentially in the sludge layer and the removal of soluble COD was low. The study of sludge characteristics showed that anaerobic digestion equilibrium was reached after one year of operation. The beginning of methanogenesis could be observed by the decrease in the concentration of volatile fatty acids. The accumulation of sludge showed seasonal variation with an important accumulation in winter and the digestion of the accumulated stock in summer. This evolution could be related to the influence of temperature on methanogenesis. The mean rate of sludge accumulation was only 3. 8 g SS/P-E×d or 0. 017 m 3 /P-E×yr. This rate was significantly lower than for the primary settling tank (50 - 60 g SS/P-E×d) and for the facultative ponds (0. 085 m 3 /P-E×yr) due to the intensive anaerobic degradation. The production of biogas was measured by gas collectors specially developed for this study. The biogas contained essentially CH 4 (83 %); CO 2 was less than 4 % because it dissolved in the water column and was converted into bicarbonate alkalinity. The concentration of H 2 S was less than 1 % (between 75 and 4770 ppm) but was the cause of unpleasant odours. The biogas production rate was strongly dependent on temperature. A non-linear relationship was obtained (Ebiogas= 4. 8451 × e 0. 1203 T, r 2 = 0. 92, n= 16). The mean annual biogas production rate was calculated to be 49 L/m 2 ×d. Seasonal variation in the biogas production rate could be related to seasonal variations in sludge accumulation. The carbon mass balance showed that 74 % of the removed organic carbon was converted into CH 4, 13 % into dissolved inorganic carbon (bicarbonates) and only 15 % was stored in sludge. The mass balance was well equilibrated and did not show the entry of atmospheric CO 2, which occurs in aerobic ponds where CO 2 is used by algae to produce their cell biomass. In an anaerobic pond, the low production of sludge was due to the efficiency of the anaerobic degradation but also to the low internal biomass production. To conclude, the use of a primary anaerobic pond was advantageous and permitted a reduction in the required surface area for a waste stabilization pond system. This process produced effluent for secondary treatment in a facultative pond with essentially the removal of the particulate organic matter. However, However, anaerobic ponds may cause odor problems linked to the emission of H 2 S...|$|E
