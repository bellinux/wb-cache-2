30|$|Facility {{expansion}} {{is the process}} of adding capacity over time to satisfy rising <b>demand.</b> <b>Facility</b> expansion decisions in the business sector generally add up to a massive commitment of capital. The efficient investment of capital depends on making appropriate decisions in individual expansion undertakings. Planning for facility expansion consists, primarily, of determining future expansion times, sizes, and locations to support anticipated demand growth. This activity forms a crucial part of the strategic level decision making in many applications. Examples can be found in heavy process industries (Sahinidis and Grossmann 1992), communication networks (Laguna 1998), electric utilities (Murphy and Weiss 1990), automobile industries (Eppen et al. 1989), service industries (Berman and Ganz 1994), and in electronic goods and semiconductor industries (Swaminathan 2000).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Computation of {{facility}} location {{problem for}} every {{location in the}} country is not easy simultaneously. Solving the problem is described by using cluster computing. A technique is to design parallel algorithm by using local search with single swap method in order to solve that problem on clusters. Parallel implementation is done by the use of portable parallel programming, Message Passing Interface (MPI), on Microsoft Windows Compute Cluster. In this paper, it presents the algorithm that used local search with single swap method and implementation of the system of a facility to be opened by using MPI on cluster. If large datasets are considered, the process of calculating a reasonable cost for a facility becomes time consuming. The result shows parallel computation of facility location problem on cluster speedups and scales well as problem size increases. Keywords—cluster, cost, <b>demand,</b> <b>facility</b> locatio...|$|E
40|$|In StopLoc we {{consider}} the location of new stops {{along the edges of}} an existing public transportation network. Examples of StopLoc include the location of bus stops along some given bus routes or of railway stations along the tracks in a railway system. In order to measure the “convenience ” of the location decision for potential customers in given <b>demand</b> <b>facilities,</b> two objectives are proposed. In the first one, we give an upper bound on reaching a closest station from any of the <b>demand</b> <b>facilities</b> and minimize the number of stations. In the second objective, we fix the number of new stations and minimize the sum of the distances between <b>demand</b> <b>facilities</b> and stations. The resulting two problems CovStopLoc and AccessStopLoc are solved by a reduction to a classical set covering and a restricted location problem, respectively. We implement the general ideas in two different environments- the plane, where <b>demand</b> <b>facilities</b> are represented by coordinates and in networks, where they are nodes of a graph...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a location model that assigns online demands to the capacitated regional warehouses currently serving in-store demands in a multi-channel supply chain. The model explicitly considers the trade-off between the risk pooling effect and the transportation cost in a two-echelon inventory/logistics system. Keeping the delivery network of the in-store demands unchanged, the model aims {{to minimize the}} transportation cost, inventory cost, and fixed handling cost in the system when assigning the online demands. We formulate the assignment problem as a non-linear integer programming model. Lagrangian relaxation based procedures are proposed to solve the model, both the general case and an important special case. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our algorithms. Furthermore, we find {{that because of the}} pooling effect the variance of in-store demands currently served by a warehouse is an important parameter of the warehouse when it is considered as a candidate for supplying online demands. Highly uncertain in-store demands, as well as low transportation cost per unit, can make a warehouse appealing. We illustrate with numerical examples the trade-off between the pooling effect and the transportation cost in the assignment problem. We also evaluate the cost savings between the policy derived from the model, which integrates the transportation cost with the pooling effect, and the commonly used policy, which is based only on the transportation cost. Results show that the derived policy can reduce 1. 5 - 7. 5 % cost in average and in many instances the percentage of cost savings is more than 10 %.

40|$|Qualitative {{behavioural}} assessment (QBA) {{is based}} on observers’ ability to capture the dynamic complexity of an animal’s demeanour as it interacts with the environment, in terms such as tense, anxious or relaxed. Sensitivity to context is part of QBA’s integrative capacity and discriminatory power; however, when not properly managed {{it can also be}} a source of undesirable variability and bias. This study investigated the sensitivity of QBA to variations in the visual or verbal information provided to observers, using free-choice profiling (FCP) methodology. FCP allows observers to generate their own descriptive terms for animal demeanour, against which each animal’s expressions are quantified on a visual analogue scale. The resulting scores were analysed with Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA), generating two or more multi-variate dimensions of animal expression. Study 1 examined how 63 observers rated the same video clips of individual sheep during land transport, when these clips were interspersed with two different sets of video footage. Scores attributed to the sheep in the two viewing sessions correlated significantly (GPA dimension 1 : r s= 0. 95, P< 0. 001, GPA dimension 2 : r s= 0. 66, P= 0. 037) indicating that comparative rankings of animals on expressive dimensions were highly similar, however, their mean numerical scores on these dimensions had shifted (RM-ANOVA: Dim 1 : P< 0. 001, Dim 2 : P< 0. 001). Study 2 investigated the effect of being given different amounts of background information on two separate groups of observers assessing footage of 22 individual sheep in a behavioural <b>demand</b> <b>facility.</b> One group was given no contextual information regarding this facility, whereas the second group was told that animals were moving towards and away from a feeder (in view) to access feed. Scores attributed to individual sheep by the two observer groups correlated significantly (Dim 1 : r s= 0. 92, P< 0. 001, Dim 2 : r s= 0. 52, P= 0. 013). A number of descriptive terms were generated by both observer groups and used in similar ways, other terms were unique to each group. The group given additional information about the experimental facility scored the sheep’s behaviour as more ‘directed’ and ‘focused’ than observers who had not been told. Thus, in neither of the two studies did experimentally imposed variations in context alter the characterisations of animals relative to each other, but in Study 1 this did affect the mean numerical values underlying these characterisations, indicating a need for careful attention to the use of visual analogue scales...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in the problem of effective facility location {{over the past five}} decades. The location of these important facilities arises in the service and manufacturing industries. The fundamental questions that arise concern the number and location of facilities such as: schools; hospitals; ambulances; warehouses; factories; department stores; police stations; waste material dumps; fire stations; needed to achieve a prescribed level of service and output. The main concern of many location problems is to place facilities to optimize some spatially dependent objectives such as: minimize average travel time or distance between demand points and servers; minimize a cost function of travel or response time. These optimization problems are complicated with the need to meet a number of specified constraints that relate to safety, demand, available resources, level of service and time. Indeed, the optimization problems that arise in practice are computationally difficult (NP hard) to solve by exact methods. An important problem is the p-median problem which is to find the location of p-facilities so as to minimize the average weighted distance or time between demand points and service centers. Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for this problem due to the difficulty in obtaining solutions by the exact methods. We discussed below a reduction concept applied to p-median problem as follows. Consider a weighted p-median problem with a distance matrix given as D = (d ij). Note that each row (column) of D is associated with a <b>demand</b> (<b>facility)</b> location. We say that column k dominates column l if d ik ≤ d il for all i ≠ k. We use the term strongly dominates in the case of strict inequalities. Observe that locating a facility at a dominated location l would provide no advantage to locating a facility at k except possibly in serving the demands of customers in location l. Further, strongly dominated columns would only be used for ‘self-serve’. Consequently, dominated column can be dropped to generate a feasible solution and the location can later be considered as a possible ‘self-service’ facility. We extend the concept of dominance somewhat further as follows. We say columns k and l dominate column j if d ij ≤min{d ik, d il } for all i ≠ j. In this case there is no advantage in using location j (except for serving customers in location j) when locations k and l are used. So again we can drop the dominated column j if columns k and l are used. The term strongly is used as before. We further extend this concept of dominance as follows. We say that column k partially dominates column l if d ik ≤ d il for at least half or more of the entries for which i ≠ k. Similarly, we say columns k and l partially dominate column j if d ij ≥ min{d ik, d il } for at least half or more of the entries for which i ≠ j. Partially dominated columns correspond to nodes which may be assigned ‘self-serve’ facilities in the original and the reduced matrix. In this paper, we developed a new greedy algorithm based on a concept known as dominance to obtain solutions for the p-median problem. This concept reduces the number of columns of a distance matrix by considering potential facilities that are near and those that are far from the population or demand. We illustrate our ideas and the algorithm with an example. We further applied the new algorithm to effectively locate additional ambulance stations in the Central and South East metropolitan areas of Perth to complement the existing ones. We also compare the performance of our new Greedy Reduction Algorithm (GRA) with the existing greedy algorithm of the p-median problem...|$|E
