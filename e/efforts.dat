40|$|Numerous studies {{examined}} {{the role of}} processing <b>effort</b> in judgments using the “ease-of-processing” paradigm in which participants generate or retrieve few or many issue-relevant thoughts. Because earlier studies only assessed the subjective <b>effort,</b> it is unclear if this paradigm also mobilizes objective <b>effort,</b> and how such <b>effort</b> relates to subjective <b>effort.</b> These questions were addressed in two experiments modeled on standard tasks from the processing <b>effort</b> literature: “ease of argument generation” (Study 1) and “ease of retrieval” (Study 2). In both experiments we simultaneously measured subjective <b>effort</b> (via self-report) and objective <b>effort</b> (via cardiovascular reactivity). The results showed that processing ease manipulations (generation or retrieval of few vs. many exemplars) influence not only subjective <b>effort,</b> but also objective <b>effort,</b> as reflected especially by increases of systolic blood pressure in the many exemplars condition.

Improvements in technology have made life so easy for us that we can do nearly everything with little to no <b>effort.</b> However, in the wake of these technological advances, this research shows that people still place a high premium on human <b>effort.</b> More specifically, I demonstrate that when <b>effort</b> is exerted on a good, consumers reward that <b>effort</b> by increasing their value or utility for the good even if the actual quality of the good is not improved.

40|$|Background: The Theory of Learned Industriousness {{states that}} durable {{individual}} differences in industriousness are {{due in part to}} differences in the extent to which individuals were rewarded for high <b>effort</b> at an earlier time. Individuals rewarded for high <b>effort</b> during training are thought to generalize greater persistence to subsequent tasks than those rewarded for low <b>effort.</b> This study tested whether rewarded physical and/or mental <b>effort</b> at different intensities generalized to greater persistence at a subsequent mental task. Methods: 80 inactive 18 - 25 year-olds were randomized into four groups: Low Mental <b>Effort,</b> High Mental <b>Effort,</b> Low Physical <b>Effort,</b> and High Physical <b>Effort.</b> Each completed group-specific <b>effort</b> training and a mental persistence task at baseline and posttest. Results: Factorial analysis of covariance revealed a significant domain x <b>effort</b> interaction on persistence (F[1, 75]= 4. 93, p=. 029). High Mental <b>Effort</b> and Low Mental <b>Effort</b> groups demonstrated similar gains in persistence (d=- 0. 08, p>. 05) and points earned (d= 0. 11, p>. 05) following <b>effort</b> training. High Physical <b>Effort</b> and Low Physical <b>Effort</b> diverged on persistence (d=- 0. 49, p=. 004) but not points earned (d =- 0. 12, p>. 05). Conclusions: Findings suggest either that training and test stimuli were too dissimilar to cue effects of associative learning in physical <b>effort</b> groups, or that effects were present but overpowered by the affective and neurocognitive consequences of an acute bout of intense aerobic physical activity.

40|$|Both {{physical}} and mental <b>effort</b> are thought to affect vigilance. Mental <b>effort</b> {{is known for its}} vigilance declining effects, but the effects of physical <b>effort</b> are less clear. This study investigated whether these two forms of <b>effort</b> affect the EEG and subjective alertness differently. Participants performed a physical task and were subsequently presented with a mental task, or vice versa. Mental <b>effort</b> decreased subjective alertness and increased theta power in the EEG. Both results suggest a vigilance decline. Physical <b>effort,</b> however, increased subjective alertness and alpha and beta 1 power in the EEG. These findings point towards an increase in vigilance. Beta 2 power was reduced after physical <b>effort,</b> which may reflect a decrease in active cognitive processing. No transfer effects were found between the <b>effort</b> conditions, suggesting that the effects of mental and physical <b>effort</b> are distinct.

The agent’s <b>effort</b> level increases the firm’s outcome, x=a+ε, which is subject to a normally distributed noise term, ε.

Response time is used as a proxy for <b>effort</b> and consumer involvement measures capture individual differences in (relative) cost of <b>effort</b> and perceived complexity. <b>Effort</b> is explained using the (estimated) utility difference between alternatives, the number of elementary information processes (EIP's) required to solve the choice problem optimally and respondent specific cost of <b>effort</b> and complexity perceptions. The predictions of the theoretical model are supported by our empirical findings. Response time increases with lower cost of <b>effort</b> and greater perceived complexity (i. e. higher involvement).

40|$|When {{employees}} work hard, they exert more <b>effort</b> on job tasks (task effort); {{and when}} employees learn hard, they exert more <b>effort</b> to learn (learning <b>effort).</b> Task <b>effort</b> and learning <b>effort</b> are important causes of improved performance. This thesis investigates whether {{the use of}} tournament schemes motivates employees to work harder and learn harder, and also whether providing performance feedback in tournament schemes has any impact on task <b>effort</b> and learning <b>effort.</b> This thesis has three goals. The first is to investigate the relationship between incentives, learning, and performance. The literature on whether learning interacts with incentives to improve performance is inconclusive, because no prior research has provided a good test of this question (as noted by Bonner and Sprinkle 2002; Bailey and Fessler 2011; Bailey et al. 1998, and as remains true today). The second goal is to investigate the motivational effect of tournament schemes on <b>effort.</b> The literature suggests that <b>effort</b> is difficult to observe directly or to quantify; as a result, {{it is hard to}} verify whether tournament schemes motivate employees’ task <b>effort</b> and learning <b>effort.</b> This thesis uses an eye-tracking device to measure <b>effort,</b> by measuring eye position, eye movements, and pupil size. The third goal is to investigate the effect of performance feedback on task <b>effort,</b> learning <b>effort,</b> and performance in the tournament setting. I posit and show evidence that both task <b>effort</b> and learning <b>effort</b> are higher in multiple-winner schemes than in either winner-takes-all schemes or piece-rate schemes. Task <b>effort</b> is directly positively associated with performance, while learning <b>effort</b> causes learning transfer to a job task, also yielding a positive effect on performance. I find that providing relative performance feedback in the tournament setting has no significant impact on task <b>effort</b> or learning <b>effort.</b> These findings have practical value for many corporations, which are constantly re-evaluating the effectiveness of their incentive schemes and reporting systems while investing in learning initiatives to help employees transfer learned skills to job tasks. Organizations may use the insights of this thesis to help them design learning initiatives and motivate employees to transfer learned skills to their job tasks...|$|R
