40|$|The {{total losses}} caused by natural {{disasters}} have spatial heterogeneity {{due to the}} different economic development levels inside the disaster-hit areas. This paper uses scenarios of direct economic loss to introduce the sectors' losses caused by the 2008  Wenchuan earthquake (2008  WCE) in Beijing, utilizing the Adaptive Regional Input–Output (ARIO) model and the Inter-regional ripple effect (IRRE) model. The purpose is to assess the ripple effects of <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> and spatial heterogeneity of both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> at {{the scale of the}} smallest administrative divisions of China (streets, villages, and towns). The results indicate that the district of Beijing with the most severe <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> is the Chaoyang District; the finance and insurance industry (15, see Table  1) of Chaowai Street suffers the most in the Chaoyang District, which is 1. 46  times that of its direct economic loss. During  2008 – 2014, the average annual GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of Beijing was decreased 3. 63  % by the catastrophe. Compared with the 8  % of GDP growth rate target, the decreasing GDP growth rate is a significant and noticeable economic impact, and it can be efficiently mitigated by increasing rescue effort and by supporting the industries which are located in the seriously damaged regions...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} studies have estimated the economic impacts {{of a variety of}} disruptions. Most of these studies are based on macroeconomic models that quantify the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a disruption. Direct <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> occur due to damaged facilities or when consumers change their purchasing behavior because of the disruption. <b>Indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> occur when directly impacted businesses consequently reduce their orders to their suppliers. <b>Indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> are often larger than direct <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> This paper compiles the results from these economic models in order to compare the costs of different disruptions and help decision makers prioritize among disruptions. We compare the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a variety of disruptions, including earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, pandemic diseases, and port closures. Some studies model hypothetical scenarios, but other studies quantify the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from historical events such as the September 11 attacks and the 2011 Japanese tsunami.

40|$|International audienceDisaster loss {{estimates}} are helpful for managing post-disaster reconstruction and for designing disaster-risk mitigation strategies. However, {{most of these}} estimates in China merely consider direct losses, {{and only a few}} include <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> As the most destructive earthquake since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Wenchuan Earthquake that occurred in 2008 resulted in direct economic damages reached Chinese Yuan (CNY) 845 billion (US $ 124 billion). The aim {{of the study was to}} estimate <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> caused by the Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan Province through the Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, which can reflect disaster-related changes in production capacity, ripple effects within the economic system, and adaptive behaviors of economic actors. The results showed that <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> in the production and housing sectors were estimated at 40 % of the direct <b>economic</b> <b>losses,</b> i. e., approximately CNY 300 billion; moreover, the model predicted an 8 -year reconstruction period. Several factors contributed to these losses, including significant damages to key sectors, financial constraints on reconstruction, post-earthquake investment instability, and limits in reconstruction capacity.

40|$|The severe Mediterranean storm {{occurred}} on 25 October 2011 triggered several shallow landslides in the Cinque Terre area (eastern Liguria, Italy) that disrupted transportation routes causing significant direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> In the Vernazza catchment the high-intensity rainfall event (472 mm/ 6 h at Brugnato, Vara valley, and 349 mm/ 6 h at Monterosso, Cinque Terre) generated more than 500 shallow landslides and all provincial roads connecting {{the village of}} Vernazza to the inland were closed due to severe damages. The reparation works on roads has been estimated at more than 10 million Euros. <b>Indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> related to road closures are unknown but, although difficult to estimate, {{are likely to be}} higher than the direct losses, being this area a very famous tourist resort. A quantitative procedure has been applied for estimating shallow-landslide risk along the road network of Vernazza catchment in case a similar event occurs again. Firstly, a landslide hazard model has been produced analyzing statistically the spatial relationship between the landslide-event inventory and several conditioning factors. Secondly, the potential <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> on roads have been estimated defining damage scenarios. The risk estimation has been calculated by combining landslide occurrence probability and expected losses on every road stretch. Additionally, the following aspects of the risk estimation, assessment and management have been analyzed simulating different solutions for hazard mitigation: (1) Impact of land use changes on landslide hazard and risk; (2) Identification of suitable engineering mitigation measures to reduce possible future economic losses; (3) Cost-effectiveness of proposed solutions.

40|$|Abstract Background Injury is an {{emerging}} {{public health problem}} with social development and modernization in developing countries. To describe the prevalence and burden of injury and provide elaborate information for policy development, we conducted a community-based household survey in the Shandong Province of China. Methods The survey was conducted in 2004. Participants were selected by a multi-stage random sampling method. Information on injuries occurring in 2003 was collected in four cities and six rural counties in Shandong Province, China. Results The estimated incidence rate of injury in Shandong Province was 67. 7 per 1, 000. Injury incidence was higher in rural areas (84. 3 per 1, 000) than in urban areas (42. 9 per 1, 000), and was higher among males (81. 1 per 1, 000) than females (54. 1 per 1, 000).

40|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} natural hazards that affect the population of Hong Kong on an annual basis. However, the existing loss reduction strategies for the hazard in Hong Kong have rarely been systematically evaluated. In this paper, by adopting Smith and Petley's (2009) framework, the loss reduction strategies currently adopted by the Hong Kong government are evaluated. The known strategies include the implementation of wind resistance design in buildings, the establishment of a state-of-the-art forecast and warning system, and a comprehensive contingency plan. Through the continuous application of those combined strategies, the vulnerability of the Hong Kong population to the tropical hazard has been greatly reduced in recent decades. Nevertheless, there are two issues of concern. First, the issuance of the tropical cyclone signal is not solely determined by wind speed. It is also mediated by the associated <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss.</b> Second, the strengthened protection helps Hong Kong citizens to develop a strong sense of security towards the tropical cyclone hazard. But, the sense of security may be too strong which results in a general insensitivity to the potential risks of the tropical cyclone hazard. Based on the above findings, it is suggested that in addition to the existing loss reduction strategy for the tropical cyclone hazard, a strategy which enhances the risk perception of the community towards the hazard should be developed...|$|E

Methods Cross-sectional study {{carried out in the}} city of Presidente Prudente / SP. The sample consisted of 542 adults of both sexes and aged ≥ 50 years old. The occurrence of osteoporosis, health-related productivity loss, use of hospital services and level of physical activity were assessed using questionnaires. Statistical analysis was composed of chi-square test, binary logistic regression and Mann-Whitney test. The significance level adopted was p-value < 0. 05. ResultsThe prevalence of osteoporosis was 14. 4 % (95 % CI: 11. 4 % - 17. 3 %) and it was associated with female sex (p = 0. 001), lower economic status (p-value = 0. 036) and obesity (p-value = 0. 003).

40|$|An illness shock {{may cause}} {{two kinds of}} {{economic}} losses: the direct financial loss mainly due to medical spending and the <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> due to the reduction of income. This article studies the illness burden in China between 1990 and 2000 by analyzing, at the same time, the direct medical cost and the indirect income loss. The analyses are conducted in two steps. First, a quintile analysis is {{used to assess the}} level and the distribution of health financing burden across the population. Second a fixed-effect panel model is used to capture the effect of illness shock on households' long-term income. The paper highlights the increase of households' health financial burden in the 1990 s, as well as its unequal distribution among income groups. The data suggest that, despite of an increase in coverage between 1991 and 1997, the insurance system actually failed to protect the poor against catastrophic medical expenditure. A significant negative effect of illness shock on long-term income is captured by the chronic illness indicator but not by the general illness indicator, which suggests that chronic illnesses, compared to non-chronic illnesses, may induce additional income loss. The paper also shows that the effect of illness shock varies by region and working status: urban households are more vulnerable to long-term income effect of illness than rural ones; people with more flexible work (self-employees and collective companies' employees) are more likely to cope with the health shock than people with less flexible work (private or state companies' employees) and the unemployed. Finally, insurance membership turned out to have no effect on the protection of households against the loss of income due to health shocks...|$|E

40|$|The {{southeast}} {{region of}} China is frequently affected by summer heat waves. Nanjing, a metropolitan city in Jiangsu Province, China, experienced an extreme 14 -day heat wave in 2013. Extreme heat {{can not only}} induce health outcomes in terms of excess mortality and morbidity (hospital admissions) but can also cause productivity losses for self-paced indoor workers and capacity losses for outdoor workers due to occupational safety requirements. All of these effects can be translated into productive working time losses, thus creating a need to investigate the macroeconomic implications of heat waves on production supply chains. Indeed, industrial interdependencies are important for capturing the cascading effects of initial changes in factor inputs in a single sector on the remaining sectors and the economy. To consider these effects, this paper develops an interdisciplinary approach by combining meteorological, epidemiological and economic analyses to investigate the macroeconomic impacts of heat waves on the economy of Nanjing in 2013. By adopting a supply-driven input-output (IO) model, labour {{is perceived to be}} a key factor input, and any heat effect on human beings {{can be viewed as a}} degradation of productive time and human capital. Using this interdisciplinary tool, our study shows a total economic loss of 27. 49 billion Yuan for Nanjing in 2013 due to the heat wave, which is equivalent to 3. 43 % of the city's gross value of production in 2013. The manufacturing sector sustained 63. 1 % of the total economic loss at 17. 34 billion Yuan. Indeed, based on the ability of the IO model to capture <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss,</b> our results further suggest that although the productive time losses in the manufacturing and service sectors have lower magnitudes than those in the agricultural and mining sectors, they can entail substantial indirect losses because of industrial interdependencies. This important conclusion highlights the importance of incorporating industrial interdependencies and indirect economic assessments in disaster risk studies...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the prevalence and economic significance of fasciolosis in cattle slaughtered at Mettu town municipal abattoir, Southwest Ethiopia. A total of 663 animals were randomly selected from the indigenous zebu cattle brought to the abattoir during October 2008 -May 2009. Retrospective assessment, Ante-mortem examinations, body condition scoring and Post-mortem inspections were performed to collect data. Out of the total examined animals 47. 1 % (312 / 663) were found positive for Fasciola parasites. Two species of Fasciola: Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica were detected with prevalences of 26. 9 % (178 / 663) and 11. 8 % (78 / 663), respectively, mixed infections by both species were 4. 8 % (32 / 663) and immature (unidentified) flukes were 3. 5 % (24 / 663) of the total infections. The difference in prevalence of Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica was found to be significant (P= 0. 000). Prevalence of the disease was also determined in relation to body condition score of the sample animals whereby 319 and 344 animals were categorized under Good and Medium body condition score sub-groups, respectively. It was found that 41. 7 % (133 / 319) of the Good score animals and 52 % (179 / 344) of the medium score animals were positive for Fasciola parasites, and the difference in prevalence between the two sub-groups was statistically significant (P= 0. 008). The annual direct economic loss due to liver condemnation and the annual <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> due to carcass weight reduction were estimated to be 4, 757. 00 USD (47, 570. 00 birr) and 46, 615. 00 USD (466, 150. 00 birr), respectively; hence, the total economic loss due to fasciolosis in cattle slaughtered at Mettu municipal abattoir was estimated to be 51, 372. 00 USD (513, 720. 00 birr). In conclusion, bovine fasciolosis due to Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica was observed to be an economically important disease in Mettu and its surrounding districts. Further studies on small ruminant species and local epidemiology of the disease are suggested to enable control of the infection in the area...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the four {{principal}} uses of seismic zonation for lifelines and utilities: 1) hazard delineation, 2) physical loss estimation, 3) assessment {{of economic and social}} consequences, and 4) planning for emergency response and recovery. Emphasis is given to geographic information systems (GIS) and their application to pipeline networks in evaluating the spatial characteristics of earthquake effects. The paper examines the GIS databases for water supply performance obtained for the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes. Relationships among buried lifeline damage and various seismic parameters are examined, and the parameters that are statistically most significant are identified. Using GIS data from the Northridge earthquake, the relationships among pipeline repair rate, type of pipe, diameter, and various seismic parameters are assessed. The effects of permanent ground deformation (PGD) on buried lifelines are discussed. Air photo measurements of PGD and the spatial characteristics of ground deformation revealed by these measurements are described. Mapping procedures for PGD hazards, including probabilistic mapping techniques, are reviewed. Recent studies of <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from earthquake damage to lifelines in Shelby County, TN are used to explore the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of lifeline systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{research of}} seismic risk assessment is presented herein {{focused on the}} existing build-ings of the extended urban region of Athens in Greece. The seismic risk assessment is fulfilled by discriminating the current study in two approaches, probable and actual, conducting afterwards between them a comparison analysis. In the first part, a pilot methodology is developed for the seismic loss assessment in monetary terms regarding the buildings damages, consistent with the National Programme for Earthquake Management of Existing Buildings (NPEMEB). The building stock consists of typical building types of Southern Europe and refers to 750, 085 buildings (18. 80 % of buildings in Greece) situated in the entire region of Athens according {{to the results of}} the 2000 - 1 statistical census. A wider research of seismic risk assessment could include direct losses of infrastructures and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> The evaluation of loss due to building damage in a certain region requires an assessment of both seismic hazard and vulnerability of the building stock in the study area. Four different existing damage scenarios are applied for the vulnerabilit...|$|R
40|$|More than 350, 000 railway bridges {{are present}} on the European railway network, making them a key {{infrastructure}} of the whole railway network. Railway bridges are continuously exposed to changing environmental threats, such as wind, floods and traffic load, which can affect safety and reliability of the bridge. Furthermore, a problem on a bridge can affect the whole railway network by increasing {{the vulnerability of the}} geographic area, served by the railway network. In this paper a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) method is presented in order to move from visual inspection towards a real time Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of the bridge. It is proposed that the health state of a steel truss bridge is continuously monitored by taking account of the health state of each bridge element. In this way, levels of bridge deterioration can be identified before they become critical, the risk of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> can be reduced by defining optimal bridge maintenance works, and the reliability of the bridge can be improved by identifying possible hidden vulnerabilities among different bridge elements...|$|R
