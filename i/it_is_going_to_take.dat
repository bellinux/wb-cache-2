500|$|The film {{upon its}} debut grossed more internationally than in North America. As of March 1, 2011, the film's total {{worldwide}} gross was $261,183,588. The Hollywood Reporter said This Is <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{first place in}} the weekend box office chart with $23,234,394 at 3,481 theaters—with a per-theater average of $6,675 over the period of five days. This return had [...] "underperformed" [...] to both Sony and film analysts' expectations—Sony's had originally expected the film to make an estimated 50 million, but after the film's [...] "disappointing" [...] three-day gross, due to some fans, mostly in North America, boycotting the movie and issuing boycott propaganda in social networks and media, Sony lowered their expectations to $35 million, while analysts expected an estimated 30 million for the weekend. In the film's second weekend of wide release, it declined to 43.4%, making $13,157,944, placing it at second at the box office, behind A Christmas Carol—which had grossed more than twice what This Is It made. The film completed its theatrical run in North America on December 3, 2009.|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but last week we did not have a good week, ratings wise. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his first}} term of office, from 1921 to 1926, King pursued a {{conservative}} domestic policy with the object of lowering wartime taxes and, especially, wartime ethnic and labour tensions. [...] "The War is over", he argued, [...] "and {{for a long time}} to come <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> all that the energies of man can do to bridge the chasm and heal the wounds which the War has made in our social life." [...] He sought a Canadian voice independent of London in foreign affairs. In September 1922 the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, appealed repeatedly to King for Canadian support in the Chanak crisis, in which a war threatened between Britain and Turkey. King coldly replied that the Canadian Parliament would decide what policy to follow, making clear it would not be bound by London's suggestions; the crisis soon dissipated, but the episode led to the downfall of Lloyd George.|$|E
2500|$|What {{level of}} access to the European single market Britain should seek, and the future of {{migration}} policy and the free movement of EU nationals in the UK. Fox, the most right-wing of the five candidates, said that he only supported membership in the single market if the UK was allowed to completely opt-out of the free movement of people, which is viewed as extremely unlikely. Gove and Leadsom have taken a tough line of free movement, with Gove pledging to [...] "end free movement [...] introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration" [...] and Leadsom pledging that free movement [...] "will end" [...] without mentioning the single market. Crabb took what The Week described as [...] "the most pro-single market stance" [...] of the candidates, saying it was [...] "vital" [...] for the UK to have [...] "as close an economic relationship with the EU as we have now" [...] while also speaking of [...] "controlling" [...] immigration, signalling some willingness to compromise with the EU. May stated that it was her [...] "priority to allow British companies to trade with the single market in goods and services" [...] but said that she would not accept a deal [...] "that involves accepting the free movement of people as it has worked hitherto"—also signalling willingness to some future compromise deal with the EU. Fox also pledged to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, while Leadsom, Crabb and Gove have not specifically pledged to do so; May has said: [...] "I think net migration {{in the tens of thousands}} is sustainable, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time." ...|$|E
