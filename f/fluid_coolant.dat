Presented {{are the results}} from heat transfer analyses of a PCM containment canister. One and two dimensional finite difference computer models are developed to analyze heat transfer in the canister walls, PCM, void, and heat engine working <b>fluid</b> <b>coolant.</b> The modes of heat transfer considered include conduction in canister walls and solid PCM, conduction and pseudo-free convection in liquid PCM, conduction and radiation across PCM vapor filled void regions, and forced convection in the heat engine working fluid. Void shape, location, growth or shrinkage (due to density difference between the solid and liquid PCM phases) are prescribed based on engineering judgment. The PCM phase change process is analyzed using the enthalpy method. The {{discussion of the results}} focuses on how canister thermal performance is affected by free convection in the liquid PCM and void heat transfer. Characterizing these effects is important for interpreting the relationship between ground-based canister performance (in 1 -g) and expected on-orbit performance (in micro-g). Void regions accentuate canister hot spots and temperature gradients due to their large thermal resistance. Free convection reduces the extent of PCM superheating and lowers canister temperatures during a portion of the PCM thermal charge period. Surprisingly small differences in canister thermal performance result from operation on the ground and operation on-orbit. This lack of a strong gravity dependency is attributed to the large contribution of container walls in overall canister energy redistribution by conduction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} fine-mesh multiphysics methodologies and algorithms for numerical {{predictions of}} the behavior of Light Water Reactor (LWR) cores. The multiphysics aspects cover the distribution of neutrons, the fluid flow of the coolant and the conjugate heat transfer between the solid fuel pins and the <b>fluid</b> <b>coolant.</b> The proposed schemes are aimed at fine-mesh coupled effects, directly resolving the interdependencies of the different fields on the finest scales of the computations. The solver is developed for both steady-state and transient LWR scenarios. For the steady-state simulations, the neutronics is solved both by the lower order, diffusion equation and the higher order, discrete ordinate transport method, and for transient cases by the former. The thermal-hydraulic solver is based on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The implementation utilizes a finite volume method (FVM) computational framework, and to achieve feasible computational times, high performance computing (HPC) aspects such as parallelization by domain decomposition are considered. The implemented tool is applied to cases of parts of a fuel assembly, analyzing systems of up to 15 x 15 fuel pins and succesfully resolving sub-pin resolution of all fields. Furthermore, the transient fine-mesh neutronic solver is verified based on a novel scheme utilizing the system response to a local perturbation. In addition, the multiphase flow problem encountered in Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) is studied. First, the transport of bubbles under subcooled boiling conditions is simulated based on a population balance approach. The novel formulation is shown to increase the computational efficiency and to capture a large range of bubbles sizes with few degrees of freedom. Second, the typical Eulerian-Eulerian approach for two-phase flow is studied from a stability and dynamics perspective. The latter investigations highlight the complexity of the two-fluid formulation and indicate the spontaneous emergence of meso-scale void structures under adiabatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Poster présenté au congrès Euromat 2011 International audienceAccording to the {{directive}} n° 2000 / 53 /CE 85 % by weight of an end-of-life vehicle (EVL) must be recycled. The {{current state of}} practice comprises four steps. Liquids from battery, gearboxes casing, brake <b>fluid,</b> <b>coolant</b> and air conditioning circuit are first collected. Tyres, catalysts, windscreens and windows are then manually removed, prior to the shredding of the car. A magnetic separation is processed on the shredded materials, to recover valuable ferrous components. The remaining part (Automotive Shredder Residue - ASR) undergoes successive separation steps, leading among others to two potentially valuable fractions, one mostly composed of plastics (P 1) and the other of iron oxides (P 2). Currently, P 2 and P 1 are respectively landfilled or used as a fuel source in various processes. In the blast furnace (BF) and the electric arc furnace (EAF) routes, P 1 {{could be used as}} substitute for coal or coke, and P 2 could replace part of the ore, provided some elements (Cl, Cu, Zn) are removed. Chlorinated compounds (PVC) can release toxics (dioxin) or corrosive metal chlorides, detrimental to the installations and the environment. Copper can spoil the cast-iron produced, and zinc favors the development of scabs that modify the flow configuration inside the BF. The whole objective of REFORBA is to assess the possibility of using "purified" fractions P 1 and P 2 in the BF and the EAF, as reducing agents or "iron ore". This would provide steelmakers with raw materials cheaper than coke. As additional potential benefits the amount of CO 2 generated in the processes and the volume of landfilled shredded residues would be lowered. Representative fractions of P 1 and P 2 are obtained by sampling an industrial line of treatment. Comprehensive chemical characterization (ICP-AES, SEM, FTIR, thermal analyses) is performed to know the global content and localization of materials containing chemicals to remove. Sorting operations (grinding, screening, magnetic, eddy current, and sink float separations) are then performed on P 1 and P 2, until the modeled BF global heat and flow profiles match the classical configuration. The possibility of using P 1 in place of C and CO is evaluated by a lab-scale thermochemical characterization of the iron oxides reduction, and {{of the quality of the}} cast-iron processed with some percent of P 2 in the ore feed.
