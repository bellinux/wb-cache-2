5|$|<b>Drumming</b> {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The <b>drumming</b> is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds <b>drumming</b> more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. <b>Drumming</b> serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the <b>drumming</b> of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying <b>drumming</b> is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the <b>drumming</b> might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
50|$|In {{his major}} work on Sami <b>drums,</b> Die lappische Zaubertrommel, Ernst Manker lists 41 frame <b>drums,</b> 1 ring <b>drum,</b> 2 angular cut frame <b>drums</b> and 27 bowl <b>drums.</b> Given this numbers, many tend {{to divide the}} <b>drums</b> into the two main groups bowl <b>drums</b> and frame <b>drums,</b> seeing the others as variations. Judged by these {{remaining}} <b>drums</b> and their known provenance, frame <b>drums</b> seem to be common in the southern Sami areas, and bowl <b>drums</b> seem to be common in the northern Sami areas. The bowl <b>drum</b> is sometimes regarded as a local adjustment of the basic <b>drum</b> type, this being the frame <b>drum.</b> The frame <b>drum</b> type has most resemblance to other ceremonial <b>drums</b> used by indigenous peoples of Siberia.|$|R

25|$|Several factors {{determine}} the sound a <b>drum</b> produces, including the type, shape {{and construction of}} the <b>drum</b> shell, the type of <b>drum</b> heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different <b>drum</b> sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern Tom-tom <b>drum.</b> A jazz <b>drummer</b> may want <b>drums</b> that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock <b>drummer</b> may prefer <b>drums</b> that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their <b>drums</b> are constructed and tuned differently.|$|R
5|$|Free was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive critical reception. Critics noted that the album was different from its predecessor, focusing more on Moore's keyboards than Matheos' guitars. Portnoy's <b>drumming</b> received praise; Moore's vocals received mixed reactions. A remix EP entitled re:free was released on October 24, 2006, featuring remixes of three tracks from Free.|$|E
5|$|From that point, Manne refocused his {{attention}} on his own <b>drumming.</b> It might be argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he recorded numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E
5|$|Leto {{has worked}} on several side {{projects}} during his career, including a collaboration with Antoine Becks, a recording with the short-lived supergroup The Wondergirls, and performing on occasional dates with Street Drum Corps.

5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon {{was asked to}} leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and <b>drumming.</b> Chimes was brought back to drum {{for the next few}} months. The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for the Who on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's Shea Stadium.|$|E
5|$|As the Second World War progressed, Sellers {{continued}} {{to develop his}} <b>drumming</b> skills, and played {{with a series of}} touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers {{became a member of the}} Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.|$|E
50|$|Initially the boilers were {{designed}} with 4 <b>drums</b> and 3 <b>drums</b> like the Stirling boiler. The single <b>drum</b> {{at the bottom}} and three <b>drums</b> on the top were connected through a network of tubes which were welded to the <b>drums</b> above and the single <b>drum</b> below. The rational demand of steam in terms of capacity, pressure and temperature resulted in bi <b>drums</b> and single <b>drum</b> boilers.|$|R
50|$|A moving <b>drum</b> hoist, or {{traveling}} <b>drum</b> hoist, is {{a variation}} on the traditional <b>drum</b> hoist. Moving <b>drum</b> hoists effectively eliminate the fleet angle between <b>drum</b> and block by shifting the <b>drum</b> along its axis as it spins. The amount of shift per <b>drum</b> revolution is equal to the pitch of the <b>drum's</b> helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving <b>drum</b> hoists can combine <b>drum</b> and head block into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.|$|R
2500|$|An {{electronic}} <b>drum</b> module is {{an electronic}} or digital music device in an electronic <b>drum</b> kit {{that serves as}} the central processing unit and sound module. The <b>drum</b> module creates or produces the <b>drum</b> kit sounds or other sounds selected by the <b>drummer.</b> By itself, a <b>drum</b> module cannot play or sound <b>drum</b> beats. It only produces <b>drum</b> sounds when a performer strikes electronic <b>drum</b> pads or acoustic <b>drum</b> kit instruments that have electronic [...] "triggers" [...] (or sensors) attached to them. When the electronic <b>drum</b> pads or trigger-equipped instruments are struck, this sends a signal to the <b>drum</b> module, which produces the corresponding electronic <b>drum</b> sound (or other sound). Even when <b>drum</b> pads and/or triggers are connected to a <b>drum</b> module, the <b>drum</b> module by itself does not make any audible sound. Like other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, the <b>drum</b> module only outputs an electronic signal. The performer can hear this signal by connecting headphones to the <b>drum</b> module (i.e., for individual practice) or by plugging the <b>drum</b> module into a amplifier and loudspeaker or PA system for audible practice or live performances. The <b>drum</b> module's output signal can also be patched into an audio console for concerts or sound recording. The nomenclature varies (see below). For example, electronic <b>drum</b> modules are called [...] "percussion sound modules" [...] in the case of Roland Corporation, or sometimes simply modules. A common colloquial term for this device is <b>drum</b> brain. (see below).|$|R
5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} {{of popular}} music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit <b>drumming,</b> the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' <b>drumming</b> style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|Combining {{elements}} of death metal, thrash metal, black metal, progressive metal and industrial music, Strapping Young Lad's music {{was characterized by}} the use of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and <b>drumming,</b> blast beats and Wall of Sound production. The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with bipolar disorder and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behaviour, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.|$|E
