25|$|Domestic {{immersion}} heaters, usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal domestic electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, off-peak <b>electricity</b> <b>tariff</b> such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|E
25|$|The Water and Sanitation Services Law No. 2029 of 1999, was revised in 2000 after Cochabamba’s water war into Law No. 2066. The new law {{includes}} {{provisions for}} protection of traditional water-sharing arrangements through {{a system of}} official licenses and increase local communities participation in decision making processes such as the establishment of water tariffs. The , (Superintendencia de Agua y Saneamiento Basico) which grants concessions and licenses and establishes the principles to set prices, tariffs, taxes, and quotas, was not modified by the new Law. The Government of Evo Morales considers passing a new water and sanitation services law called “Water for Life”. According to Vice-Minister Rene Orellana, this new legal framework would eliminate the SISAB and introduce a decentralized regulator in its place. Regulatory taxes would be eliminated along with the legal concept of the concession. A preferential <b>electricity</b> <b>tariff</b> would be introduced for EPSAs and community water rights would be strengthened.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} 2013-14, The plant load factor (PLF) of {{coal-fired}} thermal power stations is only 65.43% whereas these stations can run above 85% PLF comfortably provided there is adequate electricity {{demand in the}} country. The additional electricity generation at 85% PLF is nearly 240 billion units which is adequate to replace all the LPG and Kerosene consumption in domestic sector. The incremental cost of generating additional electricity is only their coal fuel cost which is less than 3 Rs/kWh. Enhancing the PLF of coal-fired stations and encouraging domestic electricity consumers to substitute electricity in place of LPG and Kerosene in household cooking, would reduce the government subsidies and idle capacity of thermal power stations can be put to use economically. The domestic consumers {{who are willing to}} surrender the subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits or eligible for subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits, may be given free electricity connection and subsidised <b>electricity</b> <b>tariff.</b>|$|E

By the middle of 2016, LPG spot prices have fallen below crude oil parity price in terms of heat content (one barrel crude oil is equal to 123.5kg of LPG) due to LPG glut in the market Instead of using LPG as heating fuel in domestic sector, for higher end usage, LPG can be also converted into alkylate which is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and gives clean burning.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to apply the {{mechanism}} of cross-differentiated electricity tariffication to the existing system of regulated tariffs {{in accordance with the}} structure chain of ?prices-tariffs-contracts?. With this purpose methods of regulated pricing are divided into three groups of methods which are one way or another orientated towards the processes of electricity supply or electricity consumption according to their mechanism of regulated prices (tariffs) calculation. It is shown that cross-differentiated tariffication makes use of system approach to form <b>electricity</b> <b>tariffs</b> and that is more powerful mechanism than discriminatory pricing. Correspondence between <b>electricity</b> <b>tariffs</b> and possible indications of differentiation has been analyzed. The mechanism of cross-differentiated tariffication has been illustrated. As a result in the existing system of <b>electricity</b> <b>tariffs</b> integrated and differentiated by time, subsystems of one-part and multipart tariffs have been formed as well as subsystems of one-component and multicomponent tariffs. Connections between the formed tariffs subsystems are established. Correspondence between the formed <b>electricity</b> <b>tariffs</b> subsystems and contracts using for electricity supply is shown (forward, call option, put option). ????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????-??????-??????????. ? ???? ????? ?????? ????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???
