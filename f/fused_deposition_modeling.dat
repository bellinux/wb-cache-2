25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modeling,</b> selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} technologies in additive manufacturing. The layer-by-layer mechanism of rapid prototyping allows this technology to rapidly create and print complex geometries from three-dimensional models of any objects. <b>Fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> {{is one of the}} common processes in rapid prototyping, and its maturity has given birth to full-scale, commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machines, as well as low-cost, <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machines, which are also referred to as three-dimensional printers. This work compares the effect of layer thickness during printing on the tensile and compressive strengths of samples, for commercial and low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machines. Standard samples based on ASTM D 638 and ASTM D 695 were prepared for the tensile and compressive tests, with layer thicknesses of 0. 3302 and 0. 2540 mm, using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene as the printing material. From the tensile tests, specimens prepared using low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> managed to obtain only 41. 87 and 54. 69 % of the ultimate tensile strength of specimens prepared using commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling,</b> for layer thicknesses of 0. 3302 and 0. 2540 mm.

40|$|AbstractIn this research, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to find out the {{influence}} of the process parameter along with their interactions on the dimensional accuracy of part fabricated using two different rapid prototyping machines namely <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine, and a low cost open source 3 D printer. 3 D open source printer (3 D-OSP) is one of the newly developed rapid prototyping (RP) process for part fabrication. It has been observed from previous research that the contribution of parameters such as raster width, slice height, and path speed are the most significant to the dimensional accuracy of 3 D open source product while raster width, slice height, and tip dimension are the most influencing factors for <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine. Taguchi parameter design of experiment method has been used to find out the optimum parameters level to minimize percentage change in length (L 1), length (L 2) and height (H) of test specimens fabricated by each of these two rapid prototyping machines. Experimental result revels that there is different optimal parameters level setting for each dimensional characteristics namely change in length (L 1), length (L 2) and height (H). Therefore, grey relational method is used to obtain optimum factor level of each dimensional characteristic simultaneously. Dimensional accuracy of parts fabricated by two different technique namely 3 D open source printer and <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine is within a desired range. Appropriate controls of machine process parameters improve the dimensional accuracy of parts. It is concluded that a low cost 3 D open source printer gave sufficient amount of part accuracy when it is compared with the industrial based <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine...|$|R
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as <b>Fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modeling</b> (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The paper aims {{to predict}} the surface {{roughness}} of <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> prototypes. Since average roughness is not comprehensive, this study aims to extend the characterization to all the roughness parameters obtainable by a profilometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model of the 3 D profile is supplied {{as a function of}} process parameters and part shape. A suitable geometry was designed and prototyped for validation. Data were measured by a profilometer and complemented by microscopic analysis. A methodology based on the proposed model was applied to optimise prototype fabrication in two practical cases. Findings - The proposed profile is effective in describing the micro-geometrical surface of <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> prototypes. The third dimension enables the calculation of amplitude, spatial and hybrid roughness parameters. Research limitations/implications - Because of mathematical assumptions and technological aspects, the validity of the model presents limitations related to the deposition angle. Practical implications - The method is an effective tool in the process planning stage: it enables knowing in advance how to assure part specifications delivering a set of technical choices. Two practical applications point out the usability in the product development and process parameters optimisation.
