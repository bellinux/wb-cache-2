It is a problematic groundwater contaminant {{because of its}} unique physical-chemical properties. It is found {{in a wide range}} of consumer products as a by-product contaminant. This research aimed to investigate contaminant properties and behavior of dioxane in the environment and also in the human body. The dioxane ability to decontamination by adsorption processes was evaluated with four adsorbents. The adsorption efficiencies of activated carbon (AC), metal oxide nanomaterials (TiO[subscript] 2 and MgO), and diatomaceous earth (DE) were assessed in aqueous and vapor phases using infrared spectroscopy. AC showed the highest adsorptive capacity for dioxane at equilibrium in both phases. The rate and extent of dermal absorption are important in the analysis of risk from dermal exposure to dioxane. For this purpose, a new flow through diffusion system (FTDS) was developed by modifying a Bronaugh flow through diffusion cell with flow capacity in both the donor and receptor compartments and using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) as the analytical technique. FTDS can provide ‘real time’ quantitative high-density permeation data over time and is characterized by the simplicity of its use and the low cost of test samples. The in vitro <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>study</b> of dioxane across human skin showed that the absorption parameters of dioxane were 1. 16 ± 0. 22 hr, 5. 7 X 10 [superscript]- 4 ± (0. 62) cm/hr, 0. 286 ± 0. 035 mg/cm 2 /hr, 4. 8 X 10 - 5 (± 0. 32) cm[superscript] 2 /hr, and 1. 99 ± 0. 086 mg for lag time, permeability, steady-state flux, diffusivity, and total amount absorbed over 8 hr, respectively. The study of the effect of the surfactant sodium lauryl sulphate and solvent systems water, ethanol, propylene glycol, and ethyl acetate on permeation profiles revealed that these solvents and surfactants increased the permeation of dioxane significantly. The FT-IR spectra of stratum corneum treated with solvents showed that there was broadening of the CH[subscript] 2 asymmetric stretching vibration of the CH[subscript] 2 peak near 2920 cm[superscript]- 1 only in samples treated with ethanol.

30|$|Terrestrial life {{stages of}} {{amphibians}} {{may be more}} sensitive to chemicals than other vertebrate species due to the particular properties and functions of their skin. In accordance with limited literature data, these studies have demonstrated that amphibian skin may be significantly more permeable to chemicals than mammalian skin. Increased permeability of amphibian skin compared to mammalian may be attributed to biochemical and structural skin differences. Thus, dermal exposure to environmental contaminants can be a relevant route of exposure for amphibians. So far, no guidelines exist to investigate dermal uptake of chemicals across amphibian skin. The present work has shown that the <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> in vitro method according to OECD guideline 428 may be successfully adapted to the skin of the amphibian X. laevis, providing the basis for further investigations. However, further investigations are needed to assess whether X. laevis {{can be used as a}} representative model system for other species, too. Prospective work should evaluate species differences including morphological investigations of different skin sites in parallel to <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>studies.</b> Besides structural aspects of the skin, physico-chemical properties should be examined as factors influencing <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> by collecting comparable permeability data of different types of chemicals.

It is based on the ‘scientific opinion on the science behind the revision of the guidance document on dermal absorption’ issued in 2011 by the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR). The guidance refers to the EFSA PPR opinion in many instances. In addition, the first version of this guidance, issued in 2012 by the EFSA PPR Panel, has been revised in 2017 on the basis of new available data on human in vitro <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> for PPPs and wherever clarifications were needed.

40|$|AbstractDermal {{absorption}} {{is a key}} parameter in non-dietary human safety assessments for agrochemicals. Conservative {{default values}} and other criteria in the EFSA guidance have substantially increased generation of product-specific in vitro data and in some cases, in vivo data. Therefore, data from 190 GLP- and OECD guideline-compliant human in vitro <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>studies</b> were published, suggesting EFSA defaults and criteria should be revised (Aggarwal et al., 2014). This follow-up article presents data from an additional 171 studies and also the combined dataset. Collectively, the data provide consistent and compelling evidence for revision of EFSA’s guidance. This assessment covers 152 agrochemicals, 19 formulation types and representative ranges of spray concentrations. The analysis used EFSA’s worst-case <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> definition (i. e., an entire skin residue, except for surface layers of stratum corneum, is absorbed). It confirmed previously proposed default values of 6 % for liquid and 2 % for solid concentrates, irrespective of active substance loading, and 30 % for all spray dilutions, irrespective of formulation type. For concentrates, absorption from solvent-based formulations provided reliable read-across for other formulation types, as did water-based products for solid concentrates. The combined dataset confirmed that absorption does not increase linearly beyond a 5 -fold increase in dilution. Finally, despite using EFSA’s worst-case definition for absorption, a rationale for routinely excluding the entire stratum corneum residue, and ideally the entire epidermal residue in in vitro studies, is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{requirements for the}} registration of pesticides are mainly evolved from concern about dietary exposure and risk, i. e. chronic oral exposure. Pesticide workers, however, are predominantly exposed dermally and intermittently. The present critique provides suggestions for improvement of toxicity studies to refine the risk assessment of pesticide workers. In this respect it is considered of utmost importance that toxicity studies (either toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic) should be tuned towards the anticipated exposure scenario. Apart from suggestions for improvement of dermal toxicokinetic and dynamic studies, recommendations for further research and guidance are given, amongst which the request {{for information on the}} robustness of in vitro <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>studies</b> and guidance on how to use these data. With respect to the intermittent exposure of pesticide workers it is recognised that both information on the anticipated exposure scenario as well as knowledge on the effect of intermittent exposure on the toxicity are needed. From a toxicological point of view, the setting of more than one Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL), covering effects that may arise after different periods of exposure, as well as the development of more robust acute and short term studies are strongly recommended. © 2001 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

In vitro flow-through cells offer a con-venient method for the <b>study</b> of <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> that is relevant to the initial processes of <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption.</b> This <b>study</b> describes a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model devel-oped to simulate the absorption of organophosphate pesticides, such as parathion, fenthion, and methyl parathion through porcine skin with flow-through cells. Parameters related to the structure of the stratum corneum and solvent evaporation rates were independently estimated. Three parameters were optimized based on experimental <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> data, including solvent evaporation rate, diffusivity, and a mass transfer factor. Diffusion cell studies were conducted to validate the model under a variety of conditions, including different dose ranges (6. 3 – 106. 9 lg/cm 2 for parathion; 0. 8 – 23. 6 lg/cm 2 for fenthion; 1. 6 – 39. 3 lg/cm 2 for methyl parathion), different solvents (ethanol, 2 -propanol and acetone), different solvent volumes (5 – 120 ll for ethanol; 20 – 80 ll for 2 -propanol and acetone), occlusion versus open to atmosphere dosing, and corneocyte removal by tape-stripping.

Currently, the most popular approach for the analysis of skin and fluid samples is LC coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). However, this technique is largely affected by sample matrix interferences that heavily affect quantitative evaluation. LC-Direct-EI-MS is not affected by matrix interference and produces accurate quantitative data {{in a wide range of}} concentrations. Trans-cinnamaldehyde was chosen as test substance and applied in a suitable dosing vehicle on dermatomed human skin sections.

On column limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantitation (LOQ) of 0. 1 and 0. 5 ng/μL, respectively, were achieved. Calibration showed satisfactory linearity and precision for the concentration range of interest. Matrix effects (ME) were evaluated for all sample types, demonstrating the absence of both signal enhancement and signal suppression.

The model compounds (caffeine and benzoic acid), and the surrogate compounds (chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos and phorate) were generally found to be poor marker chemicals for comparison with HD absorption through human and pig skin in vitro.

No differences were observed between absorption of neat HD and HD in IPA in terms of percentage of applied dose absorbed at 24 hours. Absorption of HD through full thickness pig skin more closely matched absorption through full thickness human skin, split thickness pig skin overestimated absorption of HD in vitro in comparison. ‘Everyday’ clothing (cotton shirt) significantly reduced absorption of dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos and HD through human skin. Chemicals were applied to clothed skin in IPA to mimic finite exposure, and left in contact for 30 minutes (dichlorvos), 4 hours (chlorpyrifos), and 1 hour (HD). For all chemicals, removal of clothing followed by immediate skin surface decontamination with 0. 5 % (v/v) soap solution further reduced absorption compared with removal of clothing alone. Despite these differences not being significant, in terms or civilian exposure, it would be recommended to remove clothing and decontaminate as early as possible postexposure to minimise the potential for <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> and localised toxicity within the skin.

The extent {{and significance of}} <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> of eight petroleum substances, representing different classes of hydrocarbons, was evaluated. Literature data on the steady-state flux and permeability coefficient of these substances were evaluated and compared to those predicted by mathematical models. Reported results spanned over 5 - 6 orders of magnitude and were largely dependent on experimental conditions in particular {{on the type of}} the vehicle used. In general, aromatic hydrocarbons showed higher <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> than more lipophilic aliphatics with similar molecular weight. The results showed high variation and were largely influenced by experimental conditions emphasizing the need of performing the experiments under "in use" scenario. The predictive models overestimated experimental absorption. The overall conclusion is that, based on the observed percutaneous penetration data, dermal exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, even of aromatics with highest <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> is limited and highly unlikely to be associated with health risks under real use scenario...|$|R

40|$|To the Editor: In their {{interesting}} Case Report about {{a single}} and unintentional exposure of leg skin to metallic mer-cury in an 18 -year-old man, De Capitani et al. 1 state – in the Abstract section- that “Urinary mercury 36 h after contact was 5. 9 μg/L, and {{one week later}} 19. 6 μg/L, indicating <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption.</b> ” We think that their case report deserves comment on several points. First, {{the authors argue that}} the slight elevated urinary mercury concentration is due to transdermal absorption of metallic mercury through his leg skin. Although metallic mercury absorption through the skin can occur in humans, the rates of elemental mer-cury <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> is approximately 2. 2 percent of the uptake quantity in the lungs. ...|$|R
