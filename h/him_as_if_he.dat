25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is still alive. One evening, {{as she is}} {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from {{when she was a}} small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E
500|$|According to Jazz Police, Taborn is [...] "basically shy" [...] and {{prefers to}} [...] "let his music do the talking", {{which is why}} he [...] "doesnt have, or want, his own website". He also has a minimal social media {{presence}} and controls all of his US bookings personally. Some of his friends told The New York Times author of a 2017 profile piece on Taborn [...] "how relieved they were that someone, at last, was profiling <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were being forced out of hiding".|$|E
500|$|Barrow {{was known}} as [...] "Uncle Egbert" [...] to his friends; {{according}} to writer Tom Meany, Babe Ruth referred to him as [...] "Barrows," [...] treating <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were [...] "a butler in an English drawing room comedy." [...] He resided in Rye, New York. He first married in 1898, but did not discuss it in any of his writings. His second marriage was to Fannie Taylor Briggs in January 1912; he raised her five-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, Audrey, as his own daughter.|$|E

5000|$|A cute boy who {{is often}} mistaken to be a girl. Has {{a crush on}} Nozomi. He goes to the same school as Arahata.And he is embarrassed that all guys looks at <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> a girl that's why he wants to become the ideal man.|$|R
500|$|Balzac {{sought to}} present his {{characters}} as real people, neither fully good nor fully evil, but completely human. [...] "To arrive at the truth", {{he wrote in the}} preface to Le Lys dans la vallée, [...] "writers use whatever literary device seems capable of giving the greatest intensity of life to their characters". [...] "Balzac's characters", Robb notes, [...] "were as real to <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were observing them in the outside world". This reality was noted by playwright Oscar Wilde, who said: [...] "One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of [...] Lucien de Rubempré.... It haunts me in my moments of pleasure. I remember it when I laugh".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, Crosetti {{discusses}} with Lewis various {{conspiracy theories}} about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the 16thpresident of the United States. Crosetti disputes the accepted theory that actor John Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln and instead theorizes that Jefferson Davis, {{the president of the}} Confederate States of America, organized the murder. Crosetti's assassination theories about Lincoln would be a recurring theme {{throughout the rest of the}} first season. Crosetti's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana's real-life obsession with it. During an early scene in which a suspect tries lying to Munch, the detective berates the suspect for treating <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were Montel Williams instead of Larry King. King is a long-time television journalist and host of CNN's Larry King Live, whereas Williams is a more tabloid-style television show host. Williams is also a Baltimore native, which becomes a point of discussion between Munch and Bolander. Munch tells a lying suspect that his false story has an [...] "Elmore Leonard quality", a reference to an American novelist and screenwriter.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk about <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E
60|$|The detective eyed <b>him</b> thoughtfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{hunting for}} {{the answer to a}} riddle.|$|R
60|$|They {{talked of}} <b>him</b> strangely, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were absent or had not ears to hear.|$|R

500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello". [...] "Once, words just seemed to flow out of <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> couldn't help himself", Sanneh wrote. [...] "Now it's clearer than ever that he's choosing them carefully." [...] Louis Pattison of NME was more critical and called it a regression from the [...] "slightly bloated" [...] Kingdom Come, lamenting the shortage of [...] "don't-give-a-fuck attitude" [...] highlighted on [...] "Success" [...] in favor of less effective raps exploiting Jay-Z's entrepreneurial personage. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Say Hello" [...] and [...] "Blue Magic" [...] as highlights while humorously using sampled film dialogue from the latter track to frame his lukewarm opinion of the album: [...] "Jay-Z, that's a brand name, like Pepsi, that's a brand name – he stands behind it, he guarantees it, even if you don't know him {{any more than you}} know the chairman of Universal Music".|$|E
500|$|Little else is {{recorded}} about Ealdorman Ælfhelm's career before his death. Notice of the latter, with the blinding {{of his two}} sons, comes in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which related under the year 1006:In this year Archbishop Ælfric died and Bishop Ælfheah succeeded him to the archiepiscopal see. In the same year Wulfgeat was deprived of all his property, and Wulfheah and Ufegeat were blinded and Ealdorman Ælfhelm killed. The Worcester Chronicle, which for this period consists of entries taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle supplemented with extra information, gives an expanded saga-like version of this account, attributing Ælfhelm's death to Eadric Streona:The crafty and treacherous Eadric Streona, plotting to deceive the noble ealdorman Ælfhelm, prepared a great feast for him at Shrewsbury at which, when he came as a guest, Eadric greeted <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were an intimate friend. But on {{the third or fourth}} day of the feast, when an ambush had been prepared, he took him into the wood to hunt. When all were busy with the hunt, one Godwine Porthund (which means the town dog) a Shrewsbury butcher, whom Eadric had dazzled long before with great gifts and many promises so that he might perpetrate the crime, suddenly leapt out from the ambush, and execrably slew the ealdorman Ælfhelm. After a short space of time his sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, were blinded, at King Æthelred’s command, at Cookham, where he himself was then staying. This material in the Worcester Chronicle seems to have been part of a lost saga about Eadric Streona, not extant but used by various surviving 11th- and 12th-century sources. Kapelle thought Ælfhelm's murder, conducted without King Æthelred's displeasure, was the result of suspect loyalty in the face of Scandinavian invasions.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking at <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent {{in such a way that}} it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

60|$|He was a sharp-looking man, {{tall and}} thin, with screwed-up {{eyes and a}} little red beard. The second day 'e came 'e was up here at this 'ere Cauliflower, having a pint o' beer and looking round at the chaps as he talked to the landlord. The odd thing was that men who'd never taken a hare or a {{pheasant}} in their lives could 'ardly meet 'is eye, while Bob Pretty stared at <b>'im</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>'e</b> was a wax-works.|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you doing, O'Grady?" [...] {{he broke}} off, as that officer walked {{round and round}} Terence, scrutinizing <b>him</b> attentively, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been some unknown animal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} proved inspirational to many budding {{scientists and}} engineers. Nimoy {{has said that}} many of them, on meeting him, were eager to show him their work and discuss it with <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a scientific peer, {{as opposed to an}} actor, photographer, and poet. His stock response in these situations was [...] "it certainly looks like you're headed in the right direction".|$|E
2500|$|Antonio Bonfini {{writes of}} Hunyadi's {{service in the}} retinue of one [...] "Francis Csanádi" [...] who [...] "became so fond of him that treated <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were his own son". Historian Engel {{identifies}} Francis Csanádi with Franko of Talovac, Ban of Severin who was also Ispán of Csanád County around 1432. Engel says that Hunyadi served in the Ban's retinue {{for at least one}} and a half years from around October 1434. A Vlach district of the Banate of Severin was mortgaged to Hunyadi in this period.|$|E
2500|$|When Iron Lad {{leaves the}} time period, {{he leaves the}} armor behind with the Vision's {{operating}} system activated. The exact details of the new Vision's personality and mental make-up varies from writer to writer. Some writers like Brian Michael Bendis (during the [...] "Collective" [...] storyline) and Ed Brubaker (during [...] "Captain America Reborn") write <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was the original Vision in a new body (or at least {{has access to the}} original Vision's memories), while other writers such as Allan Heinberg and Dan Slott write him as an entirely new character.|$|E

6000|$|... 'He {{often was}} kind to us,' said Berenger, impelled to speak as tenderly {{as he could}} of the enemy, who had {{certainly}} tortured <b>him,</b> but <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> loved <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Cronshaw {{looked at}} <b>him</b> slowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were turning the inquiry {{over in his}} mind, and before he {{answered}} rapped on the marble table {{with one of the}} saucers.|$|R
2500|$|According to 18th century writers, {{in parts}} of Scotland there was another ritual {{involving}} the oatmeal cake. The cake would be cut {{and one of the}} slices marked with charcoal. The slices would then be put in a bonnet and everyone would take one out while blindfolded. According to one writer, whoever got the marked piece would have to leap through the fire three times. According to another, those present would pretend to throw him into the fire and, for some time afterwards, they would speak of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were dead. This [...] "may embody a memory of actual human sacrifice", or it may have always been symbolic. A similar ritual (i.e. of pretending to burn someone in the fire) was practised at spring and summer bonfire festivals in other parts of Europe.|$|E
2500|$|According to some traditions, upon {{receiving}} {{his first}} revelations Muhammad was deeply distressed, but the spirit moved closer {{and told him}} that he had been chosen as a messenger of God. Muhammad returned home and was consoled and reassured by his wife Khadijah and her Christian cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal. Shia tradition, on the other hand, maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather welcomed <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been expecting him. The initial revelation was followed by a pause of three years during which Muhammad gave himself up further to prayers and spiritual practices. When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching: Your lord has not forsaken you nor does he hate [...] (Qur'an [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Oglethorpe {{continued}} {{to press the}} Spanish, trying to dislodge them from the island. A few days later, approaching a Spanish settlement on the south side, he learned of a French man who had deserted the British and gone to the Spanish. Worried that the deserter might report how small the British force was, Oglethorpe spread out his drummers, to make them sound {{as if they were}} accompanying a larger force. He wrote to the deserter, addressing <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a spy for the British, saying that the man just needed to continue his stories until Britain could send more men. The prisoner who was carrying the letter took it to the Spanish officers, as Oglethorpe had hoped and the Spanish promptly executed the Frenchmen. The timely arrival of British ships reinforced a misconception among the Spanish that British reinforcements were arriving. [...] The Spanish left St. Simons on 25 July, ending their last invasion of colonial Georgia.|$|E
6000|$|She {{moved away}} from <b>him,</b> backwards, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had given her a}} push. [...] "Ah, well, now you are reckless," [...] Mrs. Luna remarked, drawing out her ribbons before the mirror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Och! ye spalpeen!" [...] shouted Ted, flinging <b>him</b> off <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} a feather. Then, sinking back, he added, [...] "Come on; you'll not ketch me slaipin' again, me honey!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is the {{well-known}} Red Rover," [...] returned the other, dropping his voice, and casting a furtive look around <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> even <b>he</b> thought extraordinary caution was necessary in uttering the formidable name.|$|R
2500|$|Hyson {{debuted in}} Extreme Championship Wrestling in August 1996, and gained fame as [...] "Little" [...] Spike Dudley, {{as a part}} of the Dudley family. His in-ring persona was that of the [...] "runt" [...] of the family. His {{initials}} (LSD) and finishing move (a corner-running three-quarters facelock bulldog named the [...] "Acid Drop") were both drug references and, at times, he would stare at his hands waving in front of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were on a trip. He quickly gained the nickname [...] "The Giant Killer". A storyline with Bam Bam Bigelow saw him on the end of two pay-per-views defeats, however, at Hardcore Heaven and As Good as it Gets. In one memorable moment in not only Spike's career but in ECW history in general, Bam Bam Bigelow threw Spike from the ring, over the top rope, and into the crowd. The fans caught him and proceeded to body surf him around the ECW Arena. This incident was incorporated into the ECW TV introduction for years.|$|E
60|$|The King {{continued}} to stare at <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a human curiosity.|$|E

50|$|The Mexican fans loved Noguera's {{dribbling}} {{abilities and}} the press dubbed him the juggler. The newspapers published a cartoon of <b>him</b> flying <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had wings with many legs and several soccer balls.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am thankful!" [...] Mrs. Rouncewell {{is fond of}} her son but has a plaintive feeling towards <b>him,</b> much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were a very honourable {{soldier who}} had gone over to the enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what has}} happened?" [...] and Jim caught the excited barber by the coat collar, shaking <b>him</b> vigorously, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} by such energetic measures {{he might be}} restored to his scanty senses.|$|R
