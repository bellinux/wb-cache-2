5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish {{in a flash of}} light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E

25|$|In Zachman’s opinion, {{the single}} factor that makes his {{framework}} unique {{is that each}} element on either axis of the matrix is explicitly distinguishable <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> elements on that axis. The representations in each cell of the matrix are not merely successive levels of increasing detail, but actually are different representations — different in context, meaning, motivation, and use. Because each of the elements on either axis is explicitly different from the others, {{it is possible to}} define precisely what belongs in each cell.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, a graph may be {{embedded}} in space {{in such a}} way that, for each cycle in the graph, one can find a disk bounded by that cycle that does not cross any other feature of the graph. In this case, the cycle must be unlinked <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> cycles disjoint from it in the graph. The embedding is said to be flat if every cycle bounds a disk in this way. A flat embedding is necessarily linkless, but there may exist linkless embeddings that are not flat: for instance, if G is a graph formed by two disjoint cycles, and it is embedded to form the Whitehead link, then the embedding is linkless but not flat.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} no score was registered on the scoreboard. For {{half an hour}} gymnastics stole the screen <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> sports and even the adverts on Western TV stations were delayed. Deductions were taken in tenths by the judges, i.e. 0 if the judge thought the exercise was perfect, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc. The marks were 10 from the Bulgarian judge, 9.9 from the Czech judge, 9.8 from both the Soviet and Polish judges. With {{the top and bottom}} marks being discarded, and the remaining two being added together and then divided by two, this gave Nadia Comăneci a score of 9.85. This gave her a shared silver with Maxi Gnauck. Natalia Shaposhnikova finished 4th but would have shared a silver medal with them had she scored 0.05 extra.|$|E

25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential point in this approach {{is the assumption that}} the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to the determination of the effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E
25|$|Richard Owen {{presented}} several {{papers on}} the anatomical differences between apes and humans, arguing {{that they had been}} created separately and stressing the impossibility of apes being transmuted into men. In 1857 he went even further, presenting an authoritative paper to the Linnean Society of London on his anatomical studies of primate brains and asserting that humans were not merely a distinct biological order of primates, as had been accepted by great anatomists such as Carl Linnaeus and Georges Cuvier, but a separate sub-class of mammalia, distinct <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> primates and mammals generally. Owen supported his argument with a figure by himself of a South American monkey, a figure of a negro's brain by Friedrich Tiedemann, and of a chimpanzee's brain by Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Willem Vrolik.|$|E

This League has been launched by BCCI in 2007-08 and it received support <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Cricket Boards and International Players. The Players were selected via the auctions and drafted into the City-based Franchises. The first IPL season was held from 18 April 2008 to 1 June 2008 where underdogs Rajasthan Royals, led by Shane Warne, won the first title at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai Based on regional loyalties, the eight-team tournament brings a unique and popular team and player auction system hand-picking some of the best international players in the world and teaming them with Indian players, both domestic and international, in one arena. The total prize money for the IPL was $3 million. The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.|$|E

The win, though, was largely due to interference <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Knockouts who were lumberjacks. Frustrated at her lack of meaningful victories, Flash interrupted an interview with newcomer Hamada by voicing her frustration {{at the lack of}} fanfare her arrival in the company received in comparison to foreign Knockouts Sarita and Hamada. Flash then began to brawl with Hamada, throwing her down the bleachers of the empty arena. The two met weeks later on October 8 Impact! in an eight-woman elimination tag team match; when both were legal members in the ring they brawled out onto the floor until they were counted out and eliminated. The following week on Super Impact! the two met in a Falls Count Anywhere match which Flash lost after taking a moonsault from Hamada through a table. She finally scored an unassisted singles win on November 12 against Traci Brooks. After not being used by the company thereafter, Anderson requested her release which was granted on January 21, 2010. On March 14, 2011, at the tapings of the edition of March 17 of Impact!, Anderson, as Alissa Flash, made a one night return to TNA, unsuccessfully challenging Madison Rayne for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship as part of her open challenge series.

500|$|This {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith in 1934 as Pluteus michiganensis, based on collections made in Ann Arbor in October 1932. In the original description {{there is no}} mention of a volva at the base of the stipe, one of the morphological characters separating Pluteus from Volvopluteus. Smith did mention that [...] "the large spores are unusual for the genus Pluteus". The species then disappeared from the mycological literature of the 20th century and Smith did not include his own species when he revised the type collections of North American Pluteus. Morphological revision of the type and DNA sequence data (based on Internal transcribed spacer sequences) obtained from the collection confirmed that this taxon belongs in the genus Volvopluteus, and that it is a separate species <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of that genus.|$|E

Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the song {{four out of}} five stars and described it as a [...] "huge-hearted urbany piano ballad" [...] and compared it to [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] by Alicia Keys with a similar sound as the Keys song. In her review for Billboard, Megan Vick wrote: [...] "Over a breezy piano and vaguely hip-hop breakbeat, Mars professes his love for a beautiful girl who occupies his dreams [...] Mars pens lyrics that aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their own skin. With its steady, danceable pulse and singalong chorus, Mars has created a feel-good jam that should establish him as a solo contender in his own right." [...] Nima Baniamer from Contactmusic.com felt that [...] "there is nothing about the single that makes Bruno Mars stand out <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> RnB artists dominating the charts at the moment", and said, [...] "The song never builds to any climax and it simply falls a bit flat, coming across quite corny and cheesy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century, Bishop Thomas Beckington left {{much of his}} estate to the Vicars' Choral, {{enabling}} repairs to be carried out. The gardens {{in front of the}} houses were not part of the original scheme with the garden walls being added as part of this development. The walls are on average [...] {{from the front of the}} houses. He unified the appearance of the terraces including the installation of a single arch-braced and wind-braced trussed sloping roof around 1466. The chimney shafts were renewed and raised, possibly because of the introduction of coal as the fuel rather than wood. Each stack incorporates two heraldic shields and the upper sections of the stacks are octagonal. The shields are those of the Bishop, a beacon above tun, and the arms of his three executors; sugar loaves for Hugh Sugar, three swans for Richard Swan, and the talbot for John Pope. Many of the original windows were replaced in the 18th century. Shrewsbury House is architecturally different <b>from</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> buildings.
