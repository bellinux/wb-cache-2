I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the <b>free</b> <b>action</b> of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E

2500|$|Buddhism accepts both {{freedom and}} {{determinism}} (or {{something similar to}} it), {{but in spite of}} its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources. According to the Buddha, [...] "There is <b>free</b> <b>action,</b> there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [...] of those elements." [...] Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named pratitya-samutpada in Sanskrit, often translated as [...] "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called [...] "Conditioned Genesis" [...] or [...] "Dependent Origination". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not [...] "free" [...] to begin with. It is also part of the theory of karma in Buddhism. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's destiny in future lives.|$|E
2500|$|Non-causal {{accounts}} of incompatibilist free will {{do not require}} a <b>free</b> <b>action</b> {{to be caused by}} either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal {{accounts of}}ten claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition – a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm). Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom – intentional actions are rather self-generating. The [...] "actish feel" [...] of some intentional actions do not [...] "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they [...] "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, {{in the absence of any}} relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".
