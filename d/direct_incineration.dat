50|$|Molten salt {{oxidation}} is a non-flame, {{thermal process}} that destroys all organic materials while simultaneously retaining inorganic and hazardous {{components in the}} melt. It is used as either hazardous waste treatment(with air) or energy harvesting similar to coal and wood gasification(with steam).The molten salt of choice has been sodium carbonate (m.p 851°C), but other salts can be used. Sulfur, halogens, phosphorus and similar volatile pollutants are oxidized and retained in the melt. Most organic carbon content leaves as relatively pure CO//H2/H2O gas (depending on the feed conditions, whether steam or air is used), and the effluent only requires a cold trap and a mild aqueous wash (except mercury-containing wastes).

In addition, the ash produced by incineration or incomplete combustion processes (such as fluidized-bed dryers) may be difficult to use without subsequent treatment due to high heavy metal content; solutions to this include leaching of the ashes to remove heavy metals {{or in the case of}} ash produced in a complete-combustion process, or with biochar produced from a pyrolytic process, the heavy metals may be fixed in place and the ash material readily usable as a LEEDs preferred additive to concrete or asphalt.Examples of other ways to use dried sewage sludge as an energy resource include the Gate 5 Energy System, an innovative process to power a steam turbine using heat from burning milled and dried sewage sludge, or combining dried sewage sludge with coal in coal-fired power stations. In both cases this allows for production of electricity with less carbon-dioxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power stations.|$|R

So after a reconstruction of the economic situation, by considering all the costs and revenues, for both the possible energetic configurations the correspondence between the environmental convenience (that was evaluated in a previously work) and the economic convenience has been defined.

40|$|In {{order to}} define {{practical}} application conditions for thermal treatment of mixed solid wastes, the presented {{study has been}} conducted in order to describe the fundamental processes that occur during a gasification process, with the aim to construct a specific model for the gasification reactor. The model has been realized by using the tools of energy and mass balances and by considering a chemical gas phase homogeneous equilibrium; the governing equations under steady condition have been defined. In order to completely establish {{the set of the}} required equations, some assumption were made: the main concern solid residue composition formed only by inert material, no tar formation, very fast reaction kinetics, adiabatic conditions. Subsequently, {{on the basis of the}} above mentioned model, numerical simulations have been performed, and in particular we evaluated: • the change in the operating temperature and the performance parameters, syngas volume, Lower Heating Value (LHV), gasification yield (η), consequent to variation of the inlet air volume; • the change of the operative parameters as a consequence of the choice of a specific gasifying agent (air, dioxide carbon, oxygen and steam); • the change, with reference to pressure variation, of the parameters: air volume, flue gases volume, LHV and gasification yield (η). By considering gasification fundamental processes the above mentioned numerical simulation led to a comparison between the thermal gasification treatment and the usual <b>direct</b> combustion (<b>incineration)</b> operation. The first comparison aspect has been the environmental performance (quantity and quality of the generated flue gas in the two different systems, upstream and downstream of the flue gas treatment system), and it was conducted both on local (pollutant emission) and global scale (GHG formation).

Among other biodegradable polymers polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted researcher and industries attention for the production of plastic {{food packaging}}. In the present contribute we report a study to evaluate the degradability in compost of some representative examples of materials prepared with PLA and chitin nano-fibrils (NC). Since blending a biodegradable polymer with an active compound might hinder the compost ability of the materials produced, it is important to perform test of degradability on innovative materials even if based on biobased and biodegradable components.

The effect of the equivalence ratio (ER), reaction temperature, and moisture content on MSW conversion is studied. A rising ER increases the syngas yield but decreases the syngas heating value. The combustible gas yield is strengthened at lower ERs and later drops when the ER exceeds 0. 4 {{as a result of}} the continuously enhanced oxidation reactions. A higher temperature favors pyrolysis reactions but causes an evident decrease in the syngas heating value during gasification. When the ER is at 0. 4 and the temperature is at 650 degrees C, an optimum operating performance is obtained under the specific input simulated MSW (S-MSW) and test conditions, with an energy conversion efficiency of 68. 5 %. Under such a circumstance, the further increase of the MSW moisture content is effective for stimulating H- 2 production; nevertheless, the quality of syngas degrades, and the energy conversion efficiency declines.

40|$|Significant {{efforts have}} been direct towards {{developing}} environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial treatment of olive mill wastes. Recently, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) {{has been shown to}} be a potentially beneficial approach for the treatment of olive mill wastes. When considering the use of HTC to treat these wastes, however, it is critical that its environmental implications be evaluated and subsequently compared to other commonly used treatment approaches. In this study, the environmental impacts associated with using HTC to treat olive mill wastes were evaluated and compared to aerobic composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration using life cycle assessment. Results indicate that HTC coupled with subsequent energy recovery from the combustion of the generated hydrochar results in net environmental benefits and that the energy offsets derived from electricity production from hydrochar combustion are critical to achieving these savings. In addition, results indicate that HTC process water discharge significantly influences system environmental impacts, indicating that research investigating treatment alternatives is needed. Changes in carbonization temperature and hydrochar moisture content also influence system environmental impact, suggesting that both are important when considering possible industrial applications. In comparison with current management approaches, alternatives using HTC are more environmental advantageous than composting and anaerobic digestion. However, the use of HTC is not as environmentally advantageous as incineration with energy recovery because 45 - 35 % of the energy contained in the olive mill waste is lost during HTC. However, if the electricity recovery efficiency from incineration increases to greater than 30 %, the environmental impacts associated with HTC and subsequent energy generation are equal to or better than <b>direct</b> TPOWM <b>incineration</b> with energy recovery. It is recommended that future research efforts focus on the evaluation of appropriate and environmentally beneficial HTC process water treatment approaches and methods to improve the energetic retention efficiencies of the hydrochar.

On the other hand, municipal solid waste (MSW) generation is greatly increasing globally and causing environmental burden. Using RDF as an alternative fuel in cement kilns saves fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum coke and reduces GHG emissions. The fly ash and bottom ash from incineration of RDF {{can be used as}} alternative raw materials for cement production. China has some policies to promote and regulate co-processing of MSW in cement kilns. “Notice on carrying out the pilot work of co-processing of MSW in cement kilns” (Joint section of Industry and Information Office No. 28, 2015) aims to develop available technologies through study on six pilot projects in China before co-processing of MSW in cement kilns is promoted in the whole country. Later Guizhou province was selected as the pilot province for co-processing of MSW in cement kilns and eight projects in Guizhou were chosen to be pilot projects. In “Technical policy for pollution control on co-processing of solid waste in cement kilns” (Ministry of Environmental Protection, Notice No. 72, 2016), co-processing of MSW is seen as an important supplementary technology for incineration and landfill. In China, Conch, Jinyu and Huaxin are primary leading companies in co-processing of MSW in cement kilns. Conch’s technology treats shredded MSW in gasification furnace and transports flammable gases from the furnace to the cement kiln for further incineration. Huaxin produces RDF in pretreatment plants and uses RDF in cement kilns.

If all cement plants in China use RDF and the share of heat provided by RDF is similar to that in the example plant, 307 million tonnes of MSW per year would be directed from landfills to RDF production and 138 million tonnes of RDF would be used in cement kilns.

These processes present the very important positive aspect to lead to a correct management for the disposal problem; {{at the same time they}} can represent an useful energy source. From this point of view it is important to consider that, in opposition to the continuously increasing difficulty to generate energy from traditional fossil sources, the possibility to obtain energy from biomass (as for example from the sewage sludge), represents an interesting tool both for the reason that this source is certainly renewable and corresponding to the directives of the Kyoto protocol, and also for economical aspects (in fact the energy that is derived from traditional sources presents an always increasing cost). On the basis of these considerations the aim of the present work is the individuation of the optimal solution (in particular with a thermal treatment approach), for the correct disposal of the sewage sludge deriving from wastewater treatment, with particular reference to a specific large-scale example.

In this report apple juice producing process and organic waste from juice productionin Uzbekistan were overviewed. Two juice processing plants of Uzbekistan “Bagat-Sharbat”and “Meva” and their generated organic waste were overviewed. Also different treatment methods of organic waste and their advantages anddisadvantages were analyzed and compared with anaerobic fermentation process. The studiedorganic waste management methods are animal feeding, <b>incineration,</b> <b>direct</b> land spreading,land filling, composting and anaerobic fermentation. Anaerobic fermentation of organic wastegenerated from fruit juice production was studied. Suggestions and recommendations were done to implement organic wastemanagement for fruit juice industry in Uzbekistan according to studies and calculations. Advantages and disadvantages of different waste management methods are discussedand compared with anaerobic fermentation. Economical and environmental calculations ofanaerobic fermentation process were done. Different biogas plant types all over the world andtheir construction costs were studied and compared. According to studies and calculationsseveral suggestions and recommendations are made. By studying and comparing different waste treatment methods with anaerobic digestion oforganic waste from juice plants following conclusions are made: The benefits of the biogas plant on the fruit juice plant: • Solution of the organic waste-disposal problems • Reduction of obnoxious smells from the organic wastes • Own, stable, self-sufficient energy production (heat, steam and electricity) • Cheap energy, which yields financial savings in the longer term. • Possibility of selling energy or biogas surplus - a source of extra income forthe plant. • Production of high-volume fertiliser that carries a higher content of nitrogen(15 % or more) than artificial fertilisers, and that does not burn the crops, asuntreated slurry can do. This reduces the need for expensive artificialfertilisers. By selling this natural fertiliser additional income for the plant canbe obtained. Local benefits: • Better control of the waste from fruit juice processing organic waste meansless pollution of local environment and water sources. • Removal of chemical fertilisers from the fields and recirculation of nutrients. • Local power plants contribute to creating permanent local jobs in the area. On a global additional, replacing fossil fuels to biogas reduces emissions of CO 2.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{developed in the}} present thesis deals with the upgrading of moist agroindustrial wastes by torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization for their subsequent use as bioenergy feedstocks in industrial and domestic systems. The Mediterranean region concentrates the main producer countries of olive oil, canned foodstuffs and juices worldwide, and thus produces large amounts of moist agroindustrial wastes needing suitable management treatments. Unfortunately, their use in energy applications is not directly an efficient option, since this kind of wastes present moisture contents higher than 65 % and low energy density. Therefore, the main objective of the present work is to convert moist agroindustrial wastes in profitable materials {{that can be used}} in energy purposes. Low temperature treatments such as torrefaction (TF) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) were selected in order to maximize the solid recovery and minimize energy requirements and costs. On the one hand, torrefaction of olive mill waste was studied. On the other, hydrothermal carbonization of olive mill waste, artichoke wastes and orange juice wastes was studied as a potential alternative to dry treatments. Through these investigations, it was possible to bear out that HTC is more energy beneficial to treat moist agroindustrial wastes than TF, leading to energy savings up to 50 %. Then, since HTC was considered more appropriate than TF to manage this kind of wastes, following investigations were focused on a deeply study of the HTC process, hydrochar properties and its use in possible energy applications. The effect of lipids on the HTC process and hydrochar properties was studied and it was found that lipids, which mainly remain on the hydrochar, improve the hydrophobicity of the solid and thus reduce its moisture content, decreasing the total energy requirements of the global low temperature upgrading process. In addition, it was found that lipids retain antimicrobial liposoluble substances on the solid and thus improve the biodegradability of the HTC-liquor. Then, it was concluded that, although HTC is an effective treatment regardless the lipids loading, HTC is energetically and enviromentally more advantageous as the amount of lipids contained in the raw wastes increases. When considering the use of hydrochars as renewable fuels for both industrial and domestic applications, ashes behaviour and related emissions are important concerns. To improve ash fusibility characteristics of hydrochars, the composition of their ashes was modified with rice hulls and/or mineral additives. It was found that rice hulls and kaolin are able to increase the hydrochar ash fusion characteristic temperatures to values higher than 1500 ºC. The high cost of kaolin could limit its application. Thus, rice hulls were considered the best option among the additives studied, since consisting of a waste, allows reaching economic and sustainability criteria. Emissions associated with the combustion of hydrochars were assessed and compared with those associated with raw materials, torrefied materials (TF-chars) and conventional fuels (i. e., anthracite and wood). Experiments were conducted in both a lab-scale furnace and a commercial domestic pellet stove. Lab-scale experiments showed that hydrochar and TF-char lead to 40 % lower emissions of light hydrocarbons but 50 % higher emissions of SVOCs and PAHs than OMW. As compared with conventional fuels emissions of hydrochar and TF-chars were substantially higher than those associated with anthracite, whereas the toxicity factor of hydrochar was similar to that of wood. Experiments conducted in the domestic pellet stove showed that the toxicity associated with hydrochar was very similar to that of OMW, although it duplicated that of wood pellets. Hence, it is mandatory to ensure good combustion conditions to avoid the release of toxic compounds to the environment. Finally, the life cycle analysis (LCA) of HTC coupled with energy recovery from the hydrochar was conducted to determine its environmental implications and compare them with the impacts associated with current management options. Results indicated that HTC and subsequent energy generation is more beneficial than biological treatments. However, this scenario was less advantageous than <b>direct</b> <b>incineration,</b> due to the energy losses that occur during HTC and the discharge of HTC-liquor to the environment. Thus, it is recommended that future research efforts focus on the evaluation of appropriate HTC-liquor treatments and methods to improve the energy retention efficiencies of the hydrochar...|$|E
40|$|The {{national}} and international situation for the definition of integrated systems for the treatment and the final destination of solid wastes presents, today, a significant affirmation of separate collection system aimed {{to the creation of}} processes and plants for the reuse and production of secondary materials. Downstream of this, there is, anyway, an important flow of waste that is collected without differentiation; to this flux the rejects deriving from the recycle operations must necessarily be added, and for this resulting flux it is necessary to individuate suitable prospects for disposal. This obtained flow in comparison with the gross waste production is a large percentage; {{from the point of view}} of quality, it has a composition deprived of the fractions that more easily can be recovered (metal, glass, organic waste find an appropriate valorization after upstream pre - selection), and it can be considered as constituted of a dry combustible fraction, a wet organic fraction and a substantially inert mineral fraction. In account of the composition and also of the ever increasing interest for the production of energy from non fossil sources, this fraction must be sent to an energetic valorization (by using direct combustion systems, in traditional incineration, or by using innovative systems of gasification); the purpose of this destination relies in the possibility, together with a convenient disposal, to simultaneously produce sustainable energy to be used in the individuated area. On the basis of this general perspective the aim of this work is a careful analysis of the thermal treatment systems for municipal solid wastes, but also for other matrices such as, in particular, biomasses (chiefly wood biomasses) and sludges deriving from wastewater treatment plant, that can also be considered for thermal use. The study is aimed to the analysis both of conventional thermal treatments (<b>direct</b> combustion in <b>incineration</b> plant) and also innovative solutions (especially gasification plants). For this purpose, after a thorough analysis of the scientific literature that allowed the reconstruction of a solid theoretical and technological reference base, and also a careful analysis of the practical real scale implementation state of the art, the different technologies for thermal treatment have been were analyzed in detail, both from an analytical and from an experimental point of view. From the point of view of the conventional, more diffused, thermal technologies we evaluated the performances and environmental effects of these treatments on the three different types of materials. In order to define plant conditions, effects on the quality of receiving context and environmental impact, an analysis of each realization has been performed from the operating scheme until to the environmental effects: the used tools were, in succession, the mass and energy balances to define the plant operating conditions, the tool of externalities and the application of different pollutant dispersion models (ISC 3 Short Term and SPRAY) to establish air quality modifications. For a correct mass balance definition, in some cases a deeper knowledge of the original treated material was required, and in these cases it has been necessary to perform laboratory tests (by using analysis instruments as the Mahler bomb calorimeter, the ionic spectrophotometer and more in general by using the instrument of titration). A different approach was required to study innovative technologies, gasification in particular. In this case, in the lack of enough informations about the process parameters, we developed a predictive calculation model, that is based on the evaluation of the mass and energy balances and the chemical homogeneous gas phase equilibria able to regulate the development of the process. This model allows to estimate the quantitative and qualitative production of the syngas, and from this the energy yield of the process. We tested the model by considering a feed composed by MSW (municipal solid waste) and an RDF (refuse derived fuel) alimentation. We also evaluated the effects on results of different qualities of gasifying agent (air, air enriched with oxygen, air enriched with carbon dioxide and air enriched with steam). On the basis of the calculated results and also taking into account the general informations about the more consolidated conventional technologies we have also conducted a comparison, from energetic, environmental and economic point of view, between traditional and innovative thermal treatments. By taking also in account the real possibilities of implementation of these systems, in the final chapter we conducted a comparison among scenarios of waste management dedicated to residual wastes with and without a specific downstream separation stage that, with a mechanical separation, is able to produce three flows: a dry combustible flow, a wet organic flow and an inert flow, with different destinations. On the basis of the so indicated general scheme of the thesis, in the following we report the most important aspects of the obtained results: • through the reconstructed study of performances and a careful literature analysis, it was possible to arrive to a general and full bibliographic review concerning thermal treatments; • from a point of view of the more conventional incineration processes: o a preliminary and operative scheme has been defined as concerns the choice and the verification of the correct technology for thermal treatment of MSW; o it has been constructed and assessed an evaluation procedure able to define the environmental compatibility of biomass and other plants; o a laboratory system of definition of the characteristics of the treated waste in some cases has been considered as convenient and propositive (as for example the definition of the chlorine content in sewage sludge); this aspect can be considered as an important step in the definition of planning the plant scheme. • from a point of view of the innovative processes (in particular gasification) we developed and verified a predictive calculation model for the gasification process; • from a point of view of the comparison between traditional and innovative processes the main differences among the systems have been estimated by analyzed analytical laboratory tests and mass and energy balances; • from the point of view of the comparison between completely thermal scenarios for waste management and scenarios where also MBT procedures are considered it was individuated a procedure for the evaluation and the comparison of these scenarios from the point of view of the environmental impact and also with the aim of the evaluation of the economic aspect...|$|R
