The estimates point towards greater <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> between countries with good control of corruption. Moreover, if control of corruption in the destination country improves, <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> from cleaner countries rise more than they do from countries with a higher incidence of corruption. The resulting changes in composition of investment volumes towards more investment from cleaner countries may further reinforce the strengthening of economic and political institutions that keep corruption in check...|$|R

Besides North-South <b>investment</b> <b>flows,</b> there is an unprecedented rise of South-North and South-South <b>investment</b> <b>flows.</b> Beyond spectacular acquisitions made in several industries in the United States by Lenovo (PC division of IBM) or in Europe by Zhejiang Geely (Volvo) and Tata (Corus, Jaguar and Land Rover), South-North and more specifically South-South <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> are protean, can rely {{on a variety of}} expansion modes and concern SMEs as well as ‘emerging multinationals’. The development of these new routes for international expansion opens unique research perspectives. Such a research window opens seldom. The last one dates back to the 1990 ’s with the start of the transition process in China and ex-soviet countries, which was followed by an unprecedented rise of North-South <b>investments</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> towards emerging countries. This opening of emerging and transition countries has largely contributed to the success of {{research on}} international expansion strategies.

There, too, big eats little. There, too, the small man is more and more manifestly {{at the mercy of the}} large organization. It was a pleasant illusion of the Victorian time that one put one's hundred pounds or thousand pounds [...] "into something," [...] beside the rich man's tens of thousands, and drew one's secure and satisfying dividends. The intelligent reader of Mr. Lawson's Frenzied Finance or of the bankruptcy proceedings of Mr. Hooley realizes this idyll is scarcely true to nature. Through the seas and shallows of <b>investment</b> <b>flow</b> great tides and depressions, on which the big fortunes ride to harbour while the little accumulations, capsized and swamped, quiver down to the bottom.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of foreign <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> {{is important for}} emerging market policy makers, since such flows make up a considerable part of the balance of payments, and since such flows {{tend to be very}} volatile. Sudden stops or reversals of <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> have, indeed, played an important part in recent emerging market crises. This paper presents a study of emerging market <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> and their determinants. Using first a relatively simple cross-country framework to study <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> in the year 2000 and then a panel-data framework to study such flows for the time period 1980 to 1997, a number of variables emerge as significant in determining <b>investment</b> <b>flows.</b> In general, large open economies with a high growth rate attract more flows than small closed economies with a sluggish growth rate. In addition, the results suggest that sound fiscal policies together with moderate debt levels results in higher levels of foreign investment. The business cycle in the developed countries also has an impact on such flows. Foreign direct investment; portfolio investment; developing countries...|$|R

40|$|China {{has emerged}} as one of the top {{recipients}} of foreign direct investment in the world. Meanwhile, the successful transition experience of many Central and Eastern European countries has also allowed them to attract an increasing share of global foreign direct investment. In this paper, the authors use a panel data set to investigate whether foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> to these two regions are complements, substitutes, or independent of each other. Taking into account the role of host country characteristics - such as market size, degree of trade liberalization, and human capital - the authors find no evidence that foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> to one region are at the expense of those to the other. Instead, the results suggest that foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> are driven by distinct regional production networks (and thus are largely independent of each other) and the development of global supply chains (indicating that foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> are complementary).

No doubt SADC countries face major obstacles to achieving greater investment levels and as such, the paper looks at the major constraints within SADC in attracting sustainable FDI flows, and the reasons behind the slow growth in domestic investment within those SADC economies. Case studies are employed to illustrate the key issues at the micro-level that affect investment decisions in the SADC. In the final part of the paper a discussion follows on some of the policy conclusion that are derived from the analysis of foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>flows</b> in the SADC region.

We distinguish between the effects of the stock of R&D and the <b>investment</b> <b>flow.</b> The short run effect of changes in the stock of R&Don labor demand are quite distinct from the behavior observed along the intertemporal path. Along the path increases in the R&D investment rate must be accompanied by an increase in the labor requirement per unitof R&D.

Finally, our model provides a framework to justify the empirically observed positive relationship between the utilization and the P&E investment rates. ...|$|E
