25|$|The Jews {{damn near}} owned all of Germany {{prior to the}} war. That's why Hitler came in. He {{was going to make}} damn sure that the Jews didn't take over Germany, or even Europe. That's why he fried six million of those <b>guys,</b> <b>you</b> know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. And look what they're doing now, they're killing people in Arab countries.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those <b>guys.</b> <b>You</b> write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who all sat around the conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene of}} Sniper Wolf {{wounding}} Meryl {{to set a}} trap for Snake was included among the top ten cutscenes in the Metal Gear series by Jeremy M. Loss of Joystick Division in 2010 and ranked as the seventh most shocking surprise in video games ("subverting the power fantasy") by George Reith of GamingBolt in 2012. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole noted how the [...] "brillantly manipulative" [...] Metal Gear Solid can make the player feel guilty, even as [...] "it {{makes no sense to}} wish that you hadn't killed Sniper Wolf — that is, [...] properly to regret your actions — because it is a task that the game demands be fulfilled before you can progress." [...] In 2012, Ryan King of PLAY included the character of Sniper Wolf among the six [...] "things you didn’t want to kill (but you did anyway)" [...] and Ian Dransfield from the same magazine included her among the top [...] "bad <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> wanted to win". In 2015, Aleksander Gilyadov from VentureBeat included Sniper Wolf's death among six most memorable Metal Gear moments opining it [...] "still remains {{as one of the most}} poignant and beautiful scenes in the entire series. It also displays just how multilayered, benign, and well-written Kojima’s characters (both heroes and villains) really are." [...] That same year, Javy Gwaltney from Paste had this scene top his list of the saddest moments in Metal Gear.|$|E
2500|$|Dallas {{reporter}} Tony Zoppi, {{who knew}} Ruby well, claimed that one [...] "would {{have to be}} crazy" [...] to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he [...] "couldn't keep a secret for five minutes… Jack {{was one of the}} most talkative <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> would ever meet. He'd be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, because he just plain talked too much."

2500|$|Former {{president}} of Starday Records Don Pierce told director Mark Hall in 1989 another story about Jones after Pappy Daily bailed {{him out of}} the drunk tank and got him a gig in Houston for $2,500. [...] The next day Jones came to Dailey's office broke again. [...] According to Pierce, an irritated Dailey said, [...] "Well, George, you just made $2,500 but I talked to some of the <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> were out partying with and they said you went and flushed it down the toilet." [...] "Pappy, that's a damn lie!" [...] Jones shot back. [...] "It wasn't but $1,200." [...] Jones explained to Country Weekly in his last ever interview two months before his death, [...] "I started on Cokes and it just got the best of me.

2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad <b>guys,</b> <b>you</b> set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{development}} of the game, Robert Kirkman and the comic publisher Skybound Entertainment worked with Telltale. According to Kirkman, he had previously played Telltale's Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, and felt that they [...] "were more focused on telling a good story, and I thought they were good at engaging the player in the narrative." [...] Telltale approached him with a proposal which, according to Kirkman, [...] "involved decision-making and consequences rather than ammunition gathering or jumping over things." [...] The proposal's emphasis on the survival aspect of the comics, {{and the need for}} the player to make choices between two bad options sold him on the project. Since then, Kirkman became involved with Telltale, mostly providing oversight on what aspects of the story were appropriate components of The Walking Dead universe, in much the same manner as he does for the television show, staying out of the direct development process. Dan Connors, CEO of Telltale, stated that working with Kirkman made it easier for Telltale to craft its story and introduce new characters, instead of having to work with those already established in the comic. One of the few demands Kirkman asked of Telltale was to avoid telling anything involved with the comic's main character, Rick Grimes, as Kirkman has stated long-term plans with the character in other media. Kirkman had not been impressed with an early build of the first episode, but by the time they had presented him with a near-final build, Kirkman told the Telltale team, [...] "Holy shit <b>guys,</b> <b>you</b> did it", according to the game's co-lead developer Jake Rodkin.|$|E

50|$|Goober {{is known}} for his (bad) {{impressions}} of celebrities. He impersonates Cary Grant ("Judy, Judy, Judy!") and Edward G.

He could also impersonate Chester Goode's walk from Gunsmoke and perform lame schtick such as simulating sewing up his fingers. The only people who were truly impressed by his talents were his cousin Gomer and the fun girls, Daphne and Skippy. He had a penchant for Super-Hero and monster comic books and B-grade, sci-fi movies. Both Pyle cousins had their own peculiar dance moves.|$|R

500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child.

That's the <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together."
