5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA <b>editing</b> (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. <b>Editing</b> is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by <b>editing,</b> compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA <b>editing,</b> which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the <b>editing</b> sites. Both the structures and <b>editing</b> sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA <b>editing</b> {{do not appear to be}} present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E

5|$|The type of RNA <b>editing</b> {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA <b>editing</b> pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA <b>editing</b> and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. elegans strains indicating that A→I RNA <b>editing</b> may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic <b>editing</b> {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd <b>editing,</b> especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and <b>editing</b> decisions.|$|E

40|$|Software {{modifications}} {{are often}} systematic—they consist of simi-lar, but not identical, program changes to multiple contexts. Exist-ing tools for systematic program transformation are limited because they require programmers to manually prescribe <b>edits</b> or only sug-gest a location to <b>edit</b> with a related example. This paper presents {{the design and}} implementation of a program transformation tool called SYDIT. Given an example <b>edit,</b> SYDIT generates a context-aware, abstract <b>edit</b> script, and then applies the <b>edit</b> script to new program locations. To correctly encode a relative position of the <b>edits</b> in a new location, the derived <b>edit</b> script includes unchanged statements on which the <b>edits</b> are control and data dependent. Fur-thermore, to make the <b>edit</b> script applicable to a new context us-ing different identifier names, the derived <b>edit</b> script abstracts vari-able, method, and type names. The evaluation uses 56 systematic <b>edit</b> pairs from five large software projects as an oracle. SYDIT has high coverage and accuracy. For 82 % of the <b>edits</b> (46 / 56), SYDIT matches the context and applies an <b>edit,</b> producing code that is 96 % similar to the oracle. Overall, SYDIT mimics human programmers correctly on 70 % (39 / 56) of the <b>edits.</b> Generation of <b>edit</b> scripts seeks to improve programmer productivity by relieving develop-ers from tedious, error-prone, manual code updates. It also {{has the potential to}} guide automated program repair by creating program transformations applicable to similar contexts...|$|R
