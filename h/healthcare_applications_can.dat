40|$|Abstract — There is an {{increasing}} interest in Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare {{is considered to be}} one of the most common applications of it. Using the IoT paradigm, various devices including smart-phones and sensor-embedded <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications</b> <b>can</b> be used for monitoring health. In this study, we model an IoT use case scenario with regard to monitoring the activities associated with health. In particular, we present our use case using the SimIoT extended simulation toolkit to demonstrate the various functions and the interactions occurring within the IoT-enabled healthcare context. Specifically, we extend the functionalities of the SimIC simulation toolkit by adding the IoT layer that incorporates IoT devices which generated data for the private clouds. We focus our experimental analysis from the perspective of cloud performance to illustrate the turnaround and makespan of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{nanotechnology}} is advancing rapidly {{and the use}} of nanomaterials is becoming more common. As is the case with a broad range of industries, the healthcare sector is becoming increasingly influenced by nanotechnology, and this poses a greater risk for the exposure of workers to nanomaterials within their occupational settings. Nanotechnology and nanomaterials in <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications</b> <b>can</b> offer various benefits, for example miniaturisation techniques and approaches have converged with chemical synthesis and control of molecular assembly to produce exciting opportunities for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. However, despite ongoing research, the field of nanotechnology is developing faster than the generation of knowledge on the health and safety aspects of nanomaterials. There are still many unknowns, which raises questions concerning the evaluation of occupational safety and health (OSH) risks. This e-fact explains how healthcare workers might come across nanomaterials in their workplaces when undertaking their everyday activities. It also provides information about steps that can be taken to prevent potential exposures. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWireless body sensors {{combined}} with ubiquitous Wireless Sensor Networks enable pervasive <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications.</b> This technology <b>can</b> significantly {{improve the quality}} of life of chronically ill and elderly. Remote medical monitoring applications consist of many features as continuous medical monitoring, emergency alerts, location tracking and home automation. These heterogeneous systems have to implement Quality of Service mechanisms to ensure that the different functions have their QoS requirements satisfied, that the most important traffic still has its QoS requirements fulfilled in case of network overload and finally that QoS mechanisms are able to adapt dynamically depending on the context. From our knowledge, QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks for healthcare has never been studied from the context-awareness specific perspective, although context-awareness is the core issue of WSN for healthcare and that these networks have specific characteristics in comparison with most WSN. Health monitoring applications demand high reliability as life of human beings is involved, therefore Quality of Service support in such systems is vital. As patient may evolve from a non-critical health status to a critical one, context-awareness is essential to adapt the network performance to the new situation. In this paper we study the specific QoS requirements of <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications.</b> Then, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of related work regarding these characteristics and context-awareness.

40|$|The {{integration}} of multimedia-assisted healthcare systems with could-computing services and mobile technologies {{has led to}} increased accessibility for healthcare providers and patients. Utilizing cloud computing infrastructures and virtualization technologies allows for the transformation of traditional healthcare systems that demand manual care and monitoring to more salient, automatic and cost effective systems. The goal {{of this paper is}} to develop a multimedia-assisted mobile <b>healthcare</b> <b>application</b> using cloud-computing virtualization technologies. We consider calorie measurement as an example <b>healthcare</b> <b>application</b> that <b>can</b> benefit from cloud-computing virtualization technology. The key functionalities of our application entail image segmentation, image processing and deep learning algorithms for food classification and recognition. Client side devices (e. g. smartphones, tablets etc.) have limitations in handling time sensitive and computationally intensive algorithms pertained to our application. Image processing and deep learning algorithms, used in food recognition and calorie measurement, consume devices’ batteries quickly, which is inconvenient for the user. It is also very challenging for client side devices to scale for large number of data and images, as needed for food recognition. The entire process is time-consuming and inefficient and discomforting from users’ perspective and may deter them from using the application. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a virtualization mechanism in cloud computing that utilizes the Android architecture. Android allows for parting an application into activities run by the front-end user and services run by the back-end tasks. In the proposed virtualization mechanism, we use both the hosted and the hypervisor models to publish our Android-based food recognition and calorie measurement application in the cloud. By so doing, the users of our <b>application</b> <b>can</b> control their virtual smartphone operations through a dedicated client application installed on their smartphones, while the processing of the application continue to run on the virtual Android image even if the user is disconnected due to any unexpected event. We have performed several experiments to validate our mechanism. Specifically, we have run our deep learning and image processing algorithms for food recognition on different configuration platforms on both the cloud and local server connected to the mobile. The results show that the accuracy of the system with the virtualization mechanism is more than 94. 33 % compared to 87. 16 % when we run the application locally. Also, with our virtualization mechanism the results are processed 49 % faster than the case of running the application locally...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are application-specific networks, and usually a new network design {{is required for}} a new application. In event-driven wireless sensor network applications, the sink node of the network is generally concerned with the higher level information describing the events happening in the network, not the raw sensor data of individual sensor nodes. As the communication is a costly operation in wireless sensor networks, {{it is important to}} process the raw data triggering the events inside the network instead of bringing the raw data to the sink and processing it there. This helps reducing the total amount of packets transmitted and total energy consumed in the network. In this paper, we propose a new method that distributes the information processing into the sensor network for event-driven applications.

40|$|<b>Healthcare</b> <b>applications</b> are {{considered}} as promising fields for wireless sensor networks, where patients can be monitored using wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs). Current WMSN healthcare research trends focus on patient reliable communication, patient mobility, and energy-efficient routing, {{as a few}} examples. However, deploying new technologies in <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications</b> without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. Moreover, the physiological data of an individual are highly sensitive. Therefore, security is a paramount requirement of <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications,</b> {{especially in the case}} of patient privacy, if the patient has an embarrassing disease. This paper discusses the security and privacy issues in <b>healthcare</b> <b>application</b> using WMSNs. We highlight some popular healthcare projects using wireless medical sensor networks, and discuss their security. Our aim is to instigate discussion on these critical issues since the success of <b>healthcare</b> <b>application</b> depends directly on patient security and privacy, for ethic as well as legal reasons. In addition, we discuss the issues with existing security mechanisms, and sketch out the important security requirements for such applications. In addition, the paper reviews existing schemes that have been recently proposed to provide security solutions in wireless healthcare scenarios. Finally, the paper ends up with a summary of open security research issues that need to be explored for future <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications</b> using WMSNs...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{developments in}} the field of mobile computing have made it possible to use mobile devices for <b>healthcare</b> <b>applications.</b> These devices <b>can</b> be used by healthcare providers to collect and share patients' medical data. However, with increasing adoption of mobile devices that carry confidential data, organizations need to secure the data from unauthorized users and mobile device theft. When unencrypted data is transmitted from one device to another it faces various security threats from malicious code, unsecure networks, unauthorized access, and data theft. The objective of this research is to develop a secure data sharing solution customized for healthcare environments, which would allow authorized users to securely access and share patients' data over mobile devices. We identify the vulnerable locations in mobile communication network that can possibly be exploited by unauthorized users or malicious code to access the confidential data, and develop an efficient security protocol that provides end to end data protection without compromising device's performance. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed data sharing architecture, a prototype customized for Point-of-Care-Testing (POCT) scenarios was built in collaboration with Northern Health, Prince George. Simulations were performed to analyze and validate our solution against the pre-defined requirement criteria. [...] P. ii. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
