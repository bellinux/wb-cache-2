5|$|As a teenager, {{he began}} to work for Los Tejas, a gang that ran the {{criminal}} activities {{in his hometown of}} Nuevo Laredo. From washing cars, running errands, and stealing car parts in Nuevo Laredo, Treviño Morales turned to the drug trade, starting with small-scale drug retail sales and smuggling. Unlike the first members of Los Zetas, he was never in the military. He was hired by them and the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s for his experience moving contraband across the border. His fluent English and his criminal contacts {{on both sides of the}} U.S.-Mexico border allowed him to gain the trust of the then-leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. When he joined the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, Los Tejas, the local gang he once worked for, was absorbed by the former groups. Around 2005, Treviño Morales became the regional boss of Nuevo Laredo; he was in charge of fighting off the incursions of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was attempting to take control of the smuggling routes in the area. The Laredo–Nuevo Laredo area is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics because of the Interstate 35 highway, which serves as a strategic pathway to San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas for future drug distribution. While in power, he orchestrated a number of assassinations in American cities and in Mexico by young U.S. citizens whom <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> payroll. Treviño Morales was good at identifying and grooming young teenagers who he believed had the potential to become professional assassins for Los Zetas. These recruits, sometimes called Zetitas ("Little Zetas"), usually joined organized crime as young as twelve-years old to work first as smugglers and later as paid assassins.|$|E
25|$|After a {{short time}} in the family timber business, he worked with a cement {{merchant}} in Holborn. This resulted in 'an orgy of photography at weekends' {{so he decided to}} strike out on his own. Under the patronage of Osbert Sitwell <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> first exhibition in the Cooling Gallery, London. It caused quite a stir.|$|E
25|$|The first BMX proto sanctioning {{body was}} the Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS) founded by Scot Breithaupt in Long Beach, California on November 14, 1970, {{when he was}} {{fourteen}} years old. On that day <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> first ad hoc BMX race. At first BUMS simply referred to the transients that congregated in the field around 7th and Bellflower Streets where the track was located, but later Scot turned it into the acronym BUMS. The first race had 35 participants, who paid Scot a quarter (US25 cents) each for the privilege. At the next race 150 kids showed up.|$|E
6000|$|SERGIUS (thus rudely crossed in his chivalry, {{throws it}} off with a bitter laugh and says slightingly). Oh, you wish to be paid for the hurt? (<b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shako, and takes some money from his pocket.) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{manner of}} Gordon's death is uncertain, {{but it was}} romanticized in a popular {{painting}} by George William Joy – General Gordon's Last Stand (1893, currently in the Leeds City Art Gallery), {{and again in the}} film Khartoum (1966) with Charlton Heston as Gordon. The most popular account of Gordon's death was that <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> ceremonial gold-braided blue uniform of the Governor-General together with the Pasha's red fez and that he went out unarmed except with his rattan cane to be cut down by the Ansar. This account was very popular with the British public as it contained much Christian imagery with Gordon as a Christ-like figure dying passively for the sins of all humanity.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said {{he was glad to}} be back as <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
25|$|The next, {{and final}} match on the undercard, was the {{encounter}} of The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The match began with Austin and Rock brawling in the ring, which {{ended up at}} ringside. Throughout the match, Rock worked over Austin's leg, which included Rock applying a Sharpshooter on Austin. Rock then began to taunt Austin, as <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> vest and imitated his taunts, which led to The Rock running into a Rock Bottom by Austin. Rock then retaliated by delivering a Stone Cold Stunner. Austin performed the Stone Cold Stunner on Rock for a near-fall, much to Austin's shock. After he failed to win with the People's Elbow, Rock then performed three Rock Bottoms on Austin {{that led to the}} Rock successfully pinning Austin and winning the match.|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (recovering his speech). No: let me alone. I don't want him. I'm all right, I tell you. I need neither {{his help}} nor yours. (He rises and pulls himself together.) As you say, I had better go. (<b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hat.) Is that your last word? ...|$|R

6000|$|When Canaillard {{performs}} that Cavalier seul operation, does HE flinch? No: <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> most vainqueur look, {{he sticks}} his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat, and advances, retreats, pirouettes, and otherwise gambadoes, {{as though to}} say, [...] "Regarde moi, O monde!

2500|$|Bevan {{is one of}} {{only eight}} players with 30 ODI innings or more to {{maintain}} a batting average above 50. [...] However, Bevan's best performance was as a number four. Of the players to have played 30 or more ODI innings, he {{is one of only}} two (with Michael Hussey) whose batting average never dropped below 40. This, coupled with the high price <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> wicket, resulted in many not-out innings.|$|E
2500|$|Gustave Courbet (1819-1872) was {{the leader}} of the school of realist {{painters}} during the Second Empire who depicted the lives of ordinary people and rural life, as well as landscapes. [...] He delighted in scandal and condemned the art establishment, the Academy of Fine Arts, and Napoleon III. In 1855, when his submissions to the Salon were rejected, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own exhibit of forty of his paintings in a nearby building. [...] In 1870, Napoleon III proposed giving the Legion of Honour to Courbet, but he publicly rejected it.|$|E
2500|$|Jack Pickford brought Thomas' {{body back}} to the United States. Several {{accounts}} stated that Pickford {{tried to commit suicide}} en route but was talked out of it. According to Mary Pickford's autobiography, [...] "Jack crossed the ocean with Ollie's body. It wasn't until several years later that he confessed to Mother how one night during the voyage back <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> trousers and jacket over his pajamas, went up on deck, and was climbing over the rail when something inside him said: 'You can't do this to your mother and sisters. It would be a cowardly act. You must live and face the future.'" ...|$|E

60|$|This {{magnificent}} swell, of {{the times}} when swells had the world quite their own way, finds his lady already surrounded with visitors when he calls to revere her, {{as he would have}} said, and he can therefore make the more effective arrival.

2500|$|On July 16, 1981, Chapin {{was driving}} in the left lane on the Long Island Expressway at about 65mph (105km/h) {{on the way to}} perform at a free concert {{scheduled}} for later that evening at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York. Near exit 40 in Jericho, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> emergency flashers, presumably because of either a mechanical or medical problem (possibly a heart attack). He then slowed to about [...] per hour and veered into the center lane, nearly colliding with another car. He swerved left, then to the right again, ending up directly in the path of a tractor-trailer truck. The truck could not brake in time and rammed the rear of Chapin's blue 1975 Volkswagen Rabbit, rupturing the fuel tank as it climbed up and {{over the back of the}} car, which burst into flames.|$|E
