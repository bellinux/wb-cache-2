5|$|According to the Party's Constitution, {{the members}} of the CCDI are elected by the National Congress and serve for a term of five years. After the {{national}} congress in which it is elected, the CCDI convenes to elect its Secretary, deputy secretaries, secretary general and Standing Committee. Elected officials must then be endorsed by the Central Committee to take office. The Secretary of the CCDI has, since 1997, {{been a member of the}} Politburo Standing Committee and, since 2009, served as the leader of the Central Leading Group for <b>Inspection</b> <b>Work.</b> The current secretary is Zhao Leji, who took office on 25 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary, {{known as}} the First Secretary during Chen Yun's term (1978–1987), {{is head of the}} CCDI. Elections of its Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Secretary-General are held at its 1st Plenary Session, held {{immediately}} after a national congress. The CCDI proposes an elected Secretary to the 1st Plenary Session of a central committee, which can approve or reject them. The CCDI Secretary has a number of elected deputies; currently, there are eight deputy secretaries. Each CCDI Secretary since 2003 has concurrently headed the Central Leading Group for <b>Inspection</b> <b>Work.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI. Although the main petition office is the Complaints Office, petitions are usually sent to other offices and institutions (such as the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, the National People's Congress and party leadership {{as high as the}} PSC) as well. Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit <b>Inspection</b> <b>Work</b> (which sends inspection teams throughout the country). In a case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E

25|$|The first salvos of the {{campaign}} was the abrupt sacking of Sichuan Deputy Party Secretary Li Chuncheng, {{which took place in}} December 2012, shortly after Xi took office as leader of the Communist Party. The first batch of central inspection teams were dispatched {{in the third quarter of}} 2013 to various Chinese provinces, including Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Chongqing, and Hubei. A handful of provincial-level officials were investigated for corruption and removed from office as a result of the first round of <b>inspection</b> <b>work.</b> Of these regions, the inspection team in charge of Jiangxi uncovered far-reaching official corruption in the province, bringing down about a dozen officials, including Vice Governor Yao Mugen. The <b>inspection</b> <b>work</b> in Hubei province also resulted in about a dozen cases, including that of Vice Governor Guo Youming. In Inner Mongolia, head of the party's regional United Front department Wang Suyi was detained.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in late 2012, Wang {{emerged as}} {{the public face of}} Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, the most {{far-reaching}} campaign of its sort since the founding of the Communist-ruled state in 1949. He also became the Leader of the Central Leading Group for <b>Inspection</b> <b>Work,</b> responsible for dispatching teams to the provinces and state-owned enterprises with the goal of rooting out corruption. Following the 18th Party Congress, Wang was often considered the second most powerful man in China, second only to Xi, the paramount leader and Party General Secretary.|$|E

25|$|The one-child policy, {{a part of}} {{the family}} {{planning}} policy, was a population planning policy of China. It was introduced in 1979 and began to be formally phased out in 2015. The policy allowed exceptions for many groups, including ethnic minorities. In 2007, 36% of China's population was subject to a strict one-child restriction, with an additional 53% being allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl. Provincial governments imposed fines for violations, and the local and national governments created commissions to raise awareness and carry out registration and <b>inspection</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

As World War II was starting, Phillips was running a Tuberculosis sanatorium that was growing quickly. When the Japanese began the occupation of Peking, though, the clinic was shut down. Along with the sanatorium, the Anglican Mission Girls' School was closed, the school that Phillips had been doing health <b>inspection</b> <b>work</b> for. On 7 December 1941, Phillips was declared by the Japanese to be an enemy alien because of her British ties. Subsequently, Phillips was put under house arrest for a short while. Not long after being released, Phillips was ordered to evacuate Peking and was then taken to the Weixian Internment Compound in the Shandong Province. After spending a considerable amount of time there, American liberators came to free the people in the camp on 17 August 1945.|$|E

500|$|The CCDI {{was further}} {{reformed}} at the 16th National Congress in 2002; the CCDI Secretary {{was now the}} chief coordinator of all anti-corruption efforts on the mainland, a position later known as Leader of the Central Leading Group for <b>Inspection</b> <b>Work.</b> This was further codified in 2004 and 2005 with the [...] "Internal Supervision Regulation" [...] (ISR), institutionalising the inner-party supervision system and the Interim Provisions on DICs' Role in Assisting the party Committees with the Organisation and Coordination of Anti-Corruption Work.

The Hu Jintao-led leadership, which lasted from the 16th–18th National Congress, saw growth in CCDI power and influence, demonstrated most clearly by the increased attendance of PSC members at CCDI plenary sessions.|$|E
500|$|The Office for Circuit <b>Inspection</b> <b>Work</b> sends {{inspection}} teams {{throughout the}} country to help the local CDIs. In 2003 there were five inspection teams, and by 2013 the number had grown to twelve. In 2010, the CCDI was authorised to send inspection teams to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Despite this, there are several weaknesses to its institutional design {{in the sense that}} certain informal aspects of CPC rule compete with formal procedures (that the CCDI and its lower-level organs are tasked with supervising) for hegemony; examples are, as outlined Xuezhi Guo, [...] "vague institutional positions, incrementally declining effects as time goes by, vulnerability to patron-clientelism or guanxi network at the grassroots level, and the dilemma of 'open' or 'undercover’ investigation".

Through <b>inspection</b> <b>works</b> including both close visual inspection and nondestructive inspection were conducted periodically.
