5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that a stream of water {{emerging}} from a <b>faucet</b> will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the <b>faucet.</b> This {{is due to a}} phenomenon called the Plateau–Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension.|$|E

50|$|Advertisements is {{the main}} income source of <b>Faucets.</b> The <b>faucets</b> try to get cheap traffic by giving {{referral}} commissions. This ever increasing traffic helps then earn more on advertisement revenue. The difference between the cost of Bitcoins invested and the Ad revenue gives the profit. Some Ad networks pay in bitcoins itself. The profit margin for <b>Faucets</b> are very small for most <b>faucets.</b> Only big and established <b>faucets</b> make profit through the huge amount of cheap traffic coming into their site.|$|R
50|$|Water {{flowing through}} opened <b>faucets</b> (including kitchen, bathroom, utility sink <b>faucets,</b> and hose bibs) {{accounts}} for 19 percent (26.3 gphd, or 100 lphd) of total indoor water use {{in an average}} household where <b>faucets</b> are used 51 times per day. On average, <b>faucets</b> are opened for 30 seconds at a flow of 1 gpm (gallons per minute) and an average discharge of 0.5 gallons (1.9 liters) per each use.|$|R
5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or <b>faucet.</b> Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Out of 17 municipalities, 14 have Level III {{water supply}} systems serving 18,590 {{households}} or about 32.57 {{percent of the}} total provincial households. Level III has a reservoir with house-to-house connections. 5,252 households were serviced by Level II water systems and 24,700 households by Level I water system. Level I category is a common facility where the community members get their water supply from deep wells and shallow wells, while Level II has a reservoir with communal <b>faucet.</b> Based on the report from the Provincial Health Office in 2007, a total of 48,542 households out of the 57,079 or 85.04 percent have access to safe drinking water.|$|E
5|$|McGill has {{a number}} of student-run publications. The McGill Daily, first {{published}} in 1911, was previously published twice weekly, but shifted to a once-a-week publication schedule in September 2013 due to tightened budgets. The Délit français is the Daily's French-language counterpart. The combined circulation of both papers is over 28,000. The McGill Tribune currently publishes once a week, circulating approximately 11,000 copies across campus. The Bull & Bear, operating under the Management Undergraduate Society, publishes 1,000 copies each month.

TVMcGill is the University TV station, broadcasting on closed-circuit television and over the internet.|$|E
50|$|Rewards are {{dispensed}} {{at various}} predetermined intervals of time. <b>Faucets</b> usually give fractions of a bitcoin, {{but the amount}} will typically fluctuate according {{to the value of}} bitcoin. Typical payout per transaction is less than 1000 satoshi, although some <b>faucets</b> also have random larger rewards. To reduce mining fees, <b>faucets</b> normally save up these small individual payments in their own ledgers, which then add up to make a larger payment that is sent to a user's bitcoin address.|$|R

Toilets were remotely flushed twice a week by the guards of the cellblock.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} {{can prevent}} frequently touched surfaces from serving as reservoirs for {{the spread of}} pathogenic microbes. This {{is especially true in}} healthcare facilities, where harmful viruses, bacteria, and fungi colonize and persist on doorknobs, push plates, railings, tray tables, tap (<b>faucet)</b> handles, IV poles, HVAC systems, and other equipment. These microbes can often survive on surfaces for surprisingly long periods of time (sometimes more than 30 days).|$|E

25|$|Adenoviruses {{are often}} {{transmitted}} by expectorate, {{but can also}} be transmitted by contact with an infected person, or by virus particles left on objects such as towels and <b>faucet</b> handles. Some people with adenovirus gastroenteritis may shed the virus in their stools for months after getting over the symptoms. The virus can be passed through water in swimming pools {{that do not have}} enough chlorine in them. As with many other illnesses, good handwashing is one way to inhibit the spread of adenoviruses from one person to another. Heat and bleach will kill adenoviruses on objects.|$|E
25|$|Legionella is a {{parasite}} of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often include very hot water flushes (160°F; 70°C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, {{and in some}} cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120°F (50°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing <b>faucet</b> aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, {{it seems}} that in Suriname water is taken for granted, due to the {{availability}} and low water bills.

This way significant amounts of water are lost.|$|R

25|$|From the beginning, {{questions}} of hygiene posed {{a problem in}} the camps, built in haste. The goal was to quickly build a maximum number of installations, which relegated sanitary considerations to the back burner. Camps in Germany featured only a simple <b>faucet</b> in the yard for thousands of people. Very often, latrines consisted of a simple board with a hole in the middle above a pit, which the prisoners were tasked with emptying at regular intervals. Because of their basic construction, the toilets often overflowed during powerful rains, making an unbreathable atmosphere prevail in the camps. Moreover, the clayey soil turned to muck from the first rains.|$|E
25|$|Ms Frizzle's {{class is}} going {{with her on}} the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they {{discover}} how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the <b>faucet</b> in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, the Triboro Hospital transitioned into {{a normal}} {{hospital}} within the Queens Hospital complex. At this time, Queens Hospital Center was considered antiquated, with over 90 {{percent of the}} hospital beds below state health standards, along with overcrowding of hospital wards and shortages of equipment. The large and open hospital wards with dozens of beds that Queens General and Triboro Hospital were built with were now in violation of modern health codes. An entire corridor of Triboro Hospital had been flooded in 1971 due to a broken <b>faucet.</b> The city sought to relocate Queens Hospital Center farther south in Jamaica or South Jamaica. Meanwhile, it was proposed to sell or close Triboro Hospital. Queens Hospital was not relocated, due to community opposition and the city's fiscal crisis at that time.|$|E
