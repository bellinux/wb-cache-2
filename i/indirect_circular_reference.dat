50|$|A <b>circular</b> <b>reference</b> {{occurs when}} the formula in one cell refers—directly, or {{indirectly}} through a chain of cell references—to another cell that refers {{back to the first}} cell. Many common errors cause <b>circular</b> <b>references.</b> However, some valid techniques use <b>circular</b> <b>references.</b> These techniques, after many spreadsheet recalculations, (usually) converge on the correct values for those cells.|$|R

Although a <b>circular</b> <b>reference</b> will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a <b>circular</b> <b>reference</b> is of no use. Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a <b>circular</b> <b>reference</b> since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful <b>reference.</b> Sentences containing <b>circular</b> referents can still be meaningful; ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Complex data {{dependencies}} {{can often}} be expressed concisely by defining a variable in terms of part of its own value. Such a <b>circular</b> <b>reference</b> can be naturally expressed in a lazy functional language or in an attribute grammar. In this paper, we consider <b>circular</b> <b>references</b> {{in the context of}} an imperative C-like language, by extending the language with a new construct, persistent variables. We show that an extension of partial evaluation can eliminate persistent variables, producing a staged C program. This approach has been implemented in the Tempo specializer for C programs, and has proven useful in the implementation of run-time specialization. ...|$|R

50|$|There {{were well}} known {{problems}} with VisiCalc, and several competitors appeared {{to address some}} of these issues. One early example was 1980's SuperCalc, which solved the problem of <b>circular</b> <b>references,</b> while a slightly later example was Microsoft Multiplan from 1981, which offered larger sheets and other improvements.

50|$|Garbage {{collection}} {{is used to}} clean up unused objects and so reduce the potential for memory leaks and data corruption. There are two main types of garbage collection: tracing and reference counting. Reference counting schemes record the number of references to a given object and collect the object when the reference count becomes zero. Reference-counting cannot collect cyclic (or <b>circular)</b> <b>references</b> because only one object may be collected at a time. Groups of mutually referencing objects which are not directly referenced by other objects and are unreachable can thus become permanently resident; if an application continually generates such unreachable groups of unreachable objects this will {{have the effect of}} a memory leak. Weak references (references which are not counted in reference counting) may be used {{to solve the problem of}} <b>circular</b> <b>references</b> if the reference cycles are avoided by using weak references for some of the references within the group.|$|R
50|$|The use of indices grew exponentially, {{comprising}} a pseudo-city, pseudo-planet {{and eventually}} a pseudo-galaxy devoted to information storage.

The solutions obtained are the generalisation of the usual periodic orbits obtained for the linearised equations and also of the third order solution computed by D. L. Richardson and J. W. Mitchell.

Despite the difference of the reference orbit, the relative motion with the relatively small eccentricity shows the similar results on elliptic case and circular case.

50|$|GenoPro {{has its own}} {{object-oriented}} database engine designed to foster hierarchical data and <b>circular</b> <b>references.</b> Hierarchical data is the key for avoiding redundant data, which in turn eliminates inconsistencies, and reduces typing and memory storage. The greatest benefit of hierarchical data is providing a hierarchy for classifying data, such as grouping places by country, state, city and buildings. A building, such as a hospital or cemetery may further be divided into rooms and lots for finer data granularity. Since places are objects, the user can enter minute details, from street addresses and pictures, to latitude and longitude for GPS positioning. Any place deriving from a parent place will inherit its parent's values, unless overwritten.|$|R
