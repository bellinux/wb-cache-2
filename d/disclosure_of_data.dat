Congress believed that some financial institutions had contributed to the decline of some geographic areas by their failure to provide adequate home financing to qualified aapplicants on reasonable terms and conditions. Thus, one purpose of HMDA and Regulation C is to provide the public with information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities {{in which they are}} located. A second purpose is to aid public officials in targeting public investments from the private sector to areas where they are needed. Finally, the FIRREA amendments of 1989 require the collection and <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> about applicant and borrower characteristics to assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.|$|E

It is currently a debate whether or not digitalized student data that can be accessed by many parties is really beneficial to support individuals with disabilities in school.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study when the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> mining results represents, per se, {{a threat to}} the {{anonymity}} of the individuals recorded in the analyzed database. The novelty of our approach is that we focus on an objective definition of privacy compliance of patterns without any reference to a preconceived knowledge of what is sensitive and what is not, {{on the basis of the}} rather intuitive and realistic constraint that the anonymity of individuals should be guaranteed. In particular, the problem addressed here arises from the possibility of inferring from the output of frequent itemset mining (i. e., a set of itemsets with support larger than a threshold σ), the existence of patterns with very low support (smaller than an anonymity threshold k) [3]. In the following we develop a simple methodology to block such inference opportunities by introducing distortion on the dangerous patterns. 1...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The current {{solutions}} to disclosing privacy in computer-mediated communication are two-fold: either {{the connection is}} permitted and an audio-video link is opened providing a full-blown perceptual view on the distant location, or the connection is denied and the distant visitor has no perceptual access to the remote site. We claim that the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> private <b>data</b> {{is more complex than}} these simplistic binary solutions. In this article, we present the concept of published observability as a system property to characterize the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> private <b>data.</b> We propose a technical solution as an instantiation of this property using an eigen-space coding for private video data.
