An engine test facility is being built at Westcott and if all goes to plan, the first ground-based engine tests could happen in 2020, and Skylon could be performing unmanned test flights by 2025.|$|E

5|$|Early in his career, Barton mainly {{played a}} {{defensive}} role, with a game based on tackling and tracking back {{to shield the}} defence. As his career <b>has</b> <b>progressed,</b> he has begun to incorporate a more attacking approach to his play, which {{has resulted in a}} greater number of goals and assists, and his six goals from midfield made him Manchester City's leading scorer in the 2006–07 season, ahead of strikers Georgios Samaras, Bernardo Corradi, Émile Mpenza and Darius Vassell.|$|E
5|$|No manager <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> {{beyond the}} first group stage of a major competition, even though Scotland {{qualified}} for several between 1954 and 1998. Beattie (1954), Walker (1958), Willie Ormond (1974), Ally MacLeod (1978), Stein (1982), Ferguson (1986), Andy Roxburgh (1990 and 1992) and Brown (1996 and 1998) have all managed the team at major competitions. Ian McColl, Ormond and MacLeod all won the British Home Championship outright.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where the disease <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally {{good for the}} treatment of stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.|$|E

5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity), both cryosurgery and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} blindness as an outcome. Where the disease <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of variation on the norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series of objectives that must be completed before the player can continue. From Dark Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and the use of Force powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series <b>has</b> <b>progressed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} development in India followed socialist-inspired politicians {{for most of its}} independent history, including state-ownership of many sectors; India's per capita income increased at only around 1% annualised rate in the three decades after its independence.

After more fundamental reforms since 1991 and their renewal in the 2000s, India <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> towards a free market economy.|$|E

5|$|The main {{development}} of organ repertoire <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> {{along with that}} of the organ itself, leading to distinctive national styles of composition. Because organs are commonly found in churches and synagogues, the organ repertoire includes a large amount of sacred music, which is accompanimental (choral anthems, congregational hymns, liturgical elements, etc.) as well as solo in nature (chorale preludes, hymn versets designed for alternatim use, etc.). The organ's secular repertoire includes preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ symphonies, suites, and transcriptions of orchestral works.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across the Mojave Desert, {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found anywhere else in the world.

5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from a series of small towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre <b>has</b> <b>progressed</b> from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{with the}} greater Hollywood tradition, every Bond film {{features}} chase scenes, usually {{more than one}} per film. Bond and his allies evade their pursuers {{in a wide variety}} of vehicles, including custom air- and watercraft, to trucks and even tanks and moon-buggies. Although most chase sequences feature Bond getting chased by the villains, such as the Aston-Martin DB5 in Goldfinger and the ski sequence in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, some feature Bond chasing the villains, such as the tank pursuit in GoldenEye and all sequences in Casino Royale. As the Eon series <b>has</b> <b>progressed,</b> the chases have repeated themselves with some variations and have all increased in extravagance.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series <b>has</b> <b>progressed.</b> Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
