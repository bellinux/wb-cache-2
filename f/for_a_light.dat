5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> transport aircraft. Based upon this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E
5|$|The M19 {{evolved from}} the 40mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 project, {{which was based on}} an Armored Force {{requirement}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> anti-aircraft vehicle based on the M5 light tank chassis. Although trials were successful and a production of 1,000 T65s had been requested, the project was stopped by the Ordnance Department since the M5A1 light tank chassis was being phased out of production.|$|E
5|$|Planning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> {{rail system}} on Portland's west side started in 1979, with a {{groundbreaking}} coming in 1993 on the Westside MAX project. The line originally was to terminate at Willow Creek/185th, but lobbying by Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman and others secured funding {{to extend the}} line to downtown. Plans for the station originally called {{for the construction of}} a branch of the Hillsboro Public Library at the stop. Due to cost overruns when building the Robertson Tunnel through the West Hills, the library was canceled and a Books by Rail program was added to the Hillsboro Central station. TriMet also canceled plans for security cameras at the station. The park-and-ride lot opened on March 3, 1997, served by two bus lines (61 and 88), because it was ready for use. The original planned opening date of September 1997 for Westside MAX as far as 185th Avenue had been postponed by one year, due to delays in constructing the Robertson Tunnel, resulting in Willow Creek park-and-ride's being completed far in advance of the start of MAX service and related bus-service expansion.|$|E

5|$|The first plans <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> rail {{along the}} route of the Sognsvann Line were {{launched}} by Holmenkolbanen in 1904. They called for a branch from Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line to Geitmyren and onwards to Sagene. The next proposal for a line was launched in 1917, when Aker Municipality established the company Akersbanerne. It started work planning the Østensjø Line as well as the Sognsvann Line. The neighborhoods of Sogn and Tåsen were being built, and the municipality wanted to establish a good transport system to make the areas more attractive. Holmenkolbanen stated that they should be prioritized to build the system, since they already had a line in the area, but the municipality wanted to have political control over the development of the area.|$|E
