In a patient with a 6 -cm thoracic aortic aneurysm after a type B dissection, the modified Zenith TX 2 thoracic stent-graft was deployed successfully and without complications; the proximal part of the stent-graft protruded less into the arch, significantly improving wall apposition.

40|$|Currently, Draper Laboratory {{is in the}} {{development}} stages of a gliding autogyro airdrop system. The goal of the project is to design a platform capable of placing small, high value items into urban terrain. Theoretically, autogyros can achieve descent rates and glide slopes similar to current parafoil based systems, but do so with greater precision. Over the past half-century most rotorcraft {{research has focused on}} helicopter design, only viewing autorotation as a means of achieving emergency landings. In contrast, this project utilized early rotor theory to develop algorithms which can predict unpowered rotor performance across the entire flight envelope. To validate these predictions, a vertical wind tunnel capable of testing rotors up to 4 feet in diameter at descent rates of up to 25 ft/s was constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences</b> that would allow the system to achieve stable autorotation autonomously. By varying parameters such as blade pitch angle and rotor solidity, it is shown that in the proper configuration, rotor based systems can match and even surpass parafoils in areas such as descent rate and glide slope. The autogyro also has the added capability of varying its lift-to-drag ratio in flight while maintaining reasonable descent speeds, allowing for more precise control to the target. Possible <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences</b> are displayed, proving that relatively simple configurations can be brought into stable autorotation. The algorithms developed and vertical wind tunnel constructed for this project can be used to gain further knowledge of autogyro performance. by Michael Oliver. Thesis (S. M.)

People throughput and freight throughput have become critical issues for California {{and the rest of the}} nation. PATH has been funding a one-year research project entitled "Definition and Evaluation of Bus and Truck Automation Operations Concepts," proposed by the authors. This report summarizes the results of the research project achieved during the first six months. During those six months, we reviewed literature and developed operating concepts for both urban bus automation and inter-city truck automation. We also selected a small number of most promising operating concepts for urban bus automation and inter-city truck automation, both with variations and intermediate deployment steps. On urban bus automation, we selected one unprotected automated busway system (ABUS) for city operations and two operating concepts for automated bus operations on or along a freeway. All or a subset of these three concepts can be integrated to form other operating concepts. On truck automation, we selected an operating concept for a protected inter-city truck-AHS. These concepts describe how automated systems involving buses or trucks operate as a system and how they interact with the surrounding transportation systems. These systems, if implemented, will revolutionize the current bus or truck transportation systems. They certainly cannot be achieved suddenly, and hence can be regarded as end-state systems. Since these end-state operating concepts re intended for real-world implementation and such implementation requires the participation of many stakeholders, any creditable end-state operating concept must be accompanied by and even justified with credible <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences.</b> We developed <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences</b> for these operating concepts to demonstrate the deployability of these concepts and to explain how to "get there from here.

The Army’s SADARM and the Air Force’s Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) are typical of smart submunitions with multiple sensors, VHSIC signal processing, large warheads, and complex <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences.</b> Reported here is the SADARM Telemetry Module, designed and developed by Honeywell to support the SADARM Program. The SADARM Telemetry Module applies MMIC and VLSI technology to provide sophisticated telemetry operation with a physically small, (2 in) package, in a harsh operating environment. The 3 SADARM Telemetry Module senses 17 channels of digital and analog data, digitizes the analog data, multiplexes and PCM formats the data stream and transmits it via an IRIG compatible MMIC transmitter. This SADARM Telemetry Module was used to collect in-flight performance data at the SADARM Congressional Tests in February, 1989. Submunitions have evolved into very complex systems. Submunition development support testing has also become increasingly complicated. Onboard flight recorders are not feasible for live submunition tests because destruction of the submunition after the test precludes recovery of the recorded data. Telemetry provides the necessary test and measurement support required for efficient, cost effective, submunition development. The application of conventional telemetry {{for this type of}} submunition instrumentation has also become more difficult as the submunitions have become smaller in size and have more complex <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences</b> to evaluate. In addition, subminiature telemetry provides a practical, cost effective means to support field testing and development efforts in multiple munition weapon systems. In fact, subminiature telemetry offers the most practical instrumentation approach to evaluate the in-flight performance of several munitions dropped simultaneously. The SADARM Telemetry Module, discussed in this paper, incorporated these subminiature telemetry performance requirements into a practical, cost effective instrumentation package for SADARM development support...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Concentric tube robots can enable new {{clinical}} interventions if {{they are}} able to pass through soft tissue, deploy along desired paths through open cavities, or travel along winding lumens. These behaviors require the robot to deploy {{in such a way that}} the curved shape of its shaft remains unchanged as the tip progresses forward (i. e. “follow-the-leader ” deployment). Follow-the-leader deployment is challenging for concentric tube robots due to elastic (and particularly torsional) coupling between the tubes that form the robot. However, as we show in this paper, follow-the-leader deployment is possible, provided that tube precurvatures and <b>deployment</b> <b>sequences</b> are appropriately selected. We begin by defining follow-the-leader deployment and providing conditions that must be satisfied for a concentric tube robot to achieve it. We then examine several useful special cases of follow-the-leader deployment, showing that both circular and helical precurvatures can be employed, and provide an experimental illustration of the helical case. We also explore approximate follow-the-leader behavior and provide a metric for the similarity of a general deployment to a follow-the-leader deployment. Lastly, we consider access to the hippocampus in the brain to treat epilepsy, as a motivating clinical example for follow-the-leader deployment. I...|$|R

The kinematic studies and engineering demonstration model fully verified the deployment kinematics, stowing philosophy, and <b>deployment</b> <b>sequencing</b> for large antenna modules.

In 1971, a team from the Air Force Weapons Center at Eglin Air Force Base brought test versions of the CBU-55 to Southeast Asia for testing on two lower speed attack aircraft, the A-37 and the A-1. In late 1971, the team worked with the 604th Special Operations Squadron A-37 pilots at Bien Hoa, SVN to fly a handful of combat test missions.

The test-technique for the extraction of CPAS test articles has evolved with increased complexity and requires new modeling concepts to ensure the test article is delivered to a stable test condition for the programmer phase. Prompted by unexpected dynamics and hardware malfunctions in drop tests, these modeling improvements provide a more accurate loads prediction by incorporating a spring-damper line-model derived from the material properties.
