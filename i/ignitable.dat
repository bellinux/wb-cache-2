25|$|Pyridine has a {{flash point}} (the lowest {{temperature}} {{at which it}} can vaporize to form an <b>ignitable</b> mixture in air) of only 17°C and is, therefore, highly flammable. Its ignition temperature is 550°C, and mixtures of 1.7–10.6vol% of pyridine with air are explosive. The thermal modification of pyridine starts above 490°C, resulting in bipyridine (mainly 2,2′-bipyridine {{and to a lesser}} extent 2,3′-bipyridine and 2,4′-bipyridine), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and plants in aquatic systems. The permitted maximum allowable concentration of pyridine was 15–30 parts per million (ppm, or 15–30mg·m−3 in air) in most countries in the 1990s, but was reduced to 5ppm in the 2000s. For comparison, indoor air contaminated with tobacco smoke may contain up to 16µg·m−3 of pyridine, and one cigarette contains 21–32µg.|$|E
500|$|In a fire, the {{pressure}} in a gas cylinder rises {{in direct proportion to}} its absolute temperature. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically. [...] If the vessel contents are <b>ignitable</b> or a contaminant is present this event may result in an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Slow {{response}} of the available 909 Sea Dart tracking radar and its operator limited the possible response. The spread of the fire was not adequately controlled due {{to the presence of}} <b>ignitable</b> material coverings and lack of adequate curtains and sealing to restrict smoke and fires. Captain Salt's handing of the ship during the four hours over which the fires were fought were not faulted, nor was his decision to abandon ship due to the risk of fires igniting the Sea Dart magazine, the exposed position to air attack of HMS Arrow and Yarmouth [...] assisting the firefighting, and fact that the combat capability of the destroyer was irredeemably lost.|$|E
2500|$|In 1667, Johann Joachim Becher {{published}} his book Physica subterranea, which contained {{the first instance}} of {{what would become the}} phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire, water, and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of earth: terra lapidea, terra fluida, and terra pinguis. [...] Terra pinguis was the element that imparted oily, sulphurous, or combustible properties. [...] Becher believed that terra pinguis was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned. Becher did not {{have much to do with}} phlogiston theory as we know it now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher's main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much it was changed after him. Becher's idea was that combustible substances contain an <b>ignitable</b> matter, the terra pinguis.|$|E

50|$|Many accelerants are hydrocarbon-based fuels, {{sometimes}} referred to as petroleum distillates: gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, turpentine, butane, and various other flammable solvents. These accelerants are also known as <b>ignitable</b> liquids. <b>Ignitable</b> liquids can leave behind tell-tale marks in the fire debris.

50|$|The {{properties}} of some <b>ignitable</b> liquids make them dangerous fuels. Many <b>ignitable</b> liquids have high vapor pressures, low flash points and a relatively wide range between their {{upper and lower}} explosive limit. This allows <b>ignitable</b> liquids to ignite easily, and when mixed in a proper air-fuel ratio, readily explode. Many arsonists who use generous amounts of gasoline have been seriously burned or killed igniting their fire.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ignitable</b> liquids are {{not always}} fire {{accelerant}}s, they may just be present at the scene under normal circumstances. Gasoline {{is the most common}} fire accelerant used [...] but it could also be present at a scene as an <b>ignitable</b> liquid due to gasoline being a common fuel. Although <b>ignitable</b> liquids are the most common fire accelerants it is possible to have other chemicals being used as a fire accelerant. Gases such as propane or natural gas could also be used to accelerate a fire.|$|E
50|$|Many {{so-called}} accelerants are hydrocarbon-based fuels, {{sometimes more}} realistically {{referred to as}} petroleum distillates: gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, turpentine, butane, and various other flammable solvents. These accelerants are also known as <b>ignitable</b> liquids. <b>Ignitable</b> liquids can leave behind irregular patterns {{on the surface of}} a floor. These irregular burn patterns can indicate the presence of an <b>ignitable</b> liquid in a fire and can indicate the point of origin of the fire. Note, however, that irregular patterns may be found in fires involving no accelerant. This is particularly true in cases of full room involvement.|$|E

5000|$|Once the {{isolation}} is complete the volatiles are detected using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [...] which {{will produce a}} chromatogram that will be interpreted by a fire chemist. The interpretation is completed by comparing the sample chromatograms with chromatograms from known <b>ignitable</b> liquid samples that were analyzed on the same instrument. The chemist {{will be able to}} identify the <b>ignitable</b> liquids present in the sample by matching the sample chromatogram to a standard chromatogram that contains the highest degree of similarity. After the analyst has finished interpreting the results they will have one of three conclusions. One could be that ILRs are present and their identities will be determined (ex. Gasoline or Varsol). Another could be that ILRs are absent and the last could be that the sample was inconclusive and a reanalysis needs to be completed.|$|E
