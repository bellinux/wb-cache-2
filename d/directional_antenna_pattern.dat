40|$|It {{is known}} at a {{qualitative}} level that <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> {{can be used}} to boost the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks. Lacking is a measure to quantify this advantage and to compare <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> of different footprint patterns. This paper introduces the concept of the effective beam width (and the effective null width as its dual counterpart) as a measure which quantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of <b>directional</b> <b>antennas.</b> Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold. In contrast, our effective beam width definition lumps the effects of the (i) <b>antenna</b> <b>pattern,</b> (ii) active-node distribution, and (iii) channel characteristics, on network capacity into a single quantitative measure. We investigate the mathematical properties of the effective beam width and show how the convenience afforded by these properties {{can be used to}} analyze the effectiveness of complex <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> in boosting network capacity, with fading and multi-user interference taken into account. In particular, we derive the extent to which network capacity can be scaled with the use of phased array antennas.

40|$|In this contribution, a maximum-likelihood-based {{approach}} is proposed for estimating {{the attitudes of}} sectoring base station (BS) antennas based {{on the power of}} the received signals observed by multiple user equipments (UEs) in a cellular network. The proposed method calculates the likelihood of the antenna attitude by taking into account both the large-scale fading statistics, i. e. path loss, shadowing, and the small-scale fading attributed to multi-path propagation. The performance of the method is evaluated by simulations in both urban and rural scenarios, where a random-propagation-graph method is applied to generating realistic channel impulse responses by using <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns.</b> Results show that by using the proposed method, accurate estimates of the antenna attitude can be obtained when the observations from more UEs are available and the line-of-sight (LoS) condition dominates the channels between the BS and the UEs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{empirical}} {{results from a}} study examining the effects of antenna diversity and placement on vehicle-to-vehicle link performance in vehicular ad hoc networks. The experiments use roofand in-vehicle mounted omni-directional antennas and IEEE 802. 11 a radios operating in the 5 GHz band, which is of interest for planned inter-vehicular communication standards. Our main findings are two-fold. First, we show that radio reception performance is sensitive to antenna placement in the 5 Ghz band. Second, our results show that, surprisingly, a packet level selection diversity scheme using multiple antennas and radios, Multi-Radio Packet Selection (MRPS), improves performance not only in a fading channel but also in line-of-sight conditions. This is due to propagation being affected by car geometry, leading to the highly non-uniform <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns.</b> These patterns {{are very sensitive to}} the exact antenna position on the roof, for example at a transmit power of 40 mW the line-of-sight communication range varied between 50 and 250 m depending on the orientation of the cars. These findings have implications for vehicular MAC protocol design. Protocols may have to cope with an increased number of hidden nodes due to the <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns.</b> However, car makers can reduce these effects through careful antenna placement and diversity...|$|R
