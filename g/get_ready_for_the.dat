5|$|In June 2015, {{the board}} signed Ayoub Odisho as the team's new manager, 18 {{years after he}} first held the post in 1998. The team also signed Younis Mahmoud, an Al-Talaba Hall of Famer and {{the captain of the}} Iraq {{national}} team, twelve years after he left the club in 2004, with a free contract to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2015–16 season.

5|$|During an {{overhaul}} in May 1942, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, {{she had her}} remaining secondary battery of twelve 5–inch/51 guns removed to make space for more anti-aircraft guns. After the overhaul, which was completed on 1 August, she departed San Francisco to Hawaii to prepare for action. From 6 December to 22 March 1943, she escorted convoys and transports to the Fiji Islands. After that, she patrolled the southwestern Pacific, before returning to Pearl Harbor to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Aleutian Islands Campaign. After her training, on 17 May, she steamed to Adak, which would be her base for the attack on Attu. She later participated in the shelling of Kiska on 21 July, which preceded the Japanese evacuation of the island a week later.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} the Paris terror attacks, an Air France A380 {{traveling}} from Los Angeles, California to Paris, France was diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport due to a bomb threat on the aircraft. The aircraft was the largest plane to ever land at the airport. The airport workers had only 15 minutes to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> emergency landing.|$|E

25|$|In {{general the}} other bands {{in the area}} and the Assiniboine moved {{independently}} of each other. However, during midsummer when {{there was a lot of}} bison, all the bands came together for a few weeks in one tribal encampment. During this time they would have celebrations and possibly a tribal buffalo drive. After this time the bands would separate again and go to the river valleys or foothills and <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winter months.|$|E

25|$|The story {{takes place}} in a fictional world, {{primarily}} upon a continent called Westeros, with one storyline occurring on another continent to the east known as Essos. Like the novel, the season like the previous seasons mainly centres around the war of the five kings; after the death of Robb Stark at The Red Wedding, all three remaining kings in Westeros believe to have a claim to the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, at the wall, Jon Snow and the Night's Watch <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle against the free folk.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the need}} for {{revisions}} of the play was clearly due to purely practical concerns of stagecraft, apart from the demands of political censorship. Much of the point of the revision was to streamline the play, to make it more actable; though even the revised version would have needed a minimum cast of 18—13 adults and five boys. Two of the Additions, III and VI, occur {{at the beginning and end}} of the middle third respectively, giving more time for costume changes. Addition III provides a soliloquy by More and a 45-line dialogue between two actors; Addition VI provides a similar breathing-space for the actors to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> play's final phase.|$|E
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and levelled to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men {{on each side of the}} rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.|$|E

25|$|Selected as a torch bearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) {{is stuck}} on the London Underground with members of his local {{football}} team because someone pulled the emergency stop when an argument broke out. The train starts but police are waiting at the tube station and will not let them through. Billy manages to escape, and frantically tries to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> torch. Meanwhile, Billy's granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), is in labour in a local fast food restaurant, refusing an ambulance, and refusing to give birth until she knows Billy has carried the torch and can be there. After some delays, Billy is able to carry the torch, watched by his friends and neighbours. He then hears that Lola is in labour, so rushes to the restaurant, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) delivers the baby.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 6, {{the members}} of Endeavours crew {{performed}} a focused inspection of an area of thermal protection tiles {{on the bottom of}} the orbiter. The tiles were damaged during launch, and detailed data provided by the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was needed to make sure the orbiter could re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely. The focused inspection started with the Canadarm2 grappling the OBSS in the middle of the boom and handing it off to the shuttle's Canadarm, which was controlled by pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialists Mike Fincke and Roberto Vittori. The inspection process took approximately two hours to complete, and resulted in the Thermal Protection System (TPS) being cleared for entry. After the inspection was complete, Fincke joined Drew Feustel to get their spacesuits ready for the second spacewalk of the mission on flight day 7. The pair performed the standard overnight campout procedure to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> EVA. Later in the crew day, the STS-134 crew assembled with the Expedition 27 crew in the Kibo module. The joint crew spoke with Pope Benedict XVI, answering several questions asked by the Pope.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some technical and maintenance crew at SICEC has been barred entry to their workplace for months. The reason was due to they have not received their passes from the organisers. An anonymous worker told the press that their passes had several problems on it. They were issued temporary passes earlier in September, but they have since expired. They were not let in without proper credentials. The workers who do not have passes have been given a day off from work, whereas the rest who had passes worked double to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> meetings. An industry source stated that about 200 to 300 workers faced the same problem with their passes. The managing director from Showtec Corporation told the press around twenty of his crew were sent home as no pass have been issued to them, despite most of them submitted their forms a few months ago. A full strength of sixty is required to run the meetings. He added that a number of the passes did not come with an “S” at the bottom left hand corner of the card, which is a security feature for the person to be allowed into the Programme of Seminars which brings all the ministers and high-level delegates from 184 countries.|$|E

500|$|On February 8, 1945, Brown {{accepted}} the job, {{saying he was}} sad to leave Ohio State, but he [...] "couldn't turn down this deal in fairness to my family." [...] Brown was still Ohio State's head coach in absentia, and the decision surprised and outraged school officials who expected him to return after the war. The AAFC did not start play until after the war, however, and Brown continued to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1945 season at Great Lakes. That year, many of his best players were transferred to bases on the West Coast {{as the focus of}} the war shifted to the Pacific. The team started with a 0–4–1 record, but rattled off six straight wins after the war ended and players returned from service overseas. Within weeks of Brown's final Bluejackets game, a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame, he set off for his new job in Cleveland.|$|E
