Alternatives to penicillins may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. Therefore, we used decision analysis to calculate maximum expected utility and minimum cost for skin-testing or not skin-testing patients who have endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus that is susceptible to cloxacillin and who have a questionable history of <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to penicillin. We used known probabilities of intermediate outcomes, actual costs, and measured utilities and in-cluded one-way sensitivity analysis.

40|$|<b>Immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivities</b> {{are known}} to be {{mediated}} primarily by antibodies reacting with homologous antigens. One of the biological properties of the immunoglobulins involved in immediate hypersensitivities is a capacity to sensitize skin such that subsequent exposure of the host to antigen results in immediate-type dermal reactions. The immunoglobulins capable of passively sensitizing skin of individuals within a species (homocytotropic antibodies, 1) have been found among diverse species. Whereas one class of homocytotropic antibody has so far been described for species such as rabbit (2 - 5), dog (6), and monkey (7), two classes have been clearly defined for man (8 - 10), rat (11 - 13), mouse (14 - 19), and guinea pig (20 - 30). To illustrate the two classes, among guinea pigs there exists a heat-stable IgG 1 that confers passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) 1 after a latent period of several hours (20 - 29). Though subdivision of this class has been suggested on the basis of different latency period requirements, i. e. 4 hr vs. 16 hr, immunoglobulins of this type share common antigenic determinants (31).

40|$|Atopy can be {{considered}} one of the most important risk factor for conditions such as hay fever, asthma and also chronic airflow obstruction [1, 2].

40|$|THE aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the effect of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) on {{allergen}} and anti-IgE mediated histamine release from basophils and human skin mast cells and to assess whether soluble recombinant interleukin- 4 receptor (sIL- 4 R) can inhibit these effects. Anti-IgE stimulated histamine release from peripheral blood basophils and mast cells of atopic donors was enhanced after preincubation with IL- 4, whereas after preincubation with sIL- 4 R it was inhibited. These effects were even more pronounced when samples were stimulated with a clinically relevant allergen. In IL- 4 preincubated skin mast cells, there was a similar enhancement of anti-IgE stimulated histamine release, which could again be inhibited by sIL- 4 R. The effects of IL- 4 and sIL- 4 R were dose- and time-dependent. Mice sensitized to ovalbumin and treated with soluble recombinant murine sIL- 4 R showed signi � cantly reduced <b>immediate-type</b> cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> responses compared with untreated mice. These in vivo effects were IgE independent, since there were no signi � cant differences in total and allergen speci � c IgE/IgG 1 antibody titres between treated and untreated mice. This indicates that IL- 4 exerts priming effects on histamine release by effector cells of the allergic response and that these effects are potently antagonized by soluble IL- 4 R both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Background: A case {{in which}} a 45 -year-old female patient with {{peritonitis}} experienced <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> on two occasions after administration of preparations containing six different medications was referred to us for closer inspection. Methods/Results: Skin tests performed on the six medications revealed a positive reaction to the vitamin B 6 preparation Biosechs (Wakamoto Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). Further investigation showed that the principal ingredient, pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP), produced a positive reaction, whereas the injection solvent with the principal ingredient removed produced a negative reaction. When compounds similar to PLP were tested, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine and pyridoxal produced a negative reaction, whereas pyridoxine 5 '-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5 '-phosphate (PMP) produced a positive reaction. Adenosine 2 '-phosphate and adenosine 5 '-diphosphate were also tested and these produced a negative reaction. When a histamine-release test was performed, PLP and PMP produced a positive reaction, whereas PN produced a negative reaction. When all tests were performed on three control subjects, the results were all negative. Conclusions: In this very rare case, phosphate radical conjugates with a pyridine nucleus became haptenic-epitope and an immediate-type reaction occurred. In past cases involving hypersensitivity to vitamin B 6, two cases involved a photoallergic reaction caused by PN and one case involved an <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> caused by PLP In the past cases, closely related substances had not been tested and an epitope was not identified...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Immediate-type</b> <b>{{hypersensitivity}}</b> to glucocorticosteroids is rare {{but well}} known among allergists. Surprisingly, very few reports of glucocorticosteroid hypersensitivity in children exist although glucocorticosteroid treatment is particularly common {{in this age}} group. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 2 -year-old boy who developed generalized urticaria, facial angio-oedema, nausea and severe dyspnoea after intravenous application of prednisolone- 21 -hydrogen succinate. Skin prick testing with prednisolone- 21 -hydrogen succinate elicited a positive result; no reactions were observed to prednisone, betamethasone or dexamethasone. While fluorescence enzyme immunoassay analysis revealed no specific IgE antibodies against prednisolone- 21 -hydrogen succinate, CD 63 -based basophil activation testing with the culprit drug prednisolone- 21 -hydrogen succinate was positive. In contrast, additional incubation of basophils with prednisone, betamethasone and dexamethasone did not elicit any significant response. Hence, we performed an oral provocation test with betamethasone and a titrated intravenous dexamethasone challenge. As both drugs were tolerated without any complications they were recommended for future treatment. Conclusion In a child with confirmed <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to glucocorticosteroids, it is still not possible to predict which glucocorticosteroid might be tolerated by solely relying on clinical history or results of skin and in vitro testing. Therefore, incremental glucocorticosteroid challenges under standardized clinical conditions remain necessary in order to facilitate a patient-tailored emergency treatment and to avoid severe reactions to glucocorticosteroids in these patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} current use of Australian snake antivenoms and {{the frequency}} and severity of <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions. DESIGN: Nested prospective cohort study {{as part of the}} Australian Snakebite Project. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Patients receiving snake antivenom in Australian hospitals between 1 January 2002 and 30 November 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The use of CSL Limited antivenom; frequency and severity of hypersensitivity reactions to antivenom; premedication and treatment of these reactions. RESULTS: Snake antivenom was administered to 195 patients, mostly for venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (145 patients, 74 %), followed by non-specific systemic effects (12 %), neurotoxicity (5 %) and myotoxicity (4 %). Antivenom was given to nine patients (5 %) without evidence of envenoming or who were bitten by a species of snake for which antivenom is not required. The commonest antivenoms used were brown snake (46 %), tiger snake (30 %) and polyvalent (11 %). The median dose was four vials (interquartile range, 2 - 5 vials), and 24 patients received two different types of antivenom. <b>Immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions occurred in 48 patients (25 %); 21 satisfied our definition of anaphylaxis, with 11 moderate and 10 severe cases, including nine in which patients were hypotensive. The remaining 27 reactions were mild (skin only). Adrenaline was used in 26 cases with good effect. The frequency of reactions to tiger snake (41 %) and polyvalent (41 %) antivenoms was higher than that to brown snake antivenom (10 %). Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 11 of 40 patients receiving any form of premedication (28 %) and in 2 of 11 given adrenaline for premedication (18 %) versus 20 of 86 not receiving premedication (23 %). CONCLUSIONS: Antivenom was used appropriately, and most commonly for coagulopathy. Hypersensitivity reactions were common, but most were not severe. The discretionary use of premedication was not associated with any reduction in reactions. Geoffrey K. Isbister, Simon G. Brown, Ellen MacDonald, Julian White and Bart J.

40|$|IgE binds to {{two types}} of Fc receptors, called Fc∈R 1 (or high-affinity Fc∈R) and Fc∈R 2 (or low-affinity Fc∈R). The Fc∈R 1 is {{composed}} of four polypeptide chains, one α, one β, and two γ chains. The α chain contains the IgE binding site {{and is a member}} of the immunoglobulin supergene family. The Fc∈R 2, also called CD 23, consists of one polypeptide chain which shows homology to animal lectin receptors. Fc∈R 1 are expressed on mast cells and basophils. Crosslinking of the Fc∈R 1 induces immediate release of mediators of inflammation such as histamine and leukotrienes and delayed secretion of interleukins 4, 5, and 6. Fc∈R 2 are expressed on resting μδ+ B cells, monocytes/macrophages (MΦ), eosinophils, and platelets but rarely on T cells. Interleukin- 4 up-regulates Fc∈R 2 expression on B cells and MΦ. The functions of Fc∈R 2 on the different cell types are not fully established and are controversial. Fc∈R 2 on MΦ, eosinophils, and platelets mediate cytotoxicity to schistosomules, enhance phagocytosis, and induce the release of granule enzymes. However, MΦ from patients with atopic dermatitis expressing significantly more Fc∈R 2 than MΦ from normals do not release more leukotriene C 4, prostaglandin E 2, or β-glucuronidase after incubation with aggregated IgE than normal monocytes. Furthermore, aggregated IgG 1 is much more efficient than IgE in inducing mediator release from MΦ and IgG 1 antibodies are not known to induce <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions. Therefore, definitive proof that Fc∈R 2 are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders is still lacking. IL- 4 appears to play a central role in <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> It induces human B cells to secrete IgE and IgG 4, Ig isotypes typical for antibodies to helminthic parasites and allergens. IL- 4 stimulates mast cell growth and up-regulates Fc∈R 2 expression. Interferon-γ and IL- 2 inhibit the IL- 4 -induced IgG 4 and IgE secretion. Whether the abnormally high IgE antibody production in atopic patients is the result of overproduction of IL- 4 or deficient IFN-γ/IL- 2 production is presently unknown...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, {{frequently}} administered for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. Numerous {{studies have}} shown that daptomycin is relatively safe and well tolerated. Serious adverse events possibly related to this antimicrobial compound are rare. We report a case of acute angioedema triggered by daptomycin. CASE REPORT A 60 -year-old woman with S. aureus bacteremia without identified source was treated intravenously with high-dose beta-lactams at our institution. Because S. aureus bacteremia persisted on day 6, and in parallel, acute kidney injury developed, antimicrobial treatment was switched to a combination therapy with daptomycin and ceftriaxone. Shortly after completion of the first daptomycin administration, the patient developed lip and tongue swelling and dyspnea. Acute angioedema was clinically evident. Antibiotic therapy was switched to vancomycin, and the further clinical course was favorable. An intradermal test showed a significant wheal diameter for daptomycin, but negative results for ceftriaxone. CONCLUSION The association with daptomycin in this case is either probable or certain.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} has been provided that IgE represents a distinct class of immunoglobulins that initiate <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions in man and also in other species (1). Using a priming regimen to elicit a good reaginic antibody response, {{we have been able}} to demonstrate that antibodies of the IgE class are capable of eliciting tissue sensitization in the bovine species (2) as well. The molecular basis for the mediator role of IgE involves the linking of the Fc part to membrane receptors on basophilic granulocytes and mast cells (3, 4). The current general opinion holds that for eliciting of an optimal anaphylactic response the allergen must carry at least two haptenic determinants per molecule within a relatively short distance (5, 6) and reactions occurring consequent to monovalent interactions are considered rather exceptional (7, 8). The apparent requirement for bivalency of the hapten was interpreted as indicating that the bridging of two combining sites on adjacent cell-bound antibody molecules is the prerequisite for the release of pharmacologically active substances (9). The possibility that bridging of two cell-bound reaginic antibod...|$|E

To investigate the role of delayed hypersensitivity (DH) in immunity and protection against HSV, we developed a murine model using the ear-swelling assay.

The kinetics of development of ear swelling were typical of DH: maximal swelling occurred 24 h post challenge and was diminished by 48 h, and the cellular infiltrate was predominantly mononuclear. Four-hour swelling, indicative of antibody-mediated, <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> was not detected until 15 days post immunization.

40|$|Basophils are an {{infrequent}} type of leukocyte {{that bear}} high affinity IgE receptors, contain important amounts ofhistamine in their granules, and {{are capable of}} generating high levels of sulfidoleukotrienes. They are activated after IgE receptor crosslinking, and their products lead to the well-known signs of <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (1). Basophils are also activated by IgE-independent mechanisms, and may thus contribute to nonallergic inflammatory responses. So far two well-defined chemotactic peptides, the anaphylatoxin C 5 a and the bacterial product analogue FMLP, {{have been shown to}} induce basophil degranulation (1, 2).

40|$|Allergen-specific {{immunoglobulin}} E (IgE) mediates <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{reactions and}} plays {{a central role}} in allergic diseases. Although antigen-driven B-cell maturation and isotype switching occur within germinal centres (GCs), the role of GCs in IgE production is poorly understood. In view of this, we investigated the development of IgE-expressing cells within GCs in response to an extensively characterized antigen, 2 -phenyloxazolone (phOx). The phOx-specific IgE-expressing cells localized within GCs 7 days after immunization, and peaked in number on day 11. Surprisingly, very few IgE-positive cells were found in the T-cell areas of the lymph node. Flow cytometric studies confirmed that IgE was expressed by B cells and was not the result of trapping by follicular dendritic cells. The specificity of the antibody response was confirmed by microdissection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using phOx-specific IgE primers.

ECF-A was subsequently established as a totally preformed mediator in human nasal polyps (3) and lung fragments (4), and its association with tissue mast cells was demonstrated by extraction from dispersed human lung mast cells after their isopycnic and isokinetic purification (5). The mast cell subcellular localization of this preformed mediator was established by its isolation from purified rat peritoneal mast cells where it was contained in the granules (4). ECF-A released by IgE-mediated immunologic mechanisms (2, 4) had a mol wt of 500 and elicited preferential eosinophil chemotaxis, and a principle with these characteristics was therefore isolated from among the various activities present in human lung extracts (6, 7). After extraction from human lung, sequential purification of this low mol wt eosinophilotactic activity by Sephadex G- 25, Dowex- 1, Sephadex G- 10, and paper chromatography led to the identification of two acidic peptides of sequenc...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to isocyanate vapors or aerosols {{is associated with}} irritative and toxic effects on the airways {{as well as with}} <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions. Nowadays, isocyanates belong to the most important causes of occupational asthma in western countries. Some of the affected subjects suffer from rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. A rare disorder is isocyanate alveolitis. The first hints of isocyanateinduced respiratory disorders are frequently workplace-related cough and shortness of breath. Sometimes, symptoms of unspecific bronchial hyperreactivity or chronic bronchitis are the only complaints. There is also evidence for genotoxic effects of isocyanates which have not been clarified in detail. To ensure reversibility, the early diagnosis of isocyanate disorders followed by the avoidance of the causative substances is required. On the other hand, continuing exposure of sensitized subjects may lead to persistent or even progressive diseases. It seems timely to evaluate current threshold limit values (TLV), especially for oligo- and polyisocyanates, and to stipulate medical surveillance programs including suitable biological monitoring of isocyanate workers. Preventive measures ought to be improved in many workplaces. Updated protection equipment such as closed machinery with encapsulation, efficient exhaust systems, positive pressure hoods as well as masks significantly reduce the health risks...|$|E
40|$|Immunization of BALB/c mice with {{denatured}} DNA (dnDNA) -methylated {{bovine serum}} albumin (MBSA) complex along with aluminium hydroxide gel as adjuvant, {{resulted in the}} induction of anti-DNA antibodies of both IgG and IgE isotypes demonstrable by avidin-biotin micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and solid phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA), respectively. In contrast to {{the high levels of}} IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b anti-DNA antibodies observed in SLE-prone autoimmune mice, more than 90 % of the anti-DNA antibodies of IgG isotype were found to be of IgG 1 subclass. Specificity of both IgG and IgE antibodies which recognized activated DNA, dnDNA and double-stranded DNA but not RNA was established by competitive ELISA and SPRIA inhibition assays. These antibodies cross-reacted with cibacron blue and chondroitin sulfate but not with various other proteoglycans, nucleosides and nucleotides. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in rats showed that these antibodies are capable of inducing in vivo degranulation of mast cells in a dose-dependent manner. These studies lend support to the concept that IgE antibodies directed against DNA may mediate mast cell degranulation and thus contribute to <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> phenomena including hives seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and to the localization of IgE-nucleic acid complexes...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of avidin-biotin microELISA and solid phase radioimmunoassay, we examined sera from 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), two patients with established sensitivity to ingested shrimp, and 15 healthy normal subjects. In addition to IgG antibodies, varying amounts of IgE antibodies specific for native DNA (nDNA), denatured or single-stranded DNA (dnDNA), RNA, and tRNA were demonstrable in the sera of SLE patients, {{but not in the}} sera of normal subjects. A comparison of the specificity of nucleic acid-specific IgE antibodies present in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients with those present in the sera of seven SLE patients revealed that the IgE antibodies in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients specifically recognized shrimp tRNA but not yeast tRNA, calf thymus RNA, or calf thymus DNA, while those present in the sera of patients with SLE recognized all these nucleic acid antigens. The IgE antibodies directed against nDNA, dnDNA, RNA, and tRNA may mediate mast cell and basophil degranulation and thus contribute both to <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> phenomena including hives seen in patients with SLE and to the localization of IgE-nucleic acid complexes in target...|$|E
40|$|The immunodominant CD 4 T cell epitope of the {{bacteriophage}} k cI {{repressor protein}} in several inbred mouse strains {{can be represented}} by a peptide encompassing amino acids 12 - 26. Here, we show that this peptide, {{and a variety of}} its sequence variants, can induce <b>immediate-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in mice. 12 - 26 variants that differ by as little as single amino acid residues deviate greatly in their ability to induce hypersensitivity. Further, differences in major histocompatibility complex class II alleles appear to be as influential as changes in peptide structure in determining whether hypersensitivity is developed. The ability of a given peptide-class II combination to induce hypersensitivity correlates with production of peptide-specific antibody, but not with ability or inability to induce a T cell proliferative response. Administration of anti-interleukin 4 (IL- 4) mAb prevents the development of hypersensitivity, and analysis of cytokine production by T cell hybridomas derived from peptide-immunized mice suggests that whether a given peptide-class II combination can induce hypersensitivity depends on its ability to induce IL- 4 production. The data demonstrate that changes {{in the nature of the}} epitope(s) recognized by the CD 4 T cell population can result in qualitative differences in the response elicited in this population, ultimately leading to dramatic quantitative and qualitative variations in the effecto...|$|E
