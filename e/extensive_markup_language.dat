40|$|For most index {{structures}} for XML data proposed so far, update {{is a problem}} because XML element's coordinates are expressed by absolute values. Due to the structural relationship among elements in XML documents, we have to re-compute these absolute values if the content of source data is updated. The reconstruction requires update of large portion of index files, which causes a serious problem especially when XML data content is frequently updated. In this paper, we propose an indexing structure scheme based on the Relative Region Coordinate that can effectively deal with the update problem. The main idea is that we express the coordinate of an XML element based on the region of its parent element. We present an algorithm to construct a treestructured index in which related coordinates are stored together. In consequence, our indexing scheme requires update of {{only a small portion}} of index file in case of updating. 1.

40|$|Net-Centric Operational Warfare (NCOW) {{describes}} how the United States Department of Defense (DoD) will conduct business operations, warfare, and enterprise management in the future. It {{is based on the}} information technology (IT) concept of an assured, dynamic, and shared information environment that provides access to trusted information for all users, based on need, independent of time and place. NCOW is an information-enabled concept of operations that generates increased combat power by networking sensors, decision makers, and shooters. This enables shared awareness, increased speed of command, higher tempo of operations, greater lethality, increased survivability, and a degree of selfsynchronization. In essence, network-centric warfare translates information superiority into combat power by effectively linking knowledgeable entities in the battlespace. The DoD has mandated that the Global Information Grid (GIG) will be the primary infrastructure capability to support NCOW. Under this directive, all advanced weapons platforms, sensor systems, and command and control centers are eventually to be linked via the GIG. In the DoD vision, implementation of this massive integration effort relies on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) model and Net-Centric Data Strategy approach, along with extensive use of the <b>Extensive</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (XML) and other web service standards.

This paper presents a natural language engineering based framework for generating the Urdu language text from English language. A rule based algorithm is designed to read the input text, understand it and convert into another natural language. This research was conducted to incorporate the vigorous ability of this algorithm to read input English language text from websites and convert it into desired output natural language as Urdu. The designed system uses <b>extensive</b> <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> to represent the input text into a standard format. As XML also has a valuable ability to use Unicode for text representation, hence the text represented in the Unicode can effortlessly be converted into Urdu language.

This is a very effective and efficient way of converting an English website into Urdu website with a single click of the mouse within no time...|$|E
40|$|The {{semantic}} {{integration of}} geographically distributed and heterogeneous data resources still remains a key challenge in Grid infrastructures. Today's mainstream Grid technologies hold {{the promise to}} meet this challenge in a systematic manner, making data applications more scalable and manageable. The thesis conducts a thorough investigation of the problem, {{the state of the}} art, and the related technologies, and proposes an Architecture for Semantic Integration of Data Sources (ASIDS) addressing the semantic heterogeneity issue. It defines a simple mechanism for the interoperability of heterogeneous data sources in order to extract or discover information regardless of their different semantics. The constituent technologies of this architecture include Globus Toolkit (GT 4) and OGSA-DAI (Open Grid Service Architecture Data Integration and Access) alongside other web services technologies such as XML (<b>Extensive</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language).</b> To show this, the ASIDS architecture was implemented and tested in a realistic setting by building an exemplar application prototype on a HealthGrid (pilot implementation). The study followed an empirical research methodology and was informed by extensive literature surveys and a critical analysis of the relevant technologies and their synergies. The two literature reviews, together with the analysis of the technology background, have provided a good overview of the current Grid and HealthGrid landscape, produced some valuable taxonomies, explored new paths by integrating technologies, and more importantly illuminated the problem and guided the research process towards a promising solution. Yet the primary contribution of this research is an approach that uses contemporary Grid technologies for integrating heterogeneous data resources that have semantically different. data fields (attributes). It has been practically demonstrated (using a prototype HealthGrid) that discovery in semantically integrated distributed data sources can be feasible by using mainstream Grid technologies, which have been shown to have some Significant advantages over non-Grid based approaches.
