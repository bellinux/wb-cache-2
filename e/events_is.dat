5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these <b>events</b> <b>is</b> disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E

5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} <b>events</b> <b>is</b> recorded by the deposits related to the emplacement of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the <b>events</b> <b>is</b> that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual <b>events</b> <b>is</b> unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{competition}} rules and physical demands, long distance track races {{have much in}} common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and race tactics become much greater factors in performances.

5|$|Siward {{is perhaps}} most famous for his {{expedition}} in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the Libellus de Exordio, in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no {{connection between the two}} <b>events</b> <b>is</b> clear it is likely that they were linked.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on {{the distance that}} the object is thrown.

Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all <b>events</b> <b>is</b> the winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation is}} the earldom hypothesis.

5|$|Bär's 204th and 205th victories, {{against two}} Hawker Typhoons, were {{achieved}} on 1 January 1945 during Unternehmen Bodenplatte, a Luftwaffe mass attack against Allied airfields in the Benelux area. The operation resulted {{in hundreds of}} aircraft losses on both sides. Bär's JG3 contributed by raiding Eindhoven in the Netherlands, shooting down about six RAF fighters and destroying many aircraft on the ground. One of Bär's 'aerial kills' {{may not have been}} airborne. Historian Norman Franks states both aircraft, from No. 438 Squadron RAF, were taxiing when hit. Flight Lieutenant Pete Wilson was wounded and later died from his injuries after Bär's strafing attack. The second Typhoon did get airborne. Its pilot, Flight Officer Ross Keller was killed. This version of <b>events</b> <b>is</b> contradicted by a witness, Pilot Officer 'Bill' Harle, who thought both aircraft were airborne.|$|E
5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable <b>events</b> <b>is</b> calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E
