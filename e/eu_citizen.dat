25|$|The European Parliament, the Council of Europe and the Baltic Sea States Conference have {{produced}} various recommendations {{in favor of}} the introduction of the right to vote and of eligibility to all foreign residents in local elections. The 1992 Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level from the Council of Europe, is opened to signatures and ratifications. Then there is the Council Directive 94/80/EG from the 19th of December 1994 defining to which political organs other <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> can vote.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{described}} the three-city arrangement as a [...] "travelling circus" [...] with a cost an extra 200 million euro over a single location. Defenders of the Strasbourg seat, like the MEP for Germany Bernd Posselt, however claim that the figure is rather a mere 40 million euro, i.e. an extra cost of 8 cents per <b>EU</b> <b>citizen.</b> When Parliament was forced to meet in Brussels in September 2008, due to a fault in the Strasbourg building, {{it was estimated that}} Parliament saved between €3 and 4 million, though the exact figure is hard to calculate. As the Commission also meets in Strasbourg when Parliament is out of Brussels, the cost of Commissioners moving amounted to €9.5 million between 2002 and 2007. The Green party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert, MEP and Caroline Lucas, MEP; in addition to the extra financial cost, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. Jens-Peter Bonde, former leader of the ID group, stated in 2007 that unless the issue of the seat was tackled, {{it would be impossible to}} increase the election's turnout, as the movement of the seat was the issue raised by voters most often. He, along with Green co-leader Monica Frassoni, called for a debate on the issue, which was being blocked by President Hans-Gert Pöttering.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the visibility}} of European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>citizens</b> in <b>EU</b> news during the 2009 European Parliament election. It argues {{that the presence of}} <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> in <b>EU</b> news is vital for responsiveness of European governance. First, the theoretical notion of <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> is considered. Next, a new way of defining <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> is proposed: <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> are divided into national and supranational <b>EU</b> <b>citizens.</b> The visibility of <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> in <b>EU</b> news of 27 EU member states is analysed aiming to explain cross-country differences. The paper is based on a large-scale content analysis of TV and newspaper articles gathered during the 2009 European Parliament election. To explain different levels of visibility, a multi-level analysis is carried out. The results suggest that <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> are visible in the EU news, yet, their presence strongly varies across countries. The findings indicate that explanations for different levels of visibility can be found at both the media and country level...|$|R

2500|$|Fourth, {{and more}} debated, article 24 {{requires}} that the longer an <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> stays in a host state, the more rights they have to access public and welfare services, {{on the basis of}} equal treatment. This reflects general principles of equal treatment and citizenship in TFEU articles 18 and 20. In a simple case, in Sala v Freistaat Bayern the Court of Justice held that a Spanish lady who had lived in Germany for 25 years and had a baby was entitled to child support, without the need for a residence permit, because Germans did not need one. In Trojani v Centre public d'aide sociale de Bruxelles, a French man who lived in Belgium for two years was entitled to the [...] "minimex" [...] allowance from the state for a minimum living wage. In Grzelczyk v Centre Public d'Aide Sociale d'Ottignes-Louvain-la-Neuve a French student, who had lived in Belgium for three years, was entitled to receive the [...] "minimex" [...] income support for his fourth year of study. Similarly, in R (Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing the Court of Justice held that it was lawful to require a French UCL economics student lived in the UK for three years before receiving a student loan, but not that he had to have additional [...] "settled status". Similarly, in Commission v Austria, Austria was not entitled to restrict its university places to Austrian students to avoid [...] "structural, staffing and financial problems" [...] if (mainly German) foreign students applied, unless it proved there was an actual problem. However, in Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig, the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny child support to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked. Because she lived in Germany for over 3 months, but under 5 years, she had to show evidence of [...] "sufficient resources", since the Court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7.|$|E

5000|$|One {{school of}} legal thought {{indicates}} that the Maastricht treaty created the European Union as a legal entity, it then also created the status of <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> which gave an individual relationship between the EU and its citizens, and a status of <b>EU</b> <b>citizen.</b> Clemens Rieder suggests a {{case can be made}} that [...] "none of the Member States were forced to confer the status of EU citizenship on their citizens but once they have, according to this argument, they cannot simply withdraw this status.". In this situation, no <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> would involuntarily lose their citizenship due to their nation's withdrawal from the EU.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to holding a passport, EU citizens can also use a valid national identity card to exercise their right of free movement within the EEA and Switzerland. Strictly speaking, {{it is not necessary}} for an <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> to possess a valid passport or national identity card to enter the EEA or Switzerland. In theory, if an <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> outside of both the EEA and Switzerland can prove their nationality by any other means (e.g. by presenting an expired passport or national identity card, or a citizenship certificate), they must be permitted to enter the EEA or Switzerland. An <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> who is unable to demonstrate their nationality satisfactorily must nonetheless be given 'every reasonable opportunity' to obtain the necessary documents or to have them delivered within a reasonable period of time.|$|E

An AVC is issued only for President of Poland elections, parliamentary elections and elections to the European Parliament (in that case, the AVC can be got by Polish or <b>EU</b> <b>citizen,</b> so the <b>EU</b> <b>citizen</b> can vote for polish deputees at polling station in Poland and polish embassies or consulates, or for deputees from the country of origin.

40|$|The core {{right of}} EU {{citizenship}} is {{freedom of movement}} within {{the territory of the}} Union. But <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> who live in a member state other than their homeland cannot vote in the national elections of that country unless they first acquire its citizenship through naturalisation. In several member states they also lose their right to vote in national elections of their country of origin when they have lived abroad for too long. A group of <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> has started a European Citizens' Initiative to propose <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> should have the franchise to vote in national elections of their country of residence. This working paper collects all the contributions to a EUDO CITIZENSHIP forum debate on this proposal. While all authors agree that the loss of democratic participation rights due to the exercise of free movement rights is contrary to the spirit of EU citizenship, they disagree to a certain extent on what the right answer to this problem is: should <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> vote in their countries of origin, of residence, or be given a choice? Should third country nationals be included in a broader electoral reform? How will it be possible to convince a sufficient number of <b>EU</b> <b>citizens</b> of this initiative, given the disappointing turnout rates in European Parliament elections...|$|R
