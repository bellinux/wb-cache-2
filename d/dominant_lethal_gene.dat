40|$|Dengue and dengue {{hemorrhagic fever}} are {{increasing}} public health problems {{with an estimated}} 50 – 100  million new infections each year. Aedes aegypti is the major vector of dengue viruses in its range and control of this mosquito would reduce significantly human morbidity and mortality. Present mosquito control methods are not sufficiently effective and new approaches are needed urgently. A “sterile-male-release” strategy based on the release of mosquitoes carrying a conditional <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> is an attractive new control methodology. Transgenic strains of Aedes aegypti were engineered to have a repressible female-specific flightless phenotype using either two separate transgenes or a single transgene, based {{on the use of}} a female-specific indirect flight muscle promoter from the Aedes aegypti Actin- 4 gene. These strains eliminate the need for sterilization by irradiation, permit male-only release (“genetic sexing”), and enable the release of eggs instead of adults. Furthermore, these strains are expected to facilitate area-wide control or elimination of dengue if adopted as part of an integrated pest management strategy...|$|E

Methods: The study examined the induction of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells, morphological sperm abnormalities, the effect on <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> and protein synthesis.

The dose of 52 mg/kg body weight induced significant percentage of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells after repeated treatment for 7 and 14 days. Significant effect of morphological sperm abnormalities was demonstrated only after treatment with the dose of 52 mg/kg body weight. For examining the dominant lethal mutation, male mice were injected with dose of 39 mg/kg body weight for 5 consecutive days.

40|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is a vector of several arboviruses including dengue and chikungunya. This highly invasive species originates from Southeast Asia and has {{spread across the}} world in the last 30 years. It is now established in Europe, North and South America, Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In the absence of vaccine or antiviral drugs, efficient mosquito control strategies are crucial. Conventional control methods have so far failed to adequately control Ae. albopictus. Using germline transformation technology, a technique known as Release of Insects carrying a <b>Dominant</b> <b>Lethal</b> (RIDL) proposes to enhance the sterile insect technique by replacing irradiation with inherited <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>genes.</b> While this technology has recently shown some success in the field against the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.), it remains to be implemented against Ae. albopictus. This thesis presents the development and application of gene transfer and site-specific integration technologies in Ae. albopictus, as well as the creation of tetracycline-repressible, female-specific flightless lines for vector control based on the RIDL method. Germline transformation and site-specific integration were performed using the piggyBac transposon and the ФC 31 system, respectively. Ae. albopictus RIDL strains showing a conditional female-specific flightless phenotype were created using both the Ae. aegypti and the Ae. albopictus Actin- 4 regulatory regions. Conditionality was provided by the ‘Tet-Off’ system, which is suppressed in the presence of tetracycline (and suitable analogues). One of these strains was assessed for attributes relevant to a RIDL control programme. Specific tailoring of the RIDL transgene with alternative transactivator elements was investigated using the ФC 31 system. The work presented in this thesis lays the foundations for the application of the RIDL strategy to Ae. albopictus, an innovative vector-control method offering a promising alternative for efficient control of this highly invasive insect.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is a vector {{of several}} arboviruses {{including}} dengue and chikungunya, {{and is also}} a significant nuisance mosquito. It {{is one of the}} most invasive of mosquitoes with a relentlessly increasing geographic distribution. Conventional control methods have so far failed to control Ae. albopictus adequately. Novel genetics-based strategies offer a promising alternative or aid towards efficient control of this mosquito. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe here the isolation, characterisation and use of the Ae. albopictus Actin- 4 gene to drive a <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> in the indirect flight muscles of Ae. albopictus, thus inducing a conditional female-specific late-acting flightless phenotype. We also show that in this context, the Actin- 4 regulatory regions from both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti can be used to provide conditional female-specific flightlessness in either species. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: With the disease-transmitting females incapacitated, the female flightless phenotype encompasses a genetic sexing mechanism and would be suitable for controlling Ae. albopictus using a male-only release approach as part of an integrated pest management strategy...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} {{based on}} mosquitoes carrying a conditional <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> (release of insects carrying a dominant lethal, RIDL) {{is being developed}} to control the transmission of dengue viruses by vector population suppression. A transgenic strain, designated OX 3604 C, of the major dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, was engineered to have a repressible female-specific flightless phenotype. This strain circumvents the need for radiation-induced sterilization, allows genetic sexing resulting in male-only releases, and permits the release of eggs instead of adult mosquitoes. OX 3604 C males introduced weekly into large laboratory cages containing stable target mosquito populations at initial ratios of 8. 5 – 10 ∶ 1 OX 3604 C∶target eliminated the populations within 10 – 20  weeks. These data support the further testing of this strain in contained or confined field trials to evaluate mating competitiveness and environmental and other effects. Successful completion of the field trials should facilitate incorporation of this approach into area-wide dengue control or elimination efforts {{as a component of}} an integrated vector management strategy...|$|E
40|$|OX 513 A is a {{transgenic}} {{strain of}} Aedes aegypti engineered {{to carry a}} dominant, non-sex-specific, late-acting lethal genetic system that is repressed {{in the presence of}} tetracycline. It was designed for use in a sterile-insect (SIT) pest control system called RIDL® (Release of Insects carrying a <b>Dominant</b> <b>Lethal</b> <b>gene)</b> by which transgenic males are released in the field to mate with wild females; in the absence of tetracycline, the progeny from such matings will not survive. We investigated the mating fitness of OX 513 A in the laboratory. Male OX 513 A were as effective as Rockefeller (ROCK) males at inducing refractoriness to further mating in wild type females and there was no reduction in their ability to inseminate multiple females. They had a lower mating success but yielded more progeny than the wild-type comparator strain (ROCK) when one male of each strain was caged with a ROCK female. Mating success and fertility of groups of 10 males-with different ratios of RIDL to ROCK-competing for five ROCK females was similar, but the median longevity of RIDL males was somewhat (18 %) lower. We conclude that the fitness under laboratory conditions of OX 513 A males carrying a tetracycline repressible lethal gene is comparable to that of males of the wild-type comparator strain...|$|E
50|$|Release of Insects {{carrying}} <b>Dominant</b> <b>Lethals</b> (RIDL) is {{a control}} strategy using genetically engineered insects that have (carry) a <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> in their genome (an organism's DNA). <b>Lethal</b> <b>genes</b> cause death in an organism, and RIDl genes only kill young insects, usually larvae or pupae. Similar to how inheritance of brown eyes is dominant to blue eyes, this <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> is <b>dominant</b> {{so that all}} offspring of the RIDL insect will also inherit the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene.</b> This <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> has a molecular on and off switch, allowing these RIDL insects to be reared. The <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> is turned off when the RIDL insects are mass reared in an insectory, and turned on when they are released into the environment. RIDL males and females are released to mate with wild males and their offspring die when they reach the larval or pupal stage because of the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene.</b> This causes the population of insects to crash. This technique is being developed for some insects and for other insects has been tested in the field.

40|$|The {{ability to}} genetically {{engineer}} insects {{has opened the}} door to the development of new pest control techniques, notably the improvement of the sterile insect technique (SIT), in which radiation-sterilised insects are mass-released to suppress the wild population. Genetics-based methods may provide an alternative to irradiation, which can decreases the competitiveness of sterilised insects, by engineering repressible dominant lethality, a technique known as Release of Insects carrying a <b>Dominant</b> <b>Lethal</b> (RIDL®). <b>Gene</b> transfer and site-specific recombination technologies have here been developed in two lepidopteran pests, as the first step in the development of genetic control methods. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is a major pest of cruciferous crops and is difficult to control, mainly due to widespread resistance to insecticides, so the development of new control measures is needed. The first germline transformation of the diamondback moth has been achieved, using the piggyBac transposable element. The functionality and utility of the ΦC 31 integrase, Cre and Flp recombinases in the manipulation of the diamondback moth genome has been demonstrated, and the use of recombinase-mediated cassette exchange using lox and FRT heterospecific sites has been investigated. The pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, is a significant pest of cotton. In south-western USA this moth is a target of SIT; the development of a pink bollworm female-sterile strain would remove the need for sterilisation by irradiation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{morbidity}} and mortality from malaria and dengue fever among other pathogens are an increasing Public Health problem.

There are insufficient specific therapeutic drugs available and there are no reliable vaccines for malaria or dengue, although some progress has been achieved, there {{is still a long way}} between its development and actual field use. Most mosquito control measures have failed to achieve their goals, mostly because of the mosquito's great reproductive capacity and genomic flexibility. Chemical control is increasingly restricted due to potential human toxicity, mortality in no target organisms, insecticide resistance, and other environmental impacts. Other strategies for mosquito control are desperately needed. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a species-specific and environmentally benign method for insect population suppression, it is based on mass rearing, radiation mediated sterilization, and release of a large number of male insects. Releasing of Insects carrying a <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> (RIDL) offers a solution to many of the drawbacks of traditional SIT that have limited its application in mosquitoes while maintaining its environmentally friendly and species-specific utility. The self-limiting nature of sterile mosquitoes tends to make the issues related to field use of these somewhat less challenging than for self-spreading systems characteristic of population replacement strategies. They also are closer to field use, so might be appropriate to consider first. The prospect of genetic control methods against mosquito vectored human diseases is rapidly becoming a reality, many decisions will need to be made on a national, regional and international level regarding the biosafety, social, cultural and ethical aspects of the use and deployment of these vector control methods...|$|E

The fertility ofAe. aegypti populations can be reduced by the use of autocidal oviposition cups that prevent the development of mosquitoes inside the trap by mechanical means or larvicides, as well as by releasing sterile, transgenic, and para-transgenic mosquitoes. Survival and fertility can be simultaneously reduced by capturing gravid female Ae. aegypti with sticky gravid traps. We tested the effectiveness of the novel Centers for Disease Control and Prevention autocidal gravid ovitrap (CDC-AGO trap) to control natural populations ofAe. aegypti under field conditions in two isolated urban areas (reference vs. intervention areas) in southern Puerto Rico for 1 yr. There were significant reductions in the captures of female Ae. aegypti (53 - 70 %) in the intervention area The presence of three to four AGO control traps per home in 81 % of the houses prevented outbreaks of Ae. aegypti, which would be expected after rains. Mosquito captures in BG-Sentinel and AGO traps were significantly and positively correlated, showing that AGO traps are useful and inexpensive mosquito surveillance devices.

Treatment of dengue fever is currently limited to case management and there are, at present, no licensed vaccines available. As a result, the front-line defence against dengue fever remains vector control. Modern approaches to vector control are attempting to push forward new techniques to target the mosquito vectors of dengue. One such technique is the release of transgenic insects that are genetically sterile due to a conditional <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene.</b> This modern adaptation of the traditional sterile insect technique is at the forefront of current new vector control solutions. The success of a vector control effort using releases of transgenic insects relies on the technology being efficacious as well as effective in the field.

40|$|Aedes aegypti is {{the main}} vector of {{the virus that causes}} dengue fever and its more severe form dengue hemorrhagic fever. As {{traditional}} control methods have been unable to prevent its global re-emergence as a significant threat to human health, the development of new control methods is gaining importance. One possibility is a genetics-based control strategy modelled on the traditional sterile insect technique (SIT). The RIDL system (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is such an approach, and has been engineered in Ae. aegypti with tetracycline-dependent repression of a <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> construct. This thesis examines some of the aspects of Aedes aegypti mating ecology and behaviour that are relevant for the implementation of SIT-based control programmes, focusing on the competitive fitness of the genetically modified males. The transformed mosquitoes differed from unmodified mosquitoes with a similar genetic background with regard to several life history traits. Though the modified mosquitoes pupated earlier - which may be useful in the mass-rearing of such insects - most of the differences suggest reduced competitive performance of the modified males. These included reduced larval survival, adult longevity, insemination capacity and flight ability. In caged mating trials the modified males were less competitive than their wild type counterparts in direct competition for females. Genetically modified mosquitoes were generally smaller than unmodified mosquitoes reared at high larval densities, highlighting the value of optimising rearing conditions as females preferentially selected larger males for mating. Females exhibited no propensity to re-mate over several gonotrophic cycles, unless they had been mated to sperm-depleted males, in which case secondary insemination was common. In conclusion, genetic manipulation reduced the performance of mosquitoes. However, their competitive disadvantage could be compensated for by high over-flooding ratios upon release. Therefore, accurate estimates of competitive ability, as presented in this thesis, are essential if this control strategy is to prove successful.

I use mathematical modelling to analyse strategies using autocidal genetic constructs (dominant lethal genes that are repressible during mass-rearing); in parallel several research groups are developing the strains and the laboratory and field experimental work.

I examine the evolutionary, ecological, and economic cost and benefit aspects of these novel interventions. I consider application of this genetic technology against agricultural pest insects, combined with genetically modified crop plants engineered to produce insecticidal toxins, to which field-evolved resistance is emerging. Using a theoretical framework, I analyse the gene frequency evolution of resistant alleles and show that strategies using genetic constructs that are selectively lethal only to females could help to manage both pests and resistance. I investigate potential resistance to the lethal mechanism of the genetic construct itself. I use population genetics and population dynamics models to explore the impact of heritable biochemically-based resistance on the effectiveness of genetic strategies for reducing populations of important pests in agriculture or public health. Released insects are homozygous for susceptibility to the lethal construct; this has an inherent element of resistance dilution. Finally, I analyse genetic vector control methods to reduce the transmission of human disease.

We have previously reported that Dux 4 is toxic when misexpressed at high levels in many cell types, and blocks differentiation of myoblasts when expressed at low levels, and competes with Pax 7 for regulation of myogenic target genes. To model Dux 4 function in vivo, we made a Dux 4 -inducible mES cell line by inserting a doxycycline-inducible Dux 4 allele (iDux 4 + 3 ’UTR) onto the X chromosome at a euchromatic region (HPRT). High-level induction of the Dux 4 was toxic to mES cells but low-level Dux 4 resulted in altered differentiation. When iDux 4 + 3 ’UTR mice where generated and bred, this allele demonstrated leaky phenotypes in females, and male-specific lethality. Rare live-born males were small and underdeveloped with abnormal skin and defective sperm development and showed changes to muscle fibers, but no overt muscle degeneration. However, mice died within 1 month, well before the stage degeneration usually begins in FSHD. Dux 4 protein could be induced and observed in cultured primary cells, and we are evaluatingpups and embryos for Dux 4 expression in vivo. Dux 4 carrier females were smaller and displayed the skin phenotype in transverse stripes. We hypothesize that the 3 ’ UTR contains an enhancer which drives leaky expression in some embryonic cell types and that X chromosome inactivation combined with selective survival of XDUX 4 -inactive cells protects the females from the lethality. To test for selectively biased X inactivation, we crossed Dux 4 carrier females with XGFP males. Upon FACS analysis of the GFP+ cells in XGFP/ X+ vs. XGFP/ XDux 4 female progeny, we found that the latter had an elevated frequency of GFP positive cells in most tissues, including the satellite cell compartment of skeletal muscle, confirming our hypothesis of selective XDUX 4 inactivation. This mouse model suggests that Dux 4 is a <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> even when expressed at very low levels and can cause a variety of developmental defects in EBs and in embryo development...|$|E

Rate {{of development and}} viability were the two parameters employed to study the toxicity. The frequency of <b>dominant</b> <b>lethals</b> was scored to evaluate the mutagenic effect of the chemical on male and female germ cells. Concentrations of 250 mg and above/ 100 ml wheat cream agar medium {{were found to be}} significantly toxic.

40|$|About 20 {{years ago}} Drosophila subobscura, a native Palearctic species, colonized both North and South America. In Palearctic populations <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> are not {{associated}} in general with particular chromosomal arrangements. In colonizing populations {{they are not}} randomly distributed and usually are associated to a different degree with chromosomal arrangements caused by the founder event. The persistence of two <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> in the colonizing populations, one completely associated with the O 5 inversion and the other partially associated with the O 3 + 4 + 7 arrangement, has been analyzed. In all populations studied (five North American and six South American) the observed frequency of the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> completely associated with the O 5 inversion is higher than expected, the difference being statistically significant in all South American and one North American populations. The observed frequency of the <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> partially associated with the O 3 + 4 + 7 arrangement is also significantly higher than expected. Taking into account that the O 5 inversion exhibits significant latitudinal clines both in North and South America, an overdominant model favoring the heterokaryotypes {{seems to be in}} operation. From this model, a polynomial expression has been developed that allows us to estimate the relative fitness and the coefficient of selection against all karyotypes not carrying the O 5 inversion. The relative fitness of the O 5 heterokaryotypes is higher in South American than in North American populations. Furthermore, the observed frequencies of the <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> studied are in general very close to those of the equilibrium. This case is an outstanding demonstration in nature of an heterotic effect of chromosomal segments associated with <b>lethal</b> <b>genes</b> on a large geographic scale...|$|R

40|$|In insects it {{is known}} that the {{chemosterilant}} treatment induces <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> mutations which bring about embryonic death. The possibility of delayed expression of the chemosterilant-induced <b>dominant</b> <b>lethals</b> in F 1 progeny of the tropical house mosquito, Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann has been investigated. The chemosterilants employed were 8 aziridinyl compounds, 3 phosphoramides, and 4 s-triazines. In general, all the chemosterilants tested were found to cause different degrees of mortality at different life stages of the F 1 progeny. In this respect the aziridinyl compounds were more effective than the phosphoramides and s-triazines. This effect of the chemosterilants may be useful in the sterile-male technique...|$|R
40|$|Published onlineJournal ArticleBACKGROUND: Identification of {{synthetic}} lethal interactions in cancer cells could offer promising new therapeutic targets. Large-scale functional genomic screening presents {{an opportunity to}} test large numbers of cancer synthetic lethal hypotheses. Methods enriching for candidate synthetic lethal targets in molecularly defined cancer cell lines can steer effective design of screening efforts. Loss of one partner of a synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pair creates a dependency on the other, thus synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairs should never show simultaneous loss-of-function. We have developed a computational approach to mine large multi-omic cancer data sets and identify gene pairs with mutually exclusive loss-of-function. Since loss-of-function {{may not always be}} genetic, we look for deleterious mutations, gene deletion and/or loss of mRNA expression by bimodality defined with a novel algorithm BiSEp. RESULTS: Applying this toolkit to both tumour cell line and patient data, we achieve statistically significant enrichment for experimentally validated tumour suppressor <b>genes</b> and synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairings. Notably non-reliance on genetic loss reveals a number of known synthetic lethal relationships otherwise missed, resulting in marked improvement over genetic-only predictions. We go on to establish biological rationale surrounding a number of novel candidate synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairs with demonstrated dependencies in published cancer cell line shRNA screens. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a multi-omic approach to define gene loss-of-function, and enrich for candidate synthetic <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> pairs in cell lines testable through functional screens. In doing so, we offer an additional resource to generate new cancer drug target and combination hypotheses. Algorithms discussed are freely available in the BiSEp CRAN package at [URL]...|$|R

It was concluded that linear regressions should be employed only for the detection of significant inbreeding effects in man and that their application to the estimation of <b>lethal</b> <b>gene</b> equivalents was not warranted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSite-directed mutants of yeast ATPase {{were studied}} after {{introduction}} of mutant alleles into a yeast strain where these alleles were constitutively expressed and {{the expression of}} the wild-type chromosomal ATPase gene was turned off. One objection to this constitutive expression system was made apparent recently, as <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> mutations are lost by gene conversion with the wild-type allele during the process. Here, the phenotypes of the mutant alleles, which were studied in a constitutive expression system, are re-evaluated under conditions in which these site-directed mutants are conditionally expressed. We show that 12 of 25 site-directed mutations previously described are actually <b>dominant</b> <b>lethal</b> alleles. In addition, we show that dominant mutant proteins interfere with transport of wild-type ATPase to the plasma membrane...|$|R
