5|$|The {{economic}} focus {{began to}} change as the country sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression four <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b> The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1997, brook trout, brown trout, {{and white}} suckers {{inhabited}} Scotch Run in its upper reaches. Two <b>decades</b> <b>earlier,</b> {{this part of}} the stream was also inhabited by pumpkinseeds and eastern blacknose dace, but not by brown trout. The reason for the disappearance of the blacknose dace is unknown. The pumpkinseeds were only present in the 1970s due to their escape from nearby farm ponds.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, Hastert {{was indicted}} on federal charges of {{structuring}} bank withdrawals to evade bank reporting requirements and {{making false statements}} to federal investigators. Federal prosecutors said that the money was to compensate for and conceal deliberately unspecified misconduct by Hastert against an unnamed individual years earlier. Soon afterward, public accusations emerged that Hastert had sexually abused three male students (including the aforementioned unnamed individual) {{when he was a}} teacher more than three <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, {{and planned}} an {{invasion}} of Siam itself. By October 1548, he had assembled another 12,000-strong force that also included about 400 Portuguese mercenaries led by Diogo Soares. The invasion force would have been equipped with the conventional weapons of the day: swords, bow and arrows and spears. The more elite members would also carry matchlocks or muskets. These early modern weapons having been introduced to the two kingdoms by the Portuguese a few <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Old Swiss Confederacy was an {{alliance}} among the valley {{communities of the}} central Alps. The Confederacy, governed by nobles of various cantons, facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes. The Federal Charter of 1291 agreed between the rural communes of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances {{are likely to have}} existed <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The red ruffed lemur and the {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemur were formerly recognized as subspecies, Varecia variegata rubra and Varecia variegata variegata respectively. In 2001 both were elevated to species status, {{a decision that}} was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, which had been published <b>decades</b> <b>earlier,</b> were also recognized as variegata, editorum, and subcincta, although studies have not been entirely conclusive.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two <b>decades</b> <b>earlier,</b> believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few <b>decades</b> <b>earlier</b> accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term, Cleveland {{successfully}} nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q.C. Lamar, {{was a former}} Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the Confederacy two <b>decades</b> <b>earlier</b> caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.|$|E

5|$|Hancock did {{not long}} survive his electoral opponent. After the election, he {{remained}} on duty as {{commander of the}} Division of the Atlantic. He attended Garfield's inauguration and served loyally under him and Arthur. In 1885, he visited the Gettysburg battlefield, the site of his most famous triumph two <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b> Hancock died the following year, after an abscess in his leg became infected. Weaver survived both of his more popular opponents, returning to Congress for {{four years in the}} 1880s, and running for president again as the nominee of the Populist Party in 1892.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several <b>decades</b> <b>earlier</b> and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Kommandøren {{was one of}} four passenger/cargo steamships {{built for}} Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The four ships were {{constructed}} to supplement four smaller vessels built <b>decades</b> <b>earlier</b> at British shipyards. In addition to Kommandøren, which was seen as the flagship of the company's fleet, Lærdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandøren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two <b>decades</b> <b>earlier.</b> He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{reaches of}} Scotch Run were {{inhabited}} by eight {{species of fish}} in 1997: bluegills, brook trout, brown trout, blacknose dace, creek chubs, longnose dace, pumpkinseeds, white suckers. Bluegills and longnose dace were not present {{in this part of}} the stream two <b>decades</b> <b>earlier,</b> but rainbow trout and golden shiners were present at that time. The rainbow trout disappeared from the stream because the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission stopped stocking them and the golden shiners were only present in the 1970s due to bait bucket introductions.|$|E
