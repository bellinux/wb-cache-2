5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock {{in which an}} electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) as the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first}} to apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant pressure head of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the modern bristle toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E

25|$|The toaster is {{typically}} a small electric kitchen appliance designed to toast multiple types of bread {{products such as}} sliced bread, bagels, and English muffins. Although not the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the toaster, the pop-up toaster was invented by Charles Strite in 1919, consisting of a variable timer and springs {{in order to prevent}} burnt toast. Strite received a patent for his invention on May 29, 1919.|$|E
25|$|Two {{teams of}} people have {{claimed to be the}} <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the CAPTCHAs used widely on the Web today. The first team {{consists}} of Mark D. Lillibridge, Martín Abadi, Krishna Bharat, and Andrei Broder, who used CAPTCHAs in 1997 at AltaVista to prevent bots from adding URLs to their web search engine. Looking for a way to make their images resistant to OCR attack, the team looked at the manual of their Brother scanner, which had recommendations for improving OCR's results (similar typefaces, plain backgrounds, etc.). The team created puzzles by attempting to simulate what the manual claimed would cause bad OCR.|$|E

25|$|The zipper is {{a popular}} device for {{temporarily}} joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago who was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent,</b> conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable zipper. Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes. He also conceived {{the idea of the}} slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper. Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891, 1894, and 1905.|$|E
500|$|While {{the design}} of the bookwheel is {{commonly}} credited to Ramelli, some historians dispute that he was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> such a device. Joseph Needham, a historian of Chinese technology, stated that revolving bookcases, though not vertically oriented, had their origins in China [...] "perhaps a thousand years before Ramelli's design was taken there." ...|$|E
500|$|George Washington {{held over}} two dozen patents, {{in the fields}} of {{hydrocarbon}} lamps, cameras, and food processing. He was not the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> an instant coffee process, David Strang in New Zealand had the first patent in 1890 (Number 3518) for [...] instant or soluble coffee and was sold under the name Strangs [...] Coffee, another was chemist Satori Kato's work was a precursor, among others, but Washington's invention was the first effort that led to [...] large scale commercial manufacture. There is some suggestion that he was inspired by seeing dried powder {{on the edge of a}} silver coffee pot while in Guatemala. Federico Lehnhoff Wyld, a German-Guatemalan doctor, along with Eduardo T. Cabarrus, also developed an instant coffee process about this time, which he later marketed in Europe; as Wyld was Washington's personal physician, there is some suggestion that their discoveries were not independent.|$|E
5000|$|Flatland tricks {{are given}} names, usually by the <b>first</b> person <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> it. For example, the first {{flatland}} [...] "bunnyhop tailwhip" [...] was first {{landed in a}} Burger King parking lot by Bill Nitschke, and there named a [...] "whopper". Terry Adams invented a trick following Hurricane Katrina (since Terry lives in Louisiana), and named his new trick [...] "The Katrina".|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Edison did not {{invent the}} electric light. However, he did leverage technology brokering {{in order to}} piece together many different existing technologies {{to make a better}} light bulb. As one could assume, Edison was highly appraised for his accomplishments. Many people today believe he was the <b>first</b> person <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the electric light when truly he was great at leveraging technology brokering.|$|R

25|$|These two {{approaches}} can each be further {{divided into three}} families of protocols: discrete variable, continuous variable and distributed phase reference coding. Discrete variable protocols were the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be <b>invented,</b> and they remain the most widely implemented.

50|$|In 1597, {{he wrote}} the first {{systematic}} chemistry textbook, Alchymia, where he described the possibility of transmutation. In this book he also showed that cuprous salt lotions are detectable with ammonia, which causes them to change color to dark blue. In 1615 he wrote Syntagmatis alchamiae arcanorum where he detailed the production of tin chloride, something that he developed in 1605. He was not the <b>first</b> person <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> this process, however, as the Franciscan monk Ulmannus had discovered it earlier and wrote about in the book Buch der Heiligen Dreifaltigkeit in 1415.|$|R

(I am assuming that it is Ethelberta--Mrs. Petherwin--who sends it: of course I am not sure.)

50|$|A patent grants its owner(s) {{the right}} to sue those who {{manufacture}} and market products or services that infringe on the claims declared in the patent. Typically, governments award patents on either a first to file or <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> basis. Therefore, {{it is important to keep}} and maintain records that help establish who is <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> a particular invention.|$|E

5000|$|While Gradus ad Parnassum {{is famous}} as {{the origin of}} the term [...] "species counterpoint", Fux was not the <b>first</b> one <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the idea. In 1610, Girolamo Diruta, a {{composer}} of the Venetian school, published Il Transilvano, which presented the Renaissance polyphonic style as a series of types: one note against one note, two notes against one note, suspensions, and so forth. Fux's work repeated some of Diruta's, possibly coincidentally, since he is not known to have had a copy. In any event, Fux presented the idea with a clarity and focus which made it famous as a teaching method.|$|R
50|$|The title {{character}} is an intelligent robot, the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be <b>invented.</b> The opening chapters describe {{the creation of}} Roderick and show his mind (at first consisting of a bodiless computer program) developing through several stages of awareness. Finally, Roderick is given a rudimentary body and, {{through a series of}} misadventures, finds himself alone in the world. Due to his sketchy understanding of human customs, and intrigues surrounding the project that created him, he unwittingly becomes the center of various criminal schemes and other unfortunate events.|$|R
