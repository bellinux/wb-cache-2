With the UAE design taken as a baseline, the model is used to evaluate three proposed options for improving performance. These differ with respect to how the plants are shaded and how air flows through the greenhouse. In the baseline design, a semi-opaque plastic sheet is used to provide shade. The first option uses a similar sheet; however the air flows in a C-shaped path, travelling in opposite directions {{above and below the}} sheet.

60|$|In {{considering}} these several {{means of}} distribution, {388} {{it should be}} remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will {{have a good chance of}} succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should, also, remember that some, perhaps many, <b>freshwater</b> <b>productions</b> are low in the scale of nature, and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species. We should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. But the wide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight, and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water. Nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Seawater {{desalination}} {{technology is}} an important way to solve the freshwater shortage problem. Natural vacuum desalination (NVD) technology generates very low pressure environment in the headspace of 10 meters high water column.

NVD technology drives the desalination process without any mechanical pumping, and requires relatively inferior quality of device material and simple structures.

40|$|A {{global model}} {{is used to}} {{calculate}} feed and nutrient budgets for freshwater and marine omnivorous and carnivorous aquacultural finfish production. The model uses national production data for the period 1970 - 2010 and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios for production and management for 2010 - 2050. Results indicate that annual nutrient release to the freshwater (1. 2 million tonnes of N and 0. 1 million tonnes of P in 2010) and marine aquatic environments (0. 3 million tonnes of N and 0. 05 million tonnes of P) increased less rapidly than fish production, mainly due to improving feed conversion. In the coming five decades, annual nutrient release to freshwater environments may increase to 1. 5 - 2. 1 million tonnes of N and 0. 1 - 0. 2 million tonnes of P, depending on the production scenario and assumptions on feed conversion and the share of integrated aquacultural production. At present, the global contribution of freshwater aquaculture to nutrient loading of rivers is small. This is the same conclusion reached for the assessment of nutrient export from shellfish aquaculture (Bouwman et al., 2011).
