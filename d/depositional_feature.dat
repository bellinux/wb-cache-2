A striking feature, existing on a profile running from St. Pierre Bank across Cabot Strait Trough to Banquereau, is the occurrence under the trough of a prism of sediments that thickens to almost 14, 000 feet near the northeast margin where it is almost entirely truncated by basement rock. The sequence of subsurface layers found on the banks south and southeast of Newfoundland is not unlike that reported for the submerged shelf off the northeast coast of the United States and the banks off Nova Scotia.

In this study we have investigated two stepped fan deposits in Coprates Catena, Mars, which have a genetic link to light-toned material that is rich in Fe–Mg phyllosilicate phases. Although of different sizes and in separate, but adjacent, trough-like depressions, we identify similar features at these stepped fans and phyllosilicates that are indicative of similar formation conditions and processes.

40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} are turbulent particle suspensions {{that are}} the primary mechanism for transporting terrestrial sediments to the deep marine, and generate {{some of the largest}} <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> on Earth. However the fluid-particle interactions that sustain these currents are poorly understood, principally due to the technical challenges posed by obtaining accurate velocity and density measurements, which are critical for describing flow behavior and depositional characteristics. Numerous studies have bypassed these issues by using saline density currents, but this negates the ability to link flow processes with <b>depositional</b> <b>features,</b> and it is unclear whether their density structures are representative of particle gravity flows. Consequently, numerous questions remain over the flow conditions that build up {{a significant part of the}} deep-marine geologic record.

The technical challenges of obtaining reliable density data are overcome by running the experimental flows through a medical grade computed tomography (CT) scanner, and pair this data with three-dimensional velocity measurements using an ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiler (UDVP- 3 D) to get one of the first glimpses of the internal structure of turbidity currents. Unlike previous studies where flow processes are described in terms of the velocity field, this thesis demonstrates that fluid-particle interactions are controlled by momentum characteristics, and that the velocity field is determined largely by the current’s density structure.

The Okhotsk Sea lagoons are grouped by size into large (100 – 500 km 2), medium (10 – 100 km 2), small (1 – 10 km 2) and very small (less than 1 km 2) ones. The largest lagoons in terms of area are Baikal, Schastya, Piltun, and Perevolochnaya. Many small lagoons are linked to river estuaries. In terms of water depth, lagoons are grouped into shallow (less than 1 m deep), medium-depth (1 – 5 m), deep (5 – 20 m) and very deep (more than 20 m) ones.

40|$|Abstract. Æolian dust {{deposits}} {{are known}} to be widespread in south-eastern Australia, with the dominant model being that of ‘parna’, an aggregated material comprising clay, calcium carbonate, and silt-sized quartz. Despite a general acceptance of the parna model, there is surprisingly little evidence of silt-sized clay aggregates remaining in parna profiles. To investigate a relatively pure æolian dust deposit within the proposed zone of parna distribution, we examined the various phases of 3 source-bordering sand dunes on the lower Lachlan River floodplain of south-western NSW. In each dune exists an upper-slope phase of coarse brown sand, a mid-slope layer of reddish, clay-enriched sand, and a lower-slope phase of coarse sand dominated by an accumulation of carbonate glaebules. Granulometric analyses of the clay-enriched phase(s) of each dune identified a conspicuous particle population in the 20 – 60 µm range, and another in the fine-silt/clay range (< 10 µm). Mineralogical characterisation revealed an abundance of illite and kaolinite in the upper 2 dune phases, coupled with a minor amount of smectite, further suggesting an allochthonous æolian origin, as the surrounding floodplain is smectite-rich and relatively poor in illite. Micromorphological features within the clay-enriched phase, including abundant argillans and laminar bands of well-sorted fine quartz grains, indicate that this clay is a <b>depositional</b> <b>feature,</b> illuviated from surface horizons and re-deposited at depth. A similar illuvial origin is suggested by the fine crystalline nature of the calcium carbonate accumulation, ubiquitously coating the matrix mineral grains of the lower dune phase.

However, only few recent studies have focused on the deep-sea morphology and turbidite sedimentation in the western Black Sea basin, in which the main <b>depositional</b> <b>feature</b> is the Danube submarine fan. Oceanographic surveys in the Black Sea in 1998, 2002, and 2004 carried out in the framework of French-Romanian joint project and the European ASSEM-BLAGE (EVK 3 -CT- 2002 - 00090) project have collected a large amount of data (Multibeam echo sounder data, CHIRP seismic, as well as Kullenberg and Calypso cores).

40|$|Well-developed Campanian to Maestrichtian pelagic cyclic sediments were {{recovered}} from Hole 762 C on the Exmouth Plateau, off northwest Australia, during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 122. The cycles consist of nannofossil chalk (light beds) and clayey nannofossil chalk (dark beds). Both {{light and dark}} beds are strongly to moderately bioturbated, alternate on a decimeter scale, and exhibit gradual boundaries. Bioturbation introduces materials from a bed of one color into an underlying bed of another color, indicating that diagenesis is {{not responsible for the}} cyclicity. Differences in composition between the light and dark beds, revealed by calcium carbonate measurement and X-ray diffraction analysis, together with trace fossil evidence, indicate that the cycles in the sediments are a <b>depositional</b> <b>feature.</b> Diagenetic processes may have intensified the appearance of the cycles. Spectral analysis was applied to the upper Campanian to lower Maestrichtian cyclic sediments to examine the regularity of the cycles. Power spectra were calculated from time series using Walsh spectral analysis. The most predominant wavelengths of the color cycles are 34 - 41 cm and 71 - 84 cm. With an average sedimentation rate of 1. 82 cm/k. y. in this interval, we found the time durations of the cycles to be around 41 k. y. and 21 k. y., respectively, comparable to the obliquity and precession periods of the Earth's rotation, which strongly suggests an orbital origin for the cycles. On the basis of sedimentological evidence and plate tectonic reconstruction, we propose the following mechanism for the formation of the cyclic sediments from Hole 762 C. During the Late Cretaceous, when there was no large-scale continental glaciation, the cyclic variations in insolation, in response to cyclic orbital changes, controlled the alternation of two prevailing climates in the area. During the wetter, equable, and warmer climatic phases under high insolation, more clay minerals and other terrestrial materials were produced on land and supplied by higher runoff to a low bioproductivity ocean, and the dark clayey beds were deposited. During the drier and colder climatic phases under low insolation, fewer clay minerals were produced and put into the ocean, where bioproductivity was increased and the light beds were deposited...|$|E

The study area is located offshore Israel, at the Levantine Basin of the southeastern Mediterranean sea and is part of the eastern Nile's middle to lower submarine fan at depth of approximately 1200 m. The underlying topography in the study area is controlled by thin-skinned tectonic deformation resulted from the underlying mobile Messinian salt sequence. Previous work in the area of study has delineated several turbidite channel levee systems that are fed and has described in details qualitatively and quantitatively the most well illustrated depositional features in terms of interaction between the evolution of the depositional systems and the surrounding structures. This study is focused on the turbidite systems that have not been mentioned before or if they have been mentioned and they have not been described in details. The analysis of the data is based on the seismic interpretation of 3 D HR seismic data and the extraction of attribute maps that cover an area of 1400 km 2. Based on the attribute maps in combination with the seismic lines, qualitative and quantitative measurements took place for the main depositional elements of interesting, with the small scale lower submarine fan turbidite channel levee complexes to be the dominant sedimentary features in the area.

Shales and calcilutites {{in this region}} have a mean bulk silicate δ^(18) O of + 17. 7 which is significantly heavier than the mean for interbedded sandstones and siltstones. Bulk silicate δ^(18) O is decoupled from carbonate δ^(18) O {{due to differences in}} mode of deposition and diagenetic behavior. Central Appalachian terrigenous {{sedimentary rocks}} show a surprisingly uniform bulk silicate δ^(18) O of + 14. 8 with an SEM of 0. 1. The mean bulk silicate δ^(18) O for all shales (+ 15. 2) is only 0. 3 per mil heavier than the mean for all sandstones and siltstones (+ 14. 9). The oxygen isotope uniformity of Central Appalachian sedimentary rocks is mainly a primary <b>depositional</b> <b>feature</b> that is the result of thorough, grand-scale mixing of terrigenous sediment in the Appalachian geosyncline, probably involving several cycles of sedimentation, uplift, erosion, and reworking extending over hundreds of millions of years during the Paleozoic era. The bulk silicate δ^(18) O of siltstones and shales shows a significant (P ˂ 0. 05) correlation with conodont color alteration index, which is a measure of diagenetic temperature. As a result of isotopic exchange with porewater during diagenesis, the bulk silicate δ^(18) O of shales and siltstones can apparently be lowered by as much as 2. 5 to 4. 0 per mil. These diagenetic effects contributed to the overall homogeneity of these sedimentary rocks because the shales started out at higher δ^(18) O. A reconnaissance ^(18) O/^(16) O study of 14 samples of terrigenous sedimentary rocks from the Ouachita Mountains suggests more inherent isotopic variation in these samples, perhaps in part as a result of greater heterogeneity of source regions. Some of the isotopic variation also seems clearly attributable to diagenetic effects. A significant (P ˂ 0. 05) correlation was found between mean vitrinite reflectance, also a measure of diagenetic temperature, and the bulk silicate δ^(18) O difference between shale-sandstone pairs in three different sedimentary formations. Northern Appalachian metasedimentary rocks show a decrease in bulk silicate δ^(18) O at garnet grade and higher. The terrigenous facies metamorphic rocks have been depleted in ^(18) O by about two per mil relative to their unmetamorphosed counterparts in the Central Appalachians, except where they are adjacent to carbonate-rich sections. Carbonate facies metasedimentary rocks are 5 to 6 per mil higher than interbedded terrrigenous facies rocks, but at the margins of that formation there is a distinct lowering of bulk silicate δ^(18) O and carbonate δ^(18) O due to influx of metamorphic hydrothermal fluids from the adjacent terrrigenous rocks. This is attributed to the involvement of isotopically light fluids during metamorphism. Further work is need to elucidate the differences between metamorphic processes in pelitic and calcareous sediments. ...|$|E
40|$|A thick Pleistocene {{shelf and}} nearshore {{cyclical}} succession was {{deposited in the}} S. Mauro sub-basin of the Crotone basin (southern Italy). The regressive units of the cycles are mostly represented by coastal siliciclastic and bioclastic prograding wedges showing a clinoform geometry. These are separated by blanket-like deposits of high lateral persistence recording major transgressive episodes. The aim {{of this paper is}} (1) to describe facies patterns and depositional setting of two prograding wedges, particularly focussing on their polycyclic internal architecture, (2) to analyze these units within a sequence-stratigraphic framework, and (3) to speculate on the possible origin of the small-scale cyclicity. The two wedges analyzed in this paper consist of a number of shingles. Individual shingles consist of two physically connected units: (1) a relatively thin package of sigmoid clinoforms, grading into (2) a volumetrically dominant package of oblique-tangential clinoforms with toplap terminations. The shingles are bounded by seaward-dipping surfaces with sigmoid clinoform geometry, which are ravinement surfaces updip, passing into conformable flooding surfaces downdip. The wedges are thus organized into high-frequency, small-scale sequences, each comprising transgressive, highstand and falling-stage systems tracts. As a whole, individual prograding wedges are interpreted as forced-regressive units, as the shoreline was subject to an overall shift basinwards and downwards along a low-angle trajectory, in spite of the repeated minor relative sea-level rises. Tectonic subsidence, and particularly the syndepositional growth of gentle synclines, are thought to have been the key factors allowing the preservation of these forced-regressive units. Progradation of the wedges took place in a high-energy wave climate characterized by high frequency of storms and very efficient alongshore redistribution of sediments. Recurrent, storm-driven, offshore currents led to intense reworking of sediments on the topset platform and gravity spreading on the foreset slope of the prograding wedges. Well-oxygenated conditions over the shelf due to intensified storm activity during glacial periods may have enhanced the rate of production of skeletal, foramol-type carbonates. It can reasonably be assumed that progradation took place from a line source and that the sand bodies are to be regarded as coastal prograding bodies. In spite of active syndepositional tectonics, the cycles can be correlated to Pleistocene high-amplitude sea-level oscillations. The older of the two wedges can be correlated, through bio-magnetostratigraphy, to the major climatic transition which occurred from the marine oxygen-isotope stage 25 to 24 - 22 (Rio et al., 1996). The younger probably developed during the sea-level fall that ended with substage 18. 2, as suggested by sequence- and bio-stratigraphic data. The prograding wedges are thus interpreted to record long-lived sea-level falls of fourth-order cycles. Due to the particular depositional setting, we are inclined to exclude authigenic mechanisms in the origin of small-scale cyclicity. Although the concomitance and interaction of different controlling factors may be taken into account, it is tempting to ascribe this cyclicity to minor eustatic changes punctuating long-lived, erratic falling stages, possibly accompanied by climate-driven fluctuations of sediment supply. Shelf-perched and shelf-edge prograding units consisting of foramol-type carbonates are apparently a common falling-stage to lowstand <b>depositional</b> <b>feature</b> in the Mediterranean area during the Late Pliocene and Pleistcen...|$|E

This apron shows a large variability both across and along slope of morphologies and deposits related to mass wasting and reworking processes, passing into areas covered by hemipelagic sedimentation. A large spectrum of erosional and <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> was recognized {{on the surface of}} the apron. On the submerged shelves, shore platforms and <b>depositional</b> terraces submarine <b>features</b> related to wave action and sea level fluctuations are present, acting for the storage and reworking for the volcaniclastic materials derived from the subaerial portions. Turbidity currents acted on the slope, generating erosional furrows and throughs, channel-levee complexes and coarse-grained sediment waves (Casalbore et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The <b>depositional</b> and postdepositional <b>features</b> {{observed}} in the sediments of the coastal system of Portixeddu-San Nicolao (SW Sardinia) have been analyzed. The <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> include grain size, mineralogic composition, roundness of quartz grains, coatings of syn-depositional silica while the postdepositional features comprise the presence of carbonate cement, pink colouration, secondary silica deposition. The samples, collected on foreshore, foredune, man-stabilized dune, naturally stabilized dune and Pleistocene dune have grain size distibutions and mineralogic composition consistent with depositional environment and paleozoic basement. On the contrary, SEM examination of the surface textures of quartz grains shows considerable variability from the foreshore to the oldest dunes. It is {{pointed out that the}} primary marine surface textures may be progressively modified and obliterated by aeolian transport and by pedogenetic processes. The latter, on the man-stabilized dunes, can occur within 50 years...|$|R

The discussion covers {{the timing of the}} glaciation (the Laurentide Ice Sheet, 25, 000 - 13, 000 years ago) and the numerous features left behind: erosional features such as high cliffs, grooves and striations; <b>depositional</b> <b>features</b> such as till, erratics, and glacial lake deposits; and deposits reworked by meltwater streams such as outwash, alluvial fans, and stream terraces.

40|$|Snow {{stratigraphy}} in Antarctica {{is strongly}} influenced by wind. This results in a complex stratigraphy. Yearly accumulation is often masked by intermediate erosion and deposition events. Kohnen-Station has a higher accu- mulation than the very low accumulation areas of East Antarctica, and therefore is suited to investigate complex stratigraphy. Here we use very high frequency GPR at 1. 6 GHz to resolve stratigraphy. We compared the GPR mea- surements with detailed snow profiles measured using near-infrared photography and translucent profiles. Detailed <b>depositional</b> <b>features,</b> as dunes and cross-bedding are visible. First results show very complex patterns, which are not easily correlated to other features, and not necessarily to yearly accumulation...|$|R
