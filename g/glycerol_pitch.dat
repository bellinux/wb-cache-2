40|$|Glycerin pitch, a {{by-product}} of biodiesel was generated from a biodiesel plant through transesterification process in- creased drastically as tremendously growth of biodiesel industry. The excess glycerine pitch may become an environ- mental problem since it cannot be disposed to the environment. The pitch is contained many other material such as soaps, remaining catalysts, water and esters formed throughout the process. In this paper, treatment of glycerine pitch is obtained the glycerol purity is up to 87. 14 wt % with relatively low ash content (0. 00397 % (w/w)), MONG of 5. 503 % (w/w) and moisture content was 7. 35 % (w/w). Several analyses using Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) and high per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were employed to determine the purity and the compositions of <b>glycerol</b> <b>pitch</b> and recovered glycerol...|$|E
40|$|The {{pretreatment}} {{process to}} recovered glycerol is a pretreatment method {{has been recognized}} as a method for environmental protection. This paper highlights the pretreatment methods to recovered the glycerol from two types and sources of glycerol waste i. e. glycerol residue from oleo chemical and <b>glycerol</b> <b>pitch</b> from biodiesel industries by pretreatment process. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the pretreatment potential use in glycerol waste pretreatment process. The general characterization of glycerol waste, application of glycerol waste recovered and pretreatment with operational parameters in terms pH, temperatures, ratio of solvent are thoroughly discussed in the paper. The data obtained and researchers discussed about the kinetic studies of the various pretreatments, thus giving maximum awareness about glycerol waste for further research. The future aspects for research needs are also outlined...|$|E
