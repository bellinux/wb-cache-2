"Do it," [...] {{replied the}} King, [...] "and {{in doing so}} belie the whole tenor and actions of an honourable life--abandon the {{principles}} of your Church, and become a perjured traitor and an apostate, to prevent another person from discharging his duty as a gentleman! This were indeed killing your friend to prevent the risk of his running himself into danger. Let the Passive Obedience, which is so often in your mouth, and no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> head, put your feet for once into motion, and step aside for ten minutes.

60|$|But now, {{suppose you}} are an artist--and I use the word to cover all sorts of art, literary, {{dramatic}} and musical, as well as painting, sculpture, design and architecture--you want before all things freedom for personal expression, and you probably have an idea {{that this is the}} last thing you will get in the Socialist State. But, indeed, you will get far more than you do now. You will begin as a student, no <b>doubt,</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> local Municipal Art Schools, and there you will win prizes and scholarships and get some glorious years of youth and work in Italy or Paris, or Germany or London, or Boston or New York, or wherever the great teachers and workers of your art gather thickest; and then you will compete, perhaps, for some public work, and have something printed or published or reproduced and sold for you by your school or city; or get a loan from your home municipality for material--if your material costs money--and set to work making that into some saleable beautiful thing. If you are at all distinguished in quality, you will have a competition among public authorities from the beginning, to act as sponsors and dealers for your work; benevolent dealers they will be, and content with a commission. And if you make things that make many people interested and happy, you may by that fortunate gift of yours, grow to be as rich and magnificent a person as any one in the Socialist State. But if you do not please people at all, either the connoisseurs of the municipal art collection or private associations of art patrons or the popular buyer, well, then your lot will be no harder than the lot of any unsuccessful artist now; you will have to do something else for a time and win leisure to try again.|$|E

One need not dread the disappearance of sport with the disappearance of the great house.... In the dead winter-time you will probably like to run into the nearest big town with your wife and family, stay in an hotel for a few weeks to talk to people <b>in</b> <b>your</b> clubs, see what plays there are in the municipal theatres and so forth.

40|$|Route {{selection}} {{is governed by}} various strategies which often allow minimizing the required memory capacity. Previous research showed that navigators primarily remember information at route decision points and at route turns, rather than at intersections which required straight walking. However, when actually navigating the route or indicating directional decisions, navigators make fewer errors when {{they are required to}} walk straight. This tradeoff between location memory and route decisions accuracy was interpreted as a ldquo;when <b>in</b> <b>doubt</b> follow <b>your</b> noserdquo; strategy which allows navigators to only memorize turns and walk straight by default, thus considerably reducing the number of intersections to memorize. These findings were based on newly learned routes. In the present study we show that such an asymmetry in route memory also prevails for planning routes within highly familiar environments. Participants planned route sequences between locations in their city of residency by pressing arrow keys on a keyboard. They tended to ignore straight walking intersections, but they ignored turns much less so. However, for reported intersections participants were quicker at indicating straight walking than turning. Together with results described in the literature, these findings suggest that a ldquo;when <b>in</b> <b>doubt</b> follow <b>your</b> nose strategyrdquo; is applied also within highly familiar spaces and might originate from limited working memory capacity during planning a route...|$|R

On April 1st, Baines appended a note to the website, thanking the readers for expressing their interest in his story and acknowledging that the fairy corpse was fake. He wrote: [...] "Even if you believe in fairies, as I personally do, there will always have been an element of <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mind that would suggest the remains are a hoax.

"It is true," [...] said Mrs. Wilson, [...] "Clara {{has done}} well, though under {{circumstances}} of but little risk; {{she might have}} jumped into your fish-pond, and escaped with life, but the chances are she would drown: nor do I dispute {{the right of the}} girls to choose for themselves; but I say the rights extend to requiring us to qualify them to make their choice. I am sorry, Edward, to be the instigator of <b>doubts</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> breast of the worth of any one, especially as it may give you pain." [...] Here Mrs. Wilson took her brother affectionately by the hand, and communicated what she had overheard that evening. Although the impressions of the baronet were not as vivid, or as deep as those of his sister, his parental love was too great not to make him extremely uneasy under the intelligence and after thanking her for her attention to his children's welfare, he kissed her, and withdrew. In passing to his own room, he met Egerton, that moment returned from escorting Jarvis ladies to their lodgings; a task he had undertaken at the request of Jane, as they were without any male attendant. Sir Edward's heart was too full not to seek immediate relief, and as he had strong hopes of the innocence of the colonel, though he could give no reason for his expectation, he returned with him to the parlor, and in a few words acquainted him with the slanders which had been circulated at his expense; begging him by all means to disprove them as soon as possible. The colonel was struck with the circumstance at first, but assured Sir Edward, it was entirely untrue. He never played, as he might have noticed, and that Mr. Holt was an ancient enemy of his. He would in She morning take measures to convince Sir Edward, that he stood higher in the estimation of his uncle, than Mr. Holt had thought proper to state. Much relieved by this explanation, the baronet, forgetting that this heavy charge removed, he only stood where he did before he took time for his inquiries, assured him, that if he could convince him, or rather his sister, he did not gamble, he would receive him as a son-in-law with pleasure. The gentlemen shook hands and parted.|$|R
