25|$|Comparing the {{historical}} safety record of civilian nuclear energy with {{other forms of}} electrical generation, Ball, Roberts, and Simpson, the IAEA, and the Paul Scherrer Institute found in separate studies that {{during the period from}} 1970 to 1992, there were just 39 on-the-job deaths of nuclear power plant workers worldwide, while during the same time period, there were 6,400 on-the-job deaths of coal power plant workers, 1,200 on-the-job deaths of natural <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> plant workers and members of the general public caused by natural <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> plants, and 4,000 deaths of members of the general public caused by hydroelectric power plants.

25|$|The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set as {{its primary}} goal the {{reduction}} of annual SO2 emissions by 10 million tons below 1980 levels of about 18.9 million tons. To achieve these reductions by 2000, when a nationwide sulfur dioxide emissions cap of 8.95 million tons per year began, the law required a two phase tightening of operating restrictions placed on fossil fuel fired (e.g., coal, oil, natural <b>gas)</b> <b>power</b> plants.

25|$|Several methods {{exist to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of fossil fuel power plants. A frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste and conversions of natural <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce landfilling. In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery, which is also beneficial to the environment. In some instances, torrefaction of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil fuel power plant will be using.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{emergence}} of natural <b>gas</b> <b>powered</b> ferries in Norway and their diffusion {{as a means to}} reaching the goals of reducing NOx emissions. Though experiences with natural <b>gas</b> <b>powered</b> ferries have been good, there is little sign that there will be any further prioritizing of these over diesel ferries. I will analyze natural <b>gas</b> <b>powered</b> ferries in a sustainable development perspective, as an environmentally friendly alternative. Further, the values, policies and institutions affecting the ferries are analyzed. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>powered</b> ferries could prove useful in the long term for reducing national emissions of NOx. Diffusion is going slow, and there is no official strategy to prioritize gas ferries when replacing the many old ones. Industry is interested in this new technology to build competencies but unwilling to make large investments alone. To reach international agreement for NOx reduction taxes on emissions will be introduced. Natural gas ferries as a technological system might need support for infrastructure and a more overarching strategy to be significant...|$|R
25|$|Forecasts for the medium- and {{long-term}} remain highly positive. Peru's real GDP growth in 2007 was (8.3%) and largest in Latin America in 2008 was an outstanding 9.8%, {{the highest in}} the world. Inflation remained low, at about 3%, while the budget surplus is expected to remain at about 1% of GDP. Private investment should keep growing at a rate of 15% a year. Exports and imports are expected to keep rising. The unemployment and underemployment indexes (5.2% and 34%, respectively, in Lima) should keep coming down as the economy grows, other cities in Peru like Cajamarca, Ica, Cuzco and Trujillo are starting to show less unemployment nowadays.

The Edmonton Electrical Lighting and Power Company became a municipally owned electric utility in 1902, then the Electrical Distribution and Power Plant departments combined to form Edmonton Power in 1970. Electrical generation capacity was also expanded in 1970 with the coal fired Clover Bar Generating Station construction. Within the next eight years, another three units are added, bringing the combined generating capacity of the Clover bar and Rossdale generating stations to 1050 megawatts by 1979. Expansion occurred again in 1989 with the first Genesee unit is operating at full load and in 1994 with a second Genesee unit to a total capacity of both units to 850 megawatts. Electricity generated at Genesee was made commercially available through the Alberta Interconnected Grid in the early 1990s. EPCOR was formed from the merger of Edmonton's municipal natural <b>gas,</b> <b>power</b> and water utilities in 1996 and converted into a public company in 2006. Then EPCOR Utilities Inc. spun off its power generation business to create Capital Power Corporation in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Fuel {{switching}} on the demand side refers to changing {{the type of}} fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. [...] To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed. Energy efficiency alone may {{not be sufficient to}} meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions. Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning coal. [...] There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural <b>gas</b> <b>power</b> plant and an electric heat pump has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates.
