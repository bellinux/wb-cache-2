5|$|On December 27, 1976, the MBTA {{bought the}} B's northside {{commuter}} rail assets, including {{the entire length}} of the Fitchburg Line. The closure of the Lexington Branch the next month represented the limit of the contraction of the northside lines; as a result of the 1970s <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> and especially the 1979 <b>energy</b> <b>crisis,</b> a period of rapid expansion began in the end of the 1970s. Service to Ayer returned along with an extension to Gardner on January 13, 1980. Ayer has seen continuous MBTA service since 1980, although service beyond Ayer was cut from Gardner to Fitchburg at the end of 1986. The W just north of Ayer was finally abandoned in 1982, and turned into the Nashua River Rail Trail.|$|E

40|$|By {{the end of}} the {{economic}} boom in the 1960 s, the oil crisis caused an enormous rise in energy prices. Chemical companies, especially, faced a huge challenge due to their dependency on oil as an energy resource and raw material. This paper explores the reaction of West German chemical corporations to the <b>energy</b> <b>crises</b> of the 1970 s and their attempts to anticipate future <b>energy</b> <b>crises.</b> First, the companies tried to implement their own industrial nuclear power stations to cut costs and to become more independent from oil.

5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} {{gradually}} close the tramway. New trams had been delivered in 1958, {{and it was}} decided that lines would only be closed as trams were naturally retired. At the time Oslo Sporveier had 421 vehicles. By 1974, the company had 163 vehicles, of which 100 were powered trams, 43 were trailers and 20 were working trailers. Following the <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> in the 1970s, the political climate changed, and in 1977 the city council decided to not close the tramway anyway. Between 1978 and 1981, ten tram vehicles were bought from the Gothenburg Tramway.|$|E

30|$|In {{view of the}} {{exponential}} fast {{increase in}} the world population {{in addition to the}} increase in the consumption rate per capita of food as well as <b>energy,</b> two main <b>crises</b> are currently facing the whole world which are the food and <b>energy</b> <b>crises.</b> Global human population increases about 75 million annually or 1.1 % per year (World Population Data Sheet, 2014). It has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in 2012. It is expected to keep growing, where estimates have put the total population at 8.4 billion by mid- 2030 and 9.6 billion by mid- 2050. On the other hand, Egypt’s population increased from 59.6 million in 1996 to 72.6 million in 2006, and then, it increased to 94.8 million in 2017 ([URL] n.d.). Therefore, it seems that food and <b>energy</b> <b>crises</b> will definitely become worse in the very near future.|$|R

Hayden has already led multiple expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. One artifact was a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his Praetor Suit), whom the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 {{oil embargo}} and 1979 <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> caused a {{reorganization}} of energy policies {{around the world}} and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the U.S. and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the U.S. (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE).|$|E
40|$|Various sources {{indicate}} that threats to modern cities {{lie in the}} availability of essential streams, among which energy. Most cities are strongly reliant on fossil fuels; not one case of a fully self-sufficient city is known. Engineering resilience is {{the rate at which}} a system returns to a single steady or cyclic state following a perturbation. Certain resilience, for the duration of a crisis, would improve the urban capability to survive such a period without drastic measures. The capability of cities to prepare for and respond to <b>energy</b> <b>crises</b> in the near future is supported by greater or temporary self-sufficiency. The objective of the underlying research is a model for a city – including its surrounding rural area – that can sustain <b>energy</b> <b>crises.</b> Therefore, accurate monitoring of the current urban metabolism is needed for the use of energy. This can be used to pinpoint problem areas. Furthermore, a sustainable energy system is needed, in which the cycle is better closed. This will require a three-stepped approach of energy savings, energy exchange and sustainable energy generation. Essential is the capacity to store energy surpluses for periods of shortage (crises). The paper discusses the need for resilient cities and the approach to make cities resilient to <b>energy</b> <b>crises.</b> Architectural Engineering +TechnologyArchitectur...|$|R

5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 <b>energy</b> <b>crisis.</b> He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing.

5|$|BCal {{entered into}} a bid to acquire at least one Concorde.

BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required {{a high level of}} aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax. Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage. Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s <b>energy</b> <b>crisis</b> brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
5|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun {{was the fourth}} and final film in the series {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz.
