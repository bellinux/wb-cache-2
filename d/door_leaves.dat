500|$|The Altar and the Door {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews upon its release. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave it four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying it has a [...] "slightly greater dose of rock" [...] and [...] "Casting Crowns gave fans {{no reason to be}} disappointed on Alter [...] ". Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The <b>Door</b> <b>leaves</b> plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E

50|$|Fire {{doors are}} {{sometimes}} rendered {{unable to provide}} its listed fire resistance by ignorance of the intended use and associated restrictions and requirements, or by improper use. For example, fire doors are sometimes blocked open, or carpets are run through them, which would allow the fire to travel past the fire barrier in which the door is placed. The door's certification markings are displayed both on the <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> and the fire door frames, {{and should not be}} removed or painted over during the life of the building.|$|E

50|$|UL allows an {{individual}} {{composition of the}} door set from various components such as hinges, locks, frames, <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> etc. as long as every single component has satisfied the UL standard and been tested individually as such. This is not true for the EN standard. Even though for each component there is a separate test standard available, which the single hardware component must satisfy, the EN standard allows only for the tested composition of components. Therefore exchanging hinges, locks, steel sheet thicknesses, etc. is generally not possible without additional tests.|$|E
5000|$|Turnstile exit-only {{doors are}} also {{often used in}} subways and other rapid transit {{facilities}} to prevent people from bypassing fare payment. They are similarly used at large sports stadiums, theme parks, and other such venues, to allow pedestrians to exit freely, but not to enter without paying admission fees. These doors usually work mechanically, with the door panels constructed of horizontal bars which pass through a [...] "wall" [...] of interlacing (interdigitated) bars, allowing the <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> to pass through, but blocking people from illegally entering through the exit.|$|E
50|$|The {{residence}} on {{the upper}} level is arranged about a north/south corridor with three bedrooms and dining room fronting Tingal Road and kitchen, sitting room and a bedroom opening to a verandah facing north-east.

Entrance is gained from Cedar Street via an external concrete staircase arriving at the central organising corridor. A number of partitions and <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> have been removed. The rear verandah has been enclosed with casement windows. A toilet and laundry and associated rooftop drying area have been added off the north-east corner of the verandah.|$|E

50|$|He wrote short stories, {{novels and}} poetry in Urdu, and also {{literary}} columns for Dawn newspaper and Daily Express newspaper. The Seventh <b>Door,</b> <b>Leaves</b> and Basti are among his books {{that have been}} translated into English. Among the five novels he wrote - Chaand Gahan (1952), Din Aur Daastaan (1959), Basti (1980), Tazkira (1987), Aage Samandar Hai (1995) - Basti received global praise. His other writings include Hindustan Se Aakhri Khat, Aagay Sumandar Hai, Shehr-e-Afsos, Jataka Tales, Janam Kahanian and Wo Jo Kho Gaye. Aagay Sumandar Hai (Sea is facing you in the front) contrasts the spiraling urban violence of contemporary Karachi with {{a vision of the}} lost Islamic realm of al-Andalus in modern Spain. His novel Basti is based on Pakistani history.|$|E
50|$|Seating was {{designed}} to be comfortable and spacious. The Standards had short rattan benches arranged in both transverse (forward- or rear-facing) and longitudinal (sideways-facing) positions. Two to three people could fit comfortably on each bench. This gave each rider more legroom and personal space. Supplemental seats located by each side door could be folded down for rider use at a conductor's discretion. When lowered, these seats would block side <b>door</b> <b>leaves,</b> so they were protected by lock to ensure only a conductor could lower them. Under regular conditions, 78 seats were available for riders in each car. During the 1950s, many (but not all) of the rattan seats were replaced by sprung leather or a plastic compound (velon) that replicated the feel of rattan.|$|E
50|$|Its {{principal}} (Russell Street) elevation is a symmetrical tripartite {{composition of}} dark red face brickwork dressed with contrasting painted cement Classical details. The central main entry is articulated with rendered architraves and flanking rusticated pilasters that extend the full {{height of the}} building to meet the parapet. The entry double <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> have been replaced with modern glazed aluminium framed leaves. Above the main entry, a cantilevered concrete balcony with large decorative console brackets and a wrought iron balustrade doubles as an entry awning. Above the balcony, a glazed arch-headed aperture with rendered architrave extends to the underside of a rendered frieze below the parapet. Its detailed glazing pattern includes multi-paned margins (some panes fitted with coloured leadlights), three sashes and a door leaf (opening off the stair half landing within). The outer sections of the facade beyond the rusticated pilasters mirror each other. At ground level, walls are rendered and include a centrally placed single door and fanlight flanked by double hung sash windows. Above, smaller highlights align with {{the top of a}} heavy masonry transom. Physical evidence including decorative suspension rod brackets and cover flashings confirms the location of proposed awnings abutting these transoms. Window and fanlight sashes are original, but the door openings have been fitted with modern aluminium framed glazed leaves. Cantilevered balconies at first floor level are decorated to match the central balcony. Above the balconies, walls are finished in face brick with a rendered frieze decorated with widely spaced rosettes. French doors with fanlights are centrally placed and flanked by double hung sashes. <b>Door</b> <b>leaves</b> and upper sashes are multi paned. The elevation is crowned by a stepped rendered parapet decorated with cornices, consoles, and a central pediment.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the year}} that {{followed}} the fire, Massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations, inward-swinging exit doors, and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times (meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity, and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke). The new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked {{by at least one}} normal, outward-swinging door, or retrofitted to permit the individual <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation, and further required that no emergency exits be chained or bolted shut {{in such a way as}} to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation. Municipal licensing authorities ruled that no Boston establishment could use [...] "The Cocoanut Grove" [...] as a name thereafter.|$|E
50|$|The overall constructions in the Red Palace {{are typical}} Jiangnan (South regions of Yangtze River) style which shows an ancient style {{of grace and}} simplicity. All the walls, columns, <b>door</b> <b>leaves,</b> and door frames are all painted red. The main gate of the Red Palace {{consists}} of six columns and five arches. Inside of the gate, there lies a pond with an arch bridge upon. Go across the bridge and there lies the antechamber, the adytum, two side halls and the Dacheng Hall (the hall of great achievement). The Dacheng Hall is the major construction. Behind the Dacheng Hall lies the Wudai Ci (ancestral hall of many generations of ancestors). The hall {{used to be a}} place to worship Confucius. During the period of China’s great revolution, it served as an accommodation for worker-peasant soldiers. It collapsed, though, but is now fully repaired according to its original appearance. Now, Wudai Ci serves as an exhibition hall exhibiting biographical relics and other materials of martyrs of uprising and revolutions in Hai-Lu Feng counties.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} from Russell Street leads directly into an entrance lobby. The original elevated timber floor has been altered to accommodate ramped access from street level. Flanking original walls are rendered masonry. At the far end, original opposing door openings fitted with original joinery (including three panelled <b>door</b> <b>leaves</b> with original hardware) {{lead to the}} adjacent tenancies fronting Russell Street. The right hand (east) wall is also fitted with an original multi-paned high light fixed window. The ceiling is lined with decoratively arranged fibre cement sheets and cover battens. The original staircase joinery survives intact. The lower flight rises from the far right to a half landing over the front door, and a second flight rises beyond (parallel to Russell Street) to the floor above. A small ticket office to the right {{is built into the}} stair under-croft. The adjacent tenancies contain original plain quad skirtings, rendered masonry walls, and fibre cement and batten ceilings. The ceiling panel pattern in the right hand tenancy provides evidence of an original partition wall, since removed. Later doorways have been cut through to spaces behind.|$|E
