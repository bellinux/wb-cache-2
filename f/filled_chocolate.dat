5000|$|Serious {{poisoning}} happens {{more frequently}} in domestic animals, which metabolize theobromine much more slowly than humans, and can easily consume enough chocolate to cause chocolate poisoning. If large numbers of <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> candies are consumed, another serious danger is posed by the fat and sugar in the fillings, which can sometimes trigger life-threatening pancreatitis several days later. The most common victims of theobromine poisoning are dogs, for which it can be fatal. The toxic dose for cats is even lower than for dogs. [...] However, cats are less prone to eating chocolate since {{they are unable to}} taste sweetness. Theobromine is less toxic to rats, mice, and humans, who all have an [...] of about 1,000 mg/kg.|$|E
5000|$|The powder made by {{grinding}} up such caramel-coated nuts is called pralin, {{and is an}} ingredient in many cakes, pastries, and ice creams. After this powder has been mixed with chocolate, it becomes praliné in French, which gave birth to what is known in French as chocolat praliné. The word praliné is used colloquially in France and Switzerland to refer to these, known simply as [...] "chocolates" [...] in English, i.e. various centres coated with chocolate. [...] In mainland Europe, the word praline {{is often used to}} mean either this nut powder or the chocolate paste made from it, widely used to <b>fill</b> <b>chocolates,</b> hence its use (by synecdoche) in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom to refer to <b>filled</b> <b>chocolates</b> in general. In the United Kingdom, the term can refer either to praline (the <b>filling</b> for <b>chocolates)</b> or, less commonly, to the original whole-nut pralines.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of fat bloom {{is the dominant}} cause of quality loss of chocolate.

40|$|By {{means of}} {{optimized}} processing {{the risks of}} bloom formation can be minimized. Main influences on chocolate stability arise from tempering, cooling, packaging and the geometrical shape of <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> articles.

40|$|In {{the most}} cases fat bloom is a {{consequence}} of fat migration ("center bloom"). Therefore it is important to study all the influences on migration and to control this specific problem of filled chocolates. These processes were studied at <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> hollow balls. These chocolates mean a very useful model system, flexible in the choice of chocolate composition, filling composition and storage conditions. In general, migration is influenced by a lot of parameters, which are connected with the solid fat content (storage temperature, compatibility, oil content, origin of cocoa butter and milk fat) and with the fat structure (polymorphic structure of cocoa butter, oil absorption within fat structure). The fat phase as well as the non-fat part of chocolates and fillings has some effect...|$|E
40|$|Beside {{a loss in}} texture, {{the main}} quality aspect of <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> {{products}} during storage {{is the development of}} fat bloom. For these products isothermal or cycling temperature storage tests are used for accelerated shelf life prediction. However, the applicability of these tests compared to real storage conditions is complicated and shelf life estimation is vague. Com; 1;paring storage tests of different authors is difficult because products and analysis methods vary. Additionally most of the storage tests are performed to identify the reasons for fat bloom and therefore the storage conditions are not separately investigated. However, all studies agree that temperature has a major impact due to its influence on migration and crystallization. While migration is accelerated at higher temperatures, crystallization shows an optimum at lower temperatures. Therefore, migration and crystal state have to be evaluated during storage, as well as fat bloom formation. In this study, cold stamped dark chocolate shells with nougat filling were chosen to compare isothermal and cycling temperature storage conditions. Cycling temperature storage at adequate levels includes optimum for fat bloom formation, but takes crystallization and migration influence in unequal account. In contrast, isothermal storage at optimum temperature leads to faster fat bloom formation...|$|E

40|$|Filling fat and oil {{migration}} in <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> products often cause quality loss, such as fat bloom or changes in texture. Therefore, {{and due to}} legal restrictions, the detection and quantification of filling fats and oils in chocolate is of interest. Common methods are fatty acid or triacylglycerol (TAG) analysis by GC or HPLC. Additionally, NMR and DSC are used to evaluate migration especially in stored products. Using DSC, the melting and crystallization peak of a filling oil can be detected directly, while NMR turns the reduction of solid fat content (SFC) caused by filling fats and oils to account. However, fat and {{oil migration}} {{is not the only}} effect during storage, which might affect NMR and DSC measurements. Post-crystallization is also of interest. Therefore, DSC and NMR methods were used to observe and to evaluate the detectable amount over time. Dark chocolate was mixed with hazelnut oil, butterfat, and coconut oil. Samples were stored and analyzed using NMR and DSC. Additionally, methods to destroy thermal history of the sample were investigated. We found that post-crystallization, which occurs during the first 2 wk after production, has a major impact on detectability of filling fats and oils using physical methods. However, standardized sample preparation was successfully applied and amounts below 1 [*]g per 100 [*]g sample were detectable and amounts above 1 – 2 [*]g were quantifiable with slender time and effort...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{influence}} of anticipated emotions (AE) on behavioural intention and behaviour to consume filled chocolates and to give an indication on the possible differences in consumer behaviour between two countries. Design/methodology/approach - The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used to explain the consumption of chocolate. In this study, TPB is extended with a construct for AE. Findings - A total of 859 consumers in Belgium and Hungary participated in the study and results showed that including AE increases the predicted variance of the TPB. Moreover, AE have a positive effect on the intention and the actual behaviour of consumers. Next, the study suggests that Belgian consumers are more influenced by their emotional and control beliefs and that Hungarian consumers are also driven by opinion of family and friends and some behavioural beliefs. Practical implications - Overall, TPB can contribute to the understanding of behavioural intention and behaviour towards eating <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate.</b> Moreover, it can help to develop a marketing plan for specific consumer segments as it can identify influencing factors and consumer beliefs towards a product. Originality/value - This is the first study that compares the fit of the TPB model with and without the construct of AE. The work contributes to the growing literature on emotions as it does not focus on emotions elicited during or after consumption, but explores if the AE also play a significant role in behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Filled chocolates are {{particularly}} susceptible to quality loss due to oil migration. Since the fillings are often softer than the chocolate coatings, the filling lipids can {{function as an}} activator for diffusion processes {{with the formation of}} fat bloom as a consequence. Filling lipids can merge with chocolate during production or storage. However, in most studies concerning crystallization or migration cocoa butter and hazelnut oil were analyzed, investigations on chocolate are rare. To cover a broad variety of fillings, dark chocolate was blended with hazelnut oil, butterfat, and coconut oil and crystallization was analyzed. All investigated lipids reduced the solid fat content to the same extend. However, crystallization behavior of the blended samples differed. Hazelnut oil accelerated crystallization rate and did not affect crystallization time, while butterfat reduced crystallization rate and time. The effect of coconut oil addition was in between those of hazelnut oil and butterfat. Nucleation and crystal growth rate, which affect the crystallization speed, {{have been shown to be}} affected by the type of filling lipid. Additionally, there is evidence that crystal transformation during crystallization is also affected by filling lipids. Practical applications: Based on the results of this study, manufacturers of <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> products may adapt their processing parameters such as temperature and retention time in the cooling tunnel accordingly. The analytical methods may be used to control the production of confectionery and to determine filling fat concentrations in the chocolate shells of freshly produced pralines. As different filling lipids in small contents cause similar softening of chocolate shells, the solid fat content (SFC) of chocolate is an appropriate method to control filling lipid migration into chocolate. Isothermal crystallization of non-tempered samples shown as solid fat content (SFC) versus time indicate that hazelnut oil has a less retarding effect on crystallization than butterfat and the effect of coconut oil is in between, but closer to hazelnut oil...|$|E

40|$|Fat bloom {{is one of}} {{the main}} quality {{problems}} in the chocolate industry. A bloomed chocolate product is characterized by the loss of its initial gloss and the formation of a gray-whitish haze, which makes the product unappealing from a consumer point of view. In the industry, most of the fat bloom related problems arise in <b>filled</b> <b>chocolate</b> products, like pralines and chocolate-coated biscuits. In these products, oil migration is considered the main cause of fat bloom development. It leads to the dissolution of solid cocoa butter crystals in the chocolate shell which may recrystallize with the formation of undesired crystals. These give rise, upon growth, to visual fat bloom. When looking at the available literature, most of the studies elucidate the possible mechanisms of oil migration and the subsequent fat bloom formation using model systems. These model systems are sometimes too distant from the real industrial applications and the important role of the microstructure of the products are often neglected, although it plays a crucial role in migration-induced fat bloom development. The main objective of this review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, oil migration, and fat bloom. Practical applications: This review can be used as a base for the development of microstructural strategies to retard oil migration and fat bloom development in filled chocolates. An important strategy to retard oil migration and migration-induced fat bloom is the creation of more dense structures. By creating denser structures, the overall mobility is reduced leading to a decrease in the rate and extent of oil migration. Also, more dense structures hinder recrystallization and Ostwald ripening, thereby delaying the migration-induced fat bloom development. As fillings are less standardized and not bound by legislation, modification of the filling composition and microstructure offers more opportunities in delaying fat bloom. The main objective of the review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, oil migration, and fat bloom, as illustrated in this scheme. The numbers indicate the four parts that are discussed in this review...|$|E
