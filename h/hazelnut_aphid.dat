40|$|The {{densities of}} filbert (<b>hazelnut)</b> <b>aphid,</b> Myzocallis coryli (Goetze) on the hazel bushes were {{measured}} in both 1993 and 1994. The aphids were {{present on the}} hazel during from May to September, and peaked in July. Significantly greater densities of M. coryli were found in block 1 in the tree rows in both years (1993 & 1994). The population densities of aphids on hazel bushes {{were found to be}} significantly greater in the forestry plots than in the tree rows. The fewer predators observed provided too small a sample size for any meaningful comparisons of percentage predation to be made. ...|$|E
