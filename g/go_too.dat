5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too,</b> but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> was {{released}} by Smalltown Supersound on August 18, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and August 19 in the United States. A special edition was issued on December 23, 2008. The album featured a bonus disc with edited versions of the original tracks by frequent Lindstrøm collaborator Prins Thomas. Lindstrøm toured in Austria, Germany, Spain, and the United States that fall.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may <b>go</b> <b>too</b> far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E

5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to <b>go</b> <b>too.</b> Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E
5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E
25|$|Malevolent {{creativity}} {{has strong}} links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, {{there is a}} permanent tension between being creative and producing products that <b>go</b> <b>too</b> far {{and in some cases}} to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.|$|E

Austin charged that Zemprelli had been in office too long and had not done enough for the district. His critics said Austin had only served one-term in the State House and should wait before trying to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> far too fast politically.|$|E
25|$|Many {{complications}} {{arise when}} contact lenses are worn not as prescribed (improper wear schedule or lens replacement). Sleeping in lenses not designed or approved for extended wear {{is a common}} cause of complications. Many people <b>go</b> <b>too</b> long before replacing their contacts, wearing lenses designed for 1, 14, or 30 days of wear for multiple months or years. While this does save {{on the cost of}} lenses, it risks permanent damage to the eye and even loss of sight.|$|E
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH <b>go</b> <b>too</b> high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves <b>go</b> <b>too</b> far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After {{crossing}} the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are just {{looking for a place to}} <b>go,</b> <b>too.</b> While lighting up the rest of the fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they don't distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.|$|E

500|$|Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> is {{the first}} studio album by Norwegian electronica artist Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. It was first {{released}} in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2008 and was subsequently released {{the next day in}} the United States. The album comprises three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 minutes in length. Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> is usually labeled [...] "space disco" [...] due to its [...] "spacey, psychedelic" [...] feel and four-to-the-floor beats.|$|E

500|$|Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> {{comprises}} three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 {{minutes in}} duration, which seamlessly flow {{into each other}} in transitions that were described as [...] "gradual and subtle". The songs grow and develop independent musical traits, such as motifs, polyrhythms, and melodies. According to The Guardian, some musical changes are pronounced, such as {{the introduction of a}} synthesizer, while others, such as small tempo changes, remain [...] "almost insensible". Some critics have noted the album conjures the feeling of a journey.|$|E

Music felt {{audience}} reactions {{would be}} polarized; some {{would find it}} [...] "sophisticated and lovingly crafted", while others might be put off by its [...] "unabashed opulence". No Ripcord writer Sam Draper christened the record [...] "one of the finest pieces of music [...] heard in years." [...] Pitchfork editor Tim Finney believed Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> showed signs of a masterpiece, but also possessed [...] "bloat, excess, and splendor" [...] reminiscent of disco revivalists.

500|$|The {{music is}} a collage of {{electronic}} music, characterized by synthesized melodies, layered sounds, live performances, and [...] four-to-the-floor beats. Pitchfork editor Dominique Leone {{described it as a}} [...] "seamless combination of digital production, analog synthesizers and live instrumentation." [...] Lindstrøm has been heavily influenced by music from the 1970s and 1980s, particularly disco progenitors Jean-Marc Cerrone and Giorgio Moroder. Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> is often classified as [...] "space disco" [...] due to these influences and because it possesses a [...] "spacey, psychedelic" [...] sound. Lindstrøm listened to the Beach Boys, the Eagles, and Kirsty MacColl while writing the album.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic writer K. Ross Hoffman {{declared}} the record an [...] "entirely satisfying display" [...] of Lindstrøm's talents and positively {{commented on the}} textured instrumentation.

Club disagreed, believing the album to be narrow minded and a missed opportunity to exploit the lengthy tracks and deliver more musical depth. Praise was given by Alex Macpherson of The Guardian, who stated [...] "Every aspect of the record seems tailor-made to produce maximum pleasure [...] Where You Go I <b>Go</b> <b>Too</b> would make even the most hellish of journeys seem like a first-class trip." ...|$|E
