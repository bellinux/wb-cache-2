5|$|In Beijing, {{authorities}} halted renovation projects {{similar to}} the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze. The projects, intended to save energy by installing <b>insulation,</b> were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work.

5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing <b>insulation.</b> Scales on the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the <b>insulation</b> value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam <b>insulation</b> used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as <b>insulation</b> material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane <b>insulation,</b> which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the sound <b>insulations</b> and absorption coefficients {{of a range of}} metal-framed partitions having built-in acoustic treatment. The partitions were made using glass wool and gypsum boards. The sound <b>insulations</b> of the single leaf partitions having built-in acoustic treatment were considerably lower than those of comparable partitions made using mineral wool, gypsum boards and fibreboard. For the double leaf partition having built-in acoustic treatment, the sound <b>insulations</b> were, on average, 8 dB higher than those of the comparable partitions containing mineral wool. The use of the new double and triple leaf partitions containing built-in acoustic treatment should result in similar savings of floor areas to those obtained by using the partitions containing mineral wool as built-in acoustic treatment. However, {{it should be possible to}} obtain a flatter reverberation time curve using the new partitions and the sound <b>insulations</b> should be higher, provided that double leaf partitions are used.
