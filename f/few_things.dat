5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first <b>few</b> <b>things</b> gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally {{the luck of the}} draw whether that person is into us or not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.|$|E
5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

25|$|Until 1955, Edelbrock made parts {{only for}} Ford, Mercury and Lincoln. <b>Few</b> <b>things</b> {{affected}} the company (as {{well as the}} development of the hot rod market) more than {{the development of the}} Chevrolet Small-Block engine (also known as the Gen I) in 1955. Chevrolet delivered three Gen I engines to Edelbrock for experimentation. He used one engine for testing on a dynamometer and another to test multi-carb manifolds for magazine articles. He prepared the third engine for boat builder Henry Lauterback, who immediately set two world records in Miami, Florida.|$|E

If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 Brian De Palma, who {{directed}} Carrie, wanted Liv Ullmann {{to play the}} role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller Dressed to Kill and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982 Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play the main character Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, Fanny and Alexander and wrote the role with this in mind. But Ullmann felt the role was too sad and declined. Liv Ullmann later stated in interviews that turning it down was one of the <b>few</b> <b>things</b> she really regrets.|$|E

25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know <b>few</b> <b>things</b> more striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The {{contribution}} of the Kadambas to the architectural heritage of Karnataka is certainly worthy of recognition. The Kadamba style can be identified {{and that it has}} a <b>few</b> <b>things</b> in common with the Chalukya and the Pallava styles. The most prominent feature of their architecture, basic as it was is their Shikara called Kadamba Shikara. The Shikara is pyramid shaped and rises in steps without any decoration with a Stupika or Kalasha at the top. This style of Shikara are used several centuries later in the Doddagaddavalli Hoysala temple and the Mahakuta temples in Hampi. Some of their temples also use perforated screen windows. It has also been pointed out that in architecture and sculpture, the Kadambas contributed to the foundation of the later Chalukya-Hoysala style.|$|E
25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune.

So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a <b>few</b> <b>things.</b> And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
5000|$|Metaphysical {{possibility}} {{has been}} {{thought to be}} more restricting than bare logical possibility (i.e., <b>fewer</b> <b>things</b> are metaphysically possible than are logically possible).

Philosophers also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely [...] "by definition", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely.|$|R
