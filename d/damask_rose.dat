5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the <b>Damask</b> <b>rose,</b> which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E

The famous rose of Ta'if is the 30-petal <b>damask</b> <b>rose</b> which has a scent so robust, spicy, and dizzyingly complex, {{that it has been}} used in several luxury perfumes including Ormonde Jayne Perfumery, Chanel and Guerlain.|$|E

Delphine in 1913 at the Shaftesbury Theatre, and as Jericho Mardyke in Our Nell in 1924 at the Gaiety Theatre. He {{also appeared in}} Madame Pompadour (1924). A late Gilbert and Sullivan performance was in Trial by Jury at a benefit matinée for Courtice Pounds in 1927, when Passmore was joined by stars including Leslie Henson and Derek Oldham. After this long career, his last role was Count Theodore Volney in 1933 in The <b>Damask</b> <b>Rose.</b>|$|E

25|$|Courtneidge {{returned}} to presenting West End musical shows in 1927, directing Lehár's The Blue Mazurka (1927) with English lyrics by Harry Graham at Daly's Theatre. His last London musical was The <b>Damask</b> <b>Rose</b> (1930), {{an attempt to}} emulate with Chopin's music the success of Lilac Time, a piece written around Schubert's music. The adaptation was by Clutsam (who had adapted Lilac Time), with Courtneidge as co-author of the book. A strong cast included Walter Passmore, and the piece won friendly notices. His final production was at the Prince's and on tour, a musical, Lavender (1930), with music by Clutsam. In the same year, Courtneidge published his memoirs I was an actor once, and in 1933 he wrote a novel, Judith Clifford.|$|E

60|$|Coming home we {{met with}} an {{accident}} to the carriage which obliged us {{to get out and}} walk some distance. I was glad enough of it, because it gave me a better opportunity for seeing the country. We stopped at a cottage to get some rope, and a young woman came out with that beautiful, clear complexion which I so much admire here in England; literally her cheeks were like <b>damask</b> <b>roses.</b>|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} {{was much}} younger, not so tall, and of slender form. The long tresses of her chestnut hair shaded her oval face. Her small, aquiline nose, bright hazel eyes, delicate mouth, {{and the deep}} colour of her lips, were as remarkable as the transparency of her complexion. The flush of her cheek was singular; it was of a brilliant pink: you may {{find it in the}} lip of an Indian shell. The blue veins played beneath her arched forehead, like lightning beneath a rainbow. She was dressed in white, and a <b>damask</b> <b>rose,</b> half hid in her clustering hair, was her only ornament. This lovely creature glided by Vivian Grey almost unnoticed, so fixed was his gaze on her companion. Yet, magnificent as was the style of Lady Madeleine Trevor, there were few who preferred even her commanding graces to the softer beauties of Violet Fane.|$|E
60|$|Of {{this kind}} is an Experiment lately related {{to me by}} Mr. Halley, who, in diving deep into the Sea in a diving Vessel, found in a clear Sun-shine Day, {{that when he was}} sunk many Fathoms deep into the Water the upper part of his Hand on which the Sun shone {{directly}} through the Water and through a small Glass Window in the Vessel appeared of a red Colour, like that of a <b>Damask</b> <b>Rose,</b> and the Water below and the under part of his Hand illuminated by Light reflected from the Water below look'd green. For thence it may be gather'd, that the Sea-Water reflects back the violet and blue-making Rays most easily, and lets the red-making Rays pass most freely and copiously to great Depths. For thereby the Sun's direct Light at all great Depths, by reason of the predominating red-making Rays, must appear red; and the greater the Depth is, the fuller and intenser must that red be. And at such Depths as the violet-making Rays scarce penetrate unto, the blue-making, green-making, and yellow-making Rays being reflected from below more copiously than the red-making ones, must compound a green.|$|E

60|$|Once {{more the}} hum of the bee was heard booming over the grass, and from the shadow of the tree there emerged a dainty being whose attire glittered in the moonlight, and whose step was like that of a proud monarch. He was clad in a many-hued coat made of wings of dragon flies, a green vest cut from a downy {{mouse-ear}} leaf, and with buttons of buttercup buds; little knee-breeches of fine-spun silk dyed in the juice of a whinberry, stockings of cobweb, and shoes of shining beetle case; his shirt, which was as white as falling snow, had been cut from convolvulus flowers ere they had opened to the light; and his hat, a gem of a thing fit only for a fairy, was of red poppy, with a waving white feather, and a band of fur from a caterpillar. He led by the hand another personage, equally daintily dressed, but of a higher order of loveliness, with a pale oval face, and dreamy-looking eyes, gleaming like the sea when the moon and stars are bending over its bosom, and the wind is whispering its sad secrets. Her hair was golden, and rippled almost to her exquisite feet, and over it she wore a blue cornflower wreath, with diamond dewdrops here and there amid the leaves. Her dress was of <b>damask</b> <b>rose</b> leaves looped up with myosotis.|$|E

5000|$|Centifolia roses {{are also}} known as Cabbage roses, or as Provence roses.

50|$|As remontancy is {{considered}} a desirable horticultural characteristic, it is preferentially selected for by rose hybridisers. Remontant roses descended from Rosa chinensis have been grown in China {{for at least a}} thousand years, but the first garden roses in Europe to possess remontancy were the autumn damasks, which first appeared in the seventeenth century with the introduction of the cultivar 'Quatre Saisons'. Recent DNA research has shown that these <b>damask</b> <b>roses</b> resulted from crosses involving Rosa gallica, Rosa moschata and the remontant central Asian species Rosa fedtschenkoana. When forms of Rosa chinensis were introduced into Europe in the late eighteenth century, subsequent hybridisation between these and the European roses eventually led to the wide variety of remontant garden hybrids which are available today.|$|R
