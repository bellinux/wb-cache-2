40|$|<b>Enzymatic</b> <b>interconversion</b> {{of active}} and {{inactive}} glucocorticoid hormone is important, and {{is carried out}} physiologically by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) isoforms, explaining their role in cellular and toxicological processes. Two forms of the enzyme, 11 beta-HSD- 1 and 11 beta-HSD- 2, belonging to the protein superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, have been structurally and functionally characterised. Although displaying dehydrogenase and reductase activities in vitro, the dominant in vivo function of the type- 1 enzyme might be {{to work as a}} reductase, thus generating active cortisol from inactive cortisone precursors. On the other hand, for adrenal glucocorticoids the type- 2 enzyme seems to be exclusively a dehydrogenase and, by inactivating glucocorticoids, confers specificity to peripheral mineralocorticoid receptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe lifetimes of {{the first}} excited singlet states (21 Ag) of diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin, {{carotenoids}} involved in the xanthophyll cycle in some genera of algae, have been measured by femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy to be 22. 8 ± 0. 1 ps and 13. 3 ± 0. 1 ps, respectively. Using the energy gap law for radiationless transitions set forth by Englman and Jortner (Mol. Phys. 18 (1970) 145 – 164), these lifetimes correspond to S 1 excited state energies of 15 210 cm− 1 for diadinoxanthin and 14 620 cm− 1 for diatoxanthin. The lowest excited singlet state energy of Chl a has an energy of 14 700 cm− 1. The fact that the S 1 state energy of diadinoxanthin lies above that of Chl a, whereas the S 1 state energy of diatoxanthin lies below that of Chl a, suggests that the xanthophyll cycle involving the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>interconversion</b> of diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin {{may play a role}} in regulating energy flow between these molecules and Chl a in many species of algae, essentially fulfilling a role identical to that proposed for violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in higher plants and green algae (Frank et al. (1994) Photosyn. Res. 41, 389 – 395) ...|$|E
40|$|Animal viruses (e. g., lentiviruses and herpesviruses) use {{transcriptional}} {{positive feedback}} (i. e., transactivation) to regulate their gene expression. But positive-feedback circuits are inherently unstable when turned off, which presents a particular dilemma for latent viruses that lack transcriptional repressor motifs. Here {{we show that}} a dissipative feedback resistor, composed of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>interconversion</b> of the transactivator, converts transactivation circuits into excitable systems that generate transient pulses of expression, which decay to zero. We use HIV- 1 as a model system and analyze single-cell expression kinetics to explore whether the HIV- 1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) uses a resistor to shut off transactivation. The Tat feedback circuit was found to lack bi-stability and Tat self-cooperativity but exhibited a pulse of activity upon transactivation, all {{in agreement with the}} feedback resistor model. Guided by a mathematical model, biochemical and genetic perturbation of the suspected Tat feedback resistor altered the circuit’s stability and reduced susceptibility to molecular noise, in agreement with model predictions. We propose that the feedback resistor is a necessary, but possibly not sufficient, condition for turning off noisy transactivation circuits lacking a repressor motif (e. g., HIV- 1 Tat). Feedback resistors may be a paradigm for examining other auto-regulatory circuits and may inform upon how viral latency is established, maintained, and broken...|$|E
40|$|Green vanilla beans were {{subjected}} to the traditional curing process in Mexico. Odor-active potential from beans including 23 compounds was monitored through the analysis of both free and glucosidically bound volatiles. 8 of them were aliphatic aldehydes, acids, alcohol and ketone. 15 molecules were shikimate derivatives in which 13 were detected in glucosylated form. Some glucosides were efficiently hydrolyzed while some others partly {{or not at all}} after 90 days of curing. Moreover kinetics of hydrolysis of glucosides were not the same. A major part of glucovanillin was hydrolyzed at the first stages of curing while some other glucosides at the advanced stages. Data support hypothesis that hydrolysis of glucosides during curing is rather enzymatic origin than chemical one. Free shikimate derivatives or those liberated from glucosides are prone to chemical or <b>enzymatic</b> <b>interconversions</b> leading to a significant change in the aroma profile of cured vanilla.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) is an {{essential}} requirement for kernel growth in maize (Zea mays); however, {{little is known about}} how N assimilates are metabolized in young earshoots during seed development. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess amino acid metabolism in cob and spikelet tissues during the critical 2 weeks following silking. Two maize hybrids were grown in the field for 2 years at two levels of supplemental N fertilizer (0 and 168 kg N/ha). The effects of the reproductive sink on cob N metabolism were examined by comparing pollinated to unpollinated earshoots. Earshoots were sampled at 2, 8, 14, and 18 d after silking; dissected into cob, spikelet, and/or pedicel and kernel fractions; then analyzed for amino acid profiles and key enzyme activities associated with amino acid metabolism. Major amino acids in the cob were glutamine (Gln), aspartic acid (Asp), asparagine (Asn), glutamate, and alanine. Gln concentrations dropped dramatically from 2 to 14 d after silking in both pollinated and unpollinated cobs, whereas all other measured amino acids accumulated over time in unpollinated spikelets and cobs, especially Asn. N supply had a variable effect on individual amino acid levels in young cobs and spikelets, with Asn being the most notably enhanced. We found that the cob performs significant <b>enzymatic</b> <b>interconversions</b> among Gln, alanine, Asp, and Asn during early reproductive development, which may precondition the N assimilate supply for sustained kernel growth. The measured amino acid profiles and enzymatic activities suggest that the Asn to Gln ratio in cobs may be part of a signal transduction pathway involving aspartate aminotransferase, Gln synthetase, and Asn synthetase to indicate plant N status for kernel development...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about <b>enzymatic</b> quinone-quinol <b>interconversions</b> in the lipid {{membrane}} when compared with our knowledge of substrate transformations by globular enzymes. Here, the smallest example of a quinol dehydrogenase in nature, CymA, has been studied. CymA is a monotopic membrane tetraheme c-type cytochrome belonging to the NapC/NirT family and central to anaerobic respiration in Shewanella sp. Using protein-film electrochemistry, it is shown that vesicle-bound menaquinone- 7 {{is not only a}} substrate for this enzyme but is also required as a cofactor when converting other quinones. Here, we propose that the high concentration of quinones in the membrane negates the evolutionary pressure to create a high affinity active site. However, the instability and reactivity of reaction intermediate, semiquinone, might require a cofactor that functions to minimize damaging side reactions. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{proposed}} that conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) to its free radical-producing form, xanthine oxidase (XOD), underlies ischemic/reperfusion injury, although the relationship of this conversion to hypoxia and its physiologic control have not been defined. This study details the time course and control of this <b>enzymatic</b> <b>interconversion.</b> In a functionally intact, isolated perfused rat liver model, mean % XOD activity increased {{as a function of}} both the duration (25 to 45 % in 3 h) and degree (r = 0. 97) of hypoxia. This process was markedly accelerated in ischemic liver by an overnight fast (45 vs. 30 % at 2 h), and by imposing a short period of in vivo ischemia (cardiopulmonary arrest 72 %). Moreover, only under these conditions was there a significant rise in the XOD activity due to the conformationally altered XDH molecule (XODc, 18 %), as well as concomitant morphologic injury. Neither circulating white blood cells nor thrombosis appeared to contribute to the effects of in vivo ischemia on enzyme conversion. Thus, it is apparent that conversion to the free radical-producing state, with high levels of XOD activity and concurrent cellular injury, can be achieved during {{a relatively short period of}} hypoxia under certain well-defined physiologic conditions, in a time course consistent with its purported role in modulating reperfusion injury. These data also suggest that the premorbid condition of organ donors (e. g., nutritional status and relative state of hypoxia) is important in achieving optimal organ preservation...|$|E
