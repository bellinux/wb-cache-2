25|$|Many, but not all, {{computer}} keyboards have a numeric keypad {{to the right}} of the alphabetic keyboard, often separated from the other groups of keys such as the <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> and system command keys, which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> On Japanese/Korean keyboards, there may be Language input keys for changing the language to use. Some keyboards have power management keys(e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or E-mail; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls; or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified application or a command like minimizing all windows.|$|E
25|$|This PC-240 still wasn't entirely IBM PC {{standard}} as the keyboard, although being {{a standard}} PC/AT device, allowed for VS compatibility with 24 <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> {{rather than the}} normal 12, {{and a number of}} Wang VS specific keys. There was also a slight difference in CPU interrupts from IBM standard, so some software had compatibility issues.|$|E
25|$|Keyboards and keypads may be {{illuminated}} from inside, {{especially on}} equipment for mobile use. Illumination facilitates {{the use of}} the keyboard or keypad in dark environments. Some gaming keyboards have lighted keys, {{to make it easier for}} gamers to find command keys while playing in a dark room. Some keyboards may have small LED lights in a few important <b>function</b> <b>keys,</b> to remind users that the function is activated (see photo).|$|E

40|$|Are you {{entering}} {{one or more}} of {{the same}} SAS ® Display Manager System (DMS) commands repeatedly during a session? The DMS offers a convenient way of capturing and saving frequently entered commands in a user-defined macro, and then saving the macro as a <b>function</b> <b>key</b> of your choosing. Are you typing SAS ® code for data exploration during program development or validation, only to delete it soon afterwards? If you are, then this code can be placed in a macro, too, and assigned to a <b>function</b> <b>key.</b> This paper illustrates the purpose and steps that you use to assign a user-defined macro to a <b>function</b> <b>key...</b>|$|R
25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of <b>function</b> <b>keys,</b> the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E
25|$|Numeric {{keyboards}} contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.|$|E
25|$|The Cr-48's {{hardware}} design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys, {{such as the}} <b>function</b> <b>keys,</b> and replacing the caps lock key with a dedicated search key, which can be changed back to caps lock in the OS's keyboard settings. Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Internet, demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs, and announced a 3G plan that would give users 100MB of free data each month, with additional paid plans available from Verizon.|$|E

25|$|The {{machine was}} similar in {{power to the}} Apple II and {{included}} a small 9-inch black-and-white character display built into a small case with a floppy disk. It was text only, as Raskin disliked the computer mouse {{or anything else that}} could take his hands from the keyboard. A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.|$|E
25|$|Electric Pencil, {{released}} in December 1976, {{was the first}} word processor software for microcomputers. Software-based word processors running on general-purpose personal computers gradually displaced dedicated word processors, and the term came to refer to software rather than hardware. Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large plastic clip-on template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> {{and many of the}} alphabet keys.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista aims {{to simplify}} the detection, configuration, and {{installation}} of external displays and projectors by introducing a standardized setup procedure and interface. The WDDM architecture in Windows Vista enables hot plug detection of external displays and alerts the new Transient Multimon Manager (TMM) when an external display is connected to a system, which then presents an Aero Wizard interface for the configuration and setup of the display. In previous versions of Windows, installation routines for displays often varied based on hardware configurations such as <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> and specific manufacturer requirements, and typically required separate software interfaces. When possible, the TMM also saves user preferences for individual displays to improve mobility scenarios as these preferences can then be restored when a display is reconnected at a different time or location. The aforementioned improvements are intended to enable a display connectivity experience that provides the ease of use observed with plug and play peripherals.|$|E

25|$|Within a community, {{keyboard}} layout is generally quite stable, {{due to the}} high training cost of touch-typing, and the resulting network effect of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining, and the suboptimal QWERTY layout is {{a case study in}} switching costs. Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY), and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> most of all: QWERTY dates to the No. 1 (1874) (though 1 and 0 were added later), shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); function key placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.|$|E
500|$|The {{front part}} of the case is {{occupied}} by an integrated 40-key membrane keyboard displaying 20graphic and 54inverse video characters. Each key has up to five functions, accessed via the SHIFT and <b>FUNCTION</b> <b>keys</b> or depending on context. For example, the P key combines the letter P, the [...] " [...] character, and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB. The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.|$|E
500|$|Apple {{unveiled}} {{fourth generation}} 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. The models introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip {{built into the}} top of the keyboard in place of the <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> They include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a [...] "second-generation" [...] butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.|$|E

500|$|The fourth {{generation}} MacBook Pro was announced on October 27, 2016. It replaced the <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> with an interactive, multi-touch [...] "Touch Bar" [...] and a Touch ID sensor {{integrated into the}} Power button. The 15-inch notebook started at $2,399, compared to $1,999 for the previous iteration. On 5 June 2017, Apple upgraded the internals of the MacBook Pro, such as enhanced Iris Plus and AMD Radeon graphics, Kaby Lake processors, and added memory. Additionally, the 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 128GB storage option (down from the base 256GB storage) with a lowered starting price of $1299. All other configurations of the MacBook Pro have the same price as last year, barring the incremental upgrades in processors and graphics.|$|E
500|$|Other updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core Intel [...] "Skylake" [...] Core i5 and i7 processors, {{improved}} graphics, {{and displays}} {{that offer a}} 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a 5K display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card {{in addition to the}} integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of <b>function</b> <b>keys,</b> and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not upgradeable, while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable.|$|E
2500|$|A {{computer}} keyboard comprises alphanumeric or character keys for typing, modifier keys for altering {{the functions of}} other keys, navigation keys for moving the text cursor on the screen, <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> and system command keys – such as [...] and [...] – for special actions, and often a numeric keypad to facilitate calculations.|$|E

2500|$|Keyboards on laptops and {{notebook}} computers {{usually have a}} shorter travel distance for the keystroke, shorter over travel distance, and a reduced set of keys. They {{may not have a}} numerical keypad, and the <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> may be placed in locations that differ from their placement on a standard, full-sized [...] keyboard. The switch mechanism for a laptop keyboard {{is more likely to be}} a scissor switch than a rubber dome; this is opposite the trend for full-size keyboards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{built-in}} display was a one-bit black-and-white, [...] CRT with a fixed {{resolution of}} 512×342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 PPI. Expansion and networking were achieved using two non-standard RS-422 DE-9 serial ports named [...] "printer" [...] and [...] "modem"; {{they did not}} support hardware handshaking. An external floppy disk drive could be added using a proprietary connector (19-pin D-sub). The keyboard and mouse used simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades. The original keyboard had no arrow keys, numeric keypad or <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> This was an intentional decision by Apple, as these keys were common on older platforms and {{it was thought that}} the addition of these keys would encourage software developers to simply port their existing applications to the Mac, rather than design new ones around the GUI paradigm. Later, Apple would make a numeric keypad available for the Macintosh 128K. The keyboard sold with the newer Macintosh Plus model would include the numeric keypad and arrow keys, but still no <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> As with the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse had a single button. Standard headphones could also be connected to a monaural jack. Apple also offered their 300 and 1200bit/s modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially, the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter, a dot matrix printer which was designed to produce 144dpi WYSIWYG output from the Mac's 72dpi screen. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple's built-in networking system.|$|E
2500|$|Keyboard {{keys are}} {{commonly}} referred to inside angle brackets with full commands being contained in curly brackets  e.g., {VOD LN Equity }. The <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> names were replaced (from the technical name, e.g., F10) and the then standard beige color, opting for a memorable color and user-friendly name, Yellow. The F10 key is thus a Yellow key named [...] The Esc is coloured red and named [...] in the Bloomberg system, with the red to catch one's eye to stop a task. The Enter key {{is referred to as}} [...] with a green color, deriving from the Monopoly game board, by passing Go and collecting $200 in a hope that the user could make money on the information he would find.|$|E

50|$|Since Mac OS X Lion, the <b>function</b> <b>key</b> F4 is a {{keyboard}} shortcut to Launchpad. If enabled, Apple's gesture recognition software interprets a thumb-and-three-finger pinch on a touchpad as a command to open Launchpad.|$|R
5000|$|Many Windows/PC {{users have}} found a {{workaround}} using Microsoft's Intellitype Pro software, which allows a user to assign keystrokes/macros to the <b>function</b> and accessory <b>keys.</b> For example, assigning a macro {Press } to the <b>function</b> <b>key</b> [...] renders the F-lock issue moot, since the OS will interpret the key press as F1 regardless of the F-lock state.|$|R
