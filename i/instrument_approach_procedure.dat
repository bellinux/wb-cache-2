5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR <b>instrument</b> <b>{{approach}}</b> <b>procedure,</b> final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E

500|$|On December22, 1950, a Douglas C-47 {{aircraft}} {{operated by}} Canadian Pacific Air Lines from Vancouver crashed into Okanagan Mountain, some [...] north of Penticton.

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of December 23, 1985 a Beechcraft Baron N1494G, {{executing}} a missed <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> from an approach to runway 19R, lost control and crashed into {{the roof of the}} Macy's Department Store at nearby Sunvalley Mall, killing the pilot and two passengers and seriously injuring 84 Christmas shoppers in the crowded mall, mainly by spraying them with burning fuel. [...] Four of the victims on the ground later died. [...] The accident brought increased opposition to the airport and caused Pacific Southwest Airlines to delay scheduled passenger flights that had been planned to start in January 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Low clouds, deteriorating visibility, {{and winds}} that favored Runway 29 in Campbeltown, {{which did not}} have an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> {{necessary}} for landing in such conditions as were forecast for the expected arrival time, posed serious challenges to making a safe landing in Campbeltown. As G-BOMG neared its destination, conditions were worsening. The pilot chose to follow the <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> for Runway 11 until he saw the airport, at which point he would circle the airport to land on Runway 29. To perform this manoeuvre, the pilot was not permitted to descend below an altitude of 1,045 feet. However, the weather reports the pilot received when he departed and others he received while en route show the cloud base was down to 400 feet ("broken" [...] cloud layer). This was acceptable for an approach to Runway 11, but not for the circling manoeuvre to Runway 29. At the same time, the wind had increased from 8 kts to 15 kts in Campbeltown, making a landing on Runway 11 increasingly difficult, with significant crosswind and tailwind components. Four minutes before the accident, the controller in Campbeltown advised the pilot that there were now a [...] "few" [...] clouds at 300 feet as well as the broken layer at 400 feet. For the duration of the flight, the pilot likely had very little visual contact with the ground due to being in or over clouds, or out over water in low visibility. As the aircraft descended through the cloud base, the pilot likely had no visual cue that he was below the clouds because the aircraft was about 7nm out to sea and visibility was reported as 1,500 metres. The pilot of a search and rescue helicopter later commented that the sea surface that night would have provided the pilot with little or no visual cues about the aircraft's dangerously low altitude.|$|E

2500|$|The {{airliner}} left Stallings Field at Kinston, North Carolina, and {{the flight}} proceeded to Huntington without incident. The crew established radio contact with air traffic controllers at 7:23 pm with instructions to descend to 5,000 feet. The controllers advised the crew that there was [...] "rain, fog, smoke and a ragged ceiling" [...] at the airport, making landing more difficult but possible. At 7:34 pm, the airliner's crew reported passing Tri-State Airport's outer marker. The controller gave them clearance to land. The aircraft began its normal descent after passing the outer marker, but did not arrest its descent and hold altitude at 1240ft, {{as required by the}} assigned <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedure.</b> Instead, the descent continued for another 300ft for unknown reasons, apparently without either crewmember seeing the airport lights or runway.|$|E
