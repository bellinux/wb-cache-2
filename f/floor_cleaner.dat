40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from cleaning products and air fresheners indoors are prone to oxidation resulting {{in the formation of}} secondary pollutants that can pose health risks on residents. In this study, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) method was applied for the determination of BVOCs compositions in three categories of cleaning products including <b>floor</b> <b>cleaners</b> (FC), kitchen cleaners (KC) and dishwashing detergents (DD), and also air fresheners (AF). The analysis results demonstrated that chemical composition and concentration of individual BVOC varied broadly with household products in the view of their different functions and scents as indicated on the labels. The concentration of total BVOCs for sample FC 1 was the highest up to 4146. 0 μg g- 1, followed by FC 2 of 264. 6 μg g- 1, FC 4 of 249. 3 μg g- 1 and FC 3 of 139. 2 μg g- 1. d-limonene was the most abundant detected BVOCs in KC samples with the chemical composition varying from 19. 6 ± 1. 0 to 1513. 0 ± 37. 1 μg g- 1.

Increased resistance to triclosan has recently been attributed to an alteration in the fabI gene coding for enoyl reductase. 1 Although patient non-compliance with the decolonizing regimen may be responsible for failure to eradicate MRSA, it is also possible that increased resist-ance to triclosan may contribute. In a recent study of a small number of clinical MRSA isolates, a triclosan MIC range of 0. 025 – 1 mg/L was reported, 3 whereas in an earlier study, MICs of 2 – 4 mg/L were reported for MRSA. 4 We studied 232 clinical MRSA isolates referred to the Scottish MRSA Reference Laboratory from 30 Scottish hospitals between 1997 and 2000.

5000|$|The word {{halitosis}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word halitus, meaning 'breath', and the Greek suffix -osis meaning 'diseased' or 'a condition of'. With modern consumerism, there has been a complex interplay of advertising pressures and the existing evolutionary aversion to malodor. Contrary to the popular belief that Listerine coined the term halitosis, its origins date to before the product's existence, being coined by physician Joseph William Howe in his 1874 book The Breath, and the Diseases Which Give It a Fetid Odor, although it only became commonly used in the 1920s when a marketing campaign promoted Listerine as a solution for [...] "chronic halitosis".

Current project work targets to use automatic <b>floor</b> <b>cleaner</b> for large floor in house-hold purposes and office floors. The cleaning purpose is specifically carried out by continuous relative motion between a scrubber and the floor surface. During the cleaning and moving operation of vehicle a propulsion mechanism such as driven wheels and guide wheels for the dry tracking on the floor surface to be cleaned, suction of water is carried out by vacuum pump, scrubbing action is done by the scrubber directing water towards rear end. Preferably, a sweeper mechanism is mounted on the body forwarded by propulsion mechanism and operated with such control system for advance sweeping of a debris-laden floor surface. A PID controller is used to govern the motion of system which takes the input from sensor circuit and feeds it back to microcontroller which gives rise to the simulation of wheel in a synchronized manner.

40|$|Poisoning, a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} among children may be accidental or deliberate. This study was undertaken to assess the factors associated with poisoning in children in a south Indian city with high levels of education and health care facilities. The study included all children 18 years and below, admitted with poisoning during a four year period at the PSG institute of medical science and research, Coimbatore. The relevant data including the substance(s) consumed, time interval at presentation to the casualty, Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) and outcome were noted on a pre-designed questionnaire. There were 121 cases of poisoning, constituting 0. 5 % of total pediatric admissions. Among them, 86 (70. 2 %) children consumed poison for Deliberate Self Harm (DSH) and in 35 (29. 8 %) it was accidental. In 31 of the 35 children with accidental poisoning, easily available household items (drugs, insecticides, cleaning solutions) were responsible. The median age of children with accidental poisoning was 2 years, while in DSH it was 16 years. One third of children with DSH had an underlying psychiatric disorder. A majority (75 %) of children were brought to hospital within six hours. The poison severity score was none or mild in 91 (75. 2 %), while 17 had moderate and 10 had severe poisoning.
