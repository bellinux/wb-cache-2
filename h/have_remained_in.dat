5|$|In 1876, Coolsma {{returned}} to the Netherlands and became {{the leader of the}} Netherlands Missionary Union, promoting further missionary activity in the predominantly Muslim western portion of the East Indies. He also wrote extensively on Sundanese, including a grammar and two dictionaries. Although his Bible translation had little lasting impact, these later works <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> use.|$|E
5|$|It {{has hosted}} more top-flight games {{than any other}} stadium in England. Goodison has hosted {{the maximum number of}} league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> the top tier of English {{football}} since 1954. The club has only been outside the top division for four seasons, having only been relegated twice (in 1930 and 1951).|$|E

5|$|The Chincoteague Indians {{gradually}} withdrew northwards in {{the late}} 17th century as European colonization grew; most settled on a reservation at present-day Snow Hill, Maryland, with allied tribes of Native Americans, though some may <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> their traditional area. They were later forced from the reservation, and their descendants are among the Nanticoke people in southern Delaware.|$|E
5|$|The four {{national}} {{associations of}} the UK met in 1882 {{with a view}} to creating a common set of laws. They created of the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which first met in 1886. The IFAB's role was further affirmed when Fédération Internationale de Football Association adopted their laws upon its formation in 1904. They <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> sole charge of the rules ever since.|$|E

5|$|Cultura Profética (in English, Prophetic Culture) is a Puerto Rican reggae band {{formed in}} 1996. The band has {{undergone}} several lineup changes, but founding members Willy Rodríguez (bass guitar, vocals), Boris Bilbraut (drums, vocals), Eliut González (guitar), and Omar Silva (guitar, bass guitar) <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> the group throughout its history. Despite primarily performing reggae music, Cultura Profética has experimented with genres such as bossa nova, tango, jazz, and salsa. Lyrically, the group discusses socio-political and ecological issues including Latin American identity and environmental concerns, {{as well as}} interpersonal relationships and love.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{the club}} were managed by Jimmy Philip. At {{the end of}} its first season, despite having {{finished}} seventh out of twelve teams, Aberdeen were elected to the new, expanded First Division. They <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> the top tier of Scottish football ever since. From 1906, the club made steady progress, with a Scottish Cup semi-final appearance in 1908 and another in 1911. In that season of 1910–11, Aberdeen recorded their first victories over the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers, and led the league for a time, but finished the season in second place.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{classified}} as a chalcophile under the Goldschmidt classification, meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur. It rarely occurs in its native, metallic form. Many lead minerals are relatively light and, {{over the course of}} the Earth's history, <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> the crust instead of sinking deeper into the Earth's interior. This accounts for lead's relatively high crustal abundance of 14 ppm; it is the 38th most abundant element in the crust.|$|E

5|$|Maximus may <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> Rome, {{because he}} was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present {{condemned}} Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may {{have been written by}} Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|No {{conclusive}} proof of wrongdoing {{has come to}} light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he {{was found to have}} misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top-flight football.|$|E
5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential source for the period—to {{have been one of}} the cities abandoned c. 587/8 as a result of the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria. This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E

5|$|Pausanias {{returned}} to Byzantium {{as a private}} citizen in 477 BC, and took command of the city until he was expelled by the Athenians. He then crossed the Bosporus and settled in Kolonai in the Troad, until he was again accused of collaborating with the Persians and was recalled by the Spartans for a trial after which he starved himself to death. The timescale is unclear, but Pausanias may <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> possession of Byzantium until 470 BC.|$|E
5|$|Such names <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> use through tradition, each {{referring}} to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.

The City of London is the main financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.|$|E
5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> service while being over 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E

5|$|The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God is not {{the first}} church {{building}} to occupy the position on top of the Tsarevets hill. It was constructed directly on top of a late Roman (early Byzantine) basilica which dates to the 5th–6th century AD. The Roman basilica may <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> use by the local congregation during the First Bulgarian Empire, though it was no longer active by the time the construction of the current church began.|$|E
5|$|The first flights {{serving the}} American bases in Greenland {{operated}} lightweight DHC-3 Otters and Sikorsky S-55 helicopters chartered from Canada. After a crash in 1961, Grønlandsfly used PBY Catalina water planes and DHC-6 Twin Otters on domestic routes. One of the Catalinas then crashed in 1962. In 1965, the Douglas DC-4 became the line's first larger airplane. It {{was followed by}} Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, which <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> use: in 2010, they still served the communities of Kujalleq municipality in southern Greenland year-round and those of Disko Bay during the winter.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K. Bell classified Leptailurus as a subgenus of Felis, while others like O.R.P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with Felis, Lynx and Caracal. Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s {{show that the}} serval, along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of Felidae. According to a 2006 genetic study, the Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6mya.|$|E
