40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the standards relative to technical exigencies and CE marking that correspond to photovoltaic inverters of low voltage (less than 5 Â kW) as marketed in Spain. For this study, around 400 different models of inverters from the European market were compiled. Twelve of them, 50 Â Hz single phase, were chosen, made up of different brands and options of transformer below 5 Â kW. For these inverters, regulations for each model were examined according to their data sheet specifications, manual and EC <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conformity.</b> Heterogeneity in compliance to the standards was found. In addition, in view of results obtained it is possible to conclude that it would be wise to establish a common set of standards for every country in the world (or at least a common European normalization) according to PV grid inverters. It would enable all grid inverters to be commercialised in compliance with the same standards everywhere.

2500|$|In the European Union, {{there are}} {{certifying}} entities named [...] "Notified Bodies", accredited by European Member States. The Notified Bodies must ensure {{the effectiveness of}} the certification process for all medical devices apart from the class I devices where a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> produced by the manufacturer is sufficient for marketing. Once a product has passed all the steps required by the Medical Device Directive, the device is entitled to bear a CE marking, indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective when used as intended, and, therefore, it can be marketed within the European Union area.|$|E
2500|$|A {{notified}} body, in the European Union, is {{an entity}} {{that has been}} accredited by a Member State to assess whether a product {{to be placed on}} the market meets certain preordained standards. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. [...] For example, a notified body may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conformity,</b> the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).|$|E
2500|$|In the European context, safety {{effectiveness}} and quality is ensured through the [...] "Conformity Assessment" [...] that {{is defined as}} [...] "the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies {{with the requirements of}} the European Medical Device Directive". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, [...] the technical file and the quality system deliveries. [...] The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients {{for the use of the}} device. The technical file contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure. [...] The Quality System deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality management systems in US and worldwide.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{perceived}} {{authority on the}} clinical behaviour and decisionmaking of midwives has received little research attention, {{largely due to the}} unavailability of a midwifery-specific measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> The current study investigated the factor structure of the social influence scale for midwifery (SISM), a recently developed measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> designed specifically for use within midwifery practice. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a four-factor model <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> comprising distinct dimensions <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> client control, personal control and non-conformity offered an excellent fit to the data. It is concluded that, though the SIS-M was developed as a unitary measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> there is also compelling evidence that the SIS-M could be developed as a multi-dimensional measure of distinct, but related, conformity dimensions. The SIS-M therefore offers considerable potential as a research tool to gain novel insights into the <b>conformity</b> behaviour <b>of</b> midwives in the practice environment and the relationship of such behaviour to maternal and neonatal outcomes...|$|R
