All other programs on the national schedule are aired live, with separate times given for Atlantic Time; promotional trailers for national programs give the broadcast time as one hour later (for example- [...] "neuf heures, Maritimes dix heures"). Two national programs that it are normally heard at 7 p.m. local time in other time zones - Les éclaireurs (Monday-Thursday) and Parasol et <b>gobelets</b> (Friday), are heard at 6 p.m. instead, to enable its nightly news program, L'heure du monde to be heard live at 6 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. AT.; {{the rest of the}} evening programming is heard in pre-release until the rerun of Format libre at 10 p.m. filling the gap caused by the 6 p.m. pre-release.|$|E

In the southeast of France, especially in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region and the middle and lower Rhone valley, numerous rescue excavations have been made {{during the last few}} years particulary in course of the important archaeological salvage project along the railroad line of the TGV-Méditerranée during which many new Bell Beaker sites have been discovered.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and intriguing of the cultural complexes is that of the Bell Beaker Complex, particularly in the light of its wide geographic extent and its incorporation within a great variety of cultural sub-groups. During the third millennium before our era, the inhabitants of Europe adopted a different style of ceramic vase. There would be nothing exceptional in this change of ceramic style during recent prehistoric times, {{were it not for the}} fact that it is to be found across the whole of Europe as well as in North Africa. It is this aspect which makes it such a particular cultural complex, as had previously been that of the Corded Ware. The only common ceramic objects are the beakers with an S profile, decorated with alternating bands of decoration, made by applying the impression with a shell, a comb or a fish bone. Many archaeologists have studied the subject, whilst others are still doing so, undertaking type studies within a region, thematic analyses of a single element or taking a technological approach. The publication of the papers coming out of the meetings of the Archéologie et <b>gobelets</b> Association are usually published in the BAR (British Archaeological reports) international series, since the publishing delays are relatively short and their international distribution facilitates their accessibility to researchers. The 2001 meeting in Sion was in two parts; one made up of scientific meetings organised at the Cantonal Archaeological Museum and the other made up of visits to archaeological sites and museum collections. If we are able to publish the acts in this volume, the visits can only live on in our memories...|$|E

25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional <b>gobelet</b> style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of vine training and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the guyot method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters. This is because the Beaujolais wine-making style of carbonic maceration utilizes whole bunches of grape clusters that normally get broken and separated by a mechanical harvester.|$|R
2500|$|Vine {{training}} {{systems can}} be broadly classified {{by a number of}} different measurements. One of the oldest means was based on the relative height of the trunk with the distance of the canopy from the ground being described as high-trained (also known as [...] "high culture" [...] or vignes hautes) or low-trained (vignes basses). The ancient Romans were adherents of the high-trained vine systems with the tendone system of vines trained high over head along a pergola being one example. In the 1950s, Austrian winemaker Lenz Moser advocated the high-culture style of training, recommending low density plantings of vines with trunks 4ft (1.25 m) high. One of the benefits of a high-trained system is better frost protection versus low-trained systems such as the <b>gobelet</b> training system which tend to hang low to the ground. Some training systems such as the Guyot and cordons can be adapted to both high and low trained styles.|$|R
5000|$|It may {{be related}} both to German kobold and to Medieval Latin cabalus, or *gobalus, itself from Greek κόβαλος (kobalos), [...] "rogue", [...] "knave", [...] "imp", [...] "goblin".

Moreover, these proper names are not from Normandy, where the word gobelin, gobelinus first appears in the old documents. German Kobold contains the Germanic root kov- (Middle German Kobe [...] "refuge, cavity", [...] "hollow in a rock", Dial.

40|$|According to a {{widespread}} view on functional units in word reading, the perceptual structure of printed words is constrained by print-to-speech mappings. Here, {{we examined the}} hypothesis that the organization of consonant and vowel letters (the CV pattern) determines the perceived structure of letter strings. Skilled readers were presented with two kinds of bisyllabic French words. Half of the words included a silent E between two consonants (e. g. <b>gobelet,</b> /gɔblɛ/) thus entailing three orthographic vowel groups, while the other half were control words with two vowel groups (e. g. crémeux, /kʀemø/). Participants had to decide on the number of units or reproduce the physical length of the stimuli. Silent E words were consistently estimated to be longer (more units, longer lines) than control words, despite being matched in number of letters and phonemes. The effect was present both in the written modality (Experiments 1 A– 1 B) and in the spoken modality (Experiments 2 A- 2 B). When prereaders and beginning readers with limited knowledge of the orthographic form of words performed the tasks (Experiments 3 A- 3 B), no bias was found, confirming its orthographic nature in skilled readers. The study provides a clear confirmation of the predictions based on the CV pattern hypothesis according to which the number of vowel letter clusters determines the perceived units of letter strings.

These DRIS norms were generated from data obtained during the course of 11 years (2000 ¿ 10) from 166 vineyards trained on both <b>Gobelet</b> and Vertical Shoot Position (VSP) pruned Guyot and Double Cordon Royat systems. The database obtained includes information from different altitudes, soil types, cultural practices, and climatic conditions within the Rioja appellation. The majority of the vineyards had no irrigation and soil was tilled mechanically. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were analyzed in leaf blade and petiole dry tissues sampled at both flowering and veraison. Vineyards with phytosanitary damages or flowering problems were discarded. Ratios among nutrients were established for the blade and petiole at both flowering and veraison by comparing two subpopulations of high and low quality.
