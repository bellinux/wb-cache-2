40|$|Chemical pulp mills such as Kraft, soda, or sulfite mills are current {{examples}} of biorefineries that can convert lignocellulosic biomass into energy, pulp or cellulose derivatives, and tall oil.   While existing viscose pulps use a hemicellulose extraction to generate soluble sugars for ethanol production, in general there still exists a large potential for other more profitable {{applications of the}} biomass (Fig. 1), i. e. the mill needs to present a widespread product portfolio.   The biofuels under development from fermentation that will be discussed are the diesel fuel oxygenates <b>dibutyl</b> <b>succinate</b> and diethyl succinate {{to be used for}} reduced particulate emissions and fossil fuel replacement for diesel engines and butanol for Otto engines.   It's important to stress that succinic acid, butanol and ethanol, needed for the production of the diesel additives and gasoline replacement will be produced from renewable resources and hence replacing products currently produced from non-renewable fossil sources.   Since wood will be used, there will be no issue of competing with raw material used for food production.   Besides biofuel production, succinic acid and butanol, can be used directly or further refined into numerous different products classified as green chemicals.

40|$|The {{transesterification}} between poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>succinate</b> functionalized polyethylene (POF) was {{studied by}} preparing blends in a discontinuous mixer {{in the presence}} of different Zn and Ti catalysts. In particular the catalytic activities of Zn(OOCCH 3) 2, Ti(OBu) 4, ZnO and TiO(OCCH 3) 2 were compared. The mechanism of reactions occurring in the melt was studied both by a model compounds approach and by characterizing the macromolecular products of the melt processing by means of selective extractions, infrared analysis and the determinations of the molecular weight of PET. The results are discussed in terms of electrophilicity and nucleophilicity of the different catalysts. The catalysts structure also affected the phase distribution. In fact from a morphologic point of view in PET matrix blends the use of zinc derivatives yielded preferentially dispersed-like phase distribution, while the use of titanium derivatives resulted in partially co-continuous phase morphology. The stability of the attained phase distribution was also monitored during compression moulding and it evolved rapidly in fully dispersed phase morphology. The tensile properties of compression moulded films revealed that the occurred reactions and morphological assessment induced a general decrease of tensile modulus and an increase of elongation at break...|$|E
40|$|The finite {{nature of}} fossil fuels and their {{contribution}} to anthropogenic climate change is driving the development of biofuels. However, due to the inherent issues with current biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, innovative replacements are being increasingly sought. Recently four esters produced from fermentation, diethyl succinate, <b>dibutyl</b> <b>succinate,</b> dibutyl fumarate and dibutyl malonate {{were reported to have}} suitable physical properties to conventional diesel fuel. While physical properties are indicative of fuel behaviour, the determination of a fuel’s combustion emissions and performance via controlled engine testing is vital. In this investigation the engine performance and emissions produced from the most viable fuel, diethyl succinate (DES), were examined. The diethyl succinate was blended with diesel in a 20 % blend (DES 20), due to the low cetane number of the diethyl succinate, and the emissions established under pseudo steady state conditions using a 2. 0 L turbocharged direct-injection EURO 3 -compliant light commercial vehicle equipped with a direct-injection common-rail diesel engine. When using DES 20, the fuel demand and wheel force were higher across the majority of engine speeds, while exhaust gas temperatures were lower. The difference between DES 20 and diesel’s exhaust gas temperature increased with increasing pedal demand. In comparison to petroleum-derived diesel carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were reduced on using DES 20, most likely due to more complete combustion due to the increased oxygen content. However, the total hydrocarbons (THC) and mono-nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions were shown to increase on using the DES blend. Both of these factors were presumably due to the lower cetane number of the fuel, though the increase in THC was deemed negligible due to the low amount produced by both fuels...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the global {{requirement}} for transport fuel sustainably, renewable liquid biofuels must be developed. Currently, two biofuels dominate the market; bioethanol for spark ignition and biodiesel for compression ignition engines. However, both fuels exhibit technical issues such as low energy density, poor low temperature performance and poor stability. In addition, bioethanol and biodiesel sourced from first generation feedstocks use arable land in competition with food production, and can only meet {{a fraction of the}} current demand. To address these issues it is vital that biofuels be developed from truly sustainable sources, such as lignocellulosic waste resources, and possess improved physical properties. To improve and control the physical properties of a fuel for specific application, one must be able to tailor the products formed in its production process. All studies within this thesis, therefore, have the aim of assessing the fuels produced for their variability in physical property, or the aim of directing the process considered to specific fuel molecules. In Chapter 2, spent coffee grounds from a range of geographical locations, bean types and brewing processes were assessed as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. While the lipid yield was comparable to that of conventional biodiesel sources, the fatty acid profile remained constant irrespective of the coffee source. Despite this lack of variation, the fuel properties varied widely, presumably due to a range of alternative biomolecules present in the lipid. Though coffee biodiesel was produced from a waste product, the fuel properties were found to be akin to palm oil biodiesel, with a high viscosity and pour point. The blend level would therefore be restricted. In Chapter 3 the coffee lipid, as well as a range of microbial oils potentially derived from renewable sources were transformed into a novel aviation and road transport fuel through cross-metathesis with ethene. Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd generation catalyst was found to be the most suitable, achieving 41 % terminal bond selectivity under optimum conditions. Metathesis yielded three fractions: an alkene hydrocarbon fraction suitable for aviation, a shorter chain triglyceride fraction that upon transesterification produced a short chain biodiesel fuel, and a multifunctional volatile alkene fraction that could potentially have application in the polymer industry. Though there was variation for the road transport fuel fraction due to the presence of long chain saturates, the compounds fell within the US standard for biodiesel. The aviation fraction lowered the viscosity, increased the energy density, and remained soluble with Jet A- 1 down to the required freezing point. Oleaginous organisms generally only produce a maximum of 40 % lipid, leaving a large portion of fermentable biomass. In Chapter 4, a variety of ethyl and butyl esters of organic acids – potentially obtainable from fermentation – were assessed for their suitability as fuels in comparison to bioethanol. One product, butyl butyrate, was deemed suitable as a Jet A- 1 replacement while four products, diethyl succinate, <b>dibutyl</b> <b>succinate,</b> dibutyl fumarate and dibutyl malonate, were considered as potential blending agents for diesel. Diethyl succinate, being the most economically viable of the four, was chosen for an on-engine test using a 20 vol% blend of DES (DES 20) on a chassis dynamometer under pseudo-steady state conditions. DES 20 was found to cause an increase in fuel demand and NOx emissions, and a decrease in exhaust temperature, wheel force, and CO emissions. While fermentation is generally directed to one product, producing unimolecular fuels, they do not convert the entirety of the biomass available. An alternative chemical transformation is pyrolysis. In Chapter 5, zeolite-catalysed fast pyrolysis of a model compound representative of the ketonic portion of biomass pyrolysis vapour – mesityl oxide – was carried out. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the mechanistic changes that occur, which could lead to improved bio-oil yields and more directed fuel properties of the pyrolysis oil. While HZSM- 5 and Cu ZSM- 5 showed no activity for hydrogenation and little activity for oligomerisation, Pd ZSM- 5 led to near-complete selective hydrogenation of mesityl oxide to methyl isobutyl ketone, though this reduced at higher temperatures. At lower temperature (150 - 250 °C), a small amount of useful oligomerisation was observed, which could potentially lead to a selective pyrolysis oligomerisation reaction pathway...|$|E
