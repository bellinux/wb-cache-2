50|$|Of these, {{bacteria}} and <b>fungi</b> <b>play</b> key roles in maintaining a healthy soil. They act as decomposers that break down organic materials to produce detritus and other breakdown products. Soil detritivores, like earthworms, ingest detritus and decompose it.

5000|$|Bacteria and <b>fungi</b> <b>play</b> an {{essential}} role in the weathering of primary elements that results in the release of nutrients for their own nutrition and for the nutrition of other species in the ecological food chain. One element, cobalt, is available for use by animals only after having been processed into complex molecules (e.g., vitamin B12) by bacteria. Minerals are used by animals and microorganisms for the process of mineralizing structures, called [...] "biomineralization", used to construct bones, seashells, eggshells, exoskeletons and mollusc shells.|$|E
50|$|In {{bacteria}} and <b>fungi,</b> exoenzymes <b>play</b> an integral role in allowing the organisms to effectively {{interact with their}} environment.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was done to}} screen the endophytic fungi from the medicinal tree (Azadirachtaindica) for its antioxidant activity. About five fungal isolates were collected and cultured. Among the five isolates only two were taken for the study due to its coloured pigmented morphology.

The dry solid residue was re- dissolved in methanol and the crude extract was evaluated for their antioxidant property. The methanolic extracts were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed for protein, flavanoids, and phenol content.

5000|$|Microorganisms, mainly {{bacteria}} and <b>fungi,</b> <b>play</b> {{a role in}} bone degradation. They are capable of invading bone tissue and causing minerals to leach into the surrounding environment, leading to disturbances in its structure. [...] Small and large mammals often disturb bones by removing them from grave sites or gnawing on them, which contributes to their destruction. [...] Finally, plant roots located above burial sites can be extremely destructive to bone. Fine roots can travel through the tissue and split long bones, while larger roots can produce openings in bones that may be mistaken for fractures.|$|E
50|$|Decomposition {{of plant}} matter occurs in many stages. It begins with {{leaching}} by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or {{fragmentation of the}} plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for microbial colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely {{carried out by the}} soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and <b>fungi</b> <b>play</b> a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous detritivore species.Following this, the plant detritus (consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, microbial products, and lignin) undergoes chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their chemical structure. For instance, lignin is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain fungi, such as the black-rot fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment. Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of saproxylic insects may develop and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor. Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow. Warmth determines the speed of plant decay, with the rate of decay increasing as heat increases, i.e. a plant in a warm environment will decay over a shorter period of time.In most grassland ecosystems, natural damage from fire, insects that feed on decaying matter, termites, grazing mammals, and the physical movement of animals through the grass are the primary agents of breakdown and nutrient cycling, while bacteria and <b>fungi</b> <b>play</b> the main roles in further decomposition.|$|E
25|$|Parasitic fungi {{also occur}} in the forest. While some {{parasitic}} fungi can become problematic such as Armillaria luteobubalina, a fungus that causes forest dieback, parasitic <b>fungi</b> also <b>play</b> an important ecological role in creating habitats for many animals, such as the great number of invertebrates, mammals, birds and reptiles that rely on tree hollows.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the problems presented by lignin to animal production, particularly {{in countries with}} hot climates, where the degree of lignification in plants is extremely variable causing unpredictable reductions in digestibility. The difficulty of chemically defining lignin compounds is reviewed with the conclusion {{that a combination of}} traditional and advanced techniques is required if the biological role of the lignin in the plant is to be explained. Experiments in ruminants have often shown incomplete recovery of compounds traditionally referred to as lignin, leading to the suspicion that a limited digestion of lignin could occur under anaerobic conditions, with <b>fungi</b> <b>playing</b> a predominant role in the process. As is well known, the problem is difficult to study in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. White-rot fungi - Phanerochaete chrysosporium - has become a standard model for in vitro aerobic digestion. The in situ technique appears to be the most suitable for studies under anaerobic conditions, and some results are presented indicating apparent lignin digestibility in forages...|$|R
40|$|Spore {{dispersal}} {{in plants}} and <b>fungi</b> <b>plays</b> {{a critical role}} in the survival of species and is thus under strong selective pressure. As a result, various plant and fungal groups have evolved ingenious mechanisms to disperse their spores effectively [1, 2]. Many of these mechanisms use the same physical principles as man-made devices but often achieve better performance. One such dispersal mechanism is the cavitation-triggered catapult of fern sporangia. The sporangia open when dehydrating and use the stored elastic energy to power a fast closure motion that ultimately ejects the spores. The beauty of this dispersal mechanism and similarity with medieval catapults has not escaped notice [1]. All man-made catapults are equipped with a crossbar to stop the motion of the arm midway. Without it, catapults would launch their projectiles right into the ground. This “crossbar ” is conspicuously missing from the sporangium, suggesting that it should simply speed up to its closed conformation without ejecting th...|$|R
