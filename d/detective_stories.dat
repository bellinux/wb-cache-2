40|$|While {{the first}} two {{chapters}} of the thesis provide the necessary theoretical framework concerning the classical <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> and the metaphysical <b>detective</b> <b>story,</b> in the third chapter this framework is employed to analyze the particular themes that are present in The New York Trilogy and The Crying of Lot 49. To explain the metaphysical <b>detective</b> <b>story,</b> a step back to the classical <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> as its predecessor is required. To sum up the oppositions expressed in criticism dealing with this subject, the contrast between these two genres has been {{defined in terms of}} high art and popular art (Todorov), art and kitsch (Holquist), ontological dominant and epistemological dominant (McHale), postmodern and positivistic mode of thinking (Spanos). The metaphysical <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> takes the conventions of the classical <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> and distorts them in order to betray the reader's expectations. Since the popular genres are constituted by their corresponding sets of conventions which need to be familiar, any change in them causes the work to lose its status as part of the genre. In this case, the classical <b>detective</b> <b>story</b> has served as a point of departure for many authors who transformed it into a completely different genre which had no longer anything to do with popular literature.

The Last Bible series also shifted to a full fantasy setting. Two more recent notable departures were Strange Journey, which shifted the focus to Antarctica to portray the threat on a global scale, and Shin Megami Tensei IV, which included a medieval-stage society existing separately from a modern-day Tokyo. The Devil Summoner games take the form of modern-day <b>detective</b> <b>stories</b> as opposed to post-apocalyptic settings.|$|E

Rendered cynical by this cycle of violence, the detectives of hardboiled fiction are often antiheroes. Notable hardboiled detectives include Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, Sam Spade, Lew Archer, and The Continental Op.|$|E

The plot of each season is further divided into two or three parts, each covering one case. The story usually follows a pattern of a seemingly small case gradually leading to Di Renjie uncovering a sinister plot that threatens the Chinese empire.|$|E
