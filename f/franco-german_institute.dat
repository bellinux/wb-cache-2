40|$|A {{ballistic}} gas simulator {{that permits}} {{the generation of}} relatively clean, two-phase, reacting flows with realistic gas pressures and temperatures has been developed. This device {{is driven by the}} combustion of light gas mixtures such as hydrogen mixed with oxygen and helium. The experiments performed were aimed at the generation of well-defined, well-controlled flows beginning with reacting single-phase gas flows. The main gas parameters to be measured are pressure, temperature, and gas velocity. A novel intrusive temperature gage technique and other spectroscopic techniques were tested in two-phase flows to obtain information on the gas phase temperature. In addition, a Michelson-type laser Doppler velocimeter, devised by Smeets at the <b>Franco-German</b> Research <b>Institute</b> (ISL), was adapted so that gas velocity data could be recorded continuously with a time resolution of about 10 mys...|$|R
500|$|In 1956, the WEU defence {{workgroup}} FINBEL (named after France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg), {{founded in}} 1953 and consisting of {{representatives of the}} various General Staffs, drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the workgroup, turning it into FINABEL (the added [...] "A" [...] standing for Allemagne, [...] "Germany" [...] in French) and on 27 October 1956 at Colomb-Béchar a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank. Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate, the type was called Europa-Panzer to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries {{were involved in the}} design process.

That same year, on 28 November, the French and German ministries of defence in Paris agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately. The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when Charles de Gaulle took power in France, creating the Fifth Republic: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common nuclear weapon and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the USA and United Kingdom. This made Germany lose much interest in a common tank project also.|$|R

50|$|Professor Dr. Robert Picht (born 27 September 1937 in Berlin; died 24 September 2008 in Hinterzarten) was a German academic. As a Vice Rector at the College of Europe at Natolin (Warsaw) and {{a teacher}} at Natolin and Bruges College of Europe's campuses, he focused his {{scholarly}} attention among other things on Europe in a globalising world order. He was rector ad interim of the College of Europe from 2002 to 2003 and vice-rector of the College of Europe at Natolin from 2004 to 2007 (ad interim 2004-2005). He studied sociology and French literature, and was Director of the <b>Franco-German</b> <b>Institute</b> 1972-2002. He was Vice President of the European Cultural Foundation 1976-1995.|$|E
