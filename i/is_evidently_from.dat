6000|$|I {{could not}} but observe with regret the evident {{fragility}} of Lady Byron's health; yet why should I regret it? Why wish to detain here those whose home <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> hence, {{and who will}} only then fully live when the shadow we call life is passed away? ...|$|E
60|$|The text here given {{is that of}} the London reprint of the {{original}} edition, which has been collated with that given by Faulkner (vol. iv., 1735). In 1790 the tract was reprinted by J. Walters, and it <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> this reprint that Scott obtained his text; for the two agree in almost every particular.|$|E
5000|$|Marie's lays {{despite the}} fairy tale {{atmosphere}} all feature ordinary humans, except for Lanval which features an immortal [...] "fairy mistress". Here too, she is not [...] "particularly supernatural" [...] in her described manners and guises. However, she <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> the Otherworld and able to confer everlasting life on her lover. Lanval is rescued from Arthur's judgment by his mistress, which reverses the traditional gender roles of the {{knight in shining armor}} and the damsel in distress—at the conclusion, Lanval leaps onto the back of his mistress's horse and they ride off to Avalon.|$|E

60|$|While {{waiting on}} the dock Dick had noticed three girls {{standing}} near them. They <b>were</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> the rural district, but pretty and well dressed. The boys took seats near {{the bow of the}} boat, on the upper deck, and presently the girls sat down not far away.|$|R

5000|$|Another more {{well known}} pibroch {{published}} by Angus MacKay with the Gaelic title [...] "Cumhadh Craobh nan teud" [...] is translated as [...] "Lament for the Harp Tree." [...] In MacKay's book James Logan notes: [...] "This piobaireachd, so unlike all others, <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> its style, {{of very high}} antiquity. We {{have not been able}} to procure any satisfactory account of Cumhadh Craobh nan teud, which is usually translated, [...] "Lament for the Harp Tree," [...] i.e. the tree of strings. It strikes us that this is a bardic expression for the instrument itself, as we should say [...] "the Bag of Pipes." [...] This pibroch appears in the Campbell Canntaireachd MS. as [...] "MacLeod's Lament." ...|$|E
50|$|The eight compass winds <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> the Italian-tinged {{lingua franca}} in the Mediterranean Sea during the High and Late Middle Ages Of the eight winds, only two {{can be traced}} to prior Classical winds - Ostra (S) from the Latin Auster, and Libeccio (SW) from the Greek Lips - but the others seem to be largely {{conceived}} autonomously.|$|R

40|$|Note translation: This {{selection}} of photographs {{was intended for}} a "Missionskoffer", a box of materials (photographs, objects) which could be taken around in Europe when visiting schools and congregations. The photographs <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> the inter-war period, show {{a wide range of}} situations (from forest areas to remote savannah areas) and seem to the be linked to the missionaries Wildi and Wunderli. (PJ 08. 2002) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Acton will excuse {{us for a}} few minutes," [...] the Stranger remarked. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> fresh <b>from</b> the Bush. How are {{you getting}} on there?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Morlacchi" [...] remains attested as an Italian family name, {{up to the}} present. People {{with the}} surname <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> descended <b>from</b> Morlachs who became assimilated in the Italian society.|$|R
60|$|The {{young girl}} {{continued}} {{to converse with}} him in friendly frankness, showing neither ardour nor shyness. As for love--it <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> further <b>from</b> her mind than even death and dissolution.|$|R
5000|$|While out for {{an early}} morning run, Ben discovers Tom's body; he <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> taken <b>from</b> his bed {{into the woods and}} killed by six blows to the head from a flashlight.|$|R
5000|$|The word Muscoda (pronounced [...] "MUS-co-day") {{may be a}} {{corruption}} of the Ojibwa (Chippewa) word mashkode, meaning [...] "prairie". The name <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> taken <b>from</b> Longfellow's Hiawatha, {{in which it is}} mentioned several times: ...|$|R
6000|$|... {163} The {{photograph}} {{referred to}} <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> taken <b>from</b> a sketch by hand, {{and is not}} therefore a photograph from life.--EDITOR. The original photograph was hereon sent to the editor and acknowledged by him.--A. L.|$|R

60|$|They {{came back}} to Magomero grievously exhausted; Scudamore fell down on a bed only just alive, and even the Bishop, though he tried to act and speak with vigour, <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> {{suffering}} <b>from</b> illness and over-fatigue.|$|R
60|$|They <b>were</b> <b>evidently</b> no {{different}} <b>from</b> the black men--no more civilized than the apes--no less cruel than Sabor.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} sought shelter here," [...] said the king, {{pointing}} to the cavern and looking round with an assumption of boldness which he <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> far <b>from</b> feeling. [...] "Who among my warriors will follow me?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{no longer}} {{kept up the}} {{appearance}} of unconsciousness, and, in the morning, put various questions, {{to the man who}} spoke Swedish, as to what had happened and how he came to be there. This man <b>was</b> <b>evidently,</b> <b>from</b> his dress and appearance, a Jew, while the other was as unmistakably a peasant, a rough powerfully-built man with an evil face. The Jew gave him but little information, but told him that in a day or two, when he was strong enough to listen, a friend would come who would tell him all about it.|$|R
5000|$|The badge was circular, {{and showed}} a {{springbok}} {{standing on a}} grassy base. It <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> derived <b>from</b> the colony's new Public Seal, which depicted the British royal arms and a landscape scene showing three springboks standing in the veld.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{call you}} the hamlet on the left--that with the square ivy-clad church tower?' asked Monmouth, {{turning to the}} Mayor of Bridgewater, a small, anxious-faced man, who <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> far <b>from</b> easy at the {{prominence}} which his office had brought upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The man," [...] she said, [...] "is {{a bit of}} a Puritan. They {{still live}} over there, don't they? His idea of English women <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> derived <b>from</b> what his father told him, or from early-Victorian literature. I'm {{inclined}} to believe I shocked him." ...|$|R
6000|$|As for {{his recent}} failure, {{we do not}} know the facts about it. It <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> far <b>from</b> being a wild and desperate attempt. His enemy, Mr. Vallandigham, is {{compelled}} to say, that [...] "it was among the best planned executed conspiracies that ever failed." ...|$|R
60|$|One {{morning the}} Rev. George Lind {{received}} a letter addressed in a handwriting {{which he did not}} remember and never thenceforth forgot. Within the envelope he found a dainty little bag made of blue satin, secured by ribbons of the same material. This contained a note written on scented paper, edged with gold, and decorated with a miniature representation of a pierrot, sitting cross-legged, conning a book, on the open pages of which appeared the letters L.V. The clergyman recognized the monogram no more than the writing. But as it <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> a lady, he felt a pleasant thrill of expectation as he unfolded the paper.|$|R
50|$|After the Chimurenga war of {{independence}} in Zimbabwe, it became possible to again play traditional music. The band's format and instruments are clearly influenced by western {{rock and roll}} but the sound <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> originating <b>from</b> Africa. The lead guitar is played {{in such a way}} as to sound like mbira.|$|R
5000|$|The {{district}} of Mardistan, in historic Armenia, corresponds to Artaz, {{west of the}} modern Maku, Iranian Azerbaijan. The {{district of}} Mardali (Mardaghi) must have been located {{to the south of}} Erzurum, north of the Bingöl sources. The Mards of this section of the country <b>were</b> <b>evidently</b> immigrants <b>from</b> the South, says Adontz.|$|R

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> {{a signal}} <b>from</b> another party of pursuers, for these men {{answered}} it by a similar cry, {{and it was}} repeated several times by those in the distance.|$|R
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> <b>from</b> the country, for, {{though it}} was in the day of quaintness, she wore her hair plain. It was also the middle period of the curious and inexplicable little swagger which all duly-informed girls assumed, but Rose walked on her strong elastic feet with a {{powerful}} swing which was worth going miles to see. It was due to her unconscious imitation of the proud carriage of William De Lisle. She loved that forward swing of the thigh, with the flex of the side which accompanied it. It was her ideal of motion, that free action of knee, waist and neck, which she felt rather than saw in the great athlete.|$|R
50|$|The Shaheen {{series of}} {{missiles}} <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> based imported <b>from</b> China by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's National Development Complex.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{account of}} St Kenelm's legend {{lies in a}} manuscript copy from the 12th century at Winchcombe Abbey, which claims {{to be derived from}} an account given by a Worcester monk named Wilfin. Other accounts in chronicles <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> derived <b>from</b> the same source. The story told by that manuscript is as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a tearing, hissing noise and a smell of gas. Little looked up and turned pale. The balloon, at what I shall call the pointed end of the Bologna sausage, <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> {{bursting}} <b>from</b> increased pressure. The gas was escaping, and already they were beginning to descend. Little was resigned but firm.|$|R
50|$|As a nomen, Pacuvius <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> derived <b>from</b> {{a common}} Oscan praenomen, also {{rendered}} Pacuvius. The first certain {{instance of the}} name as a gentilicium occurs with the tragedian Marcus Pacuvius, a native of Brundisium in Calabria, who was born circa 220 BC, and was active at Rome for many years before his death, circa 130.|$|R
