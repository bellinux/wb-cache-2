5|$|Flocks {{of birds}} appear {{to engage in}} play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to <b>dislodge</b> it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.|$|E
40|$|Waves {{breaking}} on rocky shorelines impart large {{forces on}} intertidal organisms, sometimes <b>dislodging</b> individuals. <b>Dislodged</b> individuals may be deposited in habitats {{that have a}} greater risk of predation or that prevent return to preferred regions on the shore. Thus, dislodgement is often assumed to be lethal. We experimentally <b>dislodged</b> Littorina keenae snails from high in the intertidal zone to test the likelihood of survival. Under a variety of wave conditions, we measured return rates to the high shore of 54 – 90 %, so in this species, dislodgement is not equal to death. Snails showed a strong preference for returning to the approximate tidal height from which they were <b>dislodged,</b> but we found no evidence of widespread homing behaviour back to the original site of dislodgement...|$|R

He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to <b>dislodge</b> a clot, after which Lincoln's {{breathing}} improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal.|$|E

5|$|From 5000 to 2000 BC, Bandkeramik {{cultures}} predominated. In addition, remains {{from the}} Dnieper-Donets culture {{were found in}} Belarus and parts of Ukraine. Cimmerians and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the Scythians who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the Huns and Avars, swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to <b>dislodge</b> the Slavic presence.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to report our {{experience}} of percutaneous retrieval of dislodged port catheters with concurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters. During a 5 -year period at our institute (June 2005 to July 2010), a total of 23 <b>dislodged</b> port catheters were retrieved. The interval between port catheter implantation and <b>dislodged</b> catheter retrieval ranged from 43 days to 1, 414 days (mean 586. 7 days). The time of delayed retrieval ranged from 1 day to 45 days (mean 4. 6 days). All <b>dislodged</b> catheters were retrieved with the concurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters via femoral venous route. The prevalence of port catheter dislodgement at our institute was 3. 4 %. All <b>dislodged</b> port catheters were removed successfully with pigtail and loop snare catheters together. No procedure-related complications were encountered, except for transient arrhythmia in two patients, which required no medication. In conclusion, the concurrent use of pigtail and loop snare catheters is a feasible and easy way for percutaneous retrieval of a <b>dislodged</b> central venous port catheter...|$|R

5|$|In January 1863, the {{regiment}} received orders to fortify their camp outside of New Bern. The improved camp was named Fort Peirson {{in honor of}} their commanding officer. During the spring of 1863, the unit took part in several expeditions to reconnoiter and <b>dislodge</b> enemy positions along the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers. These expeditions involved only minor skirmishing.|$|E

When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to <b>dislodge</b> the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it.|$|E

After ten days of Operation Nifty Package, Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990. He was detained as a prisoner of war, and later taken to the United States.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{dysfunction}} of misplaced or <b>dislodged</b> endovascular endoprostheses, may be {{a serious}} complication, and endovascular removal {{may be a}}ttempted in some cases. Case Report: A Viatorr ® stent-graft (Gore, Flagstaff, AR, USA) is an endoprosthesis designed and commonly used for creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Two Viatorrs were accidentally <b>dislodged</b> during TIPS procedure. In another patient, the Viatorr was malpositioned, with its distal end being placed in the bile duct. All endoprostheses were successfully removed without serious complications. Conclusions: Removal of a misplaced or <b>dislodged</b> Viatorr endoprosthesis is possible using interventional methods...|$|R

5|$|The {{failure of}} the siege marked the {{beginning}} of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to <b>dislodge</b> Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.|$|E
5|$|When {{faced with}} opponents who used {{unfamiliar}} fighting techniques, {{such as in}} Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and <b>dislodge</b> the elephants' handlers.|$|E
5|$|After a {{hard but}} {{inconclusive}} fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to <b>dislodge</b> the French lines, and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were {{not strong enough to}} <b>dislodge</b> the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to <b>dislodge</b> fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or <b>dislodge</b> them.|$|E

Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied {{a position on the}} right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River.
