40|$|An {{extensive}} {{search for}} maize (Zea mays) genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and assembly has been performed and 735 sequences have been centralized in a database, MAIZEWALL ([URL] MAIZEWALL contains a bioinformatic analysis for each entry and gene expression {{data that are}} accessible via a user-friendly interface. A maize cell wall macroarray composed of a gene-specific tag for each entry was also constructed to monitor global cell wall-related gene expression in different organs and during <b>internode</b> <b>development.</b> By using this macroarray, we identified sets of genes that exhibit organ and internode-stage preferential expression profiles. These data provide a comprehensive fingerprint of cell wall-related gene expression throughout the maize plant. Moreover, an in-depth examination of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis coupled to biochemical and cytological data from different organs and stages of <b>internode</b> <b>development</b> has also been undertaken. These results allow us to trace spatially and developmentally regulated, putative preferential routes of monolignol biosynthesis involving specific gene family members and suggest that, although all of the gene families of the currently accepted monolignol biosynthetic pathway are conserved in maize, there are subtle differences in family size and {{a high degree of}} complexity in spatial expression patterns. These differences are in keeping with the diversity of lignified cell types throughout the maize plant...|$|E

Nitrogen per unit leaf area was high near the apex and decreased to a constant value at the sixth node below it. Soluble protein banding was qualitatively similar for leaves and internodes in this zone, but anodal peroxidases differed between leaves and internodes. The major leaf peroxidase band was {{absent from the}} second leaf below the apex but present in the fourth and sixth leaves; its appearance and intensification seemed to parallel the development of photosynthetic activity. The major internode peroxidase band was present in the apex, second, fourth, and sixth internodes, and intensified during internodal development.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of spring barley to common root rot {{and its effect}} on yield components and disease severity was studied under varied moisture regimes. Infection of barley from natural soil inoculum, primarily of Cochliobolus sativus. was augmented with inoculum of C. sativus or Fusarium culmorum to insure uniform disease pressure during plant development. To study the effect of varied soil moisture, three locations were utilized that differed in annual precipitation in 1986, and a line-source sprinkler irrigation system was utilized to establish a soil moisture gradient from a high moisture regime that received both irrigation water and rainfall to a dryland regime that received only rainfall in 1986 and 1987. Plant emergence and harvestable tillers were reduced by inoculation with C. sativus as compared to non-inoculated controls. Grain yield loss was associated with C. sativus when the dryland regime received no rainfall during seedling development and in the low rainfall, drought location. No grain yield losses occurred in the irrigated moisture regimes or the moderate and high rainfall locations with inoculation by either pathogen. In the irrigated moisture regimes, the moderate rainfall location, and the high rainfall location, the inoculated plants compensated for reduced plant emergence and harvestable tillers by producing heavier kernels. Disease severity, based on the subcrown <b>internode</b> lesion <b>development</b> during soft dough growth stage, did not differ in the dryland and irrigated moistur...|$|R
40|$|The {{nitrogen}} use efficiency (NUE) of high {{biomass energy}} sorghum hybrid plants increased during 180 days of growth {{to a maximum}} of 370 g DWgN. Shoot N uptake was biphasic and continued for 120 days. Leaf N accumulation was rapid until day 60. Specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) varied from 0. 9 to 1. 7 gNm green leaf area, a typical range for C 4 grass canopies. Stem N increased to a maximum at day 120. NUE increased during development in parallel with increasing stem to leaf biomass ratio and as stems decreased from 0. 7 % to 0. 2 % N. At the end of the season, green leaves were ~ 1 % N, represented 17 % of total shoot biomass and accounted for 50 % of N present in shoots (above ground biomass) while stems were ~ 0. 2 % N, comprised 83 % of shoot biomass and accounted for 50 % of shoot N. High NUE was due in part to N-remobilization from lower leaves and stem nodes/internodes to upper portions of the canopy. Up to 70 % of dry weight and 90 % of N was remobilized during senescence of lower leaves and 70 % of N was remobilized from lower stem nodes/internodes. The NUE of energy sorghum was similar to Saccharum officinarum and Miscanthus x giganteus, and higher than grain Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, and Panicum virgatum. High NUE of energy S. bicolor is due to long duration of vegetative growth, high stem to leaf biomass ratio, and very efficient N-remobilization from lower leaves and stem <b>internodes</b> during <b>development...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis) is a {{high-quality}} cool-season forage crop used as pasture and hay for livestock feeds. The presence of lignin in cell walls, however, impairs forage digestibility of such lignocellulosic feedstock. Here, the structural characterization and cell wall composition of sheepgrass internodes were studied, and a progressive increase in cell wall lignification was observed with internode maturation. Lignin composition analysis further revealed a gradual accumulation of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units during <b>internode</b> <b>development.</b> Consistently, the transcript abundance of lignin-related genes was upregulated in mature internodes, suggesting their potential roles in lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, {{the effects of}} cell wall composition and lignification extent on biomass saccharification efficiency were examined in sheepgrass. The results showed that lignin content, guaiacyl and syringyl lignin unit levels inversely correlated with cell wall digestibility, indicating that lignin is a crucial obstacle for utilizing sheepgrass feedstock.

40|$|Axillary meristems, {{which give}} rise to {{branches}} and flowers, {{play a critical role}} in plant architecture and reproduction. To understand how axillary meristems initiate, we have screened for mutants with defects in axillary meristem initiation to uncover the genes controlling this process. These mutants, called the barren class of mutants in maize (Zea mays), have defects in axillary meristem initiation during both vegetative and reproductive development. Here, we identify and characterize a new member of the barren class of mutants named Developmental disaster 1 (Dvd 1), due to the pleiotropic effects of the mutation. Similar to the barren mutants, Dvd 1 mutants have fewer branches, spikelets, florets, and floral organs in the inflorescence due to defects in the initiation of axillary meristems. Furthermore, double mutant analysis with teosinte branched 1 shows that dvd 1 also functions in axillary meristems during vegetative development. However, unlike the barren mutants, Dvd 1 mutants are semidwarf due to the production of shorter internodes, and they produce leaves in the inflorescence due to the outgrowth of bract leaf primordia. The suite of defects seen in Dvd 1 mutants, together with the genetic interaction of Dvd 1 with barren inflorescence 2, suggests that dvd 1 is a novel regulator of axillary meristem and <b>internode</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E

Statistical analysis of the metabolite profiles resulted in clustering of tissue types. Particular metabolites were correlated with the level of sucrose accumulation, which as expected increased down the stem. Metabolites, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and amino acids, were more abundant in the M 2 sample (meristem to internode 2) that was actively growing and decreased in an apparently coordinated developmentally programmed manner in more mature internodes down the stem. However, other metabolites such as trehalose and raffinose showed positive correlations with sucrose concentration.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 26 - 28) Seedlings of five {{species of}} plants were grown in darkness or light for two weeks. Shoots were measured in length and exhaustively extracted. The total phenolic content was determined colorimetrically after addition of Folin-Denis reagent. In all species, the lengths of the dark grown seedlings were longer than the corresponding light grown plants. It {{was found that the}} endogenous levels of phenolics were substantially higher in the light grown seedlings. The gallotannin content was also found to be higher in light grown seedlings. Dwarf pea seedlings were grown in continuous darkness and watered with water alone or solutions of tannic acid (0. 5 g/l and 5. 0 g/l). At the lower concentration, there was a stimulatory-effect on growth relative to the water control. At higher concentration, although there was an increase in total length, there was substantial reduction in the length of the first two <b>internodes</b> and <b>development</b> of a fourth internode not present in either the water control or the lower concentration of tannic acid. Lettuce hypocotyl sections were incubated in light or darkness in water or solutions of GA 3, tannic acid, dialyzed extracts from light or dark grown peas, or mixtures of GA 3 and tannic acid or pea extracts. Tannic acid and pea extracts inhibited growth of hypocotyl sections regardless of lighting conditions. The degree of inhibition was greater in dark incubated sections and extracts from light grown peas were more inhibitory than extracts from dark grown peas. These data suggest that phenolics may be involved and play a regulatory role in the light-mediated inhibition of growth...|$|R
40|$|In Arabidopsisfloral meristems are {{specified}} on {{the periphery}} of the inflorescence meristem by the combined activities of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) –FD complex and the flower meristem identity gene LEAFY. The floral specification activity of FT is dependent upon two related BELL 1 -like homeobox (BLH) genes PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF) which are required for floral evocation. PNY and PNF interact with a subset of KNOTTED 1 -LIKE homeobox proteins including SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM). Genetic analyses show that these BLH proteins function with STM to specify flowers and <b>internodes</b> during inflorescence <b>development.</b> In this study, experimental evidence demonstrates that the specification of flower and coflorescence meristems requires the combined activities of FT–FD and STM. FT and FD also regulate meristem maintenance during inflorescence development. In plants with reduced STM function, ectopic FT and FD promote the formation of axillary meristems during inflorescence development.

40|$|A {{detailed}} description of grass seedling root morphology is essential to understand {{the differences in the}} establishment process among grasses. A repeated greenhouse study using a 1 : 1 mixture of Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls) and coarse sand was conducted to determine root morphology differences at the third-leaf stage among nine cool-season forage grasses, creeping foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceous Poir., reed canarygrass, (Phalaris arundinacea L.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), russian wildrye (Elymus junceus Fish.), crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. ], intermediate wheatgrass [A. intermedian (Host) Beauv. ], and western wheatgrass (A. smithii Rydb.); and nine warm-season forage grasses, sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr. ], blue grama [B. gracilis (H. B. K.) Lag. ex. Steud. ], sand lovegrass [Eragrostis trichodes (Nutt.) Wood], big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var gerardii) Vitman, sand bluestem [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash], caucasian bluestem [Bothriochloa caucasica (Trin.) C. E. Hubb. ], indiangrass [Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash], and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). These grasses were selected as representative forage grasses of the northern USA. Andropogoneae species reached third leaf emergence 3 to 5 days earlier than other warm-season grasses and 3 to 15 days earlier than cool-season grasses. Most cool-season grasses had no or little subcoleoptile internode elongation except Aveneae species. Aveneae species and warm-season grasses, except Chlorideae species, had root development from the subcoleoptile internode. Sand bluestem had less subcoleoptile <b>internode</b> root <b>development</b> than big bluestem. Seminal root development was greater in species of the Triticeae tribe. Adventitous root development occurred by the three-leaf stage on species of all tribes except for Andropogoneae members. Most grasses were in a juvenile period of root growth at third leaf emergence.

40|$|Analyses of {{transgenic}} sugarcane clones with 45 – 95 % reduced cytosolic pyrophosphate: d-fructose- 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase (PFP, EC 2. 7. 1. 90) activity displayed no visual phenotypical change, {{but significant}} changes were evident in in vivo metabolite levels and fluxes during <b>internode</b> <b>development.</b> In three independent transgenic lines, sucrose concentrations increased between three- and sixfold in immature internodes, {{compared to the}} levels in the wildtype control. There was an eightfold increase in the hexose-phosphate:triose-phosphate ratio in immature internodes, a significant restriction in the triose phosphate to hexose phosphate cycle and significant increase in sucrose cycling as monitored by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance. This suggests that {{an increase in the}} hexose-phosphate concentrations resulting from a restriction in the conversion of hexose phosphates to triose phosphates drive sucrose synthesis in the young internodes. These effects became less pronounced as the tissue matured. Decreased expression of PFP also resulted in an increase of the ATP/ADP and UTP/UDP ratios, and an increase of the total uridine nucleotide and, at a later stage, the total adenine nucleotide pool, revealing strong interactions between PPi metabolism and general energy metabolism. Finally, decreased PFP leads to a reduction of PPi levels in older internodes indicating that in these developmental stages PFP acts in the gluconeogenic direction. The lowered PPi levels might also contribute to the absence of increases in sucrose contents in the more mature tissues of transgenic sugarcane with reduced PFP activity...|$|E
40|$|Internodes {{of grass}} stems {{function}} in mechanical support, transport, and, in some species, {{are a major}} sink organ for carbon {{in the form of}} cell wall polymers. This study reports cell wall composition, proteomic, and metabolite analyses of the rice elongating internode. Cellulose, lignin, and xylose increase as a percentage of cell wall material along eight segments of the second rice internode (internode II) at booting stage, from the younger to the older internode segments, indicating active cell wall synthesis. Liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of trypsin-digested proteins from this internode at booting reveals 2, 547 proteins with at least two unique peptides in two biological replicates. The dataset includes many glycosyltransferases, acyltransferases, glycosyl hydrolases, cell wall-localized proteins, and protein kinases that have or may have functions in cell wall biosynthesis or remodeling. Phospho-enrichment of internode II peptides identified 21 unique phosphopeptides belonging to 20 phosphoproteins including a leucine rich repeat-III family receptor like kinase. GO over-representation and KEGG pathway analyses highlight the abundances of proteins involved in biosynthetic processes, especially the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. LC-MS/MS of hot methanol-extracted secondary metabolites from internode II at four stages (booting/elongation, early mature, mature, and post mature) indicates that internode secondary metabolites are distinct from those of roots and leaves, and differ across stem maturation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{morphology}} and rumen fermentation kinetics of the maize cultivars (Zea mays L.) Vitaro and Volens {{were investigated}} in detail throughout their growing period {{as a first}} step towards understanding the relation between plant characteristics and cell wall fermentability of forage maize. Vitaro is known to have a 9 % higher whole plant organic matter digestibility than Volens. Leaf and <b>internode</b> <b>development,</b> fresh (FW) and dry weight (DW) per plant and dry matter content (DMC) of leaves, internodes and developing ears, as well as rumen fermentation characteristics of the stem, were monitored during two seasons. Vitaro plants had a larger final leaf area than Volens plants but their number of leaves (and internodes) was the same. Fully developed Vitaro internodes were shorter and thicker than Volens internodes, resulting in a shorter plant for Vitaro. After anthesis, FW and DW of individual internodes did not vary significantly throughout the growing period. Whole plant FW increased sharply after anthesis, which was associated with the development of the main ear. In both cultivars, DMC of the whole plant more or less doubled between anthesis and harvesting. Vitaro had a higher DW per plant than Volens, but not a larger ear proportion. In rumen fermentation tests on whole stem samples, using the gas production technique, gas production after 72 hours and Tilley & Terry digestibility were significantly higher for Vitaro than for Volens, indicating a higher total degradability for Vitaro. It was concluded that the two cultivars form a suitable model system for studying the causes of differences in rumen fermentation between maize roughages...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the interaction of red light (R) with blue light (B), applied to shoots of M 9 apple (Malus pumila paradisiaca Schmid) rootstock, on the regulation of stem growth, apical dominance and branching. These results are compared with the active form of phytochromes (PHYs) under monochromatic and dichromatic light treatments. The inhibition of internode elongation was determined by PHY photoequilibrium, with the additional effect of B, by means of a separate photoreceptor. The development of phytomers appeared to be primarily due to the active form of PHY, with a marginal effect from B. Shoot growth, which combines <b>internode</b> elongation and <b>development</b> of the phytomer, was highest under R and lowest under B and far red light (FR), showing the largely positive role of PHY photoequilibrium. Under FR, reduced stem elongation was due to the very small number of phytomers formed. Apical dominance was inhibited, while branching was increased under R, corresponding to the highest values of PHY photoequilibrium determined. Apical dominance was increased and branching was reduced by B, indicating a complex interaction between PHY and B receptor. In the shoot cluster system, photomorphogenic behavior was dependent on the time of exposure to the different light qualities. The information gained from the study will be helpful in improving the set up of in vitro growth light conditions, and in providing useful insights into research of the development of the woody plant canopy, an important factor in ecological plant communities. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|Sugarcane is a monocot {{plant that}} accumulates sucrose to levels {{of up to}} 50 % of dry weight in the stalk. The {{mechanisms}} {{that are involved in}} sucrose accumulation in sugarcane are not well understood, and little is known with regard to factors that control the extent of sucrose storage in the stalks. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase; EC 2. 7. 7. 9) is an enzyme that produces UDP-glucose, a key precursor for sucrose metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis. The objective of this work was to gain insights into the ScUGPase- 1 expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms that control protein activity. ScUGPase- 1 expression was negatively correlated with the sucrose content in the <b>internodes</b> during <b>development,</b> and only slight differences in the expression patterns were observed between two cultivars that differ in sucrose content. The intracellular localization of ScUGPase- 1 indicated partial membrane association of this soluble protein in both the leaves and internodes. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we observed that ScUGPase- 1 was phosphorylated in vivo at the Ser- 419 site in the soluble and membrane fractions from the leaves but not from the internodes. The purified recombinant enzyme was kinetically characterized in the direction of UDP-glucose formation, and the enzyme activity was affected by redox modification. Preincubation with H 2 O 2 strongly inhibited this activity, which could be reversed by DTT. Small angle x-ray scattering analysis indicated that the dimer interface is located at the C terminus and provided the first structural model of the dimer of sugarcane UGPase in solution.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{there has}} been {{interest}} in establishing a monocot C 4 model species with a small genome, short lifecycle, and capacity for genetic transformation. Setaria viridis has been adopted to fill this role, since reports of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in 2010, and sequencing of its genome in 2012. To date, S. viridis has primarily been used to further our understanding of C 4 photosynthesis, but is also an ideal system {{for the study of}} biomass crops, which are almost exclusively C 4 panicoid grasses. Biogenesis of stem tissue, its cell wall composition, and soluble sugar content are important determinants of bioenergy crop yields. Here we show that a developing S. viridis internode is a valuable experimental system for gene discovery in relation to these important bioenergy feedstock traits. Results: The rate of maximal stem biomass accumulation in S. viridis A 10 under long day growth was at the half-head emergence developmental stage. At this stage of <b>development,</b> <b>internode</b> 5 (of 7) was found to be rapidly expanding with an active meristem, a zone of cell expansion (primary cell walls), a transitional zone where cell expansion ceased and secondary cell wall deposition was initiated, and a mature zone that was actively accumulating soluble sugars. A simple method for identifying these zones was established allowing rapid dissection and snap-freezing for RNAseq analysis. A transcriptome profile was generated for each zone showing a transition from cell division and nucleic acid synthesis/processing in the meristem, to metabolism, energy synthesis, and primary cell wall synthesis in the cell expansion zone, to secondary cell wall synthesis in the transitional zone, to sugar transport, and photosynthesis in the mature zone. Conclusion: The identification of these zones has provided a valuable experimental system for investigating key bioenergy traits, including meristematic activity, cell wall biosynthesis, and soluble sugar accumulation, in a C 4 panicoid grass that has genetic resources, a short life cycle, and small stature allowing controlled experimental conditions in growth cabinets. Here we have presented a comprehensive map of gene expression and metabolites in this experimental system to facilitate gene discovery and controlled hypothesis testing for bioenergy research in S. viridis...|$|R

Farw. ] turf under short mowing management is {{of a primary}} concern for golf superintendents in the Atlantic region of Canada. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) characterize relative timing of occurrence of key events in development, and (ii) leaf and <b>internode</b> growth and <b>development</b> of two divergent flowering biotypes of annual bluegrass and two divergent tillering types of creeping bentgrass. Two AB germplasms, early (PAE 11) and late (PAL 11), and two CB germplasms, UM 67 - 10 (high tillering) and ‘Emerald’ (low tillering), were examined. Leaf appearance, first tiller appearance, leaf stage (Haun scale), internode elongation, inflorescence appearance, and internode number were monitored throughout the study. Haun scale provided a good baseline for determination of developmental stage, whereas West scale better defined comparative timing for tiller initiation, internode elongation, heading, and flowering. PAE 11 produced an inflorescence following the seventh or eighth leaf on the main stem [≈ 25 d after transplanting (DAT) ], with anthesis by 35 DAT. Tiller initiation was earlier for PAL 11 and UM 67 - 10 compared with Emerald. Internode elongation was at least 4 d earlier for CB than for AB. Emerald and UM 67 - 10 usually elongated above the third node on the main stem compared with the sixth node for PAL 11. At 35 DAT, UM 67 - 10 had reached the greatest leaf stage. PAE 11 was highest on the West scale. West scale limitations resulted from lack of reproductive initiation by CB and PAL 11. PAL 11 had significantly higher root and shoot dry weights, root:shoot ratio, and more adventitious root growth than CB. Earlier internode elongation in CB may have diverted carbohydrates from root and leaf production. Internode lengths were greatest for Emerald, then UM 67 - 10, followed by PAL 11. Blade length was least for UM 67 - 10. Sheath length increased with successive leaves. PAL 11 had a quicker leaf appearance rate at earlier growth stages than CB.
