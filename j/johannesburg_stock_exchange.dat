2500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Nene caused a public outcry and a strongly negative reaction by international markets causing the South African Rand to lose 10% {{of its value}} and the withdrawal of an estimated R180 billion from the <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> in the two days following the announcement. In addition {{to the public and}} opposition political parties the business community, COSATU and other trade unions, the Communist Party of South Africa, as well as many within the ruling ANC called for Zuma to reverse the decision. Four days after the announcement on 13 December a senior ANC delegation met with Zuma and told him to reinstate Nene or appoint former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan. A few hours later Zuma announced that van Rooyen would be replaced by the better known and trusted Pravin Gordhan. This event is thought to have increased the rift between Zuma {{and the rest of the}} ANC including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, something that Ramaphosa denies. Ranjeni Munusamy of The Daily Maverick stated that this has exposed President Zuma as a [...] "weak leader who acted recklessly without proper advice" [...] indicating that the firing of Nene has greatly damaged Zuma's political standing.|$|E

40|$|Background and Problem: Recently {{the focus}} of {{information}} has been discussions’ regarding what information to provide {{in order to satisfy}} the stakeholders as well as investors. During the last decades, the primary interest of corporate information has initially been the shareholders, but this is now shifting. The stakeholders demand more than just the information in the financial statement, and until now the non-financial information has been included in a standalone sustainability report. The new reporting system, which represents all information combined into one single report, is called Integrated Reporting. This mandatory reporting requirement is enforced by the South African government, for all companies listed on <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange’s</b> Main Board. Therefore, this thesis will focus upon whether integrated reporting has given any value-relevance for a company under the mandatory requirement, contrary to the voluntary requirements. Additionally, it will be observed if integrated reporting contributes to a company’s market value. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine and investigate the value-relevance of integrated reporting for the market values of companies listed on <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange’s</b> Main Board, in South Africa. Delimitations: This thesis limits itself to investigate companies listed on the <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange’s</b> Main Board. Further on, this thesis is limited to investigate disclosure of environmental and social factors of integrated reporting interconnected with the manufacturing and producing sectors, excluding all sectors of financial and service related characteristics. Method: This thesis is solely a quantitative study. The data for 2009 and 2011 is gathered from the companies’ integrated annual reports. The self-constructed disclosure index of environmental and social factors is classified by “GRI G 3 and G 3. 1 Update-Comparison sheet”, in order to define integrated reporting. This was followed by using a valuation model {{in order to determine the}} relationship between integrated reporting and a company’s value-relevance. Empirical Results and Conclusion: The empirical results show that the disclosure of level of compliance has increased from 2009 to 2011. The level of compliance differs between the sectors and characterizes to what extent integrated reporting is incorporated. The analysis of this thesis shows that the differences in voluntary and mandatory requirements reflect the level of compliance. The concluding remark of this thesis is that environmental and social aspects of integrated reporting are value relevant for a company’s market value under the requirement of King III...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine the dynamic causal {{relations}} between the two major financial assets, stock prices of the US and South Africa and the rand/US$ exchange rate. The study uses a mixed bag of time series approaches such as cointegration, Granger causality, impulse response functions and forecasting error variance decompositions.   The paper identifies a bi-directional causality from the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock price index to the rand/US$ exchange rate in the Granger sense. It was also found that the Standard & Poor’s stock price index accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} variations in the <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange’s</b> All Share index.

Impliedly, improvements in ‘energy efficient technologies’ to reduce fossil energy consumption (prevention activities) seem to exhibit value destroying tendencies, while improvements in ‘end-of-pipe’ activities seem to estimate a drive market value of equity deflated by sales and equity returns.

We assess the goodness of fit statistics using the log-likelihood, the Akaike information criterion, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Finally, we inspect the temporal stability of parameters and note implications as criteria for distinguishing between models. To better understand the dependence structure of the stocks, we fit the MGHD and subclasses to both the stock returns and the two leading principal components derived from the price data. While the MGHD could fit both data subsets, we observed that the multivariate normality of the stock return residuals, computed by removing shared components, suggests that the departure from normality {{can be explained by the}} structure in the common factors...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSWhile {{companies}} have been practising philanthropy for decades, the field of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{is a relatively new}} and fast evolving field in business. Companies invest ever increasing sums of money and resources in CSR; consequently, {{there is a need for}} companies to think strategically about their CSR approach to ensure its effective integration with overall business strategy. This research study documents how South African companies integrate CSR with their overall business strategy. By following a process of in-depth semi structured interviews, the views of senior executives and managers involved with CSR at companies listed on the <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange’s</b> Social Responsible Investment Index were obtained. The main findings that emerged reveal that South African companies believe CSR should form part of company strategy. How companies set about making this a reality depends on their unique organisational structure. Importantly, it was found that an understanding of the external as well as internal forces impacting upon CSR, buy-in from leadership and all stakeholders and effective organisational processes and systems were critical for effective implementation. While some companies report having made progress, there is an acknowledgement that fully integrating CSR with company strategy has not yet been achieve...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} a study that {{compared}} senior marketers’ perceptions of the Internet’s influence on marketing in South Africa in 1997 with their perceptions nearly two decades later in 2011. In South Africa, the predicted value of the Internet economy {{is expected to rise}} from R 59 billion at the end of 2013 to R 100 billion in 2016, thereby accounting for 2. 5 % of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A cross-industry survey of the marketing practitioners at the <b>Johannesburg</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange’s</b> top 100 companies was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Ranked means were used to compare senior marketers’ perceptions concerning the Internet’s influence on the conceptualisation of marketing activities, market definition and value creation between the 1997 and 2011 studies. In addition, a two independent-samples t-test was used to compute whether there were statistically significant differences between the 1997 and 2011 perceptions. The findings of the research suggest that in 2011, marketers perceived the Internet to have a statistically significant lower influence on doing a better job selling, expanding the size of a target market, targeting new customers in current markets and adding new segments than those in the 1997 stud...|$|R
