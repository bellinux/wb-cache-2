25|$|The {{directive}} {{was further}} clarified and extended by EU directive 2001/12 which initially allowed cross border freight operations {{on a network}} of tracks – {{to be called the}} Trans European Rail Freight Network a network which includes ports and freight terminals.

The directive also required separate accounting of freight and passenger service revenues and costs.|$|E
