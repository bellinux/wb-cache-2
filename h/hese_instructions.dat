40|$|Wireless Communication {{today is}} headingtowards dynamic {{spectrum}} allocation technology i. e. CognitiveRadio (CR). Increased demand over the usable spectrum has leftno alternative than CR for seamless communication. Working inthe dynamic spectrum allocation era demands flexibility andreconfigurability from trans-receiver radio systems. Thesoftware defined radio (SDR) thus forms {{the heart of}} CR. SDRincorporates adaptive algorithms for all processing blocks ofCommunication Systems. Noise over the channel in CR will alsotake dynamic nature. While transmission over such varyingnoise channels SDR must incorporate adaptive denoisingalgorithms. The paper focuses on such an adaptive optimisationapproach for Image denoising. The software implementationresults have been depicted & have been summarized with theplot of Peak Signal to Noise ratio(PSNR) Vs Filter Iterations atvarying Noise densities. <b>hese</b> <b>instructions</b> give you guidelines forpreparing papers for the International Journal of ComputerTechnology and Electronics Engineering (IJCTEE).

40|$|Flexible pyroelectric energy {{generators}} provide unique {{features for}} harvesting temperature fluctuations {{which can be}} effectively enhanced using meshed electrodes that improve thermal conduction, convection and radiation into the pyroelectric. In this paper, thermal radiation energy is continuously harvested with pyroelectric free standing Polyvilylidene Difluoride (PVDF) films over {{a large number of}} heat heat cycles using a novel micro-sized symmetrical patterned meshed electrode. It is shown that, for the meshed electrode geometries considered in this work, the polarisation-field (P-E), current-field (I-E) characteristics and device capacitance are unaffected since the fringing fields were generally small; this is verified using numerical simulations and comparison with experimental measurements. The use of meshed electrodes has been shown to significantly improve both the open circuit voltage (16 V to 59 V) and closed-circuit current (9 nA to 32 nA). The pyroelectric alternating current (AC) is rectified for direct current (DC) storage and 30 % reduction in capacitor charging time is achieved by using the optimum meshed electrodes. The use of meshed electrodes on ferroelectric materials provides an innovative route to improve their performance in applications such as wearable devices, novel flexible sensors and large scale pyroelectric energy harvesters. <b>hese</b> <b>instructions</b> give you guidelines for preparing papers for IEEE Transactions and Journals.
