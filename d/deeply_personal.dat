5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E
5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} groups like the Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> and emotional.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts {{while she was}} working on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> territory.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Charles McNary, {{a future}} U.S. Senator, {{was a new}} court justice by the time McAllister's appeal was heard.

5|$|For {{his next}} movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very {{different}} from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures (for example, Drunken Angel and Kagemusha) had included brief dream sequences, Dreams was to be entirely based upon the director's own dreams. Significantly, {{for the first time}} in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan, Steven Spielberg, who convinced Warner Bros. to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawa's son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film's production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and Dreams premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world. In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement.|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} of the first post-war decade were heavily influenced by <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> conflicts between López loyalists and their more liberal opponents, but just as important was the backing of various politicians by Argentina and Brazil. In the end the Brazilian-supported politicians won, and established {{the rule of the}} Colorado party.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have been}} divided {{as to the}} {{literary}} merits of Liber Amoris, a <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> account of frustrated love that is quite unlike anything else Hazlitt ever wrote. Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality, and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists.|$|E

50|$|After {{describing}} the military campaigns of Augustus, Suetonius describes his personal life. A large {{section of the}} entire book is devoted to this. This is partly because after Actium, the reign of Augustus was mostly peaceful. It has also been noted by several sources that the entire work of The Twelve Caesars delves more <b>deeply</b> into <b>personal</b> details and gossip relative to other contemporary Roman histories.|$|R
25|$|As {{sensitive}} and <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of client confidentiality—and the limited {{circumstances in which}} it {{may need to be}} broken for the protection of clients or others—is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations' codes of ethical practice.|$|E
25|$|I have no {{difficulty}} accepting the appellants' contention that {{whether or not}} sexual orientation is based on biological or physiological factors, which may {{be a matter of}} some controversy, it is a <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> characteristic that is either unchangeable or changeable only at unacceptable personal costs, and so falls within the ambit of s. 15 protection as being analogous to the enumerated grounds.|$|E
25|$|Mantram Handbook... is concise, {{simple and}} practical.... Where Easwaran scores over other books {{of a similar}} type is in his non-sectarian {{approach}} and his appeal to common-sense.... Second, Easwaran's account is <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> and, therefore, all the more convincing. He has traversed the same path himself and is aware of all the snares and pitfalls. The tone {{of the book is}} cheerful, optimistic and positive.... The book is not merely about mantrams. Its aim is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.|$|E

50|$|Their {{responsibility}} in the play is both central and extremely onerous, as their task is to re-enact the <b>deeply</b> harrowing <b>personal</b> accounts {{of the effect of}} the former Apartheid State on people's lives. Badly handled, such stories could easily become a kind of horror pornography. The puppets assist in mediating this horror. They are not actors playing a role. Rather, they are wooden dolls attempting to be real people. As they attempt to move and breathe as we do, they cross the barrier of the here and now and become metaphors for humanity.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, 'human science' {{has been}} used to refer to [...] "a {{philosophy}} and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in <b>deeply</b> subjective, <b>personal,</b> historical, contextual, cross-cultural, political, and spiritual terms. Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject-object split in science. In particular, it addresses the ways in which self-reflection, art, music, poetry, drama, language and imagery reveal the human condition. By being interpretive, reflective, and appreciative, human science re-opens the conversation among science, art, and philosophy." ...|$|R
25|$|The one failing {{of their}} {{marriage}} was that it remained childless. Head adored children, {{as can be seen}} in his poems and his poetry also gives considerable insight into Head's great desire for a child of his own. In his poem , for example, he takes on the perspective of a woman yearning for 'the fierce joy of motherhood' and presents a sympathetic view of her plight. Head's <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> poems also could be said to suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnant (maybe more than once) and perhaps even to term.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita is a {{dialogue}} between Krishna and Arjuna, and presents Bhakti, Jnana and Karma yoga as alternate ways to spiritual liberation, with the choice left to the individual. The text discusses dharma, and its pursuit as duty without craving for fruits of one's actions, {{as a form of}} spiritual path to liberation. The text, state Clooney and Stewart, succinctly summarizes the foundations of Vaishnava theology that the entire universe exists within Vishnu, and all aspects of life and living is not only a divine order but divinity itself. Bhakti, in Bhagavad Gita, is an act of sharing, and a <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> awareness of spirituality within and without.|$|E
25|$|Ivey was {{acquainted with}} Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, {{and other members}} of the 'Northwest School', and was close friends with Richard Gilkey and many of the Skagit Valley-based {{painters}} who were considered by some critics to represent a second generation of the Northwest School. However, his <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> style of abstraction showed more of the influence of Still, Rothko, and others he studied under at the California School of Fine Arts. He found inspiration in observation of the real world, but his intense immersion in the painting process transformed what he saw into lush abstractions that emphasized color and the picture plane. In Ivey's paintings, shapes are secondary to color in the development of spaces, and delicate neutral grays set off glowing patches of bright color.|$|E

40|$|At {{the time}} To Touch the Water was published, Gretel Ehrlich was a filmmaker, essayist, editor, cow- and sheepherder, {{part of both}} the West and New York, {{as well as a}} poet. The poems here speak <b>deeply</b> of <b>personal</b> experience. They are portraits {{of the people who have}} pressed their lives on hers; strong open images of the landscapes that are the West, {{complete}} with storms, drought, sun and wind; love poems as large and grainy as the landscapes. Death is never far away. Although her poems are personal in detail, they speak to all about the truths love and life hold...|$|R

25|$|The split {{over the}} treaty was <b>deeply</b> <b>personal.</b> Many {{of the leaders}} on both sides had been close friends and comrades during the War of Independence. This made their {{disagreement}} over the treaty all the more bitter. Michael Collins later said that Éamon de Valera had sent him as plenipotentiary to negotiate the treaty {{because he knew that}} the British would not concede an independent Irish republic and wanted Collins to take the blame for the compromise settlement. He said that he felt deeply betrayed when de Valera refused to stand by the agreement that the plenipotentiaries had negotiated with David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. De Valera, for his part, was furious that Collins and Arthur Griffith had signed the treaty without consulting him or the Irish cabinet as instructed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these two loose groupings, a number of prominent Irish poets {{of the second half}} of the 20th century could be described as outsiders, although these poets could also be considered leaders of a mainstream tradition in the Republic which was critically eclipsed by the Ulster-centric focus of American and British-based Irish Studies academics and the prejudices of others who are gender study specialists. These include Thomas Kinsella (born 1928), whose early work was influenced by Auden. Kinsella's later work exhibits the influence of Pound in its looser metrical structure and use of imagery but is <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> in manner and matter. He is Professor of English at Temple University, Philadelphia. Kinsella also edited the poetry of Austin Clarke, who, in his later work at least, could also be included with the outsiders in Irish poetry.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{began his}} career playing trumpet professionally, but {{by the age of}} 30 his life was devoted to composition. He was ranked with Benjamin Britten {{as one of the most}} sought-after composers in Britain. His natural melodic gift earned him a {{reputation}} as a composer of light music in works such as some of his concert overtures and the sets of Welsh, English, Scottish, Irish and Cornish dances. He was also a highly successful composer of film music, penning the scores to over a hundred features and documentaries, including titles such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Hobson's Choice and the St Trinian's series. His nine symphonies are often <b>deeply</b> <b>personal</b> and show a more serious side to his work, which has proved more controversial. Arnold also wrote a variety of concertos and chamber works, as well as music for the theatre including major ballets.|$|E
50|$|He {{escaped from}} Ireland, became a priest the was consecrated a Bishop. In 432 he {{returned}} to Ireland where, filled with the Holy Spirit, he converted many Irish Kings and their people.

500|$|Throughout the 1920s Andrade {{continued}} {{traveling in}} Brazil, studying {{the culture and}} folklore of the interior. [...] He began to formulate a sophisticated theory of the social dimensions of folk music, which is at once nationalistic and <b>deeply</b> <b>personal.</b> [...] Andrade's explicit subject was the relationship between [...] "artistic" [...] music and {{the music of the}} street and countryside, including both Afro-Brazilian and Amerindian styles. [...] The work was controversial for its formal discussions of dance music and folk music; those controversies were compounded by Andrade's style, which was at once poetic (Luper calls it [...] "Joycean") and polemical.|$|E

500|$|Badu's songwriting was {{characterized}} by pointillism, stream of consciousness, and scenic narrative. Her lyrics are alternately overtly political and <b>deeply</b> <b>personal,</b> interlaced with Five Percenter notions and references to the Nation of Islam. Badu expresses a motherly perspective and feelings of dismay and empathy for {{the subjects in the}} songs. Charles Aaron commented that [...] "a sense of history and maternal compassion ... grounds even her most oblique forays." [...] Abebe wrote similarly, [...] "her keen writing about people" [...] gives songs [...] "much of their shape" [...] and views that her candor helps communicate the album's [...] "social concerns, which could otherwise sound like a laundry list of black-community struggles".|$|E
30|$|The {{roots of}} my {{interest}} in this conversation lie in interactions I have had with people in many different settings. My attention has, over the years, been regularly drawn {{to the way we}} speak about the future, our current condition and the past. It has been challenged by a growing awareness that the language we speak is <b>deeply</b> individual, <b>personal,</b> intimate. Even when we speak the same language there is much scope for misunderstanding. When we begin to speak across, between and through other languages this scope for misunderstanding deepens. Yet I have also noticed that misunderstanding in and of itself is not really the problem.|$|R
