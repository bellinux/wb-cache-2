40|$|The {{pathology}} of schistosomiasis mansoni in rabbits was {{studied with}} special consideration to worm burden {{and duration of}} infection. Heavy and prolonged infections resulted in severe changes involving the intrahepatic portal vein branches, such as: polypoid <b>endophlebitis,</b> granulomatous <b>endophlebitis</b> and, later on, vascular occlusion and recanalization, vascular ectasia, fibrosis and hyalinization of the endothelial polyps. Living and dead adult worms, rather than the mature eggs, were the main pathogenetic factors. For some time the lesions tend {{to be limited to}} the portal vein branches, not extending to the periportal tissues, but, after 8 to 10 months, variable degree of portal, septal and intra-parenchymal fibrosis can be formed. However, both vascular and fibrotic changes in the liver had a focal distribution and therefore did not appear to cause portal hypertension and had no resemblance to the human pathology seen in cases of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Pathology of schistosomiasis in rabbits has peculiar aspects, which are worthwhile studying, since the model can be of interest for investigations, especially concerning the immunology and immunopathology of schistosomiasis mansoni...|$|E
40|$|Budd-Chiari {{syndrome}} comprises {{a variety}} of di-sorders resulting from obstruction of hepatic veno-us outflow. The clinical presentation is diverse and ranges from an asymptomatic state to either fulminant hepatic failure or end stage liver dise-ase with its associated liver complications (1). Patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome present with occlusion of terminal hepatic venules (veno-occlu-sive disease), major hepatic veins, or inferior vena cava (2). Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is non-thrombotic, fibrous, obliterative <b>endophlebitis</b> of the central or sublobular hepatic veins.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{established}} infection with penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on microarterial and microvenous anastomosis was studied in a rat experimental model. The infection {{was treated with}} wound debridement and systemic antibiotics {{at the time of}} the surgical procedure. It was found that the patency rate of microarterial repairs at 10 - 14 days was 95. 1 %. Veins were less resistant to infection than arteries. Two types of vein involvement were found.

40|$|A disease {{characterized}} by ascites and hepato-megaly {{was described in}} Jamaica by McFarlane and Branday in 1945, and later studied by Hill and his colleagues (Hill, Rhodes, Stafford and Aub, 1953), and by Bras, Jelliffe and Stuart (1954). Bras and his co-workers demonstrated occlusion of the small hepatic veins and accordingly named the condition 'Veno-occlusive disease of the liver ' (V. O. D.). The exact nature of the occlusions has not been ascer-tained, although Bras and his colleagues likened {{some of them to}} an obliterating <b>endophlebitis,</b> and others to organized mural thrombi. The death of three children early in the disease, one three days, another five days and a third 21 days after the onset of symptoms has prompted us t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Twelve tundra swans, Cygnus columbianus (Ord), from Nevada and {{one from}} New Mexico were {{collected}} and examined for schistosomes. Mature worms, determined as Allobilharzia visceralis, were found in 92 % of the swans, in the inferior mesenteric vein of the large intestine and its branches. In 12 cases, there was <b>endophlebitis</b> of the inferior mesenteric vein. The morphology of the worms {{is consistent with the}} recently described genus Allobilharzia. Placement in this genus was confirmed also by phylogenetic analysis of nuclear 28 S, 18 S and, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribo-somal DNA (rDNA), and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (CO 1) sequences. Data further suggest the worms are con-specific with the European A. visceralis, the only described species of the genus and which was found to be the sister taxon to the most diverse avian schistosome genus, Trichobil...|$|E
40|$|Nine piglets, 2 - 5 {{months old}} and {{weighing}} 12 - 15 kg were infected percutaneously with 5000 to 6000 cercariae of Schistosoma japonicum. Three similar piglets {{which were not}} infected served as controls. Infected animals were necropsied at 5, 10, 30, 40, 59, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days post-infection (PI) and the controls at 5, 60 and 180 days PI. The prepatent period varied from 27 to 33 days after infection. Clinical signs observed, coincident with egg production, were loss of appetite, lethargy, pallor of mucous membranes, diarrhea, progressive emaciation and dehydration. One piglet was moribund when killed for necropsy at 40 days and another piglet died 59 days PI. Pathological changes induced by S. japonicum included erythematous papules {{on the site of}} inoculation, petechial hemorrhages in the lungs, catarrhal to hemorrhagic enteritis, bluish-gray discoloration of the liver, and egg granulomas in the liver, lungs, spleen, intestines, pancreas and mesenteric lymph nodes. <b>Endophlebitis</b> with intimal hyperplasia was occasionally observed in veins harboring adult schistosomes.

40|$|The pathophysiologic {{responses}} of 13 sheep inoculated orally with 100 metacercariae of Fascioloides magna were monitored for 4 months after inoculation. There {{were no differences}} in weight gains between these {{and a number of}} noninoculated control sheep throughout the experiment. Complete blood cell counts showed an increase only in the absolute number of eosinophils. Serum preparations (2 times a week) from 7 inoculated and 7 noninoculated sheep did not identify any significant changes in alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities. There were no changes in total bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, inorganic phosphorus, calcium, albumin, chloride, potassium, and sodium values. Four months after they were inoculated, all sheep were necropsied, and flukes were recovered. Gross lesions attributed to fluke migration were found in the liver and portal lymph nodes, diaphragm, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Microscopically, liver lesions in inoculated sheep occurred in the portal areas, veins, and Glisson&# 39;s capsule and were characterized by both active and chronic forms of inflammation. Abundant infiltrates of eosinophils and plasma cells often marked the portal areas. <b>Endophlebitis,</b> with or without thrombosis, was the predominate vascular lesion. The flukes recovered varied greatly in size (6. 5 to 48. 0 -mm long) and demonstrated some sexual development, but none was sexually mature...|$|E
40|$|The authors pathologically {{investigated}} 10 cases (8 {{natural and}} 2 experimental cases) concerning {{a disease of}} unknown cause in dairy cows in Monbetsu City, Hokkaido. The results obtained were as follows. 1. Natural cases {{were considered to be}} chronic mercury poisoning and all cases showed mercury in tissues. 2. The clinical and pathological changes in the first experimental case (Case 9) were considerably {{similar to those of the}} natural cases and were considered to be due to chronic mercury poisoning. 3. The second experimental cases (Case 10) was considered to be subacute mercury poisoning. 4. In the natural cases, subacute interstitial nephritis, subacute catarrhal bronchitis, enlargement and edema of general lymph nodes, enlargement of splenic follicles, subendocardial and subepicardial hemorrhages, depilation and circum-scribed dermatitis, general hyperemia and hemorrhages, sometimes focal hepatic necroses and slight liver cirrhosis were anatomically noticeable. 5. Histopathologically, the activities of the reticuloendothelial system in a wide sense, such as general histiocytic cellular proliferation and giant cell formation were obesrved. Interstitial cellular reaction in the kidneys, connective tissue proliferation with cellular accumulation in GLISSON'S sheath, catarrhal lymphadenitis, the enlargement of Malpigian corpuscles in the spleen, focal hepatic necroses, degeneration of epithelial cells in the renal convoluted tubules, subacute catarrhal bronchitis, <b>endophlebitis</b> oblilerans et productiva, subendocardial and subepicardial hemorrhages, catarrh, congestion and hemorrhages in the alimentary canal and circumscribed dermatitis were noted. 6.

40|$|Venous {{diseases}} {{caused by}} venous catheters have variable symptoms and clinical progress. (Gerhards, 2004). It can be differentiated between perivenous hematoma, periphlebitis, <b>endophlebitis,</b> phlebothrombosis or septic thrombophlebitis. To diagnose a venous disease, a clinical examination (jugular fill, swelling, pain, increased skin temperature, and any exudation around the injection site) and an ultrasonographic examination (perivenous tissue, venous wall, venous content) of the vein are performed (Bonagura et al., 2010; Geraghty et al., 2009 a; Hopster et al., 20011; Kihurani und Schusser, 2001; Milne und Bradbury, 2009). The individual {{constitution of the}} patient, the underlying disease and, in particular, the catheter material, system and management are relevant {{for the development of}} catheter-associated complications (Hopster et al., 2011). The preliminary investigation was carried out with the aim to obtain an overview of the catheter management currently used in equine clinics in Germany and Austria. For this purpose, a questionnaire was sent by email to 94 equine clinics in Germany and Austria, asking about their catheter systems and -management. The investigation showed a very different catheter management with regard to catheter selection, venous dwell time, preparation of the catheter field and catheter care at equine clinics in Germany and Austria. The aim of the main study was to investigate the effect of different indwelling catheter systems (material, catheter length and diameter) for long term use on the jugular vein in horses, based on type and incidence of catheter-associated complications. The goal was to point out which material (polyurethane/PU or polytetrafluoroethylene/PTFE) and what type of catheter (diameter and length) leads to changes in the collected parameters on the vein used or has an influence on the coagulation parameters. In addition, the bacterial colonization of the different catheter materials was examined. Three venous catheter systems differing in diameter, length and material (polytetrafluoroethylene = PTFE 14 G x 16 cm, polyurethane 1 = PU 1 14 G x 13 cm, polyurethane 2 = PU 2 12 G x 13 cm) were applied to three groups of horses (15 horses per group) in a random manner. Five of the 45 horses examined developed an aseptic thrombophlebitis, which could in average be diagnosed on day five of examination. There was {{a significant difference in the}} development of the venous disease between the two materials (PTFE, PU) used (p = 0. 023, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 19 – 5. 55). Veins with PTFE catheters have a 2. 6 times higher risk of suffering from venous disease than those with PU catheters. There was no significant difference in the development of venous disease between the diameter (12 G and 14 G) of the two catheter systems PU 1 and PU 2. There was no significant difference between the experimental groups and the development of venous disease related to the coagulation parameters. Therefore it can be assumed that an increase in blood viscosity plays no role in the manifestation of venous disease in our patients. As in other studies, no significant association between a positive microbiological result and the severity of venous disease or between the catheter types could be determined (Askoy et al., 2008; Lankveld et al., 2001; Milne und Bradbury, 2009). In summary, venous catheters made of PU are more convenient for use as long-term catheter systems than those made of PTFE...|$|E
