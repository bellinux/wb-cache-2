40|$|AbstractÐThis paper {{presents}} {{the measurement of}} colored object reflectance, under different, general assumptions regarding the imaging conditions. We exploit the Gaussian scale-space paradigm for color images to define a framework for the robust measurement of object reflectance from color images. Object reflectance is derived from a physical reflectance model based on the <b>Kubelka-Munk</b> <b>theory</b> for colorant layers. Illumination and geometrical invariant properties are derived from the reflectance model. Invariance and discriminative power of the color invariants is experimentally investigated, showing the invariants {{to be successful in}} discounting shadow, illumination, highlights, and noise. Extensive experiments show the different invariants to be highly discriminative, while maintaining invariance properties. The presented framework for color measurement is well-founded in the physics of color as well as in measurement science. Hence, the proposed invariants are considered more adequate for the measurement of invariant color features than existing methods.

The {{purpose of}} the study {{intended}} to examine the performance of color rendering based on a computerized spectrum color matching (CSCM) method derived from the <b>Kubelka-Munk</b> <b>theory.</b> In the study, we prepared 2 offset ink sets to produce 30 standard color samples sets.

Since small values of k are characteristic {{of a wide variety}} of geologically important materials over a significant range of wavelength, the K-M theory should be applicable to appropriate portions of the reflectance spectra of these media if the dimensions of the scattering centers are sufficiently small. To test the utility of the K-M theory, a comparison is conducted of a set of theoretically generated spectra with a set of independently measured experimental spectra.

30|$|The {{question}} of whether or not the algorithms being used in the industry at present to analyse hyperspectral datacubes give the best results has been raised, and newer algorithms have been suggested which can take full advantage of the increasing information [33]. Doubts about the ability of HSI to identify a pigment definitively have been raised due to the complications of mixtures or degraded pigments [1]. For example, for the identification of mixtures, linear spectral unmixing was designed for remote sensing (the collection of surface data from afar, for example the geological survey of several kilometres of land using sensors on an aeroplane) where the signal is a combination of the spectral responses of spatially separated materials [1]. In such a study a pixel may be several metres across and cover both a patch of grass and some tarmac, whereas for paint materials this is not the case, as pigments are uniformly dispersed in the binding media and the spectral response is not a simple linear mixture of the reflectance. The <b>Kubelka–Munk</b> (KM) <b>theory</b> is more appropriate [1, 9] and is used in the paint industry to calculate the ratios of paints to match a given colour [1].

Remote measurements of soil volumetric water content (θv), soil water matric potential (ψ), and soil index properties (liquid limit [LL], plastic limit [PL], and clay fraction [CF]) were conducted. Field-based measurement of θv was conducted using a ground-based radar system and field measurements within 10 percentage points of measurements acquired with traditional sampling techniques were obtained. Laboratory-based, visible and near infrared spectroscopy {{was found to be}} capable of obtaining empirical, soil specific regression functions (partial least squares [PLS]) with coefficient of determination (R 2) values greater than 0. 9 for the LL, PL, and CF. A silt sized granite material, a silt sized illite clay, and a silt sized kaolinite clay were optically characterized within the visible to near-infrared wavelength range and were found to have absorption coefficient values of 0. 81 to 78. 8 cm- 1, 0. 93 to 150. 0 cm- 1, and 0. 12 to 4. 02 cm- 1, respectively. Measurements of θv and ψ using an analytical solution based on the <b>Kubelka-Munk</b> color <b>theory</b> were found not to provide viable results. Soil water characteristic curves (SWCC) were fitted to both laboratory-obtained and remotely-sensed data between - 10 and - 1500 kPa. θv for the laboratory-obtained SWCC (SWCC-L) and remotely-obtained SWCC (SWCC-R) for the granite silt were within 1 percentage points for ψ values less than - 100 kPa.

The Gamblin Conservation Colors, a set of 43 colorants specially formulated for inpainting, were characterized in terms of their optical properties, absorption and scattering, according to <b>Kubelka-Munk</b> turbid media <b>theory.</b> Formulations were made using traditional spectrophotometric measurements and image-based measurements. The multispectral imaging system consisted of a trichromatic CFA camera coupled with two absorption filters; spectral reflectance data for each pixel location was estimated with a transformation based on calibration target images. Three targets were used for testing formulation accuracy: a target consisting of mixtures of Gamblin Conservation Colors, and two oil paintings. Pigment selection was reasonably successful, and good predictions resulted from both measurement techniques, but for more complex tasks such as pigment identification, a more rigorous colorant characterization approach may be needed. Predictions from image-based measurements were generally less accurate, and improvements in the camera model would likely remedy this. It is expected that this software will be of assistance to conservators by simplifying the process of selecting from a large set of available pigments, as well as reducing the possibility of damage to painted surfaces in cases where direct measurements are impractical.

Photodynamic therapy is a promising cancer treatment in which a photosensitizing drug concentrates in malignant cells and is activated by visible light at certain wavelength. Materials and Methods: Cheap artificial semi-rigid tissue incorporated with scattering and absorbing materials along with some other composites comparable to normal human tissue has been performed. The optical parameters as measured with different conditions and calculated with various techniques are investigated. Results: The probability of interaction of light with tissue is very high when exposed to light in presence of Cichorium pumilum and RBCs followed by photohemolysis or/and photodegradation. The optical penetration depth calculated by linear absorption coefficient ranges from 0. 63 to 2. 85 mm {{is found to be}} comparable to those calculated using <b>Kubelka-Munk</b> <b>theory</b> or Monte Carlo simulation (range from 0. 78 to 2. 42 mm). The ratio of absorption to the scattering is independent of thickness and decreases with increasing irradiation time. Moreover, the optical parameters as well as their ratios are in very good agreement in the two approaches of calculation. The values of absorption and scattering coefficients are independent of thickness.

Human visual system is able to sense wide spectrum of colors and placing that range on substrate, weather paper or any other, requires skills. Traditional printing reproduction is built on metamerism phenomena and now the new challenge to overcome that constraint is set. To create the communication with print mechanism is very important {{and for that reason}} spectral printer modeling represents the crucial step. With this process characterization of the printer is done. This depends on the data given and optimal way of its use needs to be established. With forward printer model the relation between the colorant combination and the resulting spectral reflectances printed on substrate is defined. The inverse process enables printer control to define the colorant separation from spectral refelectances to precise values.
