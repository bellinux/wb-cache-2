50|$|Arden Way {{begins at}} Acoma Street in the North Sacramento area of Sacramento. It is {{a side street}} in a light {{industrial}} area, running approximately two blocks up to Colfax Street and paralleling the Arden-Garden Connector, the westward continuation for major thoroughfare traffic on Arden Way east of Colfax Street. After Colfax Street, Arden Way gains it major thoroughfare status, intersecting Del Paso Boulevard (old US 40) and running parallel with the Regional Transit light rail tracks and a residential <b>frontage</b> <b>street</b> of Arden Way up until Royal Oaks Drive. It passes two light rail stations: The Arden/Del Paso station and the Royal Oaks station. Arden Way then travels over the light rail and Union Pacific railroad tracks at a large overpass, where the roadway turns southeast towards the interchange of Business 80 (also known as the Capital City Freeway) and Highway 160, known locally as the Arden Y. Arden Way passes Arden Fair Mall, then intersects Exposition Boulevard and Ethan Way, where the roadway turns east, leaving the city of Sacramento and into the unincorporated community of Arden-Arcade.|$|E
5000|$|The developer's {{design process}} {{made use of}} the [...] "bonus provisions" [...] of the District Plan, {{allowing}} them to build more floor area in exchange for public benefits such as displayed works of art and a public plaza. The value of these {{to the general public}} has however been called into question by some. Also criticised has been the lack of connection between the two <b>frontage</b> <b>streets</b> through the building.|$|R

50|$|Samuel Farr's {{building}} {{was in an}} L-shape, with the frontages onto Kilmore (south frontage) and Montreal (west <b>frontage)</b> <b>Streets</b> measuring 244 ft and 145 ft, respectively. Whilst the external appearance of the school was highly ornamented, the inside was plain and austere. The exception to this was the octagonal corner room where Kilmore and Montreal Streets meet, with the roof of this room intricately vaulted. It was Farr's most famous building, and maybe his most scholarly Gothic design.|$|R
50|$|The {{growth and}} {{expansion}} of TC Beirne & Co. continued for the greater {{half of the twentieth}} century. Within a few years of the purchase of the Brunswick Street property, Beirne acquired adjoining properties in Duncan Street. The company was eventually to boast a Brunswick <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> of 146 feet, a Duncan <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> of 311 feet, and an Ann <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> of 62 feet. The shop floor areas fronted Brunswick Street, and warehousing areas were located along Duncan and Ann Streets.|$|R

50|$|The former South Brisbane Library {{consists}} of three interlinking buildings. The two-storeyed former Post Office and Library both have Stanley <b>Street</b> <b>frontages,</b> similar gable roofs and string courses that delineate the two floors.

50|$|The {{ground floor}} has an awning to the Queen <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> {{and to the}} {{northern}} end of the Ann <b>Street</b> <b>frontage.</b> The awning is supported by steel tie-rods fixed to the exterior of the first floor, and has decorative pressed metal soffit and fascia, with the name HOTEL ORIENT in relief. The Queen <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> has an entrance at the southern end, with regularly spaced sash windows fronting the street and returning along the Ann <b>Street</b> <b>frontage.</b> The entrance is accessed via a flight of steps to recessed doors which have a leadlight fanlight panel. A metal grille above the entrance has the letters H and O intertwined, and the side walls are finished with glazed ceramic tiles with a decorative frieze and trims. The glazed ceramic tiles continue along the street frontage; however they have been covered with a textured coating with only the frieze being left exposed. The windows along the Queen <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> dating from the interwar refurbishment have decorative leadlight panes, and later sash windows retain evidence of being adapted from earlier doorways. The corner has evidence of earlier doorways, and currently has paired non-original timber framed glass doors with a raised threshold which aligns with an internal stage area. The windows to the Ann <b>Street</b> <b>frontage</b> have their sill heights at footpath level, with a cast iron palisade set in the sill to each window. An entrance to the bar is located at the western end of the original section of the Ann Street elevation.|$|R

50|$|Effy {{purchased}} {{the building in}} 1914, and in 1925 he engaged architects Hall and Prentice to design major alterations and additions. The scheme, which cost £162,000, included the purchase of what {{was known as the}} City Garage, over which Rowes ballroom was built, and additional Adelaide <b>Street</b> <b>frontage.</b> The Adelaide <b>Street</b> building was demolished and a six storeyed building erected, the ground floor containing a shopping arcade (known as Rowes Arcade) with access to Rowes Cafe. The upper floors were divided into office accommodation. The T-shaped complex had its original <b>frontage</b> to Edward <b>Street,</b> but an increased depth to an approximate distance of 300 feet (91.5 m). Further alterations to the Edward Street facade were undertaken in late 1926.|$|R

50|$|The {{residence}} {{located at}} 150 Kingsley Terrace is sited on three parcels {{of land that}} fall gently from the western <b>street</b> <b>frontage</b> toward the rear eastern boundary of the site. The residence is sited close to the <b>street</b> <b>frontage</b> of the property meaning the backyard is quite expansive. Vegetation to the site is quite minimal {{with only a few}} mature plantings contained to the boundaries of the site.|$|R
50|$|When {{it opened}} in 1901 the hotel's <b>frontage</b> along High <b>Street</b> took up half of the block to Henry Street, with a 110 ft <b>frontage</b> along Mouat <b>Street.</b> The {{building}} consisted of two bars, a large saloon, three private parlours, lavatories, a dressing room, dining rooms, and three shops on the ground floor.
