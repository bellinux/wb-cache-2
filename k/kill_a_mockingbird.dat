5|$|To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> was Lee's only {{published}} book until Go Set a Watchman, {{an earlier}} draft of To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird,</b> was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued {{to respond to}} her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Sorkin will be adapting To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> for the stage, where he will be working alongside Bartlett Sher.|$|E
5|$|But as Hohoff saw it, the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird.</b>|$|E

5|$|To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> is a {{novel by}} Harper Lee {{published}} in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, {{and has become a}} classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E

Additionally, Lee received numerous honorary degrees, though she declined to speak on those occasions.

The novel was adapted as a 1962 film {{of the same name}} starring Gregory Peck.|$|E

As much as he wants Smith to be {{sentenced to life in}} prison, a death by hanging would provide a far more sensational ending for readers of his book. He begins to unravel psychologically as the legal appeals drag on, unable to complete his book without an ending. Lee, during the interim, writes To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird,</b> which becomes a best-seller.|$|E

The last few of the more realistic modernists along with the wildly Romantic beatniks largely dominated the period, while the direct respondents to America's involvement in World War II contributed in their notable influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{plot and}} {{characters}} of To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> are {{loosely based on}} Lee's observations of her family and neighbors, {{as well as an}} event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10years old. The novel deals with the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s, as depicted through the eyes of two children. The novel was inspired by racist attitudes in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama.|$|E

25|$|From {{the time}} of the {{publication}} of To <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> until her death in 2016, Lee granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances and, {{with the exception of a}} few short essays, published nothing further, until 2015. She did work on a follow-up novel—The Long Goodbye—but eventually filed it away unfinished. During the mid-1980s, she began a factual book about an Alabama serial murderer, but also put it aside when she was not satisfied. Her withdrawal from public life prompted unfounded speculation that new publications were in the works.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest.

Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|R
