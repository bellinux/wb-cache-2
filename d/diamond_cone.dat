Prior tests on laboratory Hall discharges indicated that CVD diamond has significant erosion resistance compared to the more commonly used boron nitride ceramics. Here, we extend our studies further, and have designed and have carried out preliminary tests of a <b>diamond</b> replacement nose <b>cone</b> on a commercial, space-qualified, BHT- 200 low power Hall thruster. A preliminary performance test verified that {{the introduction of the}} <b>diamond</b> nose <b>cone</b> resulted in nearly identical levels of thrust, efficiency, and specific impulse, within experimental uncertainty. The operation on diamond resulted in a minor increase in current, most likely due to the rougher shape of the <b>diamond</b> test nose <b>cone</b> assembly, or of the use of an alumina fastener for mating the assembly to the central pole piece of the thruster. Future diamond assemblies will consist of diamond plates that are brazed together for improved mechanical and thermal performance. In parallel, we have developed and performed initial vibration testing of brazed diamond plates, to verify the mechanical integrity of the proposed (brazed) <b>diamond</b> nose <b>cone</b> assembly. Broadband sine-sweep testing at 1 / 3 gRMS of two 6. 1 mm × 5. mm × 1 mm brazed diamond plates showed a nearly rigid frequency response over the range of 20 - 2000 Hz, with some resonances at higher frequencies, outside of the normal environmental testing range.

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural <b>diamond.</b> Roller <b>cone</b> bits can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|R

North Menan Butte is slightly larger and elliptical, with axes 3.5 and 2.5 km in length. South Menan Butte measures 3 km x 2 km. The crater of the North Menan Butte is about 3,000 feet (900 m) in diameter and the cone is about 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in diameter. The North Butte’s volume is 0.16 cubic miles (0.70 cubic km) and the South Butte measures at 0.07 cubic miles (0.30 cubic km). In comparison, the better known tuff <b>cone</b> <b>Diamond</b> Head on Oahu has a volume of 0.15 cubic miles (0.6 cubic km). The larger buttes in the Menan Complex are asymmetrical.

40|$|The Lawn Hill {{circular}} {{structure in}} northwest Queensland contains unambiguous {{evidence of an}} extraterrestrial impact, including planar deformation features in quartz, impact <b>diamonds,</b> widespread shatter <b>cone</b> formation and impact melt breccia in the Mesoproterozoic basement. The question of its relevance to ore genesis is investigated because the world-class Century Zn - Pb deposit is situated at the conjunction of the 100 + km Termite Range Fault and the previously defined margin of the impact structure. The impact structure {{is considered to be}} a 19. 5 km wide feature, this constrained in part by the outer margin of an annulus of brecciated and highly contorted limestone. New evidence is presented indicating impact into this Cambrian limestone, including: (i) 'dykes' of brecciated Cambrian limestone extending hundreds of metres into the Mesoproterozoic basement; (ii) highly contorted bedding in the limestone annulus compared with essentially undeformed limestone away from the impact site; as well as (iii) a 1 Mt megaclast of Mesoproterozoic Century-like ore suspended in the limestone. Through aerial photograph analysis, large-scale convoluted flow structures within the limestone are identified, and these are interpreted to indicate that parts of the Cambrian sequence may have been soft or only semi-consolidated at the time of impact. This highly contorted limestone bedding is suggested to represent slump-filling of an annular trough in response to impact-induced partial liquefaction of a sediment veneer. The age of impact is therefore considered to be concurrent with limestone formation during the Ordian to early Templetonian, at 520 - 510 Ma. Formation of the Century deposit is found to be unrelated to impact-generated hydrothermal activity, although some minor hydrothermal remobilisation of metals occurred. However, there was macro-scale remobilisation of gigantic ore fragments driven by impact-induced lateral and vertical injection of limestone into the Proterozoic sediments. The limestone-filled annular trough surrounds a 7. 8 km diameter central uplift, consistent with formation of a complex crater morphology. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reinforcement of root canals obturated with Resilon was {{reported}} by several investigators, but no studies reported the reinforcement of overtly flared root canals obturated with Resilon material. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the fracture resistance of overtly flared root canals filled with Resilon as compared to similar root canals filled with gutta-percha (GP). Materials and Methods: Sixty single-rooted premolars were divided randomly into six groups. Group 1 served as control group. The control group was sub-divided into two groups, a negative group and a positive group. The negative group consisted of root canals that were only cleaned from residual pulpal tissues, however, the positive group had prepared and overtly flared root canals without obturation. Groups 2 and 4 were shaped using 0. 04 taper rotary files, while groups 3 and 5 were shaped using 0. 06 taper rotary files. Before obturation, the last four groups were further flared coronally with a reverse <b>cone</b> <b>diamond</b> bur. Groups 2 and 3 were obturated with GP and a resin-based sealer, while groups 4 and 5 were obturated with Resilon and Epiphany self-etching primer and Epiphany sealer. Roots were then fixed into a universal testing machine and vertically loaded until fracture. SPSS software (Release 9. 0 for Windows, SPSS, Chicago, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis. Results: Fracture resistance measurements showed that there were differences in resistance to fracture among the experimental groups (ANOVA, P < 0. 0001). Mean values of the loading force applied to the negative control group were the highest at 1. 81 KN, whereas the mean values for the Resilon groups (Groups 4 and 5) at 1. 13 KN and 1. 54 KN were found to be higher than the GP groups (Groups 2 and 3) at 0. 45 KN and 0. 88 KN, respectively. Tukey′s post hoc test showed that there was no statistical difference between the mean values of the negative control group and Group 5 (P = 0. 69). Conclusion: Obturation of overtly flared roots with Resilon material increased the resistance of these teeth to vertical root fracture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} perform {{traceable}} hardness measurements using Rockwell Hardness Indenters, the indenter must {{conform to the}} requirement of ISO 6508 - 3 standard.

At present there is no facility in South Africa with the capability of calibrating indenters for conformance to ISO 6508 - 3. This situation is being addressed through a series of studies currently being conducted at the National Metrology Institute of South Africa. The following parameters are calibrated using the µCMM. ISO 6508 - 3 specifies a radius of 200 µm with an uncertainty of ± 5 µm for Rockwell Hardness Indenter tips.

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} properties of brittle coating structures {{were characterized by}} various indentation techniques. The adhesion properties of the coatings were evaluated by in situ scratch and sphere indentation method. Physical vapor deposited TiN coatings on transparent substrates, sapphire, were scratched by <b>diamond</b> <b>cone</b> indenter and in situ observed through the transparent substrate. In situ scratch results reveal that the failure of coating is originated from the damage of the substrate and the plastic deformation of substrate is a primary factor for determining the adhesion breakage. The unique characterization technique for the strength measurement of brittle thin coating has been developed. The strength of the thin coating was evaluated by the sphere indentation on the trilayer structure. The CVD SiC coatings on graphite were characterized by the technique. It is concluded that the microstructure of SiC coatings influences the strength. In this paper, the various indentation technique were applied to evaluate the {{mechanical properties}} of TiN and SiC coatings {{and the effect of}} microstructure on the reliability of the brittle coating system was discussed...|$|E
