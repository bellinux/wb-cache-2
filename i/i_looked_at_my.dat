500|$|Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, {{daughter}} of a Chicago banker, in 1927, when he was 40. Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the break began, Stump was the {{heaviest}} {{he had ever been}} and loathed the band's image as an [...] "emo" [...] band. Coming home from tour, drummer Andy Hurley [...] "went through the darkest depression [...] ever felt. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> calendar and it was just empty." [...] Wentz, who had been abusing Xanax and Klonopin, was divorced by his wife Ashlee Simpson and returned to therapy. [...] "I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day," [...] Wentz recalled. Previously known as the [...] "overexposed, despised" [...] leader of the band, Wentz [...] "simply grew up," [...] sharing custody of his son and embracing maturity: [...] "There was a jump-cut in my life. I started thinking – like, being old would be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellison {{graduated}} in 1981 from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, {{where he was}} active in sports and a senator in the student government. At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rumors and misquotes led to {{confusion}} as to {{what such}} a break truly meant; Wentz preferred to not refer to the break as a [...] "hiatus", instead explaining that the band was just [...] "decompressing". Fall Out Boy played its last show at Madison Square Garden on October 4, 2009. Near the end, Blink-182's Mark Hoppus shaved Wentz's head in a move Rolling Stone would later describe as a [...] "symbolic cleansing of the past, but also {{the beginning of a}} very dark chapter for the band." [...] By the time the break began, Stump was the heaviest he had ever been and loathed the band's image as an [...] "emo" [...] band.

This chapter uses phenomenonological autoethnography to examine and critique the interplay between the coercive cultural forces that impacted on my life and my gender non-conformity. The commentary and interpretation on my many attempted gender performance schemes, both failed and successful, in delivering personal agency, evidence a path of living a nonconformist life in a gendered world...|$|R
5000|$|Bassett taught Composition Seminar and Private Composition {{courses at}} the {{graduate}} level at the University of Michigan. Boury describes the time studying with Bassett as follows: [...] "... Mr. Bassett was and is a master orchestral thinker. My lessons with him were largely quiet affairs, him looking for about {{a half an hour}} at a page of 30 line full score, then saying, 'Aren't the trombones a little high?' Seemed like nothing was happening—yet <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own instrumental music and have to say, it looks like Bassett. Very clean, not many doublings..." ...|$|R
