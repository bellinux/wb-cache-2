40|$|The {{histidine}} triad nucleotide-binding (<b>Hint</b> 2) {{protein is}} a mitochondrial adenosine phosphoramidase expressed in liver and pancreas. Its physiological function is unknown. To elucidate {{the role of}} <b>Hint</b> 2 in liver physiology, the <b>Hint</b> 2 gene was deleted. <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) and <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+) mice were generated in a mixed C 57 Bl 6 /J x 129 Sv background. At 20 weeks, the phenotypic changes in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) relative to <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+) mice were an accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, decreased tolerance to glucose, a defective counter-regulatory response to insulin-provoked hypoglycaemia, an increase in plasma interprandial insulin but a decrease in glucose stimulated insulin secretion and defective thermoregulation upon fasting. Leptin mRNA in adipose tissue and plasma leptin were elevated. In mitochondria from <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) hepatocytes, state 3 respiration was decreased, a finding confirmed in HepG 2 cells where <b>HINT</b> 2 mRNA was silenced. The linked complex II to III electron transfer was decreased in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) mitochondria, which {{was accompanied by a}} lower content of coenzyme Q. HIF- 2 α expression and the generation of reactive oxygen species were increased. Electron microscopy of mitochondria in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) mice aged 12 months revealed clustered, fused organelles. The hepatic activities of 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) were decreased by 68 % and 60 %, respectively, without a change in protein expression. GDH activity was similarly decreased in <b>HINT</b> 2 -silenced HepG 2 cells. When measured in the presence of purified sirtuin 3, latent GDH activity was recovered (126 % in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) vs. 83 % in <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+)). This suggests a greater extent of acetylation in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) than in <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+). Conlusions: <b>Hint</b> 2 positively regulates mitochondrial lipid metabolism and respiration, and glucose homeostasis. The absence of <b>Hint</b> 2 provokes mitochondrial deformities and a change in the pattern of acetylation of selected proteins. (HEPATOLOGY 2012.) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Human <b>Hint</b> 1 {{suppresses}} specific {{gene transcription}} by inter-acting with the transcription factor MITF in mast cells. <b>Hint</b> 1 activity is con-nected to lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), {{a member of}} the universal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase family that catalyzes specific aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs, through an aminoacyl adenylate (aa-AMP) intermediate. During im-mune activation, LysRS produces a side-product diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap 4 A) from the condensation of Lys-AMP with ATP. The pleiotropic signaling molecule Ap 4 A then binds <b>Hint</b> 1 to promote activation of MITF-target gene transcription. Earlier work showed that <b>Hint</b> 1 can also bind and hydrolyze Lys-AMP, possibly to constrain Ap 4 A production. Because Ap 4 A can result from condensation of other aa-AMP's with ATP, the specificity of the <b>Hint</b> 1 aa-AMP−hydrolysis activity is of interest. Here we show that <b>Hint</b> 1 has broad specificity for adenylate hydrolysis, whose structural basis we revealed through high-resolution structures of <b>Hint</b> 1 in complex with three different aa-AMP analogues. <b>Hint</b> 1 recognizes only the common main chain of the aminoacyl moiety, and has no contact with the aa side chain. The α-amino group is anchored by a cation-pi interaction with Trp 123 at the C-terminus of <b>Hint</b> 1. These results reveal the structural basis for the remarkable adenylate surveillance activity of <b>Hint</b> 1, t...|$|R

30|$|It becomes {{increasingly}} important {{to obtain the}} accurate and spontaneous runtime network behavior for further studies on wireless sensor networks. However, the existing testbeds cannot appropriately match such requirements. A High-accuracy Nonintrusive Networking Testbed (<b>HINT)</b> is proposed.

The experiments show that <b>HINT</b> transparently gathers accurate runtime data and does not disturb the spontaneous behavior of sensor networks. <b>HINT</b> is also extendible to different hardware platforms of sensor nodes.

40|$|The {{histidine}} nucleotide-binding protein, <b>Hint</b> 2, is a mitochondrial phosphoramidase {{expressed in}} liver, brown fat, pancreas, and muscle. The livers of <b>Hint</b> 2 knockout (<b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-)) mice accumulate triglycerides and show {{a pattern of}} mitochondrial protein lysine hyperacetylation. The extent {{and nature of the}} lysine acetylation changes and the response of <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) mice to nutritional challenges that elicit a modification of protein acetylation have not been investigated. To compare the adaptation of <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) and control (<b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+)) mice with episodes of fasting and high-fat diet (HFD), we subjected animals to either feeding ad libitum or fasting for 24 h, and to either a HFD or control diet for 8 wk. Triglyceride content was higher in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) than in <b>Hint</b> 2 (+/+) livers, whereas plasma triglycerides were fourfold lower. Malonyl-CoA levels were increased twofold in <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) livers. After 24 h fasting, <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) displayed a decrease in body temperature, commensurate with a decrease in mass of brown fat and downregulation of uncoupling protein 1. HFD-treated <b>Hint</b> 2 (-/-) livers showed more steatosis, and plasma insulin and cholesterol were higher than in Hint(+/+) mice. Several proteins identified as substrates of sirtuin 3 and 5 and active in intermediary and ketone metabolism were hyperacetylated in liver and brown fat mitochondria after both HFD and fasting regimens. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was downregulated in fed and fasted livers, and this was attributed to an increase in acetylation and ADP-ribosylation. The absence of <b>Hint</b> 2 deregulates the posttranslational modification of several mitochondrial proteins, which impedes the adaptation to episodes of nutritional stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{histidine}} triad (HIT) protein <b>Hint</b> {{has been}} found to associate with mammalian Cdk 7, as well as to interact both physically and genetically with the budding yeast Cdk 7 homologue Kin 28. To study the function of <b>Hint</b> and to explore its possible role in modulating Cdk 7 activity in vivo, we have characterized the expression pattern of murine <b>Hint</b> and generated Hint-deficient (Hint/) mice. <b>Hint</b> was widely expressed during mouse development, with pronounced expression in several neuronal ganglia, epithelia, hearts, and testes from embryonic day 15 onward. Despite this widespread expression, disruption of <b>Hint</b> did not impair murine development. Moreover, Hint-deficient mice had a normal life span and were apparently healthy. Histological examination of tissues with high <b>Hint</b> expression in wild-type animals did not show signs of abnormal pathology in Hint/ mice. Functional redundancy within the HIT family was addressed by crossing Hint/ mice with mice lacking the related HIT protein, Fhit, and by assaying the expression levels of the HIT protein gene family members <b>Hint</b> 2 and <b>Hint</b> 3 in Hint/ and Hint/ tissues. Finally, Cdk 7 kinase activity and cell cycle kinetics were found to be comparable in wild-type and Hint/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that <b>Hint</b> may not be a key regulator of Cdk 7 activity.

40|$|Several {{reports have}} implicated {{a role for}} the {{histidine}} triad nucleotide-binding protein- 1 (<b>Hint</b> 1) in psychiatric disorders. We have studied the emotional behaviour of male <b>Hint</b> 1 knockout (<b>Hint</b> 1 KO) mice in a battery of tests and performed biochemical analyses on brain tissue. The behavioural analysis revealed that <b>Hint</b> 1 KO mice exhibit an increased emotionality phenotype compared to wildtype (WT) mice, while {{no significant differences in}} locomotion or general exploratory activity were noted. In the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, the <b>Hint</b> 1 KO animals entered the open arms of the apparatus less often than WT littermates. Similarly, in the dark-light box test, <b>Hint</b> 1 KO mice spent less time in the lit compartment and the number of entries were reduced, which further confirmed an increased anxiety-related behaviour. Moreover, the <b>Hint</b> 1 KO animals showed significantly more struggling and less floating behaviour in the forced swim test (FST), indicating an increased emotional arousal in aversive situations. <b>Hint</b> 1 is known as a protein kinase C (PKC) interacting protein. Western blot analysis showed that PKC gamma expression was elevated in <b>Hint</b> 1 KO compared to WT mice. Interestingly, PKC-gamma mRNA levels of the two groups did not show a significant difference, implying a post-transcriptional PKC-gamma regulation. In addition, PKC enzymatic activity was increased in <b>Hint</b> 1 KO compared to WT mice. In summary, our results indicate a role for <b>Hint</b> 1 and PKC gamma in modulating anxiety-related and stress-coping behaviour in mice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Distributed {{hash tables}} are {{increasingly}} being proposed as the core substrate for content delivery applications in the Internet, such as cooperative Web caches, Web index and search, and content delivery systems. The performance of these applications built on DHTs fundamentally depends {{on the effectiveness of}} request routing within the DHT. In this paper, we show how to use soft state to achieve routing performance that approaches the aggressive performance of one-hop schemes, but with an order of magnitude less overhead on average. We use three kinds of <b>hint</b> caches to improve routing latency: local <b>hint</b> caches, path <b>hint</b> caches, and global <b>hint</b> caches. Local <b>hint</b> caches use large successor lists to short cut final hops. Path <b>hint</b> caches store a moderate number of effective route entries gathered while performing lookups for other nodes. And global <b>hint</b> caches store direct routes to peers distributed across the ID space. Based upon our simulation results, we find that the combination of the <b>hint</b> caches significantly improves Chord routing performance: in a network of 4, 096 peers, the <b>hint</b> caches enable Chord to route requests with average latencies only 6 % more than algorithms that use complete routing tables with significantly less overhead. ...|$|R
