5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of psoriasis includes <b>dermatological</b> conditions similar in appearance such as discoid eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, pityriasis rosea (may {{be confused with}} guttate psoriasis), nail fungus (may be confused with nail psoriasis) or cutaneous T cell lymphoma (50% of individuals with this cancer are initially misdiagnosed with psoriasis). Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate <b>dermatological</b> disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying <b>dermatological</b> disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{served at}} Gallipoli with his unit until 2 December, {{when he was}} {{admitted}} to 5th Field Ambulance and evacuated from the peninsula suffering from jaundice. Admitted to 3rd Auxiliary Hospital, Heliopolis, he remained there until 11 December, when he was posted to a convalescent camp at Ras el Tin. He rejoined the 18th Battalion on 5 January 1916, which had been evacuated from the Gallipoli Peninsula on 20 December the previous year and posted to Egypt. On 4 February, Maxwell {{was admitted to the}} Australian <b>Dermatological</b> Hospital, Abbassia with venereal disease. He returned to his battalion four days before it embarked for France, and the Western Front on 18 March.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of <b>dermatological</b> condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather {{condition}}s. A <b>dermatological</b> condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E
5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, <b>dermatological,</b> and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

25|$|Spironolactone is not {{generally}} used in {{men for the}} treatment of androgen-dependent <b>dermatological</b> conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. This is evidenced by the usefulness of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender women.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dermatological</b> {{symptoms}} {{are caused by}} a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin.

25|$|Although {{spironolactone}} poses {{an important}} risk of hyperkalemia in the elderly, those with renal or cardiovascular disease, or those taking drugs or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, {{the rate of}} hyperkalemia in young women without such characteristics treated with spironolactone for <b>dermatological</b> conditions has been found not to differ from that of controls. This suggests that hyperkalemia is not a significant risk in such patients and that routine monitoring of circulating potassium levels is unnecessary in this population.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it seems}} that a certain {{effectiveness}} exists (and many studies have confirmed the effect), more statistically powerful studies are necessary to provide better evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} fumaric acid esters in treatment of psoriasis (e.g. more accurate in terms of the <b>dermatological</b> nosology of this autoimmune disease). Such studies should in the future help specify which psoriasis variants (in terms of the course, the immunological profile of the patient etc.) are suited to be treated with fumaric acid esters.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressant {{doses of}} doxepin {{are defined as}} 25 to 300mg/day, {{although}} are typically above 75mg/day. Antihistamine doses, including for <b>dermatological</b> uses and as a sedative/hypnotic for insomnia, {{are considered to be}} 3 to 25mg, although higher doses between 25 and 50mg and in some cases even up to 150mg have been used to treat insomnia. At low doses, below 25mg, doxepin is a pure antihistamine. At antidepressant doses of above 25mg, doxepin has significant antiadrenergic, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic effects, and these activities contribute to its side effects.|$|E
25|$|No studies examine topical {{salicylic}} acid in pregnancy. Oral {{salicylic acid}} is {{not associated with}} an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter <b>dermatological</b> agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|R.G. LeTourneau founded LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 on {{the site}} of the {{recently}} abandoned Harmon General Hospital, a World WarII hospital specialized in treating servicemen with neurological and <b>dermatological</b> issues. LeTourneau bought the site from the United States government with the help of Longview News-Journal publisher Carl Estes and other Longview community leaders for one dollar with the conditions that for the next decade, the U.S. government could reclaim the 156 acres (631,000 m²) and 220 buildings in the event of an emergency and no new construction or demolition could occur.|$|E
25|$|Another non-food protein reaction, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, {{originates}} after {{contact with}} poison ivy, eastern poison oak, western poison oak, or poison sumac. Urushiol, {{which is not}} itself a protein, acts as a hapten and chemically reacts with, binds to, and changes the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells. The immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body, causing a T-cell-mediated immune response. Of these poisonous plants, sumac is the most virulent. The resulting <b>dermatological</b> response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide was {{originally}} {{released in the}} Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) under the label of Contergan on October 1, 1957 by Chemie Grünenthal (now Grünenthal). The drug was primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, {{but it was also}} used as an antiemetic and sedative. The drug was banned in 1961 after its teratogenic properties were observed. The problems with thalidomide were, aside from the teratogenic side effects, both high incidence of other adverse reactions along with poor solubility in water and absorption from the intestines. Adverse reactions include peripheral neuropathy in large majority of patients, constipation, thromboembolism along with <b>dermatological</b> complications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dermatological</b> {{vascular}} laser (single wavelength) or intense {{pulsed light}} (broad spectrum) machines offer {{one of the}} treatments for rosacea, in particular the erythema (redness) of the skin. They use light to penetrate the epidermis to target the capillaries in the dermis layer of the skin. The light is absorbed by oxyhemoglobin, which heats up, causing the capillary walls to heat up to 70°C (158°F), damaging them, and causing them to be absorbed by the body's natural defense mechanism. With {{a sufficient number of}} treatments, this method may even eliminate the redness altogether, though additional periodic treatments will likely be necessary to remove newly formed capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. The AR antagonistic (i.e., antiandrogen) activity of spironolactone was first discovered and reported in 1969, which shortly followed the discovery in 1968 that gynecomastia, a frequent {{and by that}} time well-established side effect of spironolactone, is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. The drug started to be used as an antiandrogen, for instance in the treatment of hirsutism in women, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for <b>dermatological</b> indications in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} often {{attributed to}} fibromyalgia {{that may be}} due to a comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, genitourinary symptoms and interstitial cystitis, <b>dermatological</b> disorders, headaches, myoclonic twitches, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 20–30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{directly}} blocks androgen signaling {{and also}} {{acts as an}} inhibitor of androgen production. Due to the antiandrogenic effects that result from these actions, it is frequently used off-label to treat a variety of <b>dermatological</b> conditions in which androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play a role. Some of these uses include androgenic alopecia in men (either at low doses or as a topical formulation) and women, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and seborrhea in women. Spironolactone is {{the most commonly used}} drug in the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. Higher doses of spironolactone are not recommended in males due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Similarly, it is also commonly used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide and its immune-modulating analogs {{alter the}} {{production}} of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The analogs are believed to inhibit {{the production of}} TNF-α, where the analogs are up to 50.000 times more potent in vitro than the parent drug thalidomide. The mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in diminished amounts of this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted. This explains the effect of thalidomide when given to ENL patients, as they commonly have high levels of TNF-α in their blood and in <b>dermatological</b> lesions. In contrast, in vitro assay demonstrated that TNF-α is actually enhanced in T-cell activation, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were stimulated by anti-CD3 which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory dermatologic diseases.|$|E
25|$|The global {{rates of}} SLE are {{approximately}} 20–70 per 100,000 people. In females, {{the rate is}} highest between 45 and 64 years of age. The lowest overall rate exists in Iceland and Japan. The highest rates exist in the US and France. However, there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that SLE is less common in some countries compared to others, since there is significant environmental variability in these countries. For example, different countries receive different levels of sunlight, and exposure to UV rays affects <b>dermatological</b> symptoms of SLE. Certain studies hypothesize that a genetic connection exists between race and lupus which affects disease prevalence. If this is true, the racial composition of countries affects disease, and will cause the incidence in a country to change as the racial makeup changes. In order to understand if this is true, countries with largely homogenous and racially stable populations should be studied to better understand incidence. Rates of disease {{in the developing world}} are unclear.|$|E
25|$|Androgens like {{testosterone}} and DHT play {{a critical}} role in the pathogenesis of a number of <b>dermatological</b> conditions including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5α-reductase type II deficiency 5α-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and hirsutism as well as virilization (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions.|$|E
