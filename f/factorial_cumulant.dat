40|$|We discuss {{time-dependent}} <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulants</b> in interacting nano-scale systems. Recent theoretical {{work has}} shown that the full counting statistics of non-interacting electrons in a two-terminal conductor is always generalized binomial and the zeros of the generating function are consequently real and negative. However, as interactions are introduced in the transport, the zeros of the generating function may become complex. This has measurable consequences: With the zeros of the generating function moving away from the real-axis, the high-order <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulants</b> of the transport become oscillatory functions of time.

Recently {{it has been}} shown that the charge transport statistics for non-interacting electrons in a two-terminal system is always generalized binomial: it can be decomposed into independent single-particle events and the zeros of the generating function are real and negative. Here we investigate how the zeros of the generating function move into the complex plane due to interactions and demonstrate that the positions of the zeros can be detected using high-order <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulants.</b> As an illustrative example we consider electron transport through a Coulomb blockade quantum dot for which we show that the interactions on the quantum dot are clearly visible in the high-order <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulants.</b> Our findings are important for understanding the influence of interactions on counting statistics and the characterization in terms of zeros of the generating function provides us with a simple interpretation of recent experiments, where high-order statistics have been measured.

40|$|First, {{we present}} a concise {{glossary}} of formulas for composition of standard, cumulant, factorial, and <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulant</b> moments in superposition (compound) models, where final particles are created via independent emission from a collection of sources.

We discuss the composition laws for various types of moments via the generating-function methods and list the formulas for the unfolding of the unwanted fluctuations. Second, the technique {{is applied to the}} difference of the scaled multiplicities of two particle types. This allows us for a systematic derivation and a simple algebraic interpretation of the so-called strongly intensive fluctuation measures. With the help of the formalism we obtain several new strongly intensive measures involving higher-rank moments.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{for the analysis}} of fluorescence fluctuation experiments is introduced. Fluorescence cumulant analysis (FCA) exploits the factorial cumulants of the photon counts and resolves heterogeneous samples based on differences in brightness. A simple analytical model connects the cumulants of the photon counts with the brightness ɛ and the number of molecules N in the optical observation volume for each fluorescent species. To provide the tools for a rigorous error analysis of FCA, expressions for the variance of factorial cumulants are developed and tested. We compare theory with experiment by analyzing dye mixtures and simple fluorophore solutions with FCA. A comparison of FCA with photon-counting histogram (PCH) analysis, a related technique, shows that both methods give identical results within experimental uncertainty. Both FCA and PCH are restricted to data sampling times that are short compared to the diffusion time of molecules through the observation volume of the instrument. But FCA theory, in contrast to PCH, can be extended to treat arbitrary sampling times. Here, we derive analytical expressions for the second <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulant</b> {{as a function of the}} sampling time and demonstrate that the theory successfully models fluorescence fluctuation data...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} two-parameter discrete dispersion models, obtained by combining convolution with a factorial tilting operation, similar to exponential dispersion models which combine convolution and exponential tilting. The equidispersed Poisson model has {{a special place in}} this approach, whereas several overdispersed discrete distributions, such as the Neyman Type A, Pólya-Aeppli, negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian, turn out to be Poisson-Tweedie factorial dispersion models with power dispersion functions, analogous to ordinary Tweedie exponential dispersion models with power variance functions. Using the <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulant</b> generating function as tool, we {{introduce a}} dilation operation as a discrete analogue of scaling, generalizing binomial thinning. The Poisson-Tweedie factorial dispersion models are closed under dilation, which in turn leads to a Poisson-Tweedie asymptotic framework where Poisson-Tweedie models appear as dilation limits. This unifies many discrete convergence results and leads to Poisson and Hermite convergence results, similar to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, respectively. The dilation operator also leads to a duality transformation which in some cases transforms overdispersion into underdispersion and vice-versa. Many of the results have multivariate analogues, and in particular we consider a class of multivariate Poisson-Tweedie models, a multivariate notion of over- and underdispersion, and a multivariate zero-inflation index.

40|$|In great generality, {{the basic}} {{steady-state}} distributions in the BMAP/G/ 1 queue have asymptotically exponential tails. Here we develop asymptotic expansions for the asymptotic decay rates of these tail probabilities in powers of one minus the traffic intensity. The first term {{coincides with the}} decay rate of the exponential distribution arising in the standard heavy-traffic limit. The coefficients of these heavy-traffic expansions depend on the moments of the service-time distribution and the derivatives of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue d(z) of the BMAP matrix generating function D(z) at z = 1. We give recursive formulas for the derivatives d (k) (1). The asymptotic expansions {{provide the basis for}} efficiently computing the asymptotic decay rates as functions of the traffic intensity, i. e., the caudal characteristic curves. The asymptotic expansions also reveal what features of the model the asymptotic decay rates primarily depend upon. In particular, d(z) coincides with the limiting time-average of the <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulant</b> generating function (the logarithm of the generating function) of the arrival counting process, and the derivatives d (k) (1) coincide with the asymptotic factorial cumulants of the arrival counting process.
