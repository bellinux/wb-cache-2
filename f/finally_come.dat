5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – {{he had only}} appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made a return to touring problematic. They had shelved The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after having been upstaged by The Who.

5|$|The Komnenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the dynasty of the Angeloi, who oversaw perhaps the most crucial period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire. The next quarter of a century would see Constantinople fall to an invading force {{for the first time in}} its history, and the final loss of the empire's 'great power' status. However, with the death of Andronikos, the Komnenian dynasty, having lasted 104 years, had <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> to an end.|$|E

5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
5|$|When Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) are {{threatened}} with banishment by Michael after they constantly gaze happily on each other, Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) invites {{them to have}} lunch with her and her husband Bob Vance (Robert R.

Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E
5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all {{creature}}s have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E

5|$|With a {{large part}} of the French Empire's forces now {{entangled}} in the bloody Peninsular War, the Austrian Empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge the humiliating defeat of 1805 had <b>finally</b> <b>come.</b> The Austrians were looking to defeat France and regain their former influence in Italy and Germany. In early 1809, the Austrian war preparations were so intense that Napoleon was forced to leave Spain and head back to Paris to reorganise his main army in Germany. In spring, Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three heavy cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Reserve, placed this time under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières. As the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out, Nansouty's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war. As Napoleon then ordered a concentration of the army at Ratisbon, Nansouty's division was once again put under the command of Bessières and sent to serve with the Bavarian army. After his initial victories at Abensberg and Landshut, Napoleon concentrated the bulk of his army, including Nansouty's men, at Eckmühl, where Davout was waiting.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of French music, Les Troyens stands out as a grand opera that avoided the shallow glamour of Meyerbeer and Halévy, but {{therefore}} paid the price of long neglect. In our own time the opera has <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> {{to be seen as}} one of the greatest operas of the 19th century. There are several recordings of the work, and it is performed with increasing frequency.|$|E

The woman gives birth to twins, {{a boy and a girl}} and the story seems to have <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> full circle.

25|$|Since it was {{impractical}} {{to try to}} fit {{more than}} one or two extra guns in the constrained space available in the front of a single-engined aircraft's fuselage, this led to an increasing proportion of the armament being mounted in the wings, firing outside the arc of the propeller. There were in fact some advantages in dispensing with centrally mounted guns altogether. Nevertheless, the conclusive redundancy of synchronization gears did not <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> until the introduction of jet propulsion and the absence of a propeller for guns to be synchronized with.|$|E

The Umayyad military units from Syria within the garrison cut a deal with the Abbasids, saving their own lives by selling out the Umayyad units from Khorosan who were all put to death. After almost ninety years, Umayyad rule in Khorosan had <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> to an end.|$|E

25|$|After a few {{generations of}} {{existing}} within the Roman systems, the Jewish desire for independence did <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> to a head and resulted in the Bar Kobha revolt in 132-135 CE. In Jewish tradition, the temple was seen as indestructible and a physical manifestation {{of the power of}} God and God’s connection to the Jewish people. With its destruction, Jews resorted to the traditional explanation that they had transgressed and were being punished for their sins. The religious reaction to the destruction was evident through changes in halakhah (Jewish Law), midrashim, and 2 Baruch, all of which mention the agony of the temple’s destruction.|$|E

The Ottomans also contributed by the Ottoman invasion of the Balearic islands in 1558. The conflict would <b>finally</b> <b>come</b> to an end with the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) and the accidental death of Henry II that same year. The newfound peace between the European powers however created long-lasting disillusionment on the Ottoman side.|$|E
