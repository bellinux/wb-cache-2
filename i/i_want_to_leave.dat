500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close... I've never prepared like this in my life — for anything. [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> nothing on the table." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Gomez (WP) {{joined in}} the fray on 28 April, saying [...] "Singaporeans and Singapore are First World. There {{is no doubt in}} my mind, but it does not mean that the {{government}} and the PAP are First World. Don't claim credit. Singaporeans and Singapore are First World, and this is the message <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> with you today. You are First World, Singapore is First World but the PAP government is not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Environmental Golf Course Design is an {{integral}} part of Hurdzan's golf course design style, which has been appreciated by golf lovers through his design of the Widow's Walk Golf Course in Scituate, Massachusetts (opened in 1996) and the Harbor Links Golf Course in North Hempstead, New York. In Howard Richman's article Man with the plans in the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine of December 2012, Hurdzan explained his golf course design approach in these words: [...] "Form follows function — you'll hear that a lot around here," [...] Hurdzan says. [...] "The form is something that is a direct result of the function it has to serve. That is why I work so closely with superintendents. I ask them 'How are you going to mow that?' … 'How are you going to rake that?' … 'Are you going to be able to irrigate that?' I try to get a superintendent to think ahead. I don't want to leave them with problems. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> them with solutions. That's why I like to get them involved." ...|$|E
6000|$|All that Bashford {{could make}} out at first, as he listened, was: [...] "But <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Daisy! <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Daisy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it <b>to</b> yourself. I wanted--oh yes, if that's {{what you}} wish to ask me--to see what you'd do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vedder about [...] "Rearviewmirror":We {{start off}} with the music and it kinds of propels the lyrics. It {{made me feel like}} I was in a car, leaving something, a bad situation. There's an emotion there. I remembered all the times <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office there are going to be people who don't get along but you get on with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very, very difficult," [...] she continued, looking steadfastly at the ground. [...] "Only--I {{have come}} face to face--with {{something}} terrible, and wholly unexpected trouble. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Paris to-day--this very day. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it for ever." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{this is the}} {{practical}} lesson <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> with you, and all other working men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in a {{fever of}} curiosity {{about what is}} to come," [...] she said, when we all parted for the night; [...] "and, even if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you, <b>I</b> could not {{possibly}} go away now, without hearing the stories to the end." ...|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "print gocco" [...] {{is derived}} from the Japanese word gokko (ごっこ), loosely {{translated}} as make-believe play. Riso Kagaku president Noboru Hayama explained, [...] "We kids learned rules and knowledge through make-believe play. The spirit of play is an important cultural asset. I thought that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> [...] "play" [...] in the product's name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's as {{you look}} at it. When I {{realized}} what was going on <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and, <b>I</b> repeat, had the chief actress been an old hag or the usual sloven who plays this game, I would have fled; but she was as beautiful as a statue as she lay there, professedly in deep trance." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Daisy! <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Daisy! What shall I do? What shall I do? How was I to know? He didn't tell me. Nobody else ever kissed me. [NED stops curiously to listen. As {{he listens}} his face brightens.] I never dreamed a kiss {{could be so}} terrible [...] . until [...] . until he told me. He only told me this morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "With you I go!" [...] {{he cried}} in a {{contained}} voice. [...] "With you, who know {{so many of}} us. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this land--my people [...] . and him--there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word more," [...] said Miss Desborough; [...] "except," [...] she added,--checking {{her smile}} with a weary gesture,--"except that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this dreadful place at once! There! don't ask me any more!" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS BUILDER. My dear John, {{the fact}} that you had to do your utmost is quite enough. I feel {{continually}} humiliated in your house, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it--quite quietly, without fuss of any kind.|$|E

6000|$|Jake grinned as {{he promised}} and remarked {{as they went}} away: [...] "Makes a good dueña, doesn't he? You can trust Dick to guard {{anything}} he's told {{to take care of}}. In fact, if I'd a sister <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> in safe hands----" [...] He paused and laughed. [...] "But that's the trouble. It was my sister who told him to take care of me." ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{felt like}} criminals. When the rescue occurs I deny that I am {{a victim of}} trafficking, I said that I was not a victim and that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>I</b> had just been taken from where I was and was my only source of income. At that time I had four daughters and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> run and look for them and I felt guilty, I felt that I had {{committed}} a crime ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe you," [...] she murmured. [...] "I {{trust you}} altogether. I {{am going to}} take you entirely at your word. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Paris to-day. Will you lend me the money for my ticket to London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} now, sir, {{and it is}} hard to tell what may happen before we meet again. We have each got a {{difficult}} row to hoe, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you on the best terms I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you boys}} have rather {{got the best}} of us for a little while, so I'll give in with as good a grace as I can. I've come to hire you; get your trunk aboard right away. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> at twelve o'clock.' ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{exhibit of}} her watercolors about her {{childhood}} in Poston, [...] "Camp Days, 1942-1945," [...] was first {{shown at the}} Palos Verdes Art Center near her home, in 2009. It has since appeared at the Japanese American Museum of San Jose (in 2010-11). [...] She lectures on her life and work, saying [...] "This is what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> for my grandchildren, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> them <b>to</b> know what their parents and family went through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I haven't {{found out}} why he's here; that's the trouble," [...] Jim rejoined, and {{was silent for}} a few moments. [...] "However, perhaps you have put me on the track," [...] he went on. [...] "I was {{something}} of a fool when <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you behind. You have helped us all the time. But you haven't enough wood for morning; I'll go and chop some." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I was {{beginning}} to see more spinal injuries. You can damage your ankle or your knee and it will recover, but breaking your neck - that’s a different story. After my accident, I decided to quit while I could. I decided it wasn’t worth it any more. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> while <b>I</b> could still {{walk out of the}} studio. I love hiking and <b>I</b> didn’t <b>want</b> that <b>to</b> be taken from me for the sake of someone’s entertainment.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Eleanor, we {{understand}} each other, {{even if we}} do not agree," [...] said Carley. [...] "You leave the future of women to chance, to life, to materialism, not to their own conscious efforts. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it to free will and idealism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't want {{to destroy}} you, any more than I want to save you. There has been far too much talk about you, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you alone altogether.

6000|$|... "Can't you understand," [...] she {{interrupted}} impatiently, [...] "that it is {{just this}} very moment, this instant, that I want to get away?

6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be off, sir, for I was never happier in all my life, but I feel that I ought to go. It is likely enough that the ship may be short of middies, one or two may be away in prizes, {{and it will be}} strange if no one falls sick while they are lying in Port Royal. It would be ungrateful indeed if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you when you are all so wonderfully kind to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} told you, father, that <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Africa, still, there is mother to be considered. Her health {{is not what}} it was." ...|$|R
