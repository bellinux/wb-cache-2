5000|$|Use {{motion and}} {{formations}} {{to spread the}} defense out and anticipate what the <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. If one uses motion and the defensive back follows the motioning receiver, they are probably playing man coverage or blitzing. If no defensive back follows the motion receiver, then they are probably playing zone defense, although this tactic has partly faded {{with the addition of}} zone blitzes by defenses since the early 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Security {{has always}} been a major issue in computers, even more so with the modern systems and the {{exponentially}} growing use of the Internet. A well planned security policy and the use of antivirus software make a first line of defense. A second line of defense is needed since, as has been proven over the past few years, it {{is not a question of}} ???if??? the first line of <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be crossed by malicious code; it is a question of ???when???. This second line of defense consists of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The more efficient an IDS is at detecting real threats, the more robust the overall security of a computer system is. The Human Immune System provides a rich set of promising theories that could be used to help improve the efficiency of Intrusion Detection Systems. Self/Non-Self theory about how HIS detects foreign and malicious bodies is one area that I plan to explore and implement in an IDS application...|$|E

Joe Sullivan's relentless running combined with an improved passing game saw the Outlaws move the ball downfield and score their first touchdown of the season. The special teams got into the scoring act as well by blocking a punt followed by a scoop and recovery by rookie LB Mike Stankard.

He was represented by Attorney Mallory Book from She-Hulk's firm Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway. During the trial, Ms. Book argued that the Leader was not responsible for his actions since the gamma exposure forcibly changed his personality. To prove her point, Book compared She-Hulk to Jennifer Walters, revealing that Jennifer was much more promiscuous in her She-Hulk form. In {{the second day of}} the trial, Leader's humanoids arrived to rescue him. Instead of escaping, the Leader called off the attack, opting to see the trial to its conclusion, as he correctly predicted that his <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win.

Along the way, members of the different civil rights groups argued and collaborated, struggling to achieve their sometimes overlapping and differing goals.|$|R
