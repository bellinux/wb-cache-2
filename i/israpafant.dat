50|$|<b>Israpafant</b> (Y-24180) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a {{selective}} antagonist for the platelet-activating factor receptor, and was originally developed {{for the treatment of}} asthma. Its chemical structure is a thienotriazolodiazepine, closely related to the sedative benzodiazepine derivative etizolam. However <b>israpafant</b> binds far more tightly to the platelet-activating factor receptor, with an IC50 of 0.84nM for inhibiting PAF-induced human platelet aggregation (compared to etizolam's IC50 of 998nM at this target), while it binds only weakly to benzodiazepine receptors, with a Ki of 3680nM. <b>Israpafant</b> has been found to inhibit the activation of eosinophil cells, and consequently delays the development of immune responses. It has also been shown to have anti-nephrotoxic properties, and to mobilize calcium transport.|$|E
