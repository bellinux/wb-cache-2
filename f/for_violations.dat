5|$|Chānakya (c. 350–283 BC), {{also known}} as Kautilya, was adviser and prime {{minister}} to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340–293 BC). Kautilya suggested employing means such as seduction, secret use of weapons, and poison for political gain. He also urged detailed precautions against assassination—tasters for food and elaborate ways to detect poison. In addition, the death penalty <b>for</b> <b>violations</b> of royal decrees was frequently administered {{through the use of}} poison.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Reagan {{commuted}} the 18-year {{sentence of}} former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, a Democrat from Baton Rouge, {{to the time}} served <b>for</b> <b>violations</b> of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts. On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf.

5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} rights of the Indians to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians <b>for</b> <b>violations</b> of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E

5|$|Fleury {{missed the}} first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with {{teammates}} in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league <b>for</b> <b>violations</b> of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly <b>for</b> <b>violations</b> of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E
