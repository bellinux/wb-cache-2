5|$|In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál (chapter 57), the god Bragi {{explains}} {{the origin of}} poetry. Bragi says that it originated in the Æsir–Vanir War, when during the peace conference the Æsir and the Vanir formed a truce by all spitting into a vat. When they left, the gods decided that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> poured out, but rather kept {{as a symbol of}} their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered, and from his blood is made the Mead of Poetry.|$|E
5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} {{confused}} as to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual {{situation in which the}} family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E

5|$|The E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial {{audiobook}} {{was released}} by MCA on November 7, 1982—the same month as Jackson's acclaimed sixth studio album Thriller despite conditions given by Epic Records, Jackson's record label, that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> released until after Thriller. As a result, Epic took legal action against MCA which forced the album's withdrawal. During its curtailed release, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial reached number 82 on the UK Albums Chart. It was well-received critically and won Jackson a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children.|$|E

5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military and led them {{to find a new}} approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E

5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the approach of the German strike force and were successful in sinking two of the four submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone {{had the right to}} elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E

5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
5|$|By 2011, Serbian diplomats {{made several}} {{requests}} to the EU, asking it to pressure Croatia {{to resolve the}} dispute before Croatia's accession to the union {{out of fear that}} it might follow the Slovene example and stall Serbian accession similar to the impasse between Croatia and Slovenia over their border disputes and the subsequent blockade of the Croatian EU accession negotiation process. The request was denied by the EU. Croatian President Ivo Josipović said that the dispute was the most contentious issue of Croatia–Serbia relations but added that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> difficult to resolve. In 2012, Josipović stated that Croatia should not block Serbia's EU accession over the issue and suggested that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, which is considered to be an acceptable solution by both countries. In 2014, the Croatian ambassador to Serbia reiterated Josipović's stance from 2012. On the other hand, Zoran Milanović, the Prime Minister of Croatia, said that the resolution of the border dispute would be Croatia's condition placed before Serbia in its EU accession negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
