40|$|In 2004, Puerto Rico 2 ̆ 7 s new {{environmental}} legislation {{became part of}} the penal code with the intention of protecting the island nation 2 ̆ 7 s natural resources through criminal prosecution. However, the problem is a dearth of information about the prosecutions of <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> and the law enforcement agent 2 ̆ 7 s implementation practices. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the execution of the law and the few cases prosecuted. Lipsky and Hull and Hjern 2 ̆ 7 s theory of implementation were used to help answer the research question: What are the implementation procedures of law enforcement agents on Puerto Rico 2 ̆ 7 s <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> law, and what can be done to improve these practices? This qualitative case study included semistructured interviews with police officers and 3 district attorneys who were selected based on their involvement in <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> cases. Document analysis such as court files were analyzed to reveal the implementation practices of the law. Data were analyzed using NVivo software. Results revealed that police officers and prosecutors possess little knowledge of the <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> and this was not a barrier for execution of the law. However, court judges did not uniformly interpret the meaning of the law in the adjudication process which suggests that failure to successfully prosecute is due to lack of understanding of these <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> by legal counsel. Enhancing the training of police, prosecutors, and judges is needed to improve policing and implementation of the law.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} is {{a global}} problem. Humans need natural resources to survive and, as those resources are limited, humans’ use of these resources should respect a sustainable pace established by law. There are many approaches to addressing environmental degradation that do not honor the legal limitations {{and one of them}} is through criminal law. The question that is posed in this thesis is whether imprisonment, one of the most severe methods of punishment, is a suitable option to repress and prevent <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes.</b> This thesis is divided in three chapters. The first chapter discusses why <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> are relevant. It also explores why the conversation about imprisonment as a way of preventing and repressing those crimes is current and important. Through examples on illegal fishing, wildlife, and forest trade, chapter I demonstrates the harmful effects of environmental degradation – effects both in nature and throughout many levels of society (economy, health, governability, among others). The examples demonstrate why this topic should be addressed through criminal law, which allows the retribution and prevention of crime through one of the most serious means of punishment: imprisonment. However, particular examples from the United States of America and Brazil are presented to prove that imprisonment is not presently the norm when sentencing <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> in both countries. As imprisonment was the option adopted by both countries to address another relevant and urgent challenge (drug crimes), the question posed is whether this option should also be used for <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes.</b> The urgency on preventing environmental degradation proves that the subject is current; the fact that imprisonment was used previously when a similar challenge faced the authorities, without a clear success, demonstrates that the discussion about its use in <b>environmental</b> <b>crimes</b> is imperative...|$|R
