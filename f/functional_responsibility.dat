30|$|After this {{automated}} matching at {{the company}} level, we matched the most similar male executive of the five nearest neighbor companies to every female executive based on their respective <b>functional</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> An automated matching was not possible in this step due to the different nomenclature for the respective <b>functional</b> <b>responsibilities</b> across companies {{as well as the}} possibility of a manager’s responsibility for multiple functions at the same time. Furthermore, some companies are structured by division and others by function. In this step, we allow that a female manager who is in our sample for more than 1  year can have different male matches over the year. In this way, we can avoid matching biases in our results due to changes in <b>functional</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of the female or the male manager from 1  year to the other. We then collected the same data for the male control group as for the female executives in the first step.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{business}} unit (BU) controllers balance their dual roles of providing information for both local decision-making (local responsibility) and corporate control (<b>functional</b> <b>responsibility).</b> The existing {{literature suggests that}} organizations can {{improve the quality of}} financial reporting and internal controls by increasing the emphasis on the <b>functional</b> <b>responsibility</b> of BU controllers. In this study, we rely on prior literature and insights from field interviews to argue that such an increase also leads to role ambiguity and conflict, which in turn can lead to an increased tolerance of data misreporting. We test our predictions using survey responses of 134 BU controllers. As predicted, we find that the emphasis on the <b>functional</b> <b>responsibility</b> of BU controllers is positively associated with role conflict and role ambiguity, both of which are related to data misreporting at the BU level...|$|E

40|$|Abstract, Local self-governments at gmina (municipality) level {{have become}} primary {{components}} of Poland's democratization. The establishment of self-governing units in 1990 {{was the most}} important achievement of the first period of transformation and a very promising sign for potential political and economic changes in the future. An attitude to local self-governments presented after 1993 by postcommunist parties that came back to power, have not allowed these governments to build the infrastructure essential for the efficient operation of the jurisdiction. It also was impossible to establish the next level of self-governance—/wiwVrf (county) —designed as a complementary one to gminas. The second phase of self-government reform has been halted. There is still no clarification of the <b>functional</b> <b>responsibilities</b> between different levels of government and no authorization of revenue sources corresponding to <b>functional</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> These facts have a negative influence on local transformation processes including those of an economic nature. That is why public administration reform is perceived as a very necessary step to continue democratic reforms and to make regions and counties or municipalities well managed and administered. However, reorganisation of central government or the introduction of new levels of self-governing units will not automatically promote local transformation. In order to do s...|$|R
