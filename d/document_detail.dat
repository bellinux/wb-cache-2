40|$|The {{supersonic}} {{method of}} cleaning glassware is {{an outgrowth of}} the fact that it has been heretofore impossible to manually clean ground glass and quartz joints because the activity became lodged in the small pores of the ground surfaces. It has been theorized that the nature of the forces binding polonium to the glass is similar to that of the chemical bond but are less intense. The problem then becomes one of finding a force greater than this binding energy, capable of freeing the activity from the glass. This has been accomplished by using frequencies of 100 cycles to 20 kc at a power output from 2 to 20 watts, passing through a citric acid solution (pH- 2) into which the contaminated article is placed. The optimum results, using a tank with the dimensions 7 in. {times} 7 in. {times} 7 in. and 3 liters of solution, has been found at 200 cycles or harmonics of 200 cycles. Citric acid was used because {{of the fact that it}} forms a soluble complex with polonium. The frequencies used have been kept within the sonic range until enough data has been obtained and correlated to warrant the design and construction of more costly types of projectors (i. e., quartz crystals) and their allied components.

30|$|Due {{to strict}} guidelines, which stent {{manufacturers}} must adhere to, {{there is an}} obligation for them to provide performance evidence for manufactured scaffolds. This, in turn, assists with further development of devices {{as well as a}} wider spread of device approval and clinical use. There are various techniques and guidelines, which can be employed to mechanical tests of stents, including three-point bending (ASTM F 2606; ASTM 2014 a), radial force testing (ASTM F 3067; and a specific set of guidelines for testing of absorbable stents (ASTM F 3067)(ASTM 2013). The last <b>document</b> <b>detail</b> securement of a vascular stent onto a delivery system, three-point bending of the whole device and a method to measure its intrinsic recoil. However, these methods do not assess evolution of mechanical performance of stents with degradation. It is worthwhile to mention that testing of the bulk material may not provide mechanical data suitable for devices due to changes caused by manufacturing and processing conditions when this bulk material is transformed into a tubular scaffold with fine details at a scale of 100  μm. According to the literature there are no guidelines for measurements of the mechanical performance of polymeric scaffolds with degradation and analysis of their local mechanical properties (i.e., for varying locations across the scaffold). It is also important to note that in-vitro testing is not representative of the in-vivo environment, though it does allow for more comprehensive data for computational studies. In the subsequent sections, methods used by different research groups to characterize stent performance mechanically by taking into consideration the effect of manufacturing processes on material properties are reviewed. Experimental conditions in-vitro are also discussed, along with degradation behaviour of PLLA.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2013. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Prof. Uwe R. Kortshagen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 146 pages. Silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) {{have become an}} important class of materials {{in the fields of}} photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, lighting, and medicine. Impurities within SiNCs dramatically alter the electrical and optical properties of the host material, whether the impurity is intentionally added in an attempt to manipulate properties, or is inherent to the material and its natural state. Despite such remarkable changes, impurity incorporation within SiNCs remains poorly understood, since concepts applied to understanding impurities in bulk materials may not completely translate to nanomaterials. Understanding the effect of SiNC impurities requires new technologies to produce materials suitable for study combined with new insights to expound the differences in the nanoscale physics. Nonthermal plasma-assisted gas-phase synthesis provides an excellent route to producing and investigating impurities within SiNCs due to the unique chemical reaction environment of the plasma. The robustness of such a technique allows for the production of very pure SiNCs or SiNCs with added impurities simply by adding different chemicals to the plasma. The chapters in this document focus on the effect that different impurities have on the properties of SiNCs. Chapter 2 focuses on heavily P-doped SiNCs exhibiting the first known observation of a unique electrical and optical property known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) within free-standing SiNCs. Chapter 3 explains the synthesis of B- and P-doped SiGeNC alloys and their deposition into thin films for thermoelectric applications. Chapter 4 highlights research which uses P-doped SiNCs to form emitter layers for pn-junction type solar cells, including device fabrication and optical characterization. Chapter 5 examines inherent impurities in the form of dangling bond defects which may be responsible for the quenching of SiNC photoluminescence, and their evolution during the process of air-ambient oxidation. Several appendices {{at the end of the}} <b>document</b> <b>detail</b> some of the fabrication processes used throughout this work, as well as brief reports of some side projects that may be of interest to researchers intent on studying SiNC synthesis and deposition technologies...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{realisation}} in the IR community that the interaction of searchers with information is an indispensable component of the IR process. As a result, issues relating to interactive IR have been extensively investigated in the last decade. This research has been performed in the context of unstructured documents or {{in the context of the}} loosely-defined structure encountered in web pages. XML documents, on the other hand, define a different context, by offering the possibility of navigating within the structure of a single document, or of following links to other documents. Relatively little work has been carried out to study user interaction with IR systems that make use of the additional features offered by XML documents. As part of the INEX initiative for the evaluation of XML retrieval, the INEX interactive track has focused on interactive XML retrieval since 2004. Here user friendly exposition to various features of XML documents is provided and some new features are designed and implemented to enable searchers to have access to their desired information in an efficient manner. In this study interaction entails three levels: query formulation, inspecting result list, and examining the detail. For query formulation, suggesting related terms is a conventional method to assist searchers. Here we investigate the related terms derived from two different co-occurrence units: elements and documents. In addition, contextual aspect is added to facilitate the searchers for appropriate selection of terms. Results showed the usefulness of suggesting related terms and some what acceptance of the contextual related tool. For inspecting the result list, classic document retrieval systems such as web search engines retrieve whole documents, and leave it to the searchers to collect their required information from possibly a lengthy text. In contrast, element retrieval aims at a focused view of information by pointing to the optimal access points of the document. A number of strategies have been investigated for presenting result lists. For examining the detail of a document, traditionally the complete document is presented to a searcher and here again the searcher has to put in effort to reach its required information. We investigated the use of additional support such as a table of contents along with <b>document</b> <b>detail.</b> In addition, we also investigated graphical representations of documents depicting its structure and granularity of retrieved elements along with their estimated relevance. Here the table of contents was found to be a very useful features for examining details. In order to conduct the analysis of searcher's interaction, a visualisation technique based on Tree Map was developed. It depicts the search interaction with element retrieval system. A number of browsing strategies has been identified with the help of this tool. The value of element retrieval for searchers and comparison between two focused approaches such as element and passage retrieval system was also evaluated. The study suggests that searchers find elements useful for their tasks and they locate a lot of the relevant information in specific elements rather than full documents. Sections, in particular, appear to be helpful. In order to provide user-specific support, the system needs feedback from searchers, who in turn, are very reluctant to give this information explicitly. Therefore, we investigated to what extent the different features can be used as relevance predictors. Of the five features regarded, primarily the reading time is a useful relevance predictor. Overall, relevance predictors for structured documents seem to be much weaker than for the case of atomic documents...|$|E
