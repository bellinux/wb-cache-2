40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the report written for the European Parliament's Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Programme, {{as a response to the}} Commission's 2000 Food Safety White Paper. The White Paper made a series of major proposals, including a plan to set up a new <b>European</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Authority</b> (EFA). This paper summarises the comments and proposals on the background and technical arguments in the White Paper. The key issues in food-related public health, which the EFA will have to address, are reviewed. The role of science and technological information in policy-making on food and health matters is explored, as is the core challenge of how to link nutrition and food safety to give a consumer-friendly public health policy for Europe. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{beef and}} cattle sector {{has a long}} history of {{identifying}} and tracking animals to establish rights of ownership and to control the spread of animal disease. Meat producers around the world have also developed traceability systems to improve product flow and to limit quality/safety failures within the meat-processing sector. Recent developments within many government organizations around the world require comprehensive food traceability records. Many private food purchasing organizations such as fast-food companies are also requiring more accountability in the meat-processing supply chain. These new rules are motivating meat producers to form a bridge that links animal meat and traceability systems and establish tracking in the supply chain from rancher to retailer to consumer. 1 Benefits to the Adoption of Traceability Systems Recent events, especially the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalophy (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease) in Europe and the U. S., and the recently introduced country of origin labeling requirements issued by many governments, have focused attention on traceability capabilities in the global meat sector. The 2002 U. S. Farm Bill, the development of a <b>European</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Authority</b> and the &quot;Beef Labeling Regulations &quot; now being enforced in Australia and Japan are just some of the factors motivatin...|$|E
40|$|The European Union's {{new food}} {{regulatory}} regime {{can be understood}} as a political, rather than science-based {{solution to the problem of}} recurrent food crises that have threatened the foundations of the single market. The failure of first, mutual trust and subsequently, its remedy, comitology, led to calls for an agency solution. The question of whether to invest an agency with the three powers of risk assessment, communication, and management {{can be understood as}} a struggle to define the role of the scientist in the management of regulatory policy. Scientists base their recommendations on probabilities; politicians are accountable to a public that expects government to guarantee zero risk. The outcome, a <b>European</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Authority</b> (EFA), preserves the management function and the Rapid Alert System within the Commission. EFA's success will rest on the harmonization of food law in Member States and the creation of a network between the EFA and Member State food agencies. Satisfaction of these goals, in turn, depends upon transparency, open communication, and willingness to cooperate. An unintended consequence of the new regulatory regime for food may be to strengthen corporate food producers and accelerate food homogeneity within Europe. These processes carry their own set of problems regarding interest group behavior, unconventional political behavior, and voter mobilization.

What 2 ̆ 7 s the Beef? examines European food safety regulation at the national, European, and international levels as a case of "contested governance" a syndrome of policymaking and political dispute in which not only policy outcomes but also the fundamental legitimacy of existing institutional arrangements are challenged. The discussions of European food safety regulation in What 2 ̆ 7 s the Beef? open into consideration of broader issues, including the growing importance of multilevel regulation (and the possibility of disagreements among different levels of authority), the future of European integration, discontent over trade globalization, the politicization of risk assessment and regulatory science, the regulation of biotechnology, the shifting balance {{between public and private}} regulation, agricultural protectionism, and the "transatlantic divide. " After addressing the historical, social, and economic context of European food safety regulation, the book examines national efforts at food safety reform in France, Britain, and Germany and such regional efforts as the creation of the <b>European</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Authority.</b> The book also looks at the international dimensions of European food safety regulation, discussing the conflicts between EU safety rules and World Trade Organization rulings that occur because EU rules are more risk averse ("precautionary") than those of its trading partners, including the United States...|$|E
