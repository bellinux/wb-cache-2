5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5|$|William Kempe, the parson of Ditton, was {{sued for}} £80 in 1534 for being absent from his parish and {{for taking a}} stipend <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> prayers for {{the souls of the}} dead (which was {{prohibited}} by a statute of 1529). Although Kempe admitted being absent, he claimed that he was chaplain to baron John Zouche and thus entitled to receive two benefices.|$|E
5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E

25|$|He {{was accused}} of being 'a vexer of two parishes with continual suits of law'. This may mean that he {{resisted}} the demands of visitation articles in reference to ceremonial observance.

It is plain {{that there was no}} evidence to substantiate the charge.|$|E
25|$|Stoiber, as a {{minister}} {{in the state of}} Bavaria, was widely known for advocating a {{reduction in the number of}} asylum seekers Germany accepts, something that prompted critics to label him xenophobic, anti-Turkish and anti-Islam. In the late 1990s he criticized the incoming Chancellor Schröder <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> that he would work hard in the interest of Germans and people living in Germany. Stoiber's remarks drew heavy criticism in the press.|$|E

25|$|The media's main {{criticism}} of Reagan centered on his gaffes. When Carter kicked-off his general election campaign in Tuscumbia, Reagan—referring to the Southern US as a whole—claimed that Carter had begun his {{campaign in the}} birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. In doing so, Reagan seemed to insinuate that the KKK represented the South, which caused many Southern governors to denounce Reagan's remarks. Additionally, Reagan was widely ridiculed by Democrats <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> that trees caused pollution; he later said that he meant only certain types of pollution and his remarks had been misquoted.|$|E
