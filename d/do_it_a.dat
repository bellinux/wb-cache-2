He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} The Decision, James {{claimed that}} there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. During the 2010–11 season, he expressed some regret, admitting, [...] " [...] probably would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision." [...] Before the 2011–12 season, he relented, [...] "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tilt Ya Head Back" [...] {{was written}} by Nelly, Dorian Moore, Tegemold Newton, Curtis Mayfield and {{produced}} by Doe Mo' Beats. The producer of the song confirmed that it was originally meant for Nelly and Britney Spears, however Spears' record label Jive Records rejected the idea because they thought the song was [...] "too urban", even though Spears wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> snippet of Britney's version was premiered at Singaporean radio Gold 90.5 the 22nd March 2016. Following Spears, Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera were approached to appear on [...] "Tilt Ya Head Back", and the final choice was Aguilera.|$|E

Swedien said of Jackson recording the song, that, [...] "I tried {{all sorts of things}} with Michael – for instance, he would sing the main vocal part and we'd double it one time and then I'd ask him to step away from the mic and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> third time and that really changed the acoustics in the room so it gave Michael's vocals a unique character … We recorded some of those background vocals in the shower stall at Westlake." ...|$|E

Everybody knows that the Jews rule the whole damned world, so you cannot fight their combined power. You need to watch your step." [...] A number of The Odinists readers wrote letters to the magazine expressing disapproval of what they perceived as the editors' support of Nazism, to which Christensen publicly responded that such accusations were [...] "the cheapest of all shots that can be aimed against anyone who finds something positive to say about... National Socialism... or who merely desires some degree of objectivity in dealing with this grossly maligned movement." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{considerable}} controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth {{would be found}} in Madagascar with a long proboscis matching the nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale. An anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review of October 1862 by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that [...] "We know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another." [...] He considered Darwin's explanations the [...] "most unsatisfactory conjectures", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism. Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was [...] "quite opposed" [...] to Darwin's views, [...] "he praises the Orchids in such an enthusiastic way that he will <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> good turn". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article [...] "smashing" [...] Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E

500|$|More than 40 {{years after}} the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said [...] "They'd decided to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was {{chairman}} of the umpires selection committee." [...] Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler—the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen—instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled [...] Rowan's words at the pre-match function: [...] "It's {{going to be a very}} interesting game".|$|E
500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Rowland {{continued}} to live in Canberra, consulting part-time for French arms concern Ofema. In late 1980 he was recommended {{by the government of}} Premier Neville Wran to serve as the next Governor of New South Wales, replacing Sir Roden Cutler. Rowland admitted {{that he did not have}} [...] "the faintest idea" [...] why he was chosen, and thought that [...] "there must be a lot of people who could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> lot better than I could". He saw the role as the monarch's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide [...] "a valuable link with an older part of the world". Wran, for his part, was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for vice-regal office because [...] "they knew how to take orders". Rowland was duly appointed by Queen ElizabethII on 20January 1981. Upon taking office, he declared that he wished to be seen as a [...] "man of the people". To this end, he opened Government House to the public on a more frequent basis, and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

"When {{they asked}} me to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I was out of my mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post.

So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{unexpectedly}} limited {{releases of}} [...] "Dear Angie" [...] and Maybe Tomorrow, Griffiths complained about The Iveys' handling by Apple {{in an interview}} for the Disc & Music Echo magazine, saying: [...] "We do feel a bit neglected. We keep writing songs for a new single and submitting them to Apple, but they keep sending them back, saying they're not good enough". McCartney read the interview and offered the song [...] "Come and Get It" [...] to the group, although he had written the song for the soundtrack of The Magic Christian. Before the recording on Saturday, 2 August 1969, Griffiths remembered the whole group being so excited they couldn't sleep. Producing the track in under one hour, McCartney made sure that they copied his own demo note-for-note: [...] "They were a young band ... they said, 'We want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> bit different, wanna get our own thing in'. I said No, this has gotta be exactly like this, [...] 'cos this is the hit'." ...|$|E
