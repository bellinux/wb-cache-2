5|$|Bob {{attempts}} to rehire his children the next day, {{explaining that he}} now realizes {{that he is a}} better parent than his distant, alcoholic father, only to discover that they have found other work. A customer of the farm delivery service later walks into the restaurant looking for Tina, leaving behind a box of blueberries. Bob and his wife Linda (John Roberts) discover marijuana hidden in the box and set off to find the children, with Mickey leading them to the farm's location. As they arrive and take back the children, a SWAT team– led by the aforementioned customer, who is actually an undercover DEA agent– shows up and arrests the hippies. The scene cuts to Wagstaff School, where Louise has narrated the episode's events to her class for <b>her</b> <b>report</b> on how she spent her summer vacation.|$|E
25|$|The {{third was}} {{research}} into working {{conditions in the}} Sicilian sulphur mines. There was a concern about child labour and the general health of the miners: {{many of whom were}} physically unfit for military service. Jessie made extensive personal tours and investigations of the mines, both above and below ground, and published <b>her</b> <b>report,</b> Le miniere di Zolfo in Sicilia (The Sulphur Mines in Sicily) in 1894.|$|E
25|$|In <b>her</b> <b>report</b> of 18 December 2001 the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or {{arbitrary}} executions, Ms. Asma Jahangir, wrote: While {{the number}} of cases of abductions or “disappearances” have decreased over the last few years, {{at the time of the}} Special Rapporteur’s visit such incidents still did occur, particularly in the remote areas of south-east Turkey, and there was deep concern at the recent disappearance of two persons.|$|E

25|$|These {{events were}} preceded by an exposé in the Daily Dispatch {{newspaper}} over the allegedly appalling {{conditions at the}} hospital. Madlala-Routledge first {{paid a visit to}} the hospital, which had not been scheduled nor communicated to the hospital, and after <b>her</b> <b>report,</b> Msimang subsequently paid a scheduled and announced visit to the hospital. Finally, writing in his weekly column, president Thabo Mbeki had defended Msimang's report on Frere Hospital and downplayed the Daily Dispatchs investigations as inflammatory, effectively dismissing the deputy minister's views.|$|E
25|$|The Gosches {{immediately}} {{contacted the}} West Des Moines police department, and reported Johnny's disappearance. Noreen, in her public statements and her book Why Johnny Can't Come Home, {{has been critical}} of what she perceives as a slow reaction time from authorities, and of the policy {{at the time that}} Gosch could not be classified as a missing person until 72 hours had passed. By her estimation, the police did not arrive to take <b>her</b> <b>report</b> for a full 45 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year in August 2003, there were concerns raised over {{the custody of}} Karyn's son Christopher, who had been adopted by Mary Slover, Karyn's ex-sister-in-law. Authorities argued that Mary had {{been aware of the}} murder and could have potentially helped in concealing the crime. A judge later ruled that Mary was unfit as an adoptive parent and that she should not retain custody. Mary contested the ruling, which she claimed influenced a case worker to change <b>her</b> <b>report,</b> which initially contained a recommendation that Christopher be returned to Mary. Despite this, Mary officially lost custody of Christopher in October 2003.|$|E

25|$|An {{investigation}} by Israel Harel {{reported in the}} Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that video footage aired by Dayan on her program on Channel 2 showing soldiers dancing in delight that she attributed to the event was actually footage from a Rosh Hashana (Jewish New Year) party. Similarly, photos of soldiers celebrating after firing their weapons and attributed to Captain R. and his platoon were actually taken of another platoon after target practice in a non-combat situation. Given her role in investigating the incident, it is contended that Dayan knew the footage was unrelated but represented it differently in order to sensationalize <b>her</b> <b>report.</b> After the final court ruling, Dayan was featured in satirical news show Latma.|$|E
25|$|As a suffragist (as {{opposed to}} a suffragette), she took a {{moderate}} line, but was a tireless campaigner. She concentrated much of her energy on the struggle to improve women's opportunities for higher education and in 1875 co-founded Newnham College, Cambridge. She later {{became president of the}} National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (the NUWSS), a position she held from 1897 until 1919. In July 1901 she was appointed to lead the British government's commission to South Africa to investigate conditions in the concentration camps that had been created there {{in the wake of the}} Second Boer War. <b>Her</b> <b>report</b> corroborated what the campaigner Emily Hobhouse had said about conditions in the camps.|$|E
25|$|Gardner wrote {{papers that}} were {{primarily}} taxonomic, strategraphic or paleoecologic. Her published papers dealt mostly with coastal plain geology. Julia {{took part in}} fieldwork all over the world, including rougher locations such as those throughout Mexico. She spent weeks visiting and spending time in places that other geographers may not have dared visit. <b>Her</b> <b>report</b> on the “Mollusca from the Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Virginia and North Carolina” (Professional Paper 199-A), published in 1943, built partially {{on the work of}} Dr. W.

25|$|After ten days, {{the asylum}} {{released}} Bly at The Worlds behest. <b>Her</b> <b>report,</b> later published in book form as Ten Days in a Mad-House, caused a sensation {{and brought her}} lasting fame. While physicians and staff worked to explain how she had deceived so many professionals, a grand jury launched its own investigation into conditions at the asylum, inviting Bly to assist. The jury's report recommended the changes she had proposed. The grand jury's recommendation for increased funds for care of the insane prompted an $850,000 increase in {{the budget of the}} Department of Public Charities and Corrections. The grand jury also made sure that future examinations were more thorough so that only the seriously ill went to the asylum.|$|E
25|$|The RUC {{was renamed}} and {{reformed}} as the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001 under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. The RUC {{has been accused}} by republicans and Irish nationalists of one-sided policing and discrimination, as well as collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Conversely, it was praised {{as one of the}} most professional policing operations in the world by British security forces. The allegations regarding collusion prompted several inquiries, the most recent of which was published by Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan. The report identified police, CID and Special Branch collusion with loyalist terrorists under 31 separate headings, in <b>her</b> <b>report</b> on the murder of Raymond McCord and other matters, but no member of the RUC has been charged or convicted of any criminal acts as a result of these inquiries. Ombudsman Dame Nuala O'Loan stated in her conclusions that there was no reason to believe the findings of the investigation were isolated incidents.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July, {{after several}} BWCC inmates and staff {{expressed}} concerns about Anna's welfare, the prison's psychologist recommended that {{she have a}} psychiatric evaluation, so that her mental health could be assessed. One week later, on 6 August, a BWCC officer also asked for an evaluation, to determine whether Anna could {{be placed in the}} community, rather than remain in the prison. Eventually, on 10 August, the prison psychiatrist recommended that she be taken to a hospital for a full assessment, to determine her mental health. <b>Her</b> <b>report</b> noted that Anna's behaviour was unusual, and she had poor hygiene and would behave inappropriately towards the guards, particularly the male ones. Anna was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane on 20 August, where doctors spent six days assessing her. She was returned to BWCC on 26 August, after doctors failed to diagnose her schizophrenia.|$|E

At {{the other end of the}} spectrum is the case of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich who narrated her messages to Klemens Brentano, who transcribed them in his own words. Another case was that of Sister Consolata Betrone who would repeat <b>her</b> <b>reported</b> conversations with Jesus to her confessor Father Lorenzo Sales.
