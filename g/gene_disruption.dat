40|$|AbstractAnalysis of the {{interactions}} between genes by systematic <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> and <b>gene</b> overexpressions is an important topic in molecular biology. This paper analyses the problem of identifying a genetic network from {{the data obtained by}} multiple <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> and overexpressions in regard to the number of experiments and the complexity of experiments. An experiment consists of simultaneous <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> and overexpressions and the complexity of an experiment is the number of genes disrupted or overexpressed. We define a genetic network as a boolean network and show a series of algorithms which describe methods for identifying the underlying genetic network by such experiments. Some lower bounds on the number of experiments required for the identification are also proved for some cases...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFour {{putative}} yeast transcription factors (Hal 6 – 9 p) {{have been}} identified which upon overexpression in multicopy plasmids increase sodium and lithium tolerance. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by increased expression of the Ena 1 p Na+/Li+ extrusion pump.

Sample sequencing from 43 Mutator stocks and the W 22 inbred line identified 676 non-redundant insertions, and {{only a small fraction}} of the flanking sequences showed significant similarity to maize repetitive sequences. We further designed and tested 79 arbitrary primers to identify 12 primers that amplify all Mutator insertions within a DNA sample at 3. 1 -fold redundancy.

50|$|Noncoding DNA {{separate}} {{genes from}} each other with long gaps, so mutation in one gene or part of a chromosome, for example deletion or insertion, {{does not have a}} frameshift effect on the whole chromosome. When genome complexity is relatively high, like in the case of human genome, not only between different genes, but also inside many genes, there are gaps of introns to protect the entire coding segment and minimise the changes caused by mutation. Non-coding DNA may perhaps serve to decrease the probability of <b>gene</b> <b>disruption</b> during chromosomal crossover.|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{bases of}} learning and memory are being revealed today with {{a wide array of}} molecular approaches, most of which entail the analysis of dysfunction produced by <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions.</b> This perspective derives both from early "genetic dissections" of learning in mutant Drosophila by Seymour Benzer and colleagues and from earlier behavior-genetic analyses {{of learning and}} in Diptera by Jerry Hirsh and coworkers. Three quantitative-genetic insights derived from these latter studies serve as guiding principles for the former. First, interacting polygenes underlie complex traits. Consequently, learning/memory defects associated with single-gene mutants can be quantified accurately only in equilibrated, heterogeneous genetic backgrounds. Second, complex behavioral responses will be composed of genetically distinct functional components. Thus, genetic dissection of complex traits into specific biobehavioral properties is likely. Finally, <b>disruptions</b> of <b>genes</b> involved with learning/memory are likely to have pleiotropic effects. As a result, task-relevant sensorimotor responses required for normal learning must be assessed carefully to interpret performance in learning/memory experiments. In addition, more specific conclusions will be obtained from reverse-genetic experiments, in which <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> are restricted in time and/or space...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{which has}} the potential to allow repeated use of the same selectable marker to create <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> in Candida albicans has been developed. In this approach, originally described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the selectable marker is flanked by direct repeats. Mitotic recombination between these repeats leads to elimination of the selectable marker. A module in which the GAL 1 gene is flanked by direct repeats of the bacterial CAT gene was constructed and used to disrupt one copy of the URA 3 gene in a gal 1 mutant. Gal(-) revertants were selected by plating on 2 -deoxy-D-galactose (2 DOG). The frequency of 2 DOG-resistant colonies recovered was 20 times higher than that obtained with a similar construct not flanked by direct repeats. Of these, 20 % had lost the GAL 1 gene by recombination between the direct repeats. The GAL 1 gene was used again to disrupt the remaining wild-type copy of the URA 3 gene of one of these gal 1 isolates, resulting in a stable ura 3 mutant. This technique should be generally applicable to derive homozygous <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> in this diploid organism...|$|R

However, the receptor of this neuropeptide has been already cloned. The receptor belongs to the G-protein coupled receptors, and its activation leads to an increase of intracellular Calcium levels. According {{to the effects of}} <b>gene</b> <b>disruption</b> in the pheromone synthesis of Bombykol (the main pheromone component of the silk moth Bombyx mori and the corn earworm moth), the increase in intracellular calcium levels turns to activate different key enzymes of the last steps of pheromone biosynthesis.|$|E

50|$|Pikachurin was {{initially}} identified in a microarray analysis of gene expression {{profiles of the}} retinas of wild-type and Otx2 knockout mice. A RT-PCR {{analysis was used to}} confirm that Otx2 regulates the expression of pikachurin, it was known because there was an absence of expression of pikachurin in the Otx2 mice retina, so it indicates that Otx2 regulates pikachurin. The localization of pikachurin to synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse was determined using fluorescent antibodies. Tissue targeting of <b>gene</b> <b>disruption</b> of pikachurin was used to determine that this protein is necessary for proper synaptic signal transmission and visual function. α-dystroglycan was shown to interact with pikachurin through immunoprecipitation.|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} infect over 1 {{billion people}} worldwide and cause {{some of the}} most common neglected tropical diseases. Despite their prevalence, our understanding of the biology of parasitic nematodes has been limited by the lack of tools for genetic intervention. In particular, it has not yet been possible to generate targeted <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> and mutant phenotypes in any parasitic nematode. Here, we report the development of a method for introducing CRISPR-Cas 9 -mediated <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. We disrupted the S. stercoralis twitchin gene unc- 22, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. Ss-unc- 22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a repair template was provided. Omission of a repair template resulted in deletions at the target locus. Ss-unc- 22 mutations were heritable; we passed Ss-unc- 22 mutants through a host and successfully recovered mutant progeny. Using a similar approach, we also disrupted the unc- 22 gene of the rat-parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti. Our results demonstrate the applicability of CRISPR-Cas 9 to parasitic nematodes, and thereby enable future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites...|$|R
40|$|SCL <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> are {{the most}} common {{chromosomal}} abnormality associated with the development of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Such disruptions can be the result of t(1; 14) and t(1; 7) translocations, as well as a cytogenetically undetectable interstitial deletion of chromosome 1. We present here a case of T cell ALL with a t(1; 3) (p 34;p 21) translocation that also disrupts the SCL locus and leads to dysregulated SCL gene expression. This translocation, similar to previously reported SCL <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions,</b> appears to have been mediated, at least in part, by the V(D) J recombinase complex, since cryptic heptamer recognition sequences, as well as nontemplated N region nucleotide addition, are present at the breakpoints. The t(1; 3) also disrupts a region on chromosome 3 characterized by alternating purine and pyrimidine residues, which can form a Z-DNA structure, reported to be prone to recombination events. A previously undescribed, evolutionarily conserved transcript unit is detected within 8 kb of the breakpoint on chromosome 3. This report extends the spectrum of recognized SCL translocations associated with T cell ALL, and underscores the contention that dysregulated SCL expression may be a causal event in T cell ALL...|$|R

50|$|PIKfyve {{mutations}} affecting {{one of the}} two PIKFYVE alleles {{are found}} in 8 out of 10 families with Francois-Neetens corneal fleck dystrophy. Disruption of both PIKFYVE alleles in the mouse is lethal at the stage of pre-implantation embryo. PIKfyve’s role in pathogen invasion is deduced by evidence from cell studies implicating PIKfyve activity in HIV and Salmonella replication. A link of PIKfyve with type 2 diabetes is inferred by the observations that PIKfyve perturbation inhibits insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Concordantly, mice with selective Pikfyve <b>gene</b> <b>disruption</b> in skeletal muscle, the tissue mainly responsible for the decrease of postprandial blood sugar, exhibit systemic insulin resistance; glucose intolerance; hyperinsulinemia; and increased adiposity, i.e. symptoms, typical for human prediabetes.|$|E

There is some controversy as to whether deletion of Ogg1 actually leads to increased 8-oxo-dG levels: the HPLC-EC assay suggests up to 6 fold higher levels of 8-oxo-dG in nuclear DNA and 20-fold higher in mitochondrial DNA whereas the fappy-glycosylase assay indicates no change.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} long noted that gram-negative {{bacteria}} produce outer membrane vesicles, and recent data demonstrate that vesicles released by pathogenic strains can transmit virulence factors to host cells. However, {{the mechanism of}} vesicle release has remained undetermined. This genetic study addresses whether these structures are merely a result of membrane instability or are formed by a more directed process. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and physiological basis of vesiculation, we conducted a screen in Escherichia coli to identify <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> that caused vesicle over- or underproduction. Only a few low-vesiculation mutants and no null mutants were recovered, suggesting that vesiculation may be a fundamental characteristic of gram-negative bacterial growth. <b>Gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> were identified that caused differences in vesicle production ranging from a 5 -fold decrease to a 200 -fold increase relative to wild-type levels. These disruptions included loci governing outer membrane components and peptidoglycan synthesis {{as well as the}} σE cell envelope stress response. Mutations causing vesicle overproduction did not result in upregulation of the ompC gene encoding a major outer membrane protein. Detergent sensitivity, leakiness, and growth characteristics of the novel vesiculation mutant strains did not correlate with vesiculation levels, demonstrating that vesicle production is not predictive of envelope instability...|$|R

Knockout rat models can also complement existing transgenic mouse models. Comparing mouse and rat mutants can facilitate the distinction between rodent-specific and general mammalian phenotypes.|$|R

This study aimed to investigate E 2 gene integrity of HPV 16 and HPV 58 viruses isolated from infected women with cervical lesions. Forty-two HPV 16 - and 31 HPV 58 -positive samples were analysed. E 2 integrity was assumed when all fragments covering the E 2 gene were amplified with specific polymerase chain reaction primers. Overall, in 59 % of the samples, at least one fragment was not amplified in HPV 16 - (57 %) and HPV 58 -positive samples (61 %). Samples from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions had the highest frequency of E 2 <b>gene</b> <b>disruptions</b> (73 %), followed by samples from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (63 %) and, finally, samples from invasive cervical cancer (35 %). Association between the integrity status of the E 2 gene, and lesion grade was assessed by the chi-squared test applied to the combined set of viruses (p = 0. 6555) or to populations of the same virus type (HPV 58, p = 0. 3101; HPV 16, p = 0. 3024).
