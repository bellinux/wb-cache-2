5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> {{frustrating}} {{at first but}} eventually we {{found a way to}} communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} was praised by civil libertarians. Former President of the Victorial Council of Civil Liberties, Robert Richter QC, {{said that the}} {{decision was}} important [...] "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case {{is said to be}} a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable." [...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive...

And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [...] because the three of us, it was almost like being on stage.

500|$|In an April 2007 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Fey revealed {{that she was}} once called [...] "the c word" [...] by one of her writers. In discussion of this, she said, [...] "That C-word thing actually did happen. I was furious, and I had this weird reaction where I kept saying, 'You can't say that! My parents love me!'" [...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It was a little bit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> based {{on the experience of}} having someone call you that and not knowing how to deal with it.". [...] In December 2015 Fey revealed that the writer who called her [...] "the c word" [...] was Colin Quinn.|$|E

2500|$|D'Antoni {{was named}} Western Conference Coach of the Month after the Lakers went 7–1 in April.

Their defense also improved to 13th during that span, finishing the season 18th at 103.6 points per 100 possessions. The Lakers expected starting five of Bryant, Nash, Howard, Gasol and World Peace started together just seven times all season and without registering a win. [...] "The Lakers didn't help things by making the coaching change and putting (D'Antoni) in that situation, which {{he was glad to}} take.

2500|$|Born Marilyn Judith Grove in Auckland, New Zealand, Casali {{left home}} aged {{nineteen}} to travel around Australia, Europe and the United States. In 1967 {{she moved to}} Los Angeles where she met and began a relationship with Roberto Alfredo Vincenzo Casali, an Italian computer engineer, at a ski-club where they were both taking lessons. Casali had been drawing cartoons of humorous incidents on the ski slopes, which Roberto encouraged, and she soon began adding cartoon illustrations to messages which she left for him. The very first drawing was created as a [...] "signature" [...] to a note, and represented Casali herself with freckles, large eyes and long fair hair. She said later of these cartoons: [...] "I began making little drawings to express how I felt... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> like keeping a diary that described how my feelings had grown." [...] In the September 1981 Cartoonist Profiles magazine she said: [...] "I drew a round blob of {{a girl who was}} supposed to be me, the one who was feeling all these fantastic things. Then I added a blob of a boy who was the reason I was feeling these things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind about what he was going to do. Which, honestly, I felt [...] totally inappropriate. How many chances do you get to play for the Super Bowl? Tell them to get back to you in a couple of days. I'm not saying it was disrespectful to me, but it was in terms of the overall commitment to the team." [...] Parcells even refused to travel back with the rest of the Patriots after the game, and was eventually hired by the rival Jets.|$|E

60|$|After we {{had been}} in our new home about a fortnight, I wrote to tell Ada where we were. I had not done so before, because I did not wish her {{to come down to}} see us till we were quite straight, and had {{everything}} very nice: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of pride, perhaps, but so it was. I had received a letter from her a week after dear papa's death, condoling with us, and asking Polly and me to go and stay with her for a while, when we felt equal to it, until our future plans were settled; and I had written back, thanking her, and telling her I would let her know when things were arranged. After that, I had not sent my usual monthly letter to her, but, as I had written myself to Percy, that did not matter. The day before I wrote, I had received a letter from her, which was forwarded from Canterbury, asking what had become of me, and this I now answered by giving our present address, and saying how pleased we should be to see her.|$|E
