40|$|The {{magnitudes}} of both void {{swelling and}} radiation-induced segregation (RIS) in iron-chromium-nickel alloys {{are dependent on}} bulk alloy composition. Because the diffusivity <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>via</b> the vacancy flux is slow relative to chromium, nickel enriches and chromium depletes at void surfaces during irradiation. This local composition change reduces the subsequent vacancy flux to the void, thereby reducing void swelling. In this work, the resistance to swelling from major element segregation is estimated using diffusivities derived from grain boundary segregation measurements in irradiated iron-chromium-nickel alloys. The resistance to void swelling in iron- and nickel-base alloys correlates with the segregation and both are functions of bulk alloy composition.

40|$|Electroless Ni–P alloys are {{produced}} as coatings {{on a broad}} variety of substrates. They exhibit a corrosion resistance that is superior to pure nickel but do not form a NiO oxide film (passive film) as pure nickel does. Despite {{the fact that many}} mechanisms have been proposed to explain this superior corrosion behaviour, no consensus has yet been reached. In this work electrochemical and XPS surface analytical methods have been combined in order to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying the corrosion resistance of electroless deposited Ni–P alloys with phosphorus content between 18 and 22 at. %. The anodic polarization curves in acidic and neutral solutions confirm a broad current plateau followed by a region with increasing current density. During potentiostatic polarization in the plateau region the current decays according to a power law with exponent ca. − 0. 5 indicating diffusion-limited dissolution <b>of</b> <b>nickel.</b> XPS/XAES measurements performed after potentiostatic polarization show that phosphorus is present in three different chemical environments. Based on the Auger parameter concept and on the chemical state plot, the three phosphorus states were assigned to phosphorus in the bulk alloy, phosphates and an intermediate phosphorus compound attributed to elemental phosphorus. Angle-resolved XPS analysis has shown that the elemental phosphorus is enriched at the interface between the alloy and the outermost surface in contact with the corrosive solution. These results suggest the following conclusions: the high corrosion resistance of electroless deposited Ni–P alloys can be explained by a strong enrichment of elemental phosphorus at the interface which limits the dissolution <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>via</b> a diffusion mechanism. A complementary explanation––not yet advanced––for the high corrosion resistance may lie in the electronic state <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> in the Ni–P alloys...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} an increasing demand for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with desirable characteristics {{one has to}} understand the origin of helicity of their structures. Here, through in situ microscopy we demonstrate that the nucleation of a carbon nanotube is initiated by {{the formation of the}} carbon cap. Nucleation begins with the formation of a graphene embryo that is bound between opposite step-edges on the nickel catalyst surface. The embryo grows larger as the step-edges migrate along the surface, leading to the formation of a curved carbon cap when the steps flow across the edges of adjacent facets. Further motion of the steps away from the catalyst tip with attached rims of the carbon cap generates the wall of the nanotube. Density Functional Theory calculations bring further insight into the process, showing that step flow occurs by surface self diffusion <b>of</b> the <b>nickel</b> atoms <b>via</b> a step-edge attachment-detachment mechanism. Since the fact that cap forms first in the sequence of stages involved in nanotube growth, we suggest that it originates the helicity of the nanotube. Therefore, the angular distribution of catalyst facets could be exploited as a new parameter for controlling the curvature of the cap and, presumably, the helicity of the nanotube.

40|$|Nickel {{stands out}} as {{the main cause of}} contact allergy in both {{children}} and adults, which has given rise to concern and the introduction of regulations by official bodies. Today´s youths are frequently exposed to body piercing and orthodontic treatment. Changes in youth lifestyle practices are also likely to influence nickel exposure and thus, the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy. However, against patient and parental concern regarding nickel exposure to orthodontic appliances, often evoked by allergies following piercing, stand results from studies indicating that early orthodontic appliance treatment may reduce, rather than increase, prevalence <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy; a finding that has been suggested to result from tolerance induction by early exposure to <b>nickel</b> <b>via</b> the oral route. The objective of the present thesis was to investigate the association between nickel allergy and exposure to different orthodontic appliances and lifestyle, in particular piercing, as well as to study nickel release from orthodontic appliances into the oral cavity. Furthermore, one objective was to establish baseline prevalence data <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy in a Swedish adolescent population. Data was generated from a cross-sectional survey, in which about 6000 youths completed a questionnaire and almost 4500 of these were patch-tested for contact allergy. Information on exposure to orthodontic appliances was verified by dental records, whilst nickel content in saliva and dental biofilm was measured in a clinical study. Questionnaire data demonstrated a reduced risk <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy when orthodontic treatment preceded piercing (OR 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 8) and similar results were found for data verified from dental records, however statistical significance was lost when adjusting for background factors (OR 0. 6, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 1. 0). Exposure to full fixed appliances with NiTi-containing alloys, as well as a pooled ‘high nickel-releasing’ appliance group prior to piercing correlated with a significantly reduced risk <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy and a trend towards a reduced risk with exposure duration. Nickel could also be found in significantly higher concentrations from dental plaque samples, but not saliva samples, in orthodontic patients who were well into treatment compared to patients who had not been exposed to orthodontic appliances. The effect was not found to be due to differences in estimated dietary nickel intake between the two groups. Significantly more girls than boys (13. 3 % versus 2. 5 %) were found to be patch-test positive to nickel. Positive nickel tests were also most prevalent in occupational programmes and least prevalent in natural science programmes, indicating differences in lifestyle and exposure to nickel. Dropout from testing was handled using a missing-value analysis. This internal validation showed that our results overestimated the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy to a minor degree. More girls than boys reported piercing, vegetarian/vegan diet, and smoking practices, whereas an interesting shift in tattooing prevalence was observed with a larger proportion of girls reporting this practice compared to boys. Sex, number of piercings, smoking and orthodontic appliance treatment prior to piercing were found to influence weighted risk estimates <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy. To conclude, although orthodontic patients are exposed to nickel intraorally, we found no increased risk of sensitising adolescents to nickel by the use of oral orthodontic appliances. On the contrary, early orthodontic treatment preceding piercing reduced the risk <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> allergy by a factor of 1. 5 - 2. 0. This reduced risk appears to be associated with estimated <b>nickel</b> release <b>of</b> the appliance and duration of treatment, in all supporting a hypothesised induction of immunological tolerance <b>via</b> oral administration <b>of</b> <b>nickel.</b> Our study also showed a strong association between lifestyle and nickel allergy. Although there have been changes in lifestyle over time, as indicated by the strong shift in tattooing practices, no large change in nickel allergy prevalence was found compared with previous Swedish data. Our data will serve as a baseline for future studies of the effect <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> exposure regulations, such as the Nickel Directive, and for studies of lifestyle changes and their effects on nickel allergy...|$|R

The nanoparticles were studied via magnetometry and microscopy to identify the super-paramagnetic and nuclear volume of the particles, respectively. The magnetisation studies demonstrate that the widely used Langevin function based method of particle sizing does not reflect the total nuclear volume, and a surface correction term is introduced based on the low temperature, high applied field magnetisation. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed analysis, the study of a series of industrially-viable precipitation catalysts are reported. The catalysts are studied via x-ray diffraction (XRD) and gas adsorption to establish comparable values of crystallite diameter. The values of crystallite diameter determined from the magnetic analysis are demonstrated to be consistent with the range of sizes determined from the XRD and gas adsorption studies, with additional sensitivity to the polydispersity of the crystallites. During the study of the precipitation catalysts, the magnetic volume was demonstrated to be reduced from the nuclear volume. This behaviour was also confirmed via small angle neutron scattering experiments, which demonstrated a magnetic scattering volume reduced from the nuclear by = 1 nm, on the order previously reported for nano-ferromagnetic materials. Through these studies we have established the methods for determining the surface correction term to magnetic granulometry studies.

50|$|Nickel {{pig iron}} (NPI) {{is a low}} grade ferronickel invented in China as a cheaper {{alternative}} to pure nickel {{for the production of}} stainless steel. The production process <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> pig iron utilizes laterite <b>nickel</b> ores instead <b>of</b> pure <b>nickel</b> sold on the world market. The alternative was developed as a response to high price <b>of</b> pure <b>nickel.</b> The estimated cost of a ton <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> pig iron ranges between 16.500 and 18.000 USD in 2012, and this cheaper substitute for pure nickel influences the price <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> on the world market by lowering the demand in certain applications, the most important being the production of stainless steel, representing about two thirds <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> use.|$|R
50|$|The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest {{producers}} <b>of</b> <b>nickel,</b> {{as reported}} by the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons <b>of</b> <b>nickel.</b> About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources <b>of</b> <b>nickel</b> are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
