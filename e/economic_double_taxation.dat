In order to provide certainty to investors, investments in shares made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause as per 2005 Protocol. Further, a two-year transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019 has been provided during which capital gains on shares will be taxed in source country at half of normal tax rate, subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause. The Third Protocol also inserts provisions to facilitate relieving of <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> in transfer pricing cases.

5000|$|In Case E-1/04 Fokus Bank, the EFTA Court {{declared}} the Norwegian imputation tax credit system {{relating to the}} taxation of dividends was in breach of Article 40 EEA. Under the Norwegian Corporate Tax Act, dividends paid out by Norwegian companies to shareholders were taxed {{in the hands of}} the distributing company and again as general income {{in the hands of the}} shareholder. To avoid this so-called <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> shareholders resident in Norway were granted an imputation tax credit to the effect that dividends were only taxed in the company’s hand. However, this credit was not granted to shareholders non-resident in Norway. Instead, they were taxed by way of a withholding tax for which the distributing company was liable. In making this differentiation, the Norwegian legislation was based on the assumption that non-resident shareholders were reimbursed in their respective home state. The Court held that the distribution and receipt of dividends constitutes movement of capital within the meaning of Article 40 EEA. That Contracting Parties are, within the framework of bilateral agreements concluded in order to prevent double taxation, at liberty to determine the connecting factors for the purposes of allocating powers of taxation as between themselves does not mean that in the exercise of the power of taxation so allocated, a Contracting Party may disregard EEA law. The Court found furthermore that Article 40 EEA confers a right upon individuals and economic operators to market access. The Norwegian legislation at issue was held to restrict that right, since differential treatment may have the effect of deterring non-resident shareholders from investing capital in Norwegian companies and of impeding Norwegian companies from raising capital outside Norway. Moreover, the differential treatment constituted discrimination. Possible tax advantages in the home state could not offset the restriction and discrimination resulting from tax legislation in Norway. Attempts of the Norwegian government to justify the violation of Article 40 EEA were rejected. The Court considered shareholders resident and non-resident in Norway to be in an objectively comparable situation, referring to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-319/02 Manninen''''. The Court did not accept cohesion of the international tax system as a justification since permitting derogations from the fundamental principle of free movement of capital laid down in Article 40 EEA on the grounds of safeguarding the cohesion of the international tax system would amount to giving bilateral tax agreements preference over EEA law. A Contracting Party cannot therefore make the rights conferred by Article 40 EEA subject to the contents of a bilateral agreement concluded with another Contracting Party.|$|E

40|$|The South African fiscal {{legislators have}} found it {{necessary}} to introduce anti-avoidance legislation which governs controlled foreign companies in order to counteract schemes devised by taxpayers where companies are established outside South Africa for the purpose of diverting income from the South African fiscal net. Whilst the enforcement of such legislation does have merit in that the intention behind the introduction of such domestic legislation is to prevent the erosion of the South African tax base, it is submitted that this does pose a problem from an international perspective. The objective of this treatise is to conduct a critical analysis of how compatible the South African fiscal legislation which governs controlled foreign companies is with the provisions of the double taxation agreement as prescribed in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention (which was published in July 2010). In addition, the aim {{of this study is to}} deduce whether the purpose of the double taxation agreement is not only the avoidance of juridical double taxation but also that it addresses the avoidance of <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation.</b> This will assist in determining whether domestic controlled foreign company legislation (as embodied in section 9 D of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962) conflicts with the purpose of the double taxation agreement. By conducting an extensive research study and by depicting a certain scenario which addresses the issue at hand, the following is concluded: The tax treatment of the business profits generated by a controlled foreign company resident in a State outside South Africa and which have been generated from active business operating activities, is held to be in agreement with the provisions of the double taxation agreement. By contrast, the tax treatment of the controlled foreign company’s passive income in the form of interest income, is found not to correlate with the aforesaid agreement. As will be demonstrated in the chapters that follow, the controlled foreign company’s interest income is subjected to <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> in terms of the scenario depicted in this treatise. This means that such income is taxed twice in the hands of two different taxpayers in two different States. As a result of this it is submitted that the following problem arises: Because section 9 D of the Income Tax Act causes <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> to occur (as illustrated in the previous paragraphs) and owing to the fact that the purpose of the double taxation agreement is the avoidance of <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> it can be shown that the section 9 D domestic legislation conflicts with the terms of the double taxation agreement. This conflict is considered to be an area of concern because a contravention of the purpose of the double taxation agreement is regarded as a breach of the Contracting States’ international obligations in terms of the aforesaid agreement. It is further submitted that paragraph 23 of the OECD Commentary on article 1 and paragraph 14 of the OECD Commentary on article 7 are incorrect when they express the sentiment that domestic controlled foreign company legislation does not conflict with the provisions of the double taxation agreement. It is proposed that this be corrected to state the contrary...|$|E

The advent of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> is due to the manner in which criteria are applied to the taxation of income or wealth. Generally, the situations in which <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> (<b>economic</b> or legal) appears, are determined {{by the fact that the}} Governments of various States apply to taxes on income made in the Territories concerned by subjects of taxation local and foreign, and on the other subject to taxes and the income from its own citizens abroad.

I {{hope that this}} paper will lead to further discussion of practical aspects of Transfer Pricing Methodologies for Bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangements. The opinions expressed herein are my personal views {{and do not necessarily}} reflect organizational or state positions. It is desirable for multinational enterprises to minimize the risk of <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> arising as a result of transfer pricing adjustments.

There is some possibility that Bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangements ('BAPA'), where Transfer Pricing Methodologies ('TPMs') are mainly based on profit methods, can be a reliable way of resolving these disputes. Looking to the past, actual results of BAPA between Japan and the United States may be viewed as a successful model whereby tax authorities have reached agreement in a considerable number of cases of various types related to both inbound and outbound transactions. In this paper, which is intended to be highly supportive of the BAPA, I enumerate the practical points at issue, after taking note of world currents in transfer pricing taxation.

40|$|PhDThis work aims {{to explore}} the main distortionary {{features}} arising from the <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> of distributed profits in three member states of the European Union: Portugal, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The problem of <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> of distributed profits has been studied by public finance economists, but so far no comprehensive comparative analysis {{has been carried out}} at the juridical level. It is the purpose of this work to study the tax implications deriving from taxing distributed profits twice, but from the legal point of view. To achieve this aim both domestic laws and international tax treaties of the three member states selected are analysed in an interactive and pluridimensional way. Inward and outward investment is covered and dividend income tax burdens are ascertained by taking into account those taxes that directly influence the effective dividend income tax rate. The results are exposed and critically analysed {{in the light of the}} tax principles of neutrality and efficiency, the European Union principle of non-discrimination, and the objectives of fair distribution of revenue between member states, simplicity and prevention of tax evasion. The research findings indicate that well accepted tax principles, such as the principle of worldwide taxation and the principle of vertical equity, operate less efficiently in their roles within the overall tax system. Instead, the source principle is gaining momentum with simplicity or neutrality aims prevailing over distributional criteria. Accordingly, from a theoretical point of view, the principle of capital import neutrality is of growing importance as compared with the principle of capital export neutrality. It is also suggested that in the three states surveyed, unless an exemption system is in place, problems remain with the balance between debt financing and equity financing, complicated by the more favourably treatment given to capital gains. Neither classical or imputation systems provide a satisfactory answer to these problems...|$|E

40|$|Double {{taxation}} {{is known}} as restricting {{the free flow of}} capital and accordingly results in a limited access of the internal market. Although, not many Member States have entered into double taxation conventions in order to avoid juridical double taxation of inheritances. The question then arises whether this failure to eliminate juridical double taxation is restricting the free movement of capital. The ECJ‟s case law regarding inheritance taxes are very varying. In its initial case law, the ECJ stated that national measures which reduce the value of the inheritance are in breach of EC law. Even measures which could restrict investors in one Member State from investing in other Member States are considered to be a breach of EC law. The ECJ also stated that discriminating situations could not be justified with the argument that these situations arise due to the co-existence of national tax systems. Given these facts, it seems like juridical double taxation is likely to constitute a breach of EC law. The ECJ has however only concentrated on which effect the national provisions in a single Member State may have and have not given concern to which effect these provisions may have in connection with the tax provisions in other Member States. The author believes that the Court takes this approach because of a respect of the Member States fiscal sovereignty. This respect also shows in the Block case. In this case the ECJ made it clear that juridical double taxation, caused by the co-existence of national tax systems, is not considered to be a breach of EC law. The ECJ also stated that when the Member States develops their tax systems, {{due to the lack of}} harmonised Community rules regarding direct taxation, they are not obliged to adapt to the tax systems of other Member States in order to avoid double taxation. The ECJ also made it clear that the citizens are not guaranteed a neutral tax situation when transferring their place of residence. In this thesis a comparison has also been made to judgements where the ECJ considers <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> to be a breach of EC law. After studying all these cases it seems like the ECJ considers juridical double taxation to be an undesirable restriction of the free flow of capital. But even though the ECJ encourages the Member States to enter into double taxation conventions, there are no consequences when the Member States fail to do this. The difference between cases regarding <b>economic</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> and juridical double taxation could be that the ECJ considers it to be too far reaching to judge juridical double taxation as a breach of EC law and do not want to regulate how this restriction shall be avoided and thereby take the role of the Community legislator or breach the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States. The author believes that it would be more beneficial for the internal market if juridical double taxation was avoided and that it would not be harmful if the ECJ would give the Member States some incentives for entering into double taxation conventions in order to eliminate or alleviate situations where juridical double taxation occurs...|$|E

An important conclusion reached was that as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties represents customary international law and as such forms part of South African law, the principles contained in the treaty should be taken into account when interpreting South African legislation (including <b>Double</b> <b>Taxation</b> Agreements). The final conclusion of the research was that <b>Double</b> <b>Taxation</b> Agreements have a dual nature – forming part of domestic legislation and being classified as international agreements. The provisions of the <b>Double</b> <b>Taxation</b> Agreement should be taken as overriding any conflicting legislation in the Income Tax Act...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{phenomenon}} of international <b>double</b> <b>taxation.</b> Collection of taxes is a manifestation of state sovereignty. Each state lays down its own rules determining which persons and economic facts {{will be subject to}} taxation. As a result a situation may occur that more states claim the right to impose a tax of comparable nature on the same fact and entity. Such situations ordinarily occur in connection with cross-border labour mobility, international investments, and in many other cases. <b>Double</b> <b>taxation</b> is a burden for taxpayers and represents a barrier to international movement of persons and capital. States may provide relief to taxpayers by unilateral measures. However, a more effective instrument for the avoidance of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> is international cooperation. The 20 th century saw the development of international treaties on avoidance of <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> which have a privileged position in the tax law. These treaties not only serve as a relief to taxpayers, but are also the basis of comprehensive cooperation in tax collection. Therefore, this thesis focuses on <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> treaties, which are currently the most effective tool for resolving a conflict of tax laws of different states. The thesis firstly deals with the treaties on avoidance of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> in general [...] ...|$|R
