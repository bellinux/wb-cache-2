40|$|Within the {{reported}} project coat-combined-bodies made by some steels, machined in several manner were investigated {{before and after}} some coating processes to identify the morphology of the surface and the thickness and fraction-surface of the coats. The life time of pretreated tools were determined in cutting of steels and aluminum and also in cold forming. In some cases surface cracks and cracks between coat and substrat have been detected without any correlation to the finishing operations. This has {{to be seen as}} a great risk for the adhesion of the coat and also the properties of coated parts. It was found, that life time of drills up to a cutting-speed of 50 m/min can be increased significantly by a surface <b>jet</b> <b>lapping</b> before coating. The life time range of jet lapped coated punches for cold forming operations is smaller than only grinded coated ones. (orig.)

50|$|The {{race was}} {{scheduled}} for February 26 but heavy rain forced NASCAR officials to delay it until the next day. When it got underway at 7:02 p.m. EST, pole-sitter Carl Edwards was immediately passed by Biffle before the first turn. Biffle maintained this position until he was passed by David Ragan on lap eleven. Denny Hamlin took over the lead after a second caution period and led the race for 57 laps, during which Biffle also led. Matt Kenseth assumed the first place on lap 146 and maintained it until a seventh caution period twelve laps later. The race was stopped for one hour and fifty-seven minutes after Juan Pablo Montoya hit a <b>jet</b> dryer on <b>lap</b> 160, causing fuel to seep onto the track and catch fire. Kenseth regained the first position at the lap 166 restart, and maintained it during the remaining thirty-four laps to win the race.|$|R
50|$|Typically, the Pope flies on a {{chartered}} Alitalia {{fixed-wing aircraft}} when travelling {{to or from}} more distant destinations. Traditional protocol dictates that a Pope flies to a country he is visiting on a chartered Alitalia jet and to return on a jet belonging to a flag carrier from the visited nation; this may vary when he is touring multiple nations. When Pope John Paul II visited South America in May 1988, he came to Paraguay from Peru in an AeroPerú DC-8, but left Asunción International Airport back to Europe in a transcontinental Alitalia Boeing 747, which was brought in just hours before his farewell ceremony. Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas' longest-range aircraft {{at the time were}} Boeing 707-320Bs, which had to stop in Dakar, Senegal to refuel. However, he politely travelled within the country in a <b>LAP</b> <b>jet,</b> which incidentally carried the distinguished visitor's coat of arms in the forward fuselage as courtesy. Pope Benedict XVI also returned to Rome from Brazil on Alitalia.|$|R
