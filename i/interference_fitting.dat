Two types of stress analysis have been undertaken for a finite width rectangular plate of D 6 ac steel containing an elongated hole. Firstly, plate stress distributions due to <b>interference</b> <b>fitting</b> obtained from elastic two dimensional finite element analyses were compared to those measured experimentally using strain gauges and thermoelasticity. Secondly, two-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element analyses were undertaken to quantify the effect on critical plate stresses due to enhancement by combined cold expansion with <b>interference</b> <b>fitting,</b> in the presence of subsequent representative cold proof test loading and a sample spectrum loading. The predicted stresses for the elastic analysis cases agreed well with the experimental results, which also demonstrated the suitability of a proposed tapered plug/sleeve design to achieve effective <b>interference</b> <b>fitting</b> of an elongated hole. Overall, enhancement through combined cold expansion and <b>interference</b> <b>fitting</b> was considered to be significantly better than <b>interference</b> <b>fitting</b> alone.

40|$|Cold-expansion {{testing of}} D 6 ac plates {{containing}} an elongated (non-circular) hole, of 2 : 1 aspect ratio, has been undertaken using an AMRL designed interference fit plug/sleeve arrangement. The aim {{has been to}} determine the practical viability of the process as an option for addressing the cracking problem at the non-circular fuel flow vent hole number 13 in the wing pivot fitting of the F- 111 C aircraft in service with the RAAF. The key issue being that in the open literature, only cold expansion to circular holes has been reported, and application to non-circular holes would represent a significant new development. In the testing, three nominally identical plate specimens were cold expanded, with sleeves of two different material types (ie high strength tool steel (D 2) and stainless steel) being assessed. Strain gauge readings around the elongated hole boundary were recorded at various stages of the cold-expansion process, {{as well as some}} typical full-field qualitative photoelastic strain distributions. In all cases nominal expansion levels greater than 2. 5 % were achieved, along with maximum peak strains of more than 10, 000 micro-strain and maximum residual strains greater than 1600 micro-strain. These results indicate that highly effective cold expansion has been achieved. It was also demonstrated that subsequent to cold expansion, effective <b>interference</b> <b>fitting</b> could be achieved, without the need for post cold-expansion machining. The particular advantages available by using stainless steel sleeves have been identified, and an improved surface finish at the holes in the plug is also recommended. Fatigue testing of the existing design, (with minor amendments) is now proposed to confirm its anticipated suitability as an effective fatigue life extension option...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of efficient and reliable methods {{for the design}} and analysis of fastened structural connections and bonded joints {{is among the most}} important and most challenging problems in aerospace applications because these connections are common sites of failure initiation and there is a complicated nonlinear interaction between the fasteners and the connected plates. Realistic representations of fastened connections must account for the diameter of fastener holes, the stiffness of the fasteners, the effects of <b>interference</b> <b>fitting</b> or looseness of fit, contact between the fasteners and the connected plates, and yielding of the plates. Similarly, the treatment of bonded joints is {{complicated by the fact that}} bonded patches are typically composed of several thin layers of orthotropic material and the adhesive material may yield under load, requiring a nonlinear analysis. Consequently, the complexity of the models is such that it is difficult and time consuming to treat them using conventional finite-element or boundary-element procedures. Fortunately, these problems lend themselves to standardization in FEA-based handbook libraries. Structural connections can be described in a parametric form. Therefore, topologically similar families of connections need to be meshed only once. The FEA-based handbook library provides for the archival and recall of entries for analysis. Users need only enter the parameters. The finite-element mesh, being associative, is adjusted automatically. Therefore, users need not be concerned with meshing or other details of the analysis process. The finite-element solution and the computation of all data of interest are performed automatically and the results are displayed in tabular and graphical forms. Automatic quality control tests are performed and reported for purposes of documentation. There are provisions for the computation of margins of safety. The advanced FEA- based handbook library produces results of sufficient reliability to permit certification of repairs and joints based on computed information.

The simulation results show that, with the variation of the mid-infrared laser's carrier-envelope phase (CEP), the spectral minima positions (SMPs) are fixed for the BO model, while oscillate periodically for the NBO model.

40|$|Abstract Background During meiosis, {{homologous}} chromosomes exchange segments via {{the formation of}} crossovers. This phenomenon is highly regulated; in particular, crossovers are distributed heterogeneously along the physical map and rarely arise in close proximity, a property referred to as "interference". Crossover positions form patterns that give clues about how crossovers are formed. In several organisms including yeast, tomato, Arabidopsis, and mouse, {{it is believed that}} crossovers form via at least two pathways, one interfering, the other not. Results We have developed a software package - "CODA", for CrossOver Distribution Analyzer - which allows one to quantitatively characterize crossover patterns by <b>fitting</b> <b>interference</b> models to experimental data. Two families of interfering models are provided: the "gamma" model and the "beam-film" model. The user can specify single or two-pathways modeling, and the software package infers the model's parameters and their confidence intervals. CODA can handle data produced from measurements on bivalents or gametes, in the form of continuous crossover positions or marker genotyping. We illustrate the possibilities on data from Wheat, corn and mouse. Conclusions CODA extends the kind of crossover data that could be analyzed so far to include gametic data (rather than only bivalents/tetrads) when using two-pathways modeling. It will also enable users to perform analyses based on the beam-film model. CODA implements that model's complex physics and mathematics, and uses a summary statistic to overcomes the lack of a computable likelihood which has hampered its use till now. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} DNA to form loops has been {{employed}} by evolution {{in almost every}} aspect of biology involving DNA, not least the regulation of gene transcription. The biophysical constraints on looping of the DNA polymer at short range (< 300 bp) have been extensively studied, however it is uncertain how the probability of DNA looping decays at longer range. The first part of this thesis presents a quantitative investigation of long range DNA looping both in vivo in E. coli and in vitro. DNA looping is more efficient in vivo than measured in vitro (by our collaborators) with the technique of Tethered Particle Motion (TPM), and we suggest that DNA supercoiling aids DNA looping in vivo. By measuring long-range looping in vivo using the two well-characterised looping proteins (the LacI and λCI repressors) and thermodynamic models of DNA looping, the decay in looping probability is quantified over the range 242 – 10000 bp. Furthermore this decay is shown to be a property of the DNA tether linking the loop, independent {{of the nature of the}} DNA looping protein(s). Enhancers activate genes at long distance irrespective of position and orientation, so why don’t enhancers activate the wrong genes? In other words, what mechanisms drive efficiency and specificity in enhancer-promoter looping? The loop domain model proposes that DNA loops formed by insulators pose a topological barrier that restricts the reach of enhancers to the vicinity of desired target promoter(s). Specifically, the model predicts that two DNA loops in an alternating arrangement should form somewhat mutually exclusively (i. e. they should interfere with one another’s formation), whereas nested DNA loops are predicted to assist one another’s formation, and side-by-side loops should form independently. In the second part of this thesis, the loop domain model is tested in E. coli by combining LacI and λCI-mediated DNA loops in these different orientations. Accordingly, we quantify DNA looping assistance and <b>interference</b> by <b>fitting</b> experimental data to a statistical-mechanical model, confirming the predictions of the loop domain model. Furthermore, TPM measurements of the same looping constructs support predictions that non-supercoiled DNA in vitro should facilitate DNA looping assistance, but not interference. In addition to confirming the loop domain model in E. coli, this thesis provides a strong experimental and theoretical foundation for further investigations of enhancer-promoter looping in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the relationship between chromatin architecture and gene expression in metazoans.

40|$|In some powder {{metallurgy}} part forming, when high compacting loads {{would require a}} too large single shrink fitted die, or the inner die diameter is very large but the compaction area is modest, twice shrink fitted dies, which are relatively expensive and complex to build, should be used. In both cases, at any given compacting load, the design should minimise dimensions and stresses. The design targets are minimum die size, optimum intermediate diameter and optimum interference, with maximum stresses on each die item lower than those allowable for the selected materials. In dual mode, for fixed overall dimension, intermediate diameters and shrink <b>fitting</b> <b>interference</b> should enable to maximise the compacting load without exceeding the allowable maximum stresses. In {{the first part of}} this work, for cylindrical shapes (circular profile dies) and axisymmetric plane stress problems, dimensions, interferences and stress–strain states have been analytically calculated to optimise doubly shrink fitted dies in the abovementioned sense. In the second part, the same evaluations for axisymmetric generic problems have been carried out by finite element method (FEM) approach integrated in an optimisation procedure. The minimum overall dimensions of the die are presented as a function of the ratio between applied load and maximum allowable stress. Corresponding interferences and optimum diameters have been calculated. Some approximate equations for a quick and handy optimisation are presented. The differences between analytical and numerical results obviously depend on the consideration of the actually stressed length, or compact height, and total die height. The comparison indicates that FEM analyses are needed since analytical calculations generally give low approximations, especially for some die geometries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a regulatory}} cellular process that controls post-transcriptional gene silencing. During RNAi double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA via {{the generation of}} smaller dsRNA oligomers of length between 21 - 23 nt (siRNAs). siRNAs are then loaded onto the RNA-Induced Silencing multiprotein Complex (RISC), which uses the siRNA antisense strand to specifically recognize mRNA species which exhibit a complementary sequence. Once the siRNA loaded-RISC binds the target mRNA, the mRNA is cleaved and degraded, and the siRNA loaded-RISC can degrade additional mRNA molecules. Despite {{the widespread use of}} siRNAs for gene silencing, and the importance of dosage for its efficiency and to avoid off target effects, none of the numerous mathematical models proposed in literature was validated to quantitatively capture the effects of RNAi on the target mRNA degradation for different concentrations of siRNAs. Here, we address this pressing open problem performing in vitro experiments of RNAi in mammalian cells and testing and comparing different mathematical models fitting experimental data to in-silico generated data. We performed in vitro experiments in human and hamster cell lines constitutively expressing respectively EGFP protein or tTA protein, measuring both mRNA levels, by quantitative Real-Time PCR, and protein levels, by FACS analysis, for a large range of concentrations of siRNA oligomers. Results We tested and validated four different mathematical models of RNA <b>interference</b> by quantitatively <b>fitting</b> models' parameters to best capture the in vitro experimental data. We show that a simple Hill kinetic model is {{the most efficient way to}} model RNA interference. Our experimental and modeling findings clearly show that the RNAi-mediated degradation of mRNA is subject to saturation effects. Conclusions Our model has a simple mathematical form, amenable to analytical investigations and a small set of parameters with an intuitive physical meaning, that makes it a unique and reliable mathematical tool. The findings here presented will be a useful instrument for better understanding RNAi biology and as modelling tool in Systems and Synthetic Biology. </p...|$|R
