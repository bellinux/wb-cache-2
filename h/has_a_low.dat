40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the risk of}} <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant associated with changes in social, environmental, and genetic factors. DESIGN: Population based, historical cohort study using the Danish medical birth registry and Statistic Denmark's fertility database. SUBJECTS: All women who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant (or = 2500 g and to a subsequent liveborn infant (unexposed cohort, n = 10, 211). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant in the outcome birth {{as a function of}} changes in male partner, area of residence, type of job, and social status between the two births. RESULTS: Women in the exposed cohort showed a high risk (18. 5 %) of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> subsequent <b>low</b> birthweight infant while women in the unexposed cohort <b>had</b> <b>a</b> risk of 2. 8 %. After adjustment for initial social status, a decline in social status increased the absolute risk of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant by about 5 % in both cohorts, though this was significant only in the unexposed cohort. Change of male partner did not modify the risk of low birth weight in either cohort. CONCLUSION: <b>Having</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant and a decline in social status are strong risk factors for <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> birthweight infant subsequently...|$|R

Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E

5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E

Also, the area around the periphery of each articular face is flattened, creating a 'bevelled' appearance, and also occurs in Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus. A whiplash tail was apparently found in the same deposits but it is not certain it belongs to the same individual. Since there is no overlapping material, this assignment to Cetiosauriscus should be treated with caution.|$|E
