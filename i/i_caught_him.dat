5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
25|$|But once <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> when he {{was open}} like Silenus' statues, and I had {{a glimpse of the}} figures he keeps hidden within: they were so godlike – so bright and beautiful, so utterly amazing – that I no longer had a choice. I just had to do {{whatever}} he told me.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about his}} pass on Räikkönen {{in the closing}} laps, Massa said that [...] "it was {{the best time for}} me in the race, I was quite strong and then <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> and I passed him." [...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean we know what we want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} captain came rushing up from below. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> hold of <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But what I dis-liked {{was this}} baccy-priggin' beggar, 'oo's people, on 'is own showin', couldn't 'ave {{been more than}} thirty or forty years in the coun--on this Gawd-forsaken dust-'eap, comin' the squire over me. They're all parsons--we know that, but parson an' squire is a bit too thick for Alf Copper. Why, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>'im</b> in the shameful act of tryin' to start a {{aristocracy}} on a gun an' a wagon an' a shambuk! Yes; that's what it was: a bloomin' aristocracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came {{suddenly}} on them-—him and his brother—-birds'-nesting. In his fright {{he slipped}} in. <b>I</b> just <b>caught</b> <b>him,</b> {{but the other}} ran away, and I could not pull him up. Oh! if you had not come." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Finally <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> in Studio A of RCA. [...] He {{came out}} of the control booth and he had a couple of bikers - bikers hung around with him a lot, some pretty tough looking {{customers}} - and I'd had enough. [...] I just said, 'Hey Waylon!' [...] And he turned. [...] I said, 'I got these songs that you claimed you was gonna listen to, and if you don't listen to 'em I'm gonna whip your ass right here in front of everybody.' And boy, whew. [...] Man! [...] Everything got quiet and them old boys started formin' and Waylon stopped 'em. [...] He said, 'Hoss, you don't know how close you come to gettin' killed.' [...] I said, 'Well, I've had enough. [...] You done told me you was gonna do this. [...] Now I'm full of songs and I {{want you to listen to}} 'em." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the fight, Mayweather remarked [...] " [...] {{definitely}} had his {{moments in the}} fight. As long as I moved on the outside, I was able {{to stay away from}} those. He’s a really smart fighter... My dad wanted me to do more, but I had to take my time. Because Manny Pacquiao is a competitor, and he’s extremely dangerous." [...] Mayweather said he would retire after his next fight, the opponent of which is not yet decided. [...] Pacquiao said [...] "I thought I won the fight. He’s moving around. It’s not easy to throw punches when he’s moving around so much... I thought <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> many more times than he caught me." [...] Citing the stats that showed he possibly should have won the fight, Pacquiao has continued to maintain he should have been awarded the decision. On the possibility of a re-match, [...] Mayweather stated on May 9, 2015 that he had no plans to fight Pacquiao again [...] "at this particular time", referring to him as being a [...] "sore loser" [...] and a [...] "coward".|$|E
60|$|I {{guess the}} people in the next rooms must have thought there was {{something}} of a rumpus in our room when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{less than}} an hour afterwards, while {{crossing}} the Place Mollard, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of <b>him</b> boarding a South Shore tramcar.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could follow}} him," [...] Frank cried eagerly. [...] "I'd like to catch this Maloka by the throat, whoever he is, and I'll bet you sixpence, if <b>I</b> once <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> he'd be pretty well choked before I {{let him go}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{she said}} in a soft whisper, [...] "I believe you are right, King Krewl. The man looks to me like a very {{powerful}} wizard. But by good luck <b>I</b> have <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> asleep, so <b>I</b> shall transform him before he wakes up, giving him such a form that he will be unable to oppose me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom Shanks. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> {{coming out}} of the wood with some {{pheasants}} and warned him he'd have to leave Bank-end if Jim knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} I {{caught sight of}} Retief riding to and fro and {{shouting}} out orders. Going to him, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> by the sleeve, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|But as Thurid's foot swung so did mine, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> {{a painful}} blow upon the shin bone that saved Xodar from this added ignominy.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{wonderful}} how the Emperor's like {{a cousin}} of mine in the face," [...] said the grandmother; [...] "it struck me like lightning when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't have thought it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{no doubt}} of it; Sidonia {{is a man of}} sense, almost the only man of sense I know. <b>I</b> never <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> tripping. He never makes a false move. Sidonia is exactly the sort of man I like; you know you cannot deceive him, and that {{he does not want to}} deceive you. I wish he liked a rubber more. Then he would be perfect.' ...|$|R
60|$|With a leap I {{was beside}} Thurid, and ere the devilish smirk had faded from his {{handsome}} face <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> full upon the mouth with my clenched fist; {{and as the}} good, old American blow landed, the black dator shot back a dozen feet, to crumple in a heap {{at the foot of}} Kulan Tith's throne, spitting blood and teeth from his hurt mouth.|$|R
60|$|But Louis, the Chinese half-caste {{with the}} Oxford accent, was more frank. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> aft from the galley {{on a trip}} to the lazarette for provisions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him.</b> It's lucky we {{came when}} we did--he {{was just going}} {{out on the road}} again, up to Maine. I know where Miss Lise is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blodgett {{was driving}} {{in some of}} Tyner's calves, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him.</b> I told him what I thought of him, and he shot at me through his pocket. That was all." ...|$|E
60|$|They'm laughin' at yu, zurr. An' so I come to tell 'ee how to du. 'Twas full mune--when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> 'em, <b>him</b> an' my girl. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> 'em. [With {{a strange}} and awful flash of fire] I did; an' I tuk un [He taken up STRANGWAY'S coat and grips it with his {{trembling}} hands, as a man grips another's neck] like that--I tuk un. As the coat falls, like a body out of which the breath has been squeezed, STRANGWAY, rising, catches it.|$|R
6000|$|I {{ran out of}} the room; I rushed headlong {{down the}} stairs. The doctor heard me, and came running into the hall. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> hold of <b>him</b> like a madwoman. [...] "Euneece!" [...] My breath was gone; I could only say: [...] "Euneece!" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in <b>him.</b> Then <b>I</b> actually <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|R
6000|$|... "If they do, an' I should {{watch for}} Jip till <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him,</b> there ain't any great show of my thumpin' him very bad if he's got two others {{to lend a}} hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, uncle, one moment; I {{know all}} about those things that were stolen. It was Meadowes, my man, who pinched them. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> snaffling my silk socks. Right in the act, by Jove!" ...|$|E
60|$|Up jumped Good, burning for slaughter, and thinking, perhaps, {{that it was}} as easy to kill {{elephant}} as he {{had found}} it to shoot giraffe, but <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> {{by the arm and}} pulled him down.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} for me to answer your question, Paul, but I understand enough of both French and German to know that his broken English is a mere sham--a mixture, and a bad one too, of what no German or Frenchman would use--so it's not likely to be the sort of bad English that a Swede would speak. Moreover, <b>I</b> have <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> once or twice using English words correctly at one time and wrongly at another. No, you may depend on it that, whatever his object may be, he is deceiving us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{imagine he}} did; {{a man would}} hardly {{run the risk of}} being hung merely for the {{pleasure}} of shooting. I would give a good deal if <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>him,</b> or better still, if I had shot him," [...] said Mark. [...] "However, I will make it my business to hunt the fellow down. After this evening's affair, we shall never feel comfortable until he is <b>caught.</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt that he is the fellow we have been hunting for the last four months. The people at Bow Street seem no good whatever; I will try if I cannot succeed better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harmless! He! A Turk! A Russian spy! A double-dealing rogue. Sword in hand I have {{chased him}} through the Kurdistan valley all one night, and if <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> then Russia would have lost a tool and the Sultan a traitorous soldier. He holds still, {{although}} an absentee, a high command in the Turkish army, {{and all the while}} he is in the pay of Russia. Prince Alexis knows of my mission to you by now, and if we reach Theos we are lucky, for I do not think that a Tyrnaus upon the throne of Theos would suit Russia at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a close}} shave," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "Did you see that young fellow {{standing}} {{near the edge of}} the platform? <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> on the side and sent him spinning like a top." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Prince Bulbo, {{far from}} {{coming over to}} us, ran away, sir; but <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him.</b> The Prince is a {{prisoner}} in our army, and the most terrific tortures await him if a hair of the Princess Rosalba's head is injured.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{idea of an}} apology," [...] I answered, [...] "appears to me ridiculous. My own {{poor little}} {{possessions}} were wholly at his disposal. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>him,</b> however, {{in the act of}} meddling with papers which are mine only on trust." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Leo {{did not quite}} realise what had happened. But, when he did, his face was awful to see. With a savage oath he rose from beside the corpse, and, turning, {{literally}} sprang at Ayesha. But she was watching, and, seeing him come, stretched out her hand again, and he went staggering back towards me, and would have fallen, had <b>I</b> not <b>caught</b> <b>him.</b> Afterwards {{he told me that}} he felt as though he had suddenly received a violent blow in the chest, and, what is more, utterly cowed, as if all the manhood had been taken out of him.|$|R
5000|$|... "The animal he {{was riding}} was {{completely}} winded. I asked {{him as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> up with <b>him</b> if he had not had orders to go with Lieut. Bubb to buy supplies. He made the reply that he was taking some dispatches through for the New York Herald." [...] Grouard told Captain Jack that [...] "he was discharged from the time he quit the command." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was not}} {{the sight}} of him that filled me with amazement. For that, Castelroux's {{information}} had prepared me, and I well understood in what capacity he was there. My surprise sprang rather from the fact that amongst the half-dozen gentlemen about him--and evidently in attendance--I beheld the Chevalier de Saint-Eustache. Now, knowing as I did, the Chevalier's treasonable leanings, there was ample cause for my astonishment at finding him in such company. Apparently, too, he was on very intimate terms with the Count, for in raising my glance <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> in the act of leaning over to whisper familiarly in Chatellerault's ear.|$|R
