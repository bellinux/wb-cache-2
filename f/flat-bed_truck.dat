500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a <b>flat-bed</b> <b>truck,</b> with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E

The box exterior was made of [...] thick wooden boards measuring about [...] and standing [...] high; inside this was another, similar wooden box about [...] smaller all round; the gap between the boxes was filled with gravel. This provided protection from rifle and machine gun bullets. The fighting compartment had an embrasure on each side, these were about [...] high by [...] wide and fitted with sliding steel shutters. The fighting compartment had an open top with a beam across it to support a Lewis Gun on a sliding mount. The drivers and the engine were protected by steel plates.

50|$|Completed {{early in}} 1944 the FGP 227 (BQ+UZ) was {{fitted with a}} {{temporary}} wheeled undercarriage of ten small wheels fitted with low-pressure tyres. Intended to allow flight tests to commence from the manufacturers airfield, the FGP 227 refused to take-off from the grass airfield. To allow flight test to begin the aircraft was dismantled and transported to Erprobungsstelle See, Travemünde, (E-Stelle - flying boat testing station). During transport French prisoners of war loading the wing onto <b>flat-bed</b> <b>trucks</b> allowed it to fall from a crane causing damage which was not repaired until September 1944.|$|R

It passed the James Martin & Co engineering factory, providing a convenient way to deliver heavy equipment such as locomotives manufactured there. Broad gauge locomotives were taken directly on the tramway, narrow gauge were transported on specially-built <b>flat-bed</b> <b>trucks.</b> There were also sidings at May Brothers and Company, Roedigers, and Dowson's Mill. The tram closed in 1931 replaced by a bus, and the tracks lifted soon after.|$|R

50|$|Modular buildings, {{also called}} {{prefabricated}} homes or precision built homes, are built {{to the same}} or higher building standards as on-site stick-built homes. The building method {{is referred to as}} permanent modular construction. Modular homes are built the same and considered the same as a stick built home. Material for stick built and modular homes are the same. Modular homes are not doublewides or mobile homes. First, modular homes do not have axles or a metal frame, meaning that they are typically transported to their site by means of <b>flat-bed</b> <b>trucks.</b> Secondly, modular buildings must conform to all local building codes for their proposed use, while doublewides and mobile homes have metal under framing. Doublewides and mobile homes made in the United States, are required to conform to federal codes governed by HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} film production, Jackson's {{model was}} {{returned}} but had to be cut into sections in order to fit on the <b>flat-bed</b> <b>trucks</b> used to transport the model to Alberta. After arriving at the Reynolds Alberta Museum in Wetaskawin, Jackson {{and a team of}} volunteers reconstructed the model for display at the Abbotsford Air Show in 1997. A wind gust damaged the tail of the model in 1999 leading to its removal from an outside display area of the museum to be repaired indoors at the museum storage facility. Students and instructors from Edmonton's NAIT's Aircraft Structures program have volunteered close to 400 hours restoring the full-scale model to be displayed at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in 2009 as part of celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of powered flight in Canada and the 50th anniversary of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. The restored model remains in storage in 2010 and is not accessible to the public.|$|R

2500|$|At about 08:30, a FAR Sea Fury piloted by Carlos Ulloa Arauz {{crashed in}} the bay, due to {{stalling}} or anti-aircraft fire, after encountering a FAL C-46 returning south after dropping paratroops. By 09:00, Cuban troops and militia {{from outside the}} area had started arriving at the Central Australia sugar mill, Covadonga and Yaguaramas.

Rio Escondido was loaded with aviation fuel and as the ship started to burn, the captain gave the order to abandon ship with the ship being destroyed in three explosions shortly afterwards. Rio Escondido carried not only fuel, but also enough ammunition, food and medical supplies to last ten days and the radio that allowed the Brigade {{to communicate with the}} Liberation Air Force. The loss of the communications ship Rio Escondido meant that San Román was only able to issue orders to the forces at Blue Beach, and he had no idea of what was happening at Red Beach or with the paratroopers. A messenger from Red Beach arrived at about 10:00 am asking San Román to send tank and infantry to block the road from the Central Australia sugar mill, a request that he agreed to. It was not expected that government forces would be counter-attacking from this direction.|$|R
40|$|As hand-harvest labor {{disappeared}} from the American cotton fields afterWorldWar II, labor market dynamics differed between two key production regions, the South and the West. In the South, predominantly resident African Americans and whites harvested cotton, whereas in theWest the labor market was composed of white residents, domestic Latino migrant workers, and Mexican nationals temporarily immigrating under the sponsorship of the U. S. government (braceros). We use newly reconstructed data for the two regions and estimate {{for the first time}} the regional causes of the demise of the hand-harvest labor force from 1949 to 1964. Whereas cheaper harvest mechanization substantially affected both regions, the downward trend in cotton prices and govern-ment programs to control cotton acreage played important roles in the disappearance of hand-harvested cotton in the South, but not in the West. At the end of World War II, cotton remained largely unmechanized in con-trast to the greater part of American agricultural production. Millions of workers from California to the Carolinas spent long days picking cotton fields—once, twice, three times as the cotton continuously matured. This harvest ritual, almost as old as the nation itself, disappeared for good in the 1970 s. Gone from American cotton fields were the tenant and sharecropper shacks, migrant tents, cotton-picking crews transported from towns in <b>flat-bed</b> <b>trucks,</b> the drudgery of gathering the crop by hand, the singing in the fields, and a school year dominated by the crop cycle. 1 Instead, tens of thou-sands of machines lumbered through the fields with metal spindles whirlin...|$|R

50|$|Wheeled IFVs {{can travel}} great {{distances}} {{on their own}} without needing to be transported by <b>flat-bed</b> <b>trucks</b> and railway, as required by tracked IFVs. Tracked IFVs need to have their treads serviced or replaced on a regular basis. The tracks themselves {{and the weight of}} the IFVs tend to be tough on road surfaces, wearing them down more quickly than a wheeled IFV. Many wheeled IFVs can extract themselves from a battlefield with specialised run-flat tires when not operating in difficult terrain, while an IFV with damaged tracks would require its tracks repaired in the field or an armoured recovery vehicle to tow it out. However, tracks cannot be punctured like a tire so are more difficult to immobilize. A weapon that destroys a track will do significantly more damage to a wheeled vehicle (such as destroying the axles in which case the vehicle will have to be towed away as well). Tracks also offer far greater off-road mobility, greater obstacle climbing capabilities and greater maneuverability than wheels. Unlike a wheeled vehicle, a tracked vehicle will not be stopped by a spike strip or roadblock. A tracked vehicle can reach places a wheeled vehicle can not. As IFVs often operate alongside tanks, being tracked means that the vehicle can go everywhere that the tanks go, which a wheeled vehicle could not. In this case wheeled vehicles would either have to take another route (leaving the tanks without IFV support and the IFVs without tank protection) or the tanks would have to stay where the wheeled IFVs can go and drastically limit their own tactical mobility. Tracked vehicles can attack and operate from and in areas which a wheeled vehicle could not which is a great tactical advantage. A wheeled vehicle is limited to roads and less difficult terrain which may enable the enemy to predict where they will come from. Generally, therefore, tracked vehicles have greater mobility except on roads where wheeled vehicles have a greater top speed. Many countries only use wheeled armour for support functions or low-risk peacekeeping missions whereas combat functions are performed by tracked vehicles. A compromise between wheels and tracks is the band track, which combines some of the advantages of wheels and tracks.|$|R
