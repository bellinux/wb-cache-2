5|$|The 1951 WHO {{publication}} {{was highly}} influential in causing widespread {{changes in the}} practices and prevalence of <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> for infants and children, and in changing practices relating to the stays of small children in hospitals so that parents were allowed more frequent and longer visits. Although the monograph was primarily concerned with the removal of children from their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen. The publication was also highly controversial with, amongst others, psychoanalysts, psychologists and learning theorists, and sparked significant debate and research {{on the issue of}} children's early relationships.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Senate committee inquiries was the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which in 2002 investigated {{what became known as}} the Children Overboard Affair. The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in <b>Institutional</b> <b>Care,</b> which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{experience}} of out-of-home care varied. However, {{even those who}} made positive comments to the 2003–04 Senate Inquiry into Children in <b>Institutional</b> <b>Care</b> reported a 'lack of love, affection and nurturing'.|$|E

25|$|Residential {{institutions}} run {{by government}} and non-government organisations were the standard form of out-of-home care {{during the first}} half of the 20th century. Children in institutions were sometimes placed in foster homes for short periods, weekends or during holiday periods. There was a move towards smaller group care from the 1950s and a move away from <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> to kinship and foster care from the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Deprivation {{from social}} and {{emotional}} care causes severe delays in brain and cognitive development. Studies with children growing up Romanian orphanages during Nicolae Ceauşescu's regime reveal profound effects of social deprivation and language deprivation on the developing brain. These effects are time dependent. The longer children stayed in negligent <b>institutional</b> <b>care,</b> the greater the consequences. By contrast, adoption {{at an early age}} mitigated some of the effects of earlier institutionalization (abnormal psychology).|$|E
25|$|Care leavers {{reported}} to the Senate Inquiry into Children in <b>Institutional</b> <b>Care</b> {{that they had been}} placed in foster homes for short periods, weekends or during holiday periods. Foster care placements do not appear to have been made in a coordinated way, but 'with expediency rather than child welfare being a primary consideration'. Many reported being placed with people with limited experience of children or with older couples. Some considered they had only been fostered as a form of cheap labour to help out on farms and as domestic servants. Sexual abuse by foster parents, their children or other relatives was also reported.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as group homes) with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence {{of this type of}} support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide <b>institutional</b> <b>care,</b> such as the Texas State Schools. The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{called the}} Office of Handicapped Services, DSPD {{was created in}} 1979 to manage {{what is now called}} the Utah State Developmental Center. This is the state-funded {{institution}} for people with disabilities in American Fork, Utah. In 1983 Congress added section 1915(c) to the Social Security Act. This addition provided for the creation of Medicaid waivers. It also outlined the contractual obligations of states choosing to establish waiver programs with Medicaid. Waiver programs were considered a positive step as they provided a way for people to lead less-restricted lives in the community. Studies that supported waivers cited cost-effectiveness as the main reason why they should be enacted. It was argued that providing the same <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> in the community cost less.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of an elevated aqueduct to carry the Croton Aqueduct over the valley in 1838-42 separated {{the eastern side of}} the valley from the village of Bloomingdale which had emerged around the Bloomingdale Road, until the 1870s when it was replaced with an underground inverted siphon, and the old aqueduct was torn down. Early development in the 1870s and 1880s focused on <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> for the ill or aged, and included the Hebrew Home for the Aged, the Catholic Old Age Home, the Home for Respectable Aged Indigent Females, and the Towers Nursing Home constructed as a cancer ward by John Jacob Astor III in 1884. Also located in Manhattan Valley at the time was the New York Cancer Hospital, built in 1887 at 455 Central Park West. These, together with the Lion Brewery, gave the area its earliest landmarks. The neighborhood began to fill out residentially at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the New York City Subway's IRT Ninth Avenue Line in 1870 and the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line in 1904 allowed the public ready access to uptown Manhattan. Columbia's purchase of the Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum at around the same time as the subway's arrival naturally made the neighborhood more attractive as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{practical}} {{effects of the}} publication of Maternal Care and Mental Health were described {{in the preface to}} the WHO 1962 publication Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects as [...] "almost wholly beneficial" [...] with reference to widespread changes in the <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> of children.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the central}} tenet of {{maternal}} deprivation theory—that children's experiences of interpersonal relationships {{are crucial to}} their psychological development and that {{the formation of an}} ongoing relationship with the child is as important a part of parenting as the provision of experiences, discipline and child care—has become generally accepted, [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] as a discrete syndrome is not a concept that is much in current use other than in relation to severe deprivation as in [...] "failure to thrive". In the area of early relationships it has largely been superseded by attachment theory and other theories relating to even earlier infant–parent interactions. As a concept, parental deficiencies are seen as a vulnerability factor for, rather than a direct cause of, later difficulties. In relation to <b>institutional</b> <b>care</b> there has {{been a great deal of}} subsequent research on the individual elements of privation, deprivation, understimulation and deficiencies that may arise from <b>institutional</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
