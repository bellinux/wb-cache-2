5|$|As a quickly {{organizing}} tropical cyclone, Francisco {{developed an}} eye feature late on October16 {{in the center}} of the convection, as outflow improved and an anticyclone formed aloft. Based on the improved structure, the JMA upgraded <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> a severe tropical storm at 18:00UTC on October16, followed by upgrading it to typhoon status at 06:00UTC the next day. Francisco slowed its forward motion as steering currents weakened, with a north-northwest drift beginning on October17 due to an extension of the subtropical ridge. By later that day, the typhoon had a well-defined eye 28km (17mi) across and surrounded by deep convection, while passing west of Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. The track accelerated more to the northwest, steered by the strengthening ridge. With the eyewall convection become more distinct, Francisco continued to intensify, and the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon on October18. At 18:00UTC, the JMA estimated the typhoon attained peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). On October19, the JTWC upgraded <b>Francisco</b> <b>to</b> peak 1‑minute winds of 260km/h (160mph), the equivalent of a Category5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; by that time, the eyewall contracted to just 19km (12mi) in diameter.|$|E
