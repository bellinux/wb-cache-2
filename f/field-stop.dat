40|$|Spectrophotometric stability, {{which is}} crucial in the {{spectral}} characterization of transiting exoplanets, is affected by photometric variations arising from <b>field-stop</b> loss in space telescopes with pointing jitter or primary mirror deformation. This paper focuses on a new method for removing slit-loss or field-stop-loss photometric variation {{through the use of}} a pupil mask. Two types of pupil function are introduced: the first uses conventional (e. g., Gaussian or hyper-Gaussian) apodizing patterns; whereas the second, which we call a block-shaped mask, employs a new type of pupil mask designed for high photometric stability. A methodology for the optimization of a pupil mask for transit observations is also developed. The block-shaped mask can achieve a photometric stability of 10 ^- 5 for a nearly arbitrary <b>field-stop</b> radius when the pointing jitter is smaller than approximately 0. 7 λ/D and a photometric stability of 10 ^- 6 at a pointing jitter smaller than approximately 0. 5 λ/D. The impact of optical aberrations and mask imperfections upon mask performance is also discussed. Comment: 41 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomical Journa...|$|E

In this paper we show, for the first time, that a careful engineering of the standard cell geometry can shift the avalanche current from termination to active region and eventually lead to increased avalanche ruggedness without impacting the forward capability of a 1200 V-rated <b>field-stop</b> trench IGBT designed for power traction purposes...|$|E

The primary target is to address system-level mixed signal multi-domain simulation where the simulation time is a key factor for the usefulness of results.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} collector design on the onset and {{the extension of the}} negative differential resistance (NDR) region that develops in the blocking curves of <b>field-stop</b> (FS) and punch-through (PT) insulated gate bipolar transistors. Differences on the NDR extension and on its temperature behavior for the PT structures with respect to the FS ones are found, and their dependence from the collector design is explained. Subsequently, the dynamic filamentary current conduction mechanism is studied by means of 2 -D electrothermal simulations on a wide area structure with many elementary cells on PT and FS devices. The differences between the two structures in terms of filament movement and its influence on the max temperature of the hot spot are then demonstrated to adversely affect the ruggedness of PT devices compared with the FS ones. © 1963 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary image}} {{reflected}} from the <b>field-stop</b> of solar Gregory telescopes {{is used for}} automatic guiding. This new system avoids temporal varying influences from the bending of the telescope tube by the main mirror's gravity and from offsets between the telescope and a separate guiding refractor. The required stiffness of the guider mechanics and the small areas of the sensors demand small f-numbers for the guider optics, which cause problems with the image quality and with heat. Problems also arise from the imaging of the pinhole in the telescope's field stop. The corresponding lack of image information at that location can be reduced numerically by Fourier methods much more effectively than with profile centering methods. Several types of such guiders are tested, a final equipment, now installed at the Gregory telescopes at Tenerife and at Locarno, is described...|$|E
40|$|An {{optimized}} electro-thermal IGBT SPICE model {{based on}} the Kraus model was developed to allow reliable simulation at application level. A particular emphasis to the temperature dependence of physical parameters was given for both the on-state and breakdown conditions. The model was experimentally validated in steady state and transient operation on a <b>Field-Stop</b> trench-gate 30 A- 600 V commercial IGBT device. The effectiveness of the convergence-accuracy aspects was proved for the proposed model. The application to the short-circuit protection circuit design for a hard switched fault in an inverter motor-drive application was also analysed. The ability of the proposed IGBT model was experimentally verified with a simplified-equivalent circuit where a short condition was forced on the load, enabling the desaturation protection by the IGBT driver. The results show an accurate prediction of the device electro-thermal behaviour under short-circuit conditions, with a possible optimal design of the desaturation circuit parameters when the device experiences hard-switched-fault or fault-under-load events. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} system for the {{exchange}} and handling of cold field masks in LUCIFER, the near infrared camera and spectrograph for the LBT. Inside the LUCIFER cryostat, 10 <b>field-stop</b> and long-slit masks, and 23 multi-slit masks are stored in a stationary and an exchangeable cabinet respectively. With LUCIFER at operating temperature, the exchangeable cabinet with its multi-slit masks can be transferred from the LUCIFER cryostat to an auxiliary cryostat, and a second cabinet harboring the newly made, pre-cooled masks can be transferred back to LUCIFER from. a second auxiliary cryostat. Inside LUCIFER, a robot transports the individual masks from their storage position in the cabinet to the focal plane, and inserts them in a mask mount where they are centered on two pins. The position accuracy of the masks in the focal plane is anticipated {{to be better than}} +/- 10 mum. A mechanism which locks the masks in their cabinets and releases only the one connected to the transport robot permits mask exchange in arbitrary orientation of the cryostat...|$|E

40|$|IGBTs are {{the most}} {{preferred}} power devices in medium power and frequency applications. Due to rapid developments of IGBT technology, the need of more accurate and reliable compact models within circuit simulators has become crucial for both device and circuit designers. Thus, an improved and optimized version of the Kraus NPT IGBT model has been developed and implemented within PSpice OrCad environment. The enhancements brought to the model have regarded the addition of some IGBT typical features such as PiN injection effect or avalanche breakdown {{as well as the}} definition of temperature dependencies of semiconductor physical constants to make model suitable for electro-thermal simulations. An automated parameters calibration procedure, based on curve-fitting method and implemented in MATLAB environment, has been proposed for definition of model parameters. Hence, the ET model has been validated by comparing simulation results with experimental measurements performed on laboratory test circuits of three different application scenarios. Finally, the Kraus model has been extended to modern <b>Field-Stop</b> IGBT technology by implementing in PSpice the approximated equations of FS layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{physics of}} the {{different}} failure modes that limit the maximum avalanche capability during unclamped inductive switching (UIS) in punchthrough (PT) and not PT (NPT) insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) structures is analyzed in this paper. Both 3 -D electrothermal numerical simulations and experimental evaluations support the theoretical analysis. Experimental results for UIS test show that, at low time duration (or inductance value) of the test, the UIS limit moves from energy limitation to current limitation. While the energy limitation is well known, the current-limited failures are less studied. In this paper, the current limit for UIS test is analyzed in detail, and the cause is attributed to a filamentary current conduction due {{to the presence of}} a negative differential resistance (NDR) region in the $I_{C}$– $V_{rm CE}$ curve in breakdown. The filamentary current conduction locally increases the current density causing early device latch-up and possible device failure at a current much lower than the one dictated by energy limitations. The physical parameters that affect both the onset of NDR region and the failure current are discussed for both an NPT trench IGBT structure with a local lifetime control and a PT trench IGBT structure with a <b>field-stop</b> layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} and anatomical {{consequences of}} diurnal changes in screening pigment position were investigated in the apposition {{eye of the}} portunid crab Scylla serrata. Intracellular recordings revealed that the acceptance angles of dark-adapted photoreceptors enlarged up to four-fold at night compared with photoreceptors dark-adapted in the day. Furthermore, while light adaptation at night caused acceptance angles to narrow, dark adaptation in the day caused no significant broadening of angles. These electrophysiological changes correlated with pigment movements in the eye observed both histologically and in the deep pseudopupil. It is found that the distal pigment cells change diurnally so that the <b>field-stop</b> which these cells form {{in front of the}} photoreceptors is opened in the night and closed in the day time. One feature of the diurnal rhythm is that it prevents photoreceptor fields of view enlarging when eyes are dark adapted in the day. In Scylla, photoreceptor fields of view take tens of minutes to narrow upon exposure of crabs to light at night. By preventing a similar broadening in the day, the diurnal rhythm may enable animals suddenly leaving dark refuges to be pre-adapted to daylight. To a range of species which utilise refuges such a mechanism would be of significant advantage, especially after disturbance by predators. ...|$|E
40|$|Stop-flow {{lithography}} (SFL) is a microfluidic-based particle synthesis method, {{in which}} photolithography with a two dimensional (2 D) photomask is performed in situ within a microfluidic environment to fabricate multifunctional microstructures. Here, we modified the SFL technique by utilizing an adjustable electrostatic-force-modulated 3 D (EFM- 3 D) mask to continuously fabricate microlens structures for high-throughput production. The adjustable EFM- 3 D mask contains a layer {{filled with a}} UV-absorbing liquid and transparent elastomer structures {{in the shape of}} microlenses between two conductive glass substrates. An acrylate oligomer stream is photopolymerized via the microscope projection photolithography, where the EFM- 3 D mask was set at the <b>field-stop</b> plane of the microscope, thus forming the microlens structures. The produced microlens structures flow downstream without adhesion to the polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) microchannel surfaces due to the existence of an oxygen-aided inhibition layer. Microlens structures with variations in curvature and aperture can be produced by changing objective magnifications, controlling the morphology of the EFM- 3 D mask through electrostatic force, and varying the concentration of UV-light absorption dyes. We have successfully demonstrated to produce microlens structures with an aperture ranging from 50 μm to 2 mm and the smallest focus spot size of 0. 59 μm. Our proposed method allows one to fabricate microlens structures in a fast, simple and high-throughput mode for application in micro-optical systems...|$|E
