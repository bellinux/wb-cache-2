25|$|The Wits SRC {{academic}} boycott has {{not been}} renewed since it was passed in 2012 and is defacto no longer operable at the institution. A number of Wits SRC and former Wits SRC members have visited the country and talked about their experiences. They have said they are against boycotts and that calling Israel an apartheid state <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> black South Africans. Israeli writers and the Israeli director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have also visited the campus.|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, the Ontario Ministry of Labour charged Live Nation Canada Inc, Live Nation Ontario Concerts GP Inc, Optex Staging & Services Inc and an {{engineer}} with 13 charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The hearing began in November 2015. In June 2017, a mistrial was declared {{and a new}} trial ordered after the judge {{was appointed to the}} Ontario Superior Court and lost jurisdiction. In September 2017, charges were stayed due to court delays. Radiohead released a statement saying: [...] "We are appalled by the decision … This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the memory of Scott Johnson, his parents and our crew. It offers no consolation, closure or assurance that this kind of accident will not happen again." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer {{initially}} {{refuses to}} attend Bart's show because he discovers the artwork <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> him, but changes his mind after Bart apologizes and writes [...] "I'm sorry" [...] {{on the hood}} of Homer's car. At the show, Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town. It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he has to go to the bathroom, Wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage.|$|E

50|$|The {{pamphlet}} gathered {{about fifty}} signatures, {{but was not}} well received in France, even by the surrealist group, where some considered Galathée <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> women.|$|R
50|$|The iniuria {{need not}} be {{directly}} to the person aggrieved; it <b>is</b> plain that <b>A</b> might <b>be</b> <b>insulted</b> by something done to B. But the important cases of this are of outrage {{to members of the}} family. An iniuria to a wife gave an action not only to her but to her husband. An <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> filiusfamilias <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the paterfamilias as well, who might sue for himself and for his son, though, as in certain circumstances the son might himself sue, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> provision against two actions nomine filii. Thus where a married daughter of the family was insulted there might be three actions, or more, her own, her husband's, her father's, and even her husband's father's. A sponsus might have an action on <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> his sponsa, and there were other cases. It must be noted that the damages would not necessarily be the same in these cases: in each the personality of the plaintiff was considered. And though <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> wife or child <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> paterfamilias, the converse was not true. The most remarkable case of indirect insult is that of heredes. An <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the body or funeral <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the heres if it was the heres had entered into the estate. If not, it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the hereditas and the heres after entry acquired it like other claims of the hereditas.|$|R
500|$|Along {{with that}} of Billingsley and the Stork Club, Walter Winchell's name was further {{tarnished}} by the incident. After leaving the Stork, the Baker party made contact with WMCA's Barry Gray, where the story was told as part of Gray's radio talk show. One of those who phoned Gray's program was television personality and columnist Ed Sullivan, a professional rival of Winchell's whose [...] "home base" [...] was the El Morocco nightclub. [...] Sullivan's on-air remarks dealt mainly with Winchell's alleged part in the event, saying, [...] "What Winchell has done <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the United States and American newspapermen." [...] Winchell's column of October 24, 1951, provides the same details as earlier news stories about Josephine Baker's accusations {{that he did not}} assist her at the Stork Club. Winchell also printed a letter he received from Walter White, who was the executive secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at the time.|$|E
500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> my son's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. Why do they have to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E
2500|$|... Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter MacKay {{said that}} the conference was [...] "an outrage". [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> Holocaust victims. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> their descendants. Canada's new {{government}} and I am sure many others in this [...] House (of Commons) and around the globe condemn this conference, just as we have previously condemned the Iranian president's comments about the Holocaust as hateful." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2009, in an {{open letter}} to Israeli leaders and politicians, Ben-Ari stated that Pope Benedict XVI's visit <b>to</b> Israel would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the memory of Holocaust victims.|$|R
25|$|Fundamentalism is in {{the process}} of {{stifling}} culture and creation in the Arab world, I say it is shameful. I am ashamed. We should all be ashamed. If Marcel Khalife is found guilty, it will <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> culture.|$|R
50|$|Others {{expressed}} disappointment, however, {{that the}} elders had gone public before Ratu Finau {{had made a}} final decision on accepting the invitation, saying that the publicity <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> him and the other children of the late Ratu Mara.|$|R

2500|$|Although Pawar {{tried to}} play down the {{incident}} by stating that [...] "it wasn't intentional", some cricketers including the usually diplomatic Sachin Tendulkar and Nikhil Chopra reacted strongly to this. In Mumbai, a section of NCP workers {{took to the streets}} demanding an apology from the Australian cricket team. Chaggan Bhujbal, a NCP leader said [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> a senior leader. We will make a formal complaint to the Australian embassy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Abdol-Hamid {{hosted a}} TV show [...] "Adam og Asmaa" [...] {{together}} with Adam Holm. [...] The show caused much debate {{since it was}} the first time a TV host in Denmark wore a hijab. The Danish feminist group Feminist Forum said her appearance [...] "strengthens ethnic and gender equality in Denmark" [...] but the Women for Freedom association said, [...] "The choice of Asma Abdol-Hamid (sic) ... <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> both Danish and Muslim women." ...|$|E

25|$|In 2002, a Christian {{organization}} {{asked for}} the removal of a poster which advertised the film Amen by Costa Gavras.

2500|$|On November 28, at a {{round table}} {{organized}} by Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, scientists {{and members of}} the Russian Academy of Sciences along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, [...] "there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations." ...|$|E
2500|$|A song titled [...] "Harapan Bangsa" [...] sung by Jaclyn in 2007 for {{the churches}} in Sabah and Sarawak caused {{controversy}} in certain {{sections of the}} Muslim community, which is predominantly Malay-speaking people in Peninsular Malaysia, when a YouTube clip of the song using Christian images was uploaded five years later by a fan. Perkasa, the infamous non-governmental Malay organisation which was formed {{in the aftermath of}} the Malaysian general elections in 2008, has called for a blanket boycott of Jaclyn by Muslims nationwide over the song, which it claims <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> Islam.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, at {{an annual}} protest against the {{existence}} of Israel, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that [...] "the very existence of the Zionist regime <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> humanity" [...] and that [...] "the Zionist regime and the Zionists are a cancerous tumor. Even if one cell of them is left in one inch of (Palestinian) land, in the future this story (of Israel's existence) will repeat." [...] Ahmadinejad also said that “the nations of the region will soon finish off the usurper Zionists in the Palestinian land". [...] Ahmadinejad added that [...] "it is dangerous if even 10% of the territory {{is given to the}} Zionists."

2500|$|The Book of Genesis 1:26 {{indicates}} that God gave people {{control over the}} animals and earth, while Genesis 2:15 emphasizes that people were put {{in the world to}} maintain it and care for it. The Talmud teaches the principle of Bal tashkhit, which some take to mean that wasting or destroying anything on earth is wrong. [...] Many take the view that pollution <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the created world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care for God's creation. However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is paramount. Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have to take account of the well-being of humans.|$|E
2500|$|... "Although {{the power}} {{is given to the}} scholar to excommunicate a man who has slighted him, it is not praiseworthy for him to employ this means too frequently. He should rather shut his ears to the words of the ignorant and pay no {{attention}} to them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said, 'Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken' (Eccl. vii. 21). This was the custom of the early pious men, who would not answer when they heard themselves insulted, but would forgive the insolent[...] [...] [...] But this humility should be practised only when the insult occurs in private; when the scholar is publicly insulted, he dares not forgive; and if he forgive he should be punished, for then it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> the Torah that he must revenge until the offender humbly apologizes" ...|$|E
