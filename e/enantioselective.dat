5|$|The R-groups on the sulfur, though {{typically}} methyls, {{have been}} used to synthesize reagents that can perform <b>enantioselective</b> variants of the reaction (See Variations below). The size of the groups can also influence diastereoselectivity in alicyclic substrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{is most often}} employed for epoxidation via methylene transfer, and to this end {{has been used in}} several notable total syntheses (See Synthesis of epoxides below). Additionally detailed below are the history, mechanism, scope, and <b>enantioselective</b> variants of the reaction. Several reviews have been published.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, E. J. Corey and {{co-workers}} {{found out that}} the formation of oxazaborolidines from borane and chiral amino alcohols. And the oxazaborolidines were found to catalyze the rapid and highly <b>enantioselective</b> reduction of prochiral ketones in the presence of BH3THF. This <b>enantioselective</b> reduction of achiral ketones with catalytic oxazaborolidine is called Corey–Bakshi–Shibata reduction or CBS reduction.|$|E
25|$|Other uses of DNA in {{chemistry}} are in DNA-templated synthesis, <b>Enantioselective</b> catalysis, DNA nanowires and DNA computing.|$|E
25|$|Oxazoline ligands {{were first}} used for {{asymmetric}} catalysis in 1984 when Brunner et al. showed a single example, {{along with a}} number of Schiff bases, as being effective for <b>enantioselective</b> carbenoid cyclopropanation. Schiff bases were prominent ligands at the time, having been used by Ryōji Noyori during the discovery of asymmetric catalysis in 1968 (for which he and William S. Knowles would later be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry). Brunner's work was influenced by that of Tadatoshi Aratani, who had worked with Noyori, before publishing a number of papers on <b>enantioselective</b> cyclopropanation using Schiff bases.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to create}} a {{catalytic}} Baeyer–Villiger oxidation is by using enzymes as the catalyst. Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) use dioxygen to perform the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation. These enzymes are capable of <b>enantioselective</b> oxidations of prochiral substrates.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, R. W. Hoffmann and T. Herold {{reported}} on the <b>enantioselective</b> synthesis of secondary homoallyl alcohols via chiral non-racemic allylboronic esters. The homoallylic alcohols were formed with excellent yield and moderate enantioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Endocyclic imines do {{not suffer}} from {{complications}} due to syn/anti isomerization; however, {{this has not}} {{proven to be a}} significant advantage in <b>enantioselective</b> hydrogenations. 3-Hydroindoles may be reduced with hydrogen gas and an iridium catalyst.|$|E
25|$|Achieving {{complete}} {{conversion of}} pyrroles to pyrrolidines by asymmetric hydrogenation {{has so far}} proven difficult, with partial-hydrogenation products often being observed. Complete <b>enantioselective</b> reduction is possible, with the outcome depending on both the starting substrate and the method.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to use organometallic catalysts to perform <b>enantioselective</b> Baeyer–Villiger oxidations. The first reported instance {{of one such}} oxidation of a prochiral ketone used dioxygen as the oxidant with a copper catalyst. Other catalysts, including platinum and aluminum compounds, followed.|$|E
25|$|In the Jacobsen {{synthesis}} of (+)-yohimbine, an indole alkaloid, an early <b>enantioselective</b> Pictet-Spengler reaction using a pyrrole-substituted thiourea catalyst produced gram-scale quantities of product in 94% ee and 81% yield. The {{remainder of the}} synthesis was short, using a reductive amination and an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E
25|$|Metolachlor is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in the widely used herbicide Dual Magnum®. A key step in its industrial production involves the <b>enantioselective</b> reduction of an N-aryl imine. This reduction is achieved with extremely high turnover number (albeit moderate enantioselectivity) {{through the use of}} a specialized catalyst system consisting of 2, modified Josiphos ligand 3, and acid and iodide additives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enantioselective</b> oxidations are {{typically}} either kinetic resolutions of chiral alcohols or desymmetrization reactions. These oxidations may be facilitated {{through the use}} of chiral nitroxide radicals in the catalytic mode. A good example is provided by the kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethanol. Oxidative desymmetrization processes employing oxoammonium oxidants, on the other hand, are relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|Because the substituents {{attached}} to the imine nitrogen exert a profound influence on reactivity, few general catalyst systems exist for the <b>enantioselective</b> hydrogenation of imines and imine derivatives. However, catalyst systems have been developed that catalyze hydrogenation of particular classes of imines with high enantioselectivity and yield. This section describes some of these systems and is organized by the substitution pattern of the imine.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} method {{published in}} 2007 {{starts with the}} <b>enantioselective</b> desymmetrization of aziridine 1 with trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) and a chiral catalyst to the azide 2. The amide group is protected as a BOC group with Boc anhydride and DMAP in 3 and iodolactamization with iodine and potassium carbonate first gives the unstable intermediate 4 and then stable cyclic carbamate 5 after elimination of hydrogen iodide with DBU.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} reactivity, another {{distinct}} {{advantage of these}} two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction is very well established, and <b>enantioselective</b> variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol. Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure.|$|E
25|$|The use of cation-pi {{interactions}} {{has also}} been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies {{can be used to}} effect <b>enantioselective</b> cationic polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated polyene cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and stereoselectivity. The enantioselectivity correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the aryl group.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{advances}} in the asymmetric hydrogenation of protected indoles, considerable operational simplicity can be gained by removing the protecting group altogether. This has been achieved with catalytic systems utilizing Brønsted acids to activate the indole. The initial system used a Pd(TFA)2/H8-BINAP system to achieve the <b>enantioselective</b> cis-hydrogenation of 2,3- and 2-substituted indoles with high yield and excellent ee. A similar process, where sequential Friedel-Crafts alkylation and asymmetric hydrogenation occur in one pot, allow asymmetric 2,3-substituted indolines to be selectively prepared from 2-substituted indoles in similarly high yields and ee.|$|E
25|$|The Ireland–Claisen {{rearrangement}} is {{the reaction}} of an allylic carboxylate with a strong base (such as lithium diisopropylamide) to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The rearrangement proceeds via silylketene acetal, which is formed by trapping the lithium enolate with chlorotrimethylsilane. Like the Bellus-Claisen (above), Ireland-Claisen rearrangement can take place at room temperature and above. The E- and Z-configured silylketene acetals lead to anti and syn rearranged products, respectively. There are numerous examples of <b>enantioselective</b> Ireland-Claisen rearrangements found in literature to include chiral boron reagents {{and the use of}} chiral auxiliaries.|$|E
25|$|Lin and {{coworkers}} {{have shown that}} the postmodification of MOFs can be achieved to produce <b>enantioselective</b> homochiral MOFs for use as catalysts. The resulting 3D homochiral MOF {• 4DMF • 6MeOH • 3H2O} (L=(R)-6,6'-dichloro-2,2'-dihydroxyl-1,1'-binaphthyl-bipyridine) synthesized by Lin was shown to have a similar catalytic efficiency for the diethylzinc addition reaction as compared to the homogeneous analogue when was pretreated by Ti(OiPr)4 to generate the grafted Ti- BINOLate species. The catalytic activity of MOFs can vary depending on the framework structure. Lin and others found that MOFs synthesized from the same materials could have drastically different catalytic activities depending on the framework structure present.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, the {{hydrogenation}} of carbon–nitrogen double {{bonds is}} {{the addition of}} the elements of dihydrogen (H2) across a carbon–nitrogen double bond, forming amines or amine derivatives. Although a variety of general methods have been developed for the <b>enantioselective</b> hydrogenation of ketones, methods for the hydrogenation of carbon–nitrogen double bonds are less general. Hydrogenation of imines is complicated by both syn/anti isomerization and tautomerization to enamines, which may be hydrogenated with low enantioselectivity {{in the presence of a}} chiral catalyst. Additionally, the substituent attached to nitrogen affects both the reactivity and spatial properties of the imine, complicating the development of a general catalyst system for imine hydrogenation. Despite these challenges, methods have been developed that address particular substrate classes, such as N-aryl, N-alkyl, and endocyclic imines.|$|E
25|$|In {{this first}} usage the oxazoline ligand {{performed}} poorly, giving an ee of 4.9% compared to 65.6% {{from one of}} the Schiff base ligands. However Brunner reinvestigated oxazoline ligands during research into the monophenylation of diols, leading to the development of chiral pyridine oxazoline ligands, which achieved ee's of 30.2% in 1986 and 45% in 1989. In the same year Pfaltz et al. reported the use of C2‑symmetric semicorrin ligands for <b>enantioselective</b> carbenoid cyclopropanations, achieving impressive results with ee's of between 92-97%. Reference was made to both Brunner's and Aratani's work, however the design of the ligands was also largely based on his earlier work with various macrocycles. A disadvantage of these ligands however, was that they required a multi-step synthesis with a low overall yield of approximately 30%.|$|E
25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early <b>enantioselective</b> route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{features}} make lanthanide complexes effective catalysts. Hard Lewis acids are able to polarise bonds upon coordination and thus alter the electrophilicity of compounds, with a classic example being the Luche reduction. The large size of the ions coupled with their labile ionic bonding allows even bulky coordinating species to bind and dissociate rapidly, resulting in very high turnover rates; thus excellent yields can often be achieved with loadings {{of only a few}} mol%. The lack of orbital interactions combined with the lanthanide contraction means that the lanthanides change in size across the series but that their chemistry remains much the same. This allows for easy tuning of the steric environments and examples exist where this has been used to improve the catalytic activity of the complex·6THF: New Anhydrous Lithium Lanthanide Binaphtholates and Their Use in <b>Enantioselective</b> Alkyl Addition to Aldehydes|journal=Organometallics|date=1 April 1999|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1366–1368|doi=10.1021/om981011s}} and change the nuclearity of metal clusters.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of an <b>enantioselective</b> (i.e. yielding an enantiomeric excess, which is labelled as [...] "ee") variant of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction remains an active area of academic research. The use of chiral sulfides in a stoichiometric fashion has proved more successful than the corresponding catalytic variants, but the substrate scope is still limited in all cases. The catalytic variants have been developed almost exclusively for <b>enantioselective</b> purposes; typical organosulfide reagents are not prohibitively expensive and the racemic reactions {{can be carried out}} with equimolar amounts of ylide without raising costs significantly. Chiral sulfides, on the other hand, are more costly to prepare, spurring the advancement of catalytic <b>enantioselective</b> methods.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{modifications}} {{focused on}} altering {{the progress of}} the reaction, either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation [...] "intercepted" [...] in various ways. Furthermore, <b>enantioselective</b> variants of various kinds have been developed.

500|$|The {{development}} of an <b>enantioselective</b> Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts. Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known, in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization. Almost all of the attempts {{are based on the}} idea of torquoselectivity; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to [...] "rotate" [...] in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} chiral resolutions have been {{developed}} to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine. For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with [...] to form a diastereoisomeric salt which is fractionally crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine. Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale. In addition, several <b>enantioselective</b> syntheses of amphetamine {{have been developed}}. In one example, optically pure [...] is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral Schiff base. [...] In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group. [...] Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine.|$|E

2500|$|Migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring {{transition}} state, {{leading to}} a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst.

The synthesis of dysidiolide by Corey and co-workers was achieved via an <b>enantioselective</b> CBS reduction using a borane-dimethylsulfide complex.|$|E
2500|$|Knowles' {{research}} into asymmetric hydrogenation and {{its application to}} the production scale synthesis of L-Dopa gave asymmetric hydrogenation a strong start in the industrial world. [...] More recently, a 2001 review indicated that asymmetric hydrogenation accounted for 50% of production scale, 90% of pilot scale, and 74% of bench scale catalytic, <b>enantioselective</b> processes in industry, with the caveat that asymmetric catalytic methods in general were not yet widely used.|$|E
2500|$|A {{relatively}} new strategy of using synthetic oligopeptides to perform catalysis has yielded many successful examples of catalytic methods.
