This study considers the flow characteristics and structural strength of a disc filter with a layer of repeated 1. 8 mm lattice unit cell as the <b>filter</b> <b>mesh.</b> Computational fluid dynamics simulation is used to analyse the pressure and flow velocity across the filter, while finite element analysis is utilised to analyse the structural characteristics of the lattice mesh under fluid load. The results show a minimal decrease in pressure and small increases in velocity, with the mesh capable of withstanding higher loads. The ultimate failure load of the structure is also determined. These findings indicate that more layers of lattice structures could be used as <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> and the flexibility of AM allows the filter properties to be tailored as required for a given application...|$|E

However, the number concentration of particles smaller than the Daphnia <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> size simultaneously increases in the presence of the filter feeder, suggesting either the break-down of existing aggregates or the aggregation of particles with initial sizes below the measured size range.

This paper discusses the reduction in energy consumption in the filtration process by using additive manufactured, geometrically optimised, conical, in-line filter supports.

Based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, a new filter support was designed and fabricated using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology. The comparison was achieved by testing both types of filter supports of similar dimensions with <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> in a bespoke test rig at Croft Engineering Services. A 20 gauge, 900 µm <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> was used to test the two filter supports with flow rates between 0. 0018 m 3 /s to 0. 0062 m 3 /s. Comparison of the experimental results revealed that the AM filter support mesh arrangement was superior to the conventional filter support mesh arrangement. In comparison to the conventional approach, the AM filter support was 0. 443 kPa pressure drop lower when operated in the forward flow direction and 1. 852 kPa lower in reverse flow. The reduction in pressure drop correspondingly reduced the energy consumption by 10 kW/h in forward flow and 29 kW/h in reverse flow...|$|E

40|$|High {{gradient}} {{magnetic separation}} (HGMS) is an {{efficient way to}} remove magnetic and paramagnetic particles, such as heavy metals, from waste water. As the suspension flows through a magnetized <b>filter</b> <b>mesh,</b> high magnetic gradients around the wires attract and capture the particles removing them from the fluid. We model such a system by considering the motion of a paramagnetic tracer particle through a periodic array of magnetized cylinders. We show that there is a critical Mason number (ratio of viscous to magnetic forces) below which the particle is captured irrespective of its initial position in the array. Above this threshold, particle capture is only partially successful and depends on the particle's entry position. We determine the relationship between the critical Mason number and the system geometry using numerical and asymptotic calculations. If a capture efficiency below 100 % is sufficient, our results demonstrate how operating the HGMS system above the critical Mason number but with multiple separation cycles may increase efficiency. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{construction}} of linear mesh layouts has found various applications, such as implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering</b> and <b>mesh</b> streaming, where {{a variety of}} layout quality criteria, e. g., span and width, can be considered. While spectral sequencing, derived from the Fiedler vector, {{is one of the}} best-known heuristics for minimizing width, it does not perform as well as the Cuthill-Mckee (CM) scheme in terms of span. In this paper, we treat optimal mesh layout generation as a problem of preserving graph distances and propose to use the subdominant eigenvector of a kernel (affinity) matrix for sequencing. Despite the non-sparsity of the affinity operators we use, the layouts can be computed efficiently for large meshes through subsampling and eigenvector extrapolation. Our experiments show that the new sequences obtained outperform those derived from the Fiedler vector, in terms of spans, and those obtained from CM, in terms of widths and other important quality criteria. Therefore, in applications where several such quality criteria can influence algorithm performance simultaneously, e. g., mesh streaming and implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering,</b> the new <b>mesh</b> layouts could potentially provide a better trade-off. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{was used to}} study the flow field and {{particle}} dynamics in an internal spin-filter (SF) bioreactor system. Evidence of a radial exchange flow through the <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> was detected, with a magnitude up to 130 -fold higher than the perfusion flow, thus significantly contributing to radial drag. The exchange flow magnitude was significantly influenced by the filter rotation rate, but not by the perfusion flow, within the ranges evaluated. Previous reports had only given indirect evidences of this exchange flow phenomenon in spin-filters, but the current simulations were able to quantify and explain it. Flow pattern inside the spin-filter bioreactor resembled a typical Taylor-Couette flow, with vortices being formed in the annular gap and eventually penetrating the internal volume of the filter, thus being the probable reason for the significant exchange flow observed. The simulations also showed that cells become depleted {{in the vicinity of}} the mesh due to lateral particle migration. Cell concentration near the filter was approximately 50 % of the bulk concentration, explaining why cell separation achieved in SFs is not solely due to size exclusion.

FSF was sequestered from raw municipal wastewater, in the Netherlands, using a rotating belt <b>filter</b> (<b>mesh</b> size 350 micron). FSF is a heterogeneous substrate that mainly consists of fibres originating from toilet paper and thus contains a high cellulosic fraction (60 – 80 % of total solids content), {{regarded as an}} energy-rich material. Results Results of the 656 -day fed-batch operation clearly showed that thermophilic digestion was more stable, applying high organic loading rates (OLR) up to 22 kg COD/(m 3 day). In contrast, the mesophilic digester already failed applying an OLR of 5. 5 kg COD/(m 3 day), indicated by a drop in pH and increase in volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The observed viscosity values of the mesophilic sludge were more than tenfold higher than the thermophilic sludge. 454 -pyrosequencing of eight mesophilic and eight thermophilic biomass samples revealed that Bacteroides and aceticlastic methanogen Methanosaeta were the dominant genera in the mesophilic digester, whereas OP 9 lineages, Clostridium and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanothermobacter dominated the thermophilic one.

Starting from the classical formulation of Laplacian <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering,</b> a novel objective function is introduced. The minimization of the objective function leads to new spatial coordinates for the vertices in the mesh. A reconstruction mechanism is then applied to the non-uniform mesh to reconstruct a grayscale image. Whereas the Laplacian <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> aims at smoothing an image, the grid smoothing tends at sharpening the edges of the image. The grid smoothing framework is applied to image enhancement in this paper...|$|R

The first part of this thesis addresses three problems in fluid simulation: advection, thin film, and the volume error. First, we show that the back and forth error compensation and correction (BFECC) method can significantly reduce the dissipation and diffusion. Second, thin film is hard to simulate since it has highly complex liquid/gas interface that requires high memory and computational costs. We address this difficulties by using cell centered octree grid to reduce memory cost and a multigrid method to reduce computational cost. Third, the volume loss is an undesired side effect of the level set method. The known solution to this problem is the particle level set method, which is expensive and has small but accumulating volume error. We provide a solution that is computationally effective and can prevent volume loss without accumulation. The second part of this thesis is focused on <b>filtering</b> a triangle <b>mesh</b> to produce a mesh whose details are selectively reduced or amplified. We develop a <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> with a rational transfer function, which is a generalization from previously developed <b>mesh</b> <b>filters.</b> In addition, we show that the <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> parameters can be computed from the physical size of mesh feature.
