5|$|Hastings {{embroidery}} of 1965 {{commemorating the}} 900th {{anniversary of the}} Battle of Hastings the following year, and the Overlord embroidery of 1968 commemorating the <b>D-Day</b> invasion of France during World War II, now in the <b>D-Day</b> museum in Southsea, Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|He {{resigned}} from the United States Military Academy after one year {{to fight in the}} world war and was sent to Europe, participating in the <b>D-Day</b> landings at Omaha Beach. After the <b>D-Day</b> invasion, he fought on to Germany where he was wounded. He received a battlefield commission to second lieutenant, returned to combat, and participated in the action that earned him the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preparation}} for <b>D-Day</b> {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive bombing of railway junctions and transport networks across northern France and Belgium. Many of these targets were in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of bombing in the lead up to <b>D-Day</b> alone resulted in 1,500 civilian casualties. Bombing of targets in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied bombing during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
5|$|On the fifty-fourth {{anniversary of}} <b>D-Day,</b> June6, 1998, then Transportation Minister Tony Clement {{unveiled}} two signs in Ottawa and formally declared {{the entire length}} of Highway416 as the Veterans Memorial Highway, despite earlier reluctance from previous minister Al Palladini.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tonga was the codename {{given to}} the {{airborne}} operation undertaken by the British 6th Airborne Division between 5 June and 7 June 1944 {{as a part of}} Operation Overlord and the <b>D-Day</b> landings during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth hosts yearly remembrances of the <b>D-Day</b> landings, which {{veterans}} from Allied and Commonwealth nations attend. The city {{played a}} major part in the 50th <b>D-Day</b> anniversary in 1994; visitors included then-US President Bill Clinton, Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, King Harald V of Norway, French president François Mitterrand, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Prime Minister John Major, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Portsmouth International Kite Festival is organised annually by Portsmouth City Council and The Kite Society of Great Britain. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{story for}} FUSAG {{was that the}} army group, based in {{south-east}} England, would invade the Pas-de-Calais region several weeks after a smaller diversionary landing in Normandy. In reality, the main invasion force would land in Normandy on <b>D-Day.</b> As <b>D-Day</b> approached, the LCS moved on to planning tactical deceptions to help cover {{the progress of the}} real invasion forces. As well as naval operations, the LCS also planned operations involving paratroopers and ground deceptions. The latter would come into effect once landings were made but the former (involving naval, air and special forces units) were used to cover the approach of the true invasion fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe units {{committed}} to battle after the <b>D-Day</b> landings suffered further catastrophic losses against the overwhelming numbers of allied fighters present. In the ten weeks of action following <b>D-Day,</b> II./JG 1 lost 106 aircraft (41 in air combat) and 30 pilots, for just 32 air claims. Many experienced and irreplaceable Experte were killed during this time. Hauptmann Karl-Heinz Weber, Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG 1 (136 claims) {{was killed in}} action against Polish Wing Mustangs on 7 June 1944, north of Paris, while on 17 June 1944, Leutnant 'Toni' Piffer (35 claims) was shot down and killed in aerial combat with USAAF fighters over La Cordonnerie.|$|E
5|$|The {{foothold}} gained on <b>D-Day</b> at Omaha, itself two isolated pockets, was {{the most}} tenuous across all the <b>D-Day</b> beaches. With the original objective yet to be achieved, the priority for the Allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads. During the course of June 7, while still under sporadic shellfire, the beach was prepared as a supply area. Surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and, while still less than planned, 1,429 tons of stores were landed that day.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{attempt by}} I Corps {{to reach the}} city on <b>D-Day</b> was blocked by {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division and with the Germans committing most of the reinforcements sent to meet the invasion {{to the defense of}} Caen, the Anglo-Canadian front rapidly congealed short of Second Army's objectives. Operation Perch in the week following <b>D-Day</b> and Operation Epsom (26–30 June) brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders but Caen remained in German hands until Operation Charnwood (7–9 July), when the Second Army managed to take {{the northern part of the}} city up to the River Orne in a frontal assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} St Peter's Church are a {{memorial}} to the civilians and auxiliary personnel killed in the aerial bombing of Bristol, and a plaque on its wall lists their names. Adjoining the church is a sensory herb garden and The Normandy Garden of Peace, which was opened on 5 November 1995, with five Silver Birch trees, managed by Bristol's <b>D-Day</b> veterans, {{in memory of the}} five <b>D-Day</b> beaches. There are also memorials for trees for Anne Frank and the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|After delays due to both {{logistical}} {{difficulties and}} poor weather, the <b>D-Day</b> of Overlord, the largest amphibious operation ever, was postponed 24 hours to 6 June 1944. Eisenhower and Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group, aimed to capture Caen {{within the first}} day, and liberate Paris within 90 days.|$|E
5|$|<b>D-Day</b> at Utah {{began at}} 01:30, {{when the first}} of the {{airborne}} units arrived, tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église and controlling the causeways through the flooded farmland behind Utah so the infantry could advance inland. While some airborne objectives were quickly met, many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day. On the beach itself, infantry and tanks landed in four waves beginning at 06:30 and quickly secured the immediate area with minimal casualties. Meanwhile, engineers set to work clearing the area of obstacles and mines, and additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive. At the close of <b>D-Day,</b> Allied forces had only captured about half of the planned area and contingents of German defenders remained, but the beachhead was secure.|$|E
5|$|<b>D-Day</b> {{had cost}} the 6th Airborne Division 821 dead, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing. The {{division}} remained holding the Orne bridgehead, only {{taking part in}} patrols and small scale local attacks until the 17August when it crossed the River Dives. By 27August, the division had reached Berville sur Mer, where it halted and remained {{until the beginning of}} September when it was withdrawn back to England.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, a {{division}} of the Meteorological Office was established at RAF Uxbridge as part of the Intelligence Branch. On 1 July that year the station Sick Quarters were merged with the WAAF hospital to create the RAF Station Hospital. No. 11 Group was involved in providing air support for the Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August 1942. Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory commanded participating Allied air forces from the 11Group Operation Room. The air operations section of Operation Overlord, the 6 June 1944 Normandy landings (<b>D-Day),</b> was also controlled from RAF Uxbridge. Orders from the station were the only ones issued to Allied air units on the day. The headquarters of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and 9th Tactical Air Force of the USAAF were stationed at Uxbridge while preparations were made for the invasion. On <b>D-Day,</b> the 11Group Controller was responsible for ensuring sufficient air patrols of the United Kingdom, the main shipping routes, and the beach landing areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the military personnel involved in the fighting, several Australian war correspondents reported on the Battle of Normandy. Chester Wilmot landed with the 6thAirborne Division on <b>D-Day,</b> and his coverage of the fighting for the BBC soon {{made him one of}} the best-known Allied war correspondents. Other Australian journalists in Normandy included John Hetherington, Geoff Hutton and Ronald Monson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to <b>D-Day,</b> {{full-scale}} rehearsals of Operation Peppermint were carried out in order to test the plan and the equipment. Ground and aerial surveys were also carried out to detect the presence of radioactive substances in troop concentration areas, and at sites in the United Kingdom that had been bombed, but none were detected.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond <b>D-Day).</b> Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the {{operations}} were successful, due {{to the complexity of}} their execution, poor weather, and lack of response from German forces. It is possible that they contributed to the overall confusion of <b>D-Day</b> as part of the wider Bodyguard plan.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth Harbour was a vital {{military}} embarkation {{point for}} the <b>D-Day</b> landings on 6June 1944. Southwick House, just {{to the north of}} the city, was the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower. On 15July 1944 an experimental V-1 flying bomb hit Newcomen Road, killing 15 people.|$|E
5|$|Royal Flush {{was also}} {{intended}} to support Operation Zeppelin, the 1944 overall deception {{plan for the}} Middle Eastern theatre. Zeppelin developed threats against Greece and Southern France between February and July. Its intention was to tie up German defensive forces in the region {{during the period of}} <b>D-Day.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 94th Infantry Division, {{with the}} troop in tow, landed on Utah Beach on 8 September 1944, 94 days after <b>D-Day.</b> It {{and moved into}} Brittany to assume {{responsibility}} for containing some 60,000 German troops besieged in the ports of Lorient and Saint-Nazaire. The 94th inflicted over 2,700 casualties on the German forces and took 566 prisoners before being relieved on 1 January 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{landings}} (codenamed Operation Neptune) {{were the}} landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (termed <b>D-Day)</b> of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. The largest seaborne invasion in history, the operation began {{the liberation of}} German-occupied northwestern Europe from Nazi control, {{and contributed to the}} Allied victory on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|The cross-channel {{invasion}} of France finally came on June 6, 1944, <b>D-Day,</b> {{otherwise known as}} Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied {{invasion of}} Normandy. The 29th Infantry Division sent the 116th Infantry to support the western flank of the veteran 1st Infantry Division's 16th Infantry at Omaha Beach. Omaha {{was known to be}} the most difficult of the five landing beaches, due to its rough terrain and bluffs overlooking the beach, which had been well fortified by its German defenders of the 352nd Infantry Division. The 116th Infantry was assigned four sectors of the beach; Easy Green, Dog Red, Dog White, and Dog Green. Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division boarded a large number of attack transports for the <b>D-Day</b> invasion, among them Landing craft, Landing Ship, Tank and Landing Ship, Infantry ships and other vessels such as the , , and USS Buncombe County.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{identify}} the reorganization of the defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for the Allies. Post-action reports still documented the original estimate and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance, a few days previously, {{as part of an}} anti-invasion exercise. The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on <b>D-Day</b> as reported by the 16th Infantry S-3 <b>D-Day</b> Action Report. In fact, Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4. This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army, but at that late stage in the operations, no plans were changed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} sortie of No.410 Squadron was from RAF Drem, East Lothian, Scotland, {{on the night}} of 4 June 1942, when twelve Beaufighter crews took off, and it {{went on to become the}} top-scoring night fighter squadron in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force during the period between <b>D-Day</b> and VE-Day.|$|E
5|$|The later {{experiences}} of the Canadian Army during the disastrous Dieppe Raid of 1942, American forces on Omaha Beach on <b>D-Day</b> and taking on Japanese defenders on Pacific Islands showed that under the right conditions, a defender could exact a terrible price from assaulting forces, significantly depleting and delaying enemy forces until reinforcements could be deployed to appropriate places via the sea and inland.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not appear}} to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the chain of command. It was executed some time before <b>D-Day,</b> {{and in the midst of}} several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} push inland towards Carpiquet and the Caen–Bayeux railway line achieved mixed results. The {{sheer numbers}} {{of men and}} vehicles on the beaches created lengthy delays between the landing of the 9th Brigade {{and the beginning of}} substantive attacks to the south. The 7th Brigade encountered heavy initial opposition before pushing south and making contact with the British 50th Division at Creully. The 8th Brigade encountered heavy resistance from a battalion of the 716th at Tailleville, while the 9th Brigade deployed towards Carpiquet early in the evening. Resistance in Saint-Aubin prevented the Royal Marines from establishing contact with the British 3rd Division on Sword. When all operations on the Anglo-Canadian front were ordered to halt at 21:00, by which time The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada had reached its <b>D-Day</b> objective, and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on <b>D-Day.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the port}} of Antwerp was vital for the Allies after <b>D-Day,</b> Admirals Cunningham and Ramsay warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the port was of no use while the Germans held the approaches. But Montgomery {{postponed}} the Battle of the Scheldt, and the delay in opening the port was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.|$|E
5|$|With this action, {{the last}} of the <b>D-Day</b> goals of the British 6th Airborne Division was achieved. They were {{reinforced}} at 12:00 by commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade, who landed on Sword Beach, and by the 6th Airlanding Brigade, who arrived in gliders at 21:00 in Operation Mallard.|$|E
5|$|Zeppelin was {{executed}} in five phases between February and July 1944. The story behind each stage developed various invasion threats against Greece, Albania, Croatia, Turkey, Bulgaria and France. The latter {{portions of the}} operation received their own codenames. Vendetta referred to a threat toward Southern France close to <b>D-Day</b> whilst Turpitude was the codename for {{the final stage of}} Zeppelin, an overland threat to Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider group for the British. On <b>D-Day</b> the first large group would be transported to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
5|$|According to the storyline for Ironside, {{ten days}} {{following}} <b>D-Day,</b> Allied forces would {{land in the}} Bordeaux region. This force would spend around twelve days establishing a bridgehead before advancing to meet formations supposedly part of an invasion of the Mediterranean coast of France (in reality these were fictional landings as well, part of another Bodyguard deception called Operation Vendetta). The supposed target of Ironside was {{the mouth of the}} Gironde estuary, with a landing site at Royan.|$|E
5|$|After <b>D-Day,</b> a {{new role}} was found for Hargest. Now that the Allies were on {{mainland}} Europe, thought was turning {{to the issue of}} dealing with the expected arrival of newly released New Zealanders from liberated prisoner of war camps. The 2NZEF Reception Group was set up to help repatriate them. Hargest was appointed the commander of the group but on 12 August 1944, was killed by shell fire during the Battle of Normandy, when he was making a farewell visit to the British 50th Division. Hargest is buried at the Hottot-les-Bagues War Cemetery in France.|$|E
5|$|After the US {{entered the}} war and the British Army {{recovered}} from its earlier defeats, it defeated the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in North Africa in 1942–1943 and helped drive them from Africa. It then fought through Italy and, with the help of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces, took part in the <b>D-Day</b> invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British. In the Far East, the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the Burma Campaign and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.|$|E
