2500|$|The no {{ball was}} at first ruled for {{overstepping}} the bowling crease only. Legislation against [...] "throwing" [...] was first attempted in 1816 when roundarm was coming into use. It was ruled then that the bowler's <b>hand</b> on <b>delivery</b> must not be above the elbow. In many matches, this rule was flagrantly disregarded and matters {{came to a head}} in 1827 with the roundarm trial matches. There was no control over bowling action until 1835 when it was ruled that the bowler's <b>hand</b> on <b>delivery</b> must not be above his shoulder. In 1864, overarm bowling was authorised. The rule allowing either of the umpires to call a no ball was introduced in 1899.|$|R

5000|$|Retrieve to hand: Although some hunters {{prefer to}} have a bird dropped at their feet, the {{majority}} of handlers require the dog to deliver the game to hand, meaning once the dog has completed the retrieve, it will gently but firmly hold the bird until commanded to release it to the handler’s <b>hand.</b> <b>Delivery</b> to hand {{reduces the risk of}} a crippled bird escaping, as the bird remains in the dog's mouth until the handler takes hold of it.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{majority}} of proteins {{are unable to}} translocate into the cell interior. Hence for peptide- and protein-based therapeutics a direct intracytoplasmic delivery {{with the aid of}} transducing agents is an attractive approach. We wanted to deliver to the cell interior a putatively cytotoxic protein VPg. Protein transduction was achieved in vitro with three different commercial products. However, in our <b>hands,</b> <b>delivery</b> of various control proteins without known deleterious effects, as well as of protein VPg, always induced cell death. Finally, we used a novel transducing peptide Wr-T, which was not toxic to cultured cells, even in a quite large range of concentrations. Most importantly, control protein delivered to cells in culture did not display any toxicity while VPg protein exerted a strong cytotoxic effect. These data show that results obtained with cell-penetrating agents should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an {{efficient}} event delivery algorithm called distributed group mobility adaptive event delivery (GMED) for delay tolerant mobile sensor networks (DTMSN). GMED {{is designed to}} establish a group-based event delivery model by effectively finding and utilizing the groups generated by moving sensor nodes which then lead an improved performance: On one <b>hand,</b> Inter-Group <b>delivery</b> will be achieved by multi-replica delivery based on its delivery probability to the sink. On the other <b>hand,</b> Intra-Group <b>delivery</b> will be performed by single-replica delivery through established transmission paths because each node have stable neighbor sets inside group. Meanwhile, delivery prioritizing {{will be based on}} event priority in the queue. Furthermore, a redundant replica control mechanism is also introduced to optimize replica management and network overload. Simulation results have shown that GMED not only achieves a relatively long network lifetime, but also has a higher message delivery ratio at lower transmission overhead and delay than other DTMSN data delivering approaches. Key words: DTMSN (delay tolerant mobile sensor networks); group mobility; opportunistic probability; transmission path 摘 要: 提出了一种基于分布式群组移动的事件分类传输策 略 GMED(distributed group mobility adaptive even...|$|R

50|$|Order brokers are {{third-party}} {{agents that}} display arrangement and bouquet product images and then transfer orders to affiliated local florists for fulfillment and <b>hand</b> <b>delivery.</b> Order broker customers pay additional service fees {{as well as}} local delivery charges, which are generally included in the price displayed with each product. Orders are sent to local florists for fulfillment via a floral wire service. The advantage of this service is the consolidation of purchases for delivery to multiple locations through a single website.

50|$|While {{providing}} data {{in response}} to a legitimate FISA request approved by the FISA Court is a legal requirement, modifying systems {{to make it easier for}} the government to collect the data is not. This is why Twitter could legally decline to provide an enhanced mechanism for data transmission. Other than Twitter, the companies were effectively asked to construct a locked mailbox and provide the key to the government, people briefed on the negotiations said. Facebook, for instance, built such a system for requesting and sharing the information.

50|$|According to the U.S. Supreme Court, {{the power}} of {{administrative}} levy for federal taxes {{dates back to the}} year 1791. The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution forbids the government (whether state or federal) from taking an individual’s property without due process of law. This rule applies to an IRS levy. To comply with the U.S. Constitution, the IRS must provide the taxpayer notice of the coming levy and an opportunity to be heard. Under §6330(a)(2), the IRS must send to the taxpayer a notice by either personal <b>hand</b> <b>delivery,</b> or through certified mail, or left at the taxpayer's usual place of business.

30|$|The {{relatively}} high impact of traffic congestion on the CO 2 {{efficiency of the}} delivery trips may also be explained with the traffic effect on the total kilometers travelled. On the one hand, traffic congestion causes additional kilometers travelled because of detours avoiding congested regions. On the other <b>hand,</b> additional <b>delivery</b> trips are occasionally needed to supply the customers (76 extra tours are only due to traffic congestion). The average number of customers served per trip is 6.73 in the free-flow and 6.45 in the normal situation (− 4.2  %).

40|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>delivery</b> of self-administered {{questionnaires}} {{has been}} presented as an alternative for reducing non-coverage error associated with the mail method at lower cost than face-to-face interviews. This research note draws from experiences using the <b>hand</b> <b>delivery</b> technique (combined with hand retrieval) in rural and small community studies to address practical issues associated with improving coverage, and its relationships with sampling, response, and administrative considerations. It is suggested that while this technique provides needed flexibility in relation to household enumeration options, logistical issues limit its applicability where settlement patterns are dispersed and resources to supplement sampling frames are inadequate. Time and cost outlays are required to maximize its potential. When place-related and administrative conditions can be met, the technique offers promise for reducing non-coverage error and possible sample bias without sacrificing response rates. In addition, it provides opportunities to gain experiential insights not possible with other survey methods...|$|E
