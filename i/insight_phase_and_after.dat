40|$|Purpose. To compare ovarian stromal {{blood flow}} indices in the {{follicular}} <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> clomiphene citrate (CC) in infertile women. Methods. Pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), and peak systolic blood flow velocity (PSV) of ovarian stromal vessels {{were determined by}} spectral Doppler analysis in the early follicular <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> on day 10 after CC. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol concentrations were determined. Results. A total of 69 infertile women {{were included in the}} analysis. No significant differences in the average PI, RI, and PSV of ovarian stromal blood flow were demonstrated in the follicular <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> CC despite a significant increase in serum estradiol concentration after CC. Serum FSH concentration was similar in the follicular <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> CC, while serum LH concentration was significantly higher after CC. In the right ovary, ovarian stromal blood flow was absent in 13 (18. 8 %) patients in the follicular <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> in 6 (8. 7 %) patients after CC, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the left ovary, ovarian stromal blood flow was absent in 13 (18. 8 %) and 12 (17. 4 %) patients in the follicular <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> CC, respectively. Conclusion. Ovarian stromal blood flow indices were similar in the follicular <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> CC. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Previous reports {{showed that}} chromatin-associated PCNA couples DNA {{replication}} with Cul 4 -DDB 1 Cdt 2 -dependent proteolysis of the licensing factor Cdt 1. The CDK inhibitor p 21, another PCNA-binding protein, is also degraded both in S <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> UV irradiation. Here {{we show that}} p 21 is degraded by the same ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as Cdt 1 in HeLa cells. When PCNA or components of Cul 4 -DDB 1 Cdt 2 were silenced or when the PCNA binding site on p 21 was mutated, degradation of p 21 was prevented both in S <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> UV irradiation. p 21 was co-immunoprecipitated with Cul 4 A and DDB 1 proteins when expressed in cells. The purified Cul 4 A-DDB 1 Cdt 2 complex ubiquitinated p 21 in vitro. Consistently, p 21 protein levels are low during S <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> increase around G 2 phase. Mutational analysis suggested {{that in addition to}} the PCNA binding domain, its flanking regions are also important for recognition by Cul 4 -DDB 1 Cdt 2.

50|$|In a thin soft phase, it is {{hard for}} the {{external}} field to rotate the magnetic moments, similar to a hard magnet with high saturation magnetization. After applying a high external field to partially demagnetize the magnetic moments in the hard <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> subsequently removing the external field, the rotated moments in the soft phase can be rotated back by exchange coupling with the hard phase (Figure 5). This phenomenon is shown in the hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet (Figure 6).|$|R

40|$|Cell cycle checkpoints are {{evolutionarily}} conserved surveillance {{systems that}} protect genomic stability and prevent oncogenesis in mammals. One important target of checkpoint control is ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in dNTP and DNA synthesis. In both yeast and humans, RNR is transcriptionally induced after DNA damage via Mec 1 /Rad 53 (yeast) and ATM/CHK 2 (human) checkpoint pathways. In addition, yeast checkpoint proteins Mec 1 and Rad 53 also regulate the RNR inhibitor Sml 1. After DNA damage or at S <b>phase,</b> Mec 1 <b>and</b> Rad 53 control the phosphorylation and concomitant degradation of Sml 1 protein. This new layer of control {{contributes to the}} increased dNTP production likely necessary for DNA repair and replication; however, the molecular mechanism is unclear. Here we show that Dun 1, a downstream kinase of Mec 1 /Rad 53, genetically and physically interacts with Sml 1 in vivo. The absence of Dun 1 activity leads to the accumulation of Sml 1 protein at S <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> DNA damage. As a result, dun 1 Δ strains need more time to finish DNA replication, are defective in mitochondrial DNA propagation, and are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. Moreover, phospho-Sml 1 is absent or dramatically reduced in dun 1 Δ cells. Finally, Dun 1 can phosphorylate Sml 1 in vitro. These results suggest that Dun 1 kinase function is the last step required in the Mec 1 /Rad 53 cascade to remove Sml 1 during S <b>phase</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> DNA damage...|$|R

The vulnerability and distress appeared to affect the patient perception of and response to symptoms and must be taken into account. As postoperative recovery is an energy-consuming process involving physical, psychological, social and habitual functions (Allvin et al. 2007), the process does not only include physical symptoms as described in fast-track information.|$|R
