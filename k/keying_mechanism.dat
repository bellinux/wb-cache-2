5000|$|There {{were many}} {{heliograph}} types. Most heliographs were variants of the British Army Mance Mark V version (Fig.1). It used a mirror {{with a small}} unsilvered spot in the centre. The sender aligned the heliograph to the target {{by looking at the}} reflected target in the mirror and moving their head until the target was hidden by the unsilvered spot. Keeping their head still, they then adjusted the aiming rod so its cross wires bisected the target. They then turned up the sighting vane, which covered the cross wires with a diagram of a cross, and aligned the mirror with the tangent and elevation screws so the small shadow that was the reflection of the unsilvered spot hole was on the cross target. [...] This indicated that the sunbeam was pointing at the target. The flashes were produced by a <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism</b> that tilted the mirror up a few degrees at the push of a lever {{at the back of the}} instrument. If the sun was in front of the sender, its rays were reflected directly from this mirror to the receiving station. If the sun was behind the sender, the sighting rod was replaced by a second mirror, to capture the sunlight from the main mirror and reflect it to the receiving station. The U. S. Signal Corps heliograph mirror did not tilt. This type produced flashes by a shutter mounted on a second tripod (Fig 4).|$|E

There are many key management techniques used to implement group communication in a secured manner but the key distribution is always being an issue in WSN because of limited capabilities and vulnerable nature of WSN. The proposed WSN totally uses three sort of keys namely Master key, session key and pair wise keys for secured communication are used in WSN. The main goal is to provide secured node to node communication by using efficient pair wise <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism</b> and it uses secret code for secure communication. It provides the better robustness, authentication and more security. The proposed WSN architecture has two hierarchy layers known as H end and L end sensor layers in a cluster. Secured communication between Low end node (L) to Low end node (L) and High end node (H) to High end node (H) follows efficient pair wise <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism.</b> To establish secured communication between Low end node (L) to High end node (H) and Cluster Head (CH) to Cluster Head (CH), new node key should be established before establishing pair wise <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Master key is established for the broadcasting of Base Station (BS) to all other nodes.

40|$|Abstract — The pre-shared <b>key</b> based <b>mechanisms</b> for Transport Layer Security (TLS) were {{recently}} standardized by the IETF {{to extend the}} set of ciphersuites by utilizing existing key management infrastructures. The benefit of pre-shared based mechanisms is the avoidance or reduction of the cryptographic operations used in public-key based mechanisms. However, so far there are no performance measurements for pre-shared key based ciphersuites available. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis and performance comparison between the pre-shared <b>key</b> exchange <b>mechanisms</b> and the standard public <b>key</b> exchange <b>mechanisms</b> in TLS. Our performance metrics are processing time and transmitted amount of data for a handshake establishment. Furthermore, {{the interaction between the}} overall TLS handshake duration and the network environment is evaluated.

Usually the sensor nodes are deployed in a dangerous and untrusted area. Therefore,network security becomes very important. Key management is the core areas of the security. In this paper,we describe EPKM(Efficient and Practical Key Management Scheme),a key management protocol for the hierarchical wireless sensor networks. EPKM adopts the main idea of multiple <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism</b> which includes key establishment and updating procedures. It supports four types of keys for each node–an individual key shared with the gateway, a data encryption key shared with another node, a cluster key shared with the cluster head,and a global key that is initially preloaded by all the nodes. Compared to other key management schemes,our scheme used for establishing and updating these keys is efficient and practical as well as low storage and communication.

40|$|Certificate based keying {{scheme for}} DTLS secured IoT draft-pporamba-dtls-certkey- 00 The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) {{stands for the}} {{universal}} interconnection of smart objects and back end users {{with the help of}} IP protocols. Secure key management among the smart objects is an important aspect of IoT security. Due to the high levels of resource constraints of the devices in terms of memory, battery capacity and CPU power, and other network characteristics such as mobility, scalability, heterogeneity and limited bandwidth, the conventional security protocols cannot be directly deployed in IoT networks in their raw formats. We propose a lightweight DTLS-based <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism</b> for CoAP IoT smart objects which supports the scalability of the network and node mobility. The protocol consumes less device resources and minimum network bandwidth by incurring low message overhead. The smart objects can securely access the network and obtain certificates after an initial configuration irrespective of the manufacturer standards. Requirements Languag...|$|E
40|$|With rapid {{development}} and {{extensive use of}} wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is urgent to enhance the security for WSNs, in which key management is {{an effective way to}} protect WSNs from various attacks. However, different types of messages exchanged in WSNs typically have different security requirements which cannot be satisfied by a single <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In this study, a basic key management protocol is described for WSNs based on four kinds of keys, which can be derived from an initial master key, and an enhanced protocol is proposed based on Diffie-Hellman algorithm. The proposed scheme restricts the adverse security impact of a captured node to the rest of WSNs and meets the requirement of energy efficiency by supporting in-network processing. The master key protection, key revocation mechanism, and the authentication mechanism based on one-way hash function are, respectively, discussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed from the aspects of computational efficiency, storage requirement and communication cost, and its antiattack capability in protecting WSNs is discussed under various attack models. In this paper, promising research directions are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor Networks (WSNs) {{deployed}} in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) applications should {{be integrated into}} the Internet. According to the distributed architecture, sensor nodes measure data, process, exchange information, and perform collaboratively with other sensor nodes and end-users, which can be internal or external to the network. In order to maintain the trustworthy connectivity and the accessibility of distributed IoT, it is important to establish secure links for end-to-end communication with a strong pervasive authentication mechanism. However, due to the resource constraints and heterogeneous characteristics of the devices, traditional authentication and key management schemes are not effective for such applications. This paper proposes a pervasive lightweight authentication and <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism</b> for WSNs in distributed IoT applications, in which the sensor nodes can establish secured links with peer sensor nodes and end-users. The established authentication scheme PAuthKey is based on implicit certificates and it provides application level end-to-end security.

With the performance evaluation and the security analysis, it is justified that the proposed scheme is viable to deploy in the resource constrained WSNs...|$|E

The main challenges to the deployment of tactical WSNs for mission-centric operations are limited nodal energy and information security. In this paper we develop security mechanisms to be implemented on a tactical WSN using the 6 LoWPAN protocol {{for use by the}} United States Marine Corps (USMC). Specifically, we develop an architectural framework for tactical WSNs by studying security gaps and vulnerabilities within the 6 LoWPAN security sublayer which is based on IEEE 802. 15. 4. We develop a key management scheme that is non-broadcast but that is also feasible in an operational scenario. In addition, we modify the 6 LoWPAN packet structure to facilitate the newly developed <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The tactical WSN architecture is designed to defend against a variety of network attacks that can potentially occur. Simulations will be conducted via MATLAB to show the effectiveness of the developed keying and communication mechanisms.

In this method, the four different speech signals with different time duration are sampled and its values are permuted using logistic map and further the permuted values are segmented into four levels. Each level is permuted using four different chaotic generators. Chaotic shift <b>keying</b> <b>mechanism</b> is dynamically assigning different chaotic maps to {{different levels of}} sampled values for shuffling the speech samples at every level. The histogram of the encrypted signal shows that more sensitivity entails more security. The decrypted signal {{is very similar to}} the original speech as it shows the stability of reconstruction of original signal. Correlation test, SNR test, and PSNR testing methods are applied to estimate the performance of the system. The result obtained by the proposed system is highly screened from attackers and has a powerful diffusion and confusion mechanism and better for real-time speech communication. It is verified that the proposed method has high level of security and can recover the original signals quickly with good audio quality. Robustness test has also been carried out by using NSCR and UACI to assess the withstanding capacity of the algorithm against various attacks. The results endorse that the speech signal is highly masked from eavesdroppers.|$|E
