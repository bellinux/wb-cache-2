500|$|The Gresley 3-cylinder drive {{arrangement}} continued {{to bring a}} number of practical problems, the root of which was probably {{the need for the}} inside cylinder to be steeply inclined in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle; at the same time, the inside valve spindle had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion. This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a [...] "twist in the ports" [...] (the passages that carried steam {{in and out of the}} cylinders).

A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear. Although this had been anticipated at the design stage, the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased, leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings, especially the big-end which was liable to overheat and fail. Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment, and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the big-end bearing. Other problems persisted, such as a stiff, insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Unusually, outside {{admission}} {{was used}} for the piston valves of the cylinders. Conventionally, piston valve locomotives had inside admission, whereas outside admission was used with slide valve locomotives. Outside admission gives a shorter <b>exhaust</b> <b>passage,</b> with the consequent advantages of a lower back pressure and sharper blast, but with the disadvantage that the valve spindle glands must be made to withstand much higher pressures and temperatures. Robinson had previously used outside admission for his class 11D rebuilds from class 11B, and the new class 11E used the same cylinder casting as those rebuilds. When further 4-4-0s of similar capability to class 11E were required after World War I, these were given normal cylinders with inside admission for the piston valves, and so were placed in class 11F.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} RDX {{is powered by}} turbocharged gasoline engines; at the time, this was uncommon among Honda vehicles although it has since become common. The 2.3-litre straight-4 K23A1 engine has all-aluminum construction, an i-VTEC head, and dual balance shafts. It {{is also one of}} the only four-cylinder powered luxury SUVs. Honda's variable flow turbocharger reduces turbo lag by using a valve to narrow the <b>exhaust</b> <b>passage</b> at low rpm, increasing the velocity of the exhaust flow and keeping the turbine spinning rapidly. At higher rpm, the valve opens to allow more exhaust flow for increased boost. The engine also features a top-mounted intercooler which receives air from the grille, channeled by ducting under the hood. The Acura RDX engine is rated at [...] at 6000 rpm with a torque peak of 260 ftlbf Nm at 4500 rpm. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated fuel mileage is 19 mpg city and 23 mpg highway miles per gallon. Driving style and the terrain plays an important part in this Vehicle's fuel economy. Uphill driving, frequent lane changes and sudden accelerations can increase turbo usage to increase torque output to the SH-AWD system and thus cause much higher fuel consumption. New more recent EPA mileage estimates as of February 2007 are 17 mpg city and 22 mpg highway. The required fuel is premium 91 octane unleaded.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} V8, the block was {{relatively}} light for the displacement supported. The {{bottom of the}} block formed the parting line for the main bearing caps. The most complex part of the block was the <b>exhaust</b> <b>passage</b> routing. The exhaust valves were {{on the inside of}} the V and exhaust flow was initially downward and passed around the cylinders through the water jacket to exit on the outside of the cylinder block. The routing of the exhaust through the water jacket put an extremely heavy load on the cooling system and led to frequent overheating, especially on early models, if the cooling system were not maintained. Somewhat primitive water pumps used until the advent of the 1948 8RT and 1949 8BA models also contributed to the overheating problem. The space for the exhaust flow was also somewhat restricted, so the exhaust passages were tall and narrow in some locations. The gas flow past the rough sand castings could be greatly improved by polishing the passages. The capacity of the block for over-boring (beyond normal boring for wear compensation) was limited by the configuration and the metal available. In early blocks, some cylinder walls were extremely thin due to cores shifting during casting. It was prudent to overbore before relieving and polishing the ports, as a casting flaw such as a sand pit might be revealed, usually fatal to further use of the block. The blocks with the factory 3- (3.1875) inch bore can usually be safely bored 1/8 inch over standard to 3.3125 in and sometimes can be bored 3/16 inch over standard to 3.375 in, increasing displacement a little over 12%.|$|E

50|$|The Kadenacy {{effect is}} {{an effect of}} pressure-waves in gases. It is named after Michel Kadenacy who {{obtained}} a French patent for an engine utilizing the effect in 1933.

In simple terms, {{the momentum of the}} exhaust gas leaving the cylinder of an internal combustion engine creates a pressure-drop in the cylinder which assists the flow of a fresh charge of air, or fuel-air mixture, into the cylinder. The effect can be maximized by careful design of the inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>passages.</b>|$|R
50|$|More extreme {{modifications}} were {{to improve}} the airflow by removing material {{from the top of}} the block between the valves and the cylinders (called relieving), increasing the size of the inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>passages</b> (called porting), and by polishing the sand-cast surfaces to improve fuel flow. Increased compression ratios could be cheaply obtained by milling material from the head or by obtaining aluminum heads as aftermarket parts. Higher capacity intake manifolds were similarly available. Changing the camshaft to a higher performance version required head removal so that the valves could be held up out of the way, so this was usually done only as part of a substantial rework of the basic engine.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a failure analysis on a modern high performance diesel {{engine cylinder head}} made of gray cast iron. Cracks appeared intensively {{at the intersection of}} two exhaust passages in the cylinder head. The metallurgical examination was conducted in the crack origin zone and other zones.

The results showed that both the point of the maximum temperature and the point of the maximum thermal-mechanical coupling stress were not in the crack position. The excessive load was not the main cause of the failure. The large cooling rate in the casting process created an abnormal graphite zone that existed {{below the surface of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>passage</b> (about 1. 1 mm depth), which led to the fracture of the cylinder head. In the fractured area, there were a large number of casting defects (dip sand, voids, etc.) and inferior graphite structure (type D, type E) which caused stress concentration. Moreover, high temperature gas entered the cracks, which caused material corrosion, material oxidization, and crack propagation. Finally, premature fracture of the cylinder head took place...|$|E

The <b>exhaust</b> <b>passages</b> would then be isolated from the blast pipe and air would be admitted to the steam chests. The air would enter the cylinders though the exhaust ports and therefore reversed operations in the cylinders. Used air would be exhausted through the steam inlet ports back into the steam pipe, from where it was led {{to the rear of}} the engine by a 1+1/2 in branch pipe. This branch pipe had another valve, by which the driver could regulate the amount of compression in the cylinders. Small amounts of water could be admitted into the cylinders to keep them cool.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the basic}} terms of machine elements, the various main parts of an engine (such as {{cylinder}}(s), cylinder head(s), coolant <b>passages,</b> intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>passages,</b> and crankcase) are conceptually distinct, and these items {{can all be}} made as discrete pieces that are bolted together. Such construction was very widespread {{in the early decades}} of the commercialization of internal combustion engines (1880s to 1920s), and it is still sometimes used in certain applications where it remains advantageous (especially very large engines, but also some small engines). However, it is no longer the normal way of building most petrol engines and diesel engines, because for any given engine configuration, there are more efficient ways of designing for manufacture (and also for maintenance and repair). These generally involve integrating multiple machine elements into one discrete part, and doing the making (such as casting, stamping, and machining) for multiple elements in one setup with one machine coordinate system (of a machine tool or other piece of manufacturing machinery). This yields lower unit cost of production (and/or maintenance and repair).|$|R

These passages are exposed to wide temperature swings during engine operation, and there are high temperature gradients within the valve mechanism.|$|R

40|$|Acceptance {{testing of}} the Turboprop Test Chamber was {{conducted}} during the weeks of 27 April and 4 May 1964. The tests were conducted by personnel from the Overhaul and Repair Department, Alameda Naval Air Station, from the Bureau of Naval Weapons Fleet Readiness RepresentÂ­ative, Pacific and from the USNPGS Department of Aeronautics. The power plant utilized for correlating purposes for a T- 56 -lOW turboprop engine, recently overhauled at NAS Alameda while the propeller was the Hamilton Standard model required for this engine. The test data reveal satisfactory correlation of the engine performance data with the Alameda test results. The discrepancies that do appear {{are the result of}} errors in the instrumentation system and do not present a major problem. All of the major facility systems function satisfactorily except the oil supply system and the chamber lighting fixtures. Engine starting and control systems were adequate although somewhat different from the designs utilized in the NAVWEPS specificaÂ­tions for this engine. The engine support stand and thrust measuring assembly were found to be structurally sound and functioned satisfactorily. The propeller orifice assembly did not induce prohibitive vibrational stresses as was anticipated. However, the vibrational loads did cause the majority of the orifice retaining bolts to loosen during the test sequence. Three bolts were found beneath the test stand; these could have caused object damage to the engine. The major areas of discrepancy are the engine oil supply system and the test chamber lighting fixtures. The engine oil system as designed could not satisfy the requirements for the T- 56 series engine. It was necessary to re-route the oil by-pass system, to obtain a more precise control of the engine oil supply and pressure, and to provide a method to heat the oil for operation of the engine at high power setÂ­tings. The system as temporarily modified, did function adequately during the test period. The lighting fixtures mounted on swivel joint bases oscillated vioÂ­lently when operating the engine at Idle power. One fixture above the engine broke loose during this short period and was blown clear of the engine stand by the propeller air stream. All ceiling-mounted light fixtures were removed from the chamber before further engine operation. The acoustic survey revealed that the acoustic paneling in the inÂ­ let and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>passages</b> functioned satisfactorily. However, the Sound Pressure Level reduction across the chamber front double-doors did not meet the specified limits. Corrective action is required to (1) provide adequate and safe lighting in the test chamber, (2) re-design and install an oil supply system compatible for operation with the T- 56 engine, and (3) provide positive locking devices on all bolted fixtures in the test chambers...|$|R

Generally, these include: a high octane rating, wide ammability limits, a high gravimetric energy content, reduced CO 2 output, {{and lower levels of}} harmful exhaust gas emissions. However, natural gas presents some unique challenges due to its low density and slow laminar burning velocity. The former causes issues with volumetric e ciency and/or charge homogeneity depending on the fuel delivery method. The latter results in prolonged combustion durations that are counter-productive to high fuel conversion e ciencies. A split-cycle engine divides the conventional four-stroke engine process between two adjoining cylinders: one cylinder for intake and compression, the second cylinder for combustion and <b>exhaust.</b> The <b>passage</b> that connects these two cylinders together provides an alternative location for fuel injection and mixing. Furthermore, the uid exchange process occurring from this passage to the combustion chamber is a source of turbulence generation desired to enhance the rate of combustion.

Therefore, we evaluated {{the influence of the}} passage number and different osteogenic culture supplements, including ascorbic acid (AsAP) and dexamethasone (Dex) on the osteogenic capacity of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. This capacity was measured by the deposited calcium, the alkaline phosphatase activity, and the expression of osteogenic-related genes, including bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OC), and osteopontin (OPN). The results indicated that the mineralization capacity of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells significantly decreased during <b>passaging</b> and got <b>exhausted</b> at <b>passage</b> 34, as assessed by measuring calcium deposition after 28 days of osteogenic induction. Moreover, the combination of AsAP and Dex triggered significantly more mineralization in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells than the ATCC recommended addition of AsAP alone, as indicated by increased calcium deposition and higher expression of BSP and OPN. However, Dex alone could not trigger this effect, but only in combination with the AsAP, which indicates that Dex has no direct effect on mineralization. In conclusion, the passage number of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells is of great importance and the use of cells above 30 passages should be avoided. In addition, the favored osteogenic supplements providing an improved osteogenic differentiation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells are the combination of AsAP and Dex...|$|R

Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Fortunately, each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980's.|$|R
