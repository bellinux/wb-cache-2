50|$|Alberto Castagna {{started working}} as a {{journalist}} for the newspapers Il Piccolo and Settimanale.

In 1988, he collaborated with Pippo Baudo for one <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>primetime</b> show Serata d'onore and then hosted the morning shows Mattina 2 and, in 1992, I fatti vostri, both directed by Michele Guardì.|$|R

In 1989 the script {{was published in}} the charity fundraiser The Utterly, Utterly Amusing and Pretty Damn Definitive Comic Relief Revue Book under the title [...] "The Good Old Days", with the characters named as Joshua, Obadiah, Josiah and Ezekiel. This book was launched on an <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>primetime</b> chat show Wogan where the sketch was {{performed by}} Terry Wogan, Stephen Fry, Gareth Hale and Norman Pace.|$|R
50|$|In late 2005, WBKI-TV {{entered into}} a news share {{agreement}} with ABC affiliate WHAS-TV (channel 11) to produce a nightly prime time newscast for the station; the program, known as WHAS 11 News at 10:00 on WBKI, premiered on January 2, 2006. After Block Communications began operating WBKI-TV under the LMA with WDRB and WMYO, the station chose not to renew the news share agreement with WDRB opting to launch its own newscast on channel 34 (as a result, WDRB {{became one of the}} few Fox stations to produce a newscast for another station in the same market). On September 17, 2012, WDRB began producing a half-hour weeknight 7:00 p.m. newscast, the WDRB Local Evening News at 7:00 on WBKI, which utilizes the same anchor team as that seen on WDRB's 6:30 p.m. newscast. This resulted in a rare situation in which two competing stations produced newscast for another station in the same market; WHAS-TV continued to produce the 10:00 p.m. newscast in the interim. The weekend <b>editions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>primetime</b> newscast were dropped after the September 30, 2012 broadcast; the weeknight editions followed suit one month later on October 26, leaving only the WDRB-produced early newscast.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{re-tooling}} <b>of</b> NFL <b>Primetime,</b> Chris Berman and Tom Jackson {{were given}} an extended segment of the Sunday night <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> SportsCenter (11 p.m. ET) called The Blitz. The segment follows the same structure as the original version <b>of</b> NFL <b>Primetime,</b> featuring Berman and Jackson using the same player nicknames, catch phrases, and back-and-forth banter as the original show.|$|R
50|$|Mariel Rodriguez {{took over}} as main host <b>of</b> the <b>primetime</b> <b>edition,</b> while former Celebrity Edition {{contestant}} Bianca Gonzalez hosted the UpLate <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the show. Toni Gonzaga {{on the other hand}} returned only to host The Big Night.|$|R
50|$|In late 2002, Sinclair Broadcast Group {{announced}} plans to launch News Central, a local/national format that would provide national news segments that would be syndicated via centralcasting {{to each of the}} company's news-producing outlets for insertion into their local newscasts. When NewsCentral launched in January 2003, KOKH began incorporating pre-recorded weather reports produced at production facilities in the ground floor of Sinclair's Beaver Dam Road headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland on the Friday and Saturday <b>editions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Primetime</b> News at Nine, as well as The Point (now titled Behind the Headlines), a one-minute conservative political commentary feature by Sinclair's then-vice president Mark Hyman. When the station began carrying the News Central inserts on a regular basis on March 31, 2003, local news segments continued to be based out of the KOKH studios and the station maintained its own locally based anchors and reporters; however, the station laid off staff in its weather and sports departments (including chief meteorologist Amy Gardner, weekend evening meteorologist Greg Whitworth, sports director Zach Klein, and sports anchor/reporters Ari Bergeron and Mark Ross) as well as eight other production employees with the news department. Sports segments as well as Sunday through Thursday weather segments shown during the prime time newscast began to be produced out of the Hunt Valley facility, while local sports headlines began to be conducted by the program's main news anchor. The first time that KOKH programmed news outside its established 9:00 slot was in February 2004, when it premiered the Fox 25 Late Edition, a half-hour weeknight 10:00 p.m. newscast (it is currently one of more than three dozen Fox stations in the U.S. that produces a newscast in the traditional late news timeslot, 10:00 p.m. in the Central Time Zone). In 2005, the station debuted Oklahoma's Most Wanted, a weekly segment based on the format of former Fox series America's Most Wanted that aired during the Saturday <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the 9:00 p.m. newscast, which profiled wanted criminals being sought by law enforcement for various felonies.|$|R
50|$|When {{the network}} was announced, The WB planned to run a predominately network {{programmed}} schedule over time. It was originally slated to launch with two nights <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> programming in its first year, and two additional nights <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> programming, a nightly half-hour in late <b>primetime,</b> 4½ hours <b>of</b> weekday daytime programming and a four-hour Saturday morning children's lineup in its second year. By the third year, a fifth night <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> and 1½ hours of weekday programming outside <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> would have been added, followed by an additional hour <b>of</b> programming in <b>primetime</b> and 1½ hours on weekday afternoons by the network's fourth year, and a seventh night <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> in the fifth year of operation. However, this plan was scaled back dramatically, as The WB launched with only one night <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> programming; and by September 1995, the network added only one additional night (Sundays), along with a three-hour Saturday morning and one-hour weekday morning children's block.|$|R
