40|$|This essay {{investigates the}} {{structure}} of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations,</b> specifically the <b>obligation</b> of loyalty. <b>Fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> differ from promissory obligations {{with respect to the}} possibility of “accidental compliance. ” Promissory obligations can be satis- fied through behavior that conforms to a promise, even if that behavior is done for inappropriate reasons. By contrast, fiduciary loyalty necessarily has an intentional dimension, one that prevents satisfaction through accidental compliance. The intentional dimension of fiduciary loyalty is best described by what we call the “shaping” account. This account both explains the conscientiousness that loyalty demands and improves on other accounts of the intentional dimension of loyalty. Our analysis challenges two of the most prominent ways of conceptualizing <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations.</b> “Contractarianism” configures <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> as a species of contractual duties. The view that we call “proscriptivism” reduces <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> to the juridical prohibitions that apply to fiduciaries. Neither of these approaches is satisfactory, because each neglects the intentional dimension of fiduciary loyalty...|$|R
2500|$|A {{fiduciary}} duty, is {{the highest}} standard of care at either equity or law. A fiduciary {{is expected to be}} extremely loyal to the person to whom he owes the duty (the [...] "principal"): such that there must be no conflict of duty between fiduciary and principal, and the fiduciary must not profit from his position as a fiduciary. (unless the principal consents). The nature of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> differ among jurisdictions. In Australia, only proscriptive or negative <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> are recognised, [...] whereas in Canada fiduciaries can come under both proscriptive and prescriptive (positive) <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations.</b>|$|R

50|$|In philanthropy, donor {{intent is}} the purpose, {{sometimes}} publicly expressed, {{for which a}} philanthropist intends a charitable gift or bequest.

50|$|The law of {{confidence}} and the law relating to <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> are not coextensive and yet are not completely distinct. A claim for breach {{of confidence}} will only be made out, however, when it is shown that the confidee has misused {{the information to the}} detriment of the confider. Fiduciary law, however, is concerned with the duty of loyalty and does not require that harm result. Duties of confidence, unlike <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations,</b> can arise outside a direct relationship. Another difference is that breach of confidence also has a jurisdictional base at law, and accordingly can draw on remedies available in both law and equity, whereas <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> arise only in equity and can only draw upon equitable remedies.|$|R
40|$|This essay, {{to appear}} in Contract, Status, and Fiduciary Law (Miller 2 ̆ 6 Gold, 2016), explores three ways <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> might be like {{contractual}} ones: in the methods lawmakers use or should use to determine {{the content of the}} obligation; in the private voluntary acts that generate the obligation; and {{in the fact that the}} obligation is a default that parties have the power to alter. The thesis is that to the extent that these similarities exist, they are not especially revealing. Theorists who emphasize the similarities commonly treat contract law as a private power-conferring rule, then analogize the law of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> to it. In fact, the law of contract is more complex and serves a broader range of purposes than just giving private parties the ability to undertake legal obligations when they choose. Contract obligations are sometimes imposed for reasons other than party choice, and contract defaults and altering rules can be designed to serve other social purposes. A more nuanced understanding of the functions and design of contract law suggests that structural similarities between <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> and contractual ones tell us less about the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations</b> than we might have hoped. The explanation of why that is so, however, reveals important features both of contract law and of the law of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations...</b>|$|R

Courts have so far refused to define the concept of a fiduciary, instead preferring to develop the law on a case-by-case basis and by way of analogy. Fiduciary relationships are of different types and carry different obligations so that a test appropriate to determine whether a fiduciary relationship exists for one purpose might be inappropriate for another: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{foundation}} and ambit of the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligation</b> are conceptually {{distinct from the}} {{foundation and}} ambit of contract and tort. Sometimes the doctrines may overlap in their application, {{but that does not}} destroy their conceptual and functional uniqueness. In negligence and contract the parties are taken to be independent and equal actors, concerned primarily with their own self-interest. Consequently, the law seeks a balance between enforcing obligations by awarding compensation when those obligations are breached, and preserving optimum freedom for those involved in the relationship in question. The essence of a fiduciary relationship, by contrast, is that one party exercises power on behalf of another and pledges himself or herself to act {{in the best interests of}} the other.|$|E

Consequently, past infringements of the inherent right of self-government by imposition of the band council system violated the Crown’s <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligations.</b> The appropriate remedy for this breach is restitution, involving federal assistance to enable First Nations to restore and maintain their capacity to govern themselves {{in accordance with their}} own traditions and present-day aspirations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{consequences}} attendant on {{a finding}} of a fiduciary relationship and its breach have resulted in judicial reluctance to do so except where the application of this [...] "blunt tool of equity" [...] is really necessary. It is rare that it is required {{in the context of}} an arm's length commercial transaction. ...the fact that confidential information is obtained and misused cannot itself create a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligation.</b> No doubt one of the possible incidents of a fiduciary relationship is the exchange of confidential information and restrictions on its use. Where, however, the essence of the complaint is misuse of confidential information, the appropriate cause of action in favour of the party aggrieved is breach of confidence and not breach of fiduciary duty.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{declared}} that, {{in certain}} limited circumstances {{indicating that the}} [...] "sale" [...] or [...] "break-up" [...] of the company is inevitable, the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>obligation</b> of the directors of a target corporation are narrowed significantly, the singular responsibility of the board being to maximize immediate stockholder value by securing the highest price available. The role {{of the board of}} directors transforms from [...] "defenders of the corporate bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for the stockholders at a sale of the company." [...] Accordingly, the board's actions are evaluated in a different frame of reference. In such a context, that conduct can not be judicially reviewed pursuant to the traditional business judgment rule, but instead will be scrutinized for reasonableness in relation to this discrete obligation.|$|E

The Private Security Contractor fulfills many different needs in the private and public sectors.
