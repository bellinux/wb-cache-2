She said, [...] "The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized.... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> long time. And [...] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't {{understand the value of}} a core, in this sense a Common Core." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{that her}} mother was {{becoming}} too ill to cope, in 2005 (at age 17) Manning returned to the United States. She moved in with her father in Oklahoma City, where he was living with his second wife and her child. Manning got a job as a developer with a software company, Zoto, and was apparently happy for a time, but was let go after four months. Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had [...] "just locked up" [...] and would simply sit and stare, and in the end communication became too difficult. The boss told the newspaper that [...] "nobody's been taking care of this kid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Beating as One was {{recorded}} at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums. Kaplan described the recording sessions {{of the album}} as follows: [...] "We hole up {{in a room and}} work <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> long time. Then we come out and blink our eyes because it's sunny out". Initially, the band did not intend to write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album {{was the only way to}} accommodate the instrumental track [...] "Spec Bebop", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album [...] "by hook or by crook". Beating as One is the only Yo La Tengo album that {{was recorded}} on an ADAT magnetic tape format, even though it was mixed to analog later. Audio mixing took place at Big House and Magic Shop in New York City.|$|E

50|$|It was Goldman’s {{contention}} that the New York symphony and orchestra musicians in the summer bands of the time rarely rehearsed and didn’t take these performances very seriously. He saw the potential <b>for</b> starting <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good wind ensemble.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{features}} several {{references to}} The Beatles and McCartney's solo career. For instance, McCartney tells Lisa that playing his 1970 song [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] backwards will reveal [...] "a recipe <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> rippin' lentil soup". A {{modified version of}} the song plays in the final scene, then over the closing credits of the episode; when played backwards, McCartney can be heard reciting the recipe in the song. Mirkin had McCartney record the recipe, which was later added in reverse over the original song. McCartney thought it was [...] "very funny" [...] that the staff wanted to [...] "send up the whole cult thing" [...] of backmasking on the Beatles' songs. [...] "A secret lentil soup recipe seemed a nice parody of that", he said. One of the backwards snippets says, [...] "Oh, and by the way, I'm alive", a reference to the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] urban legend.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cover {{versions of}} Kanye West's [...] "Gold Digger", Salt-n-Pepa's [...] "Push It", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] by Rihanna, [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] by Dionne Warwick, Chic's [...] "Le Freak", and [...] "All by Myself" [...] by Eric Carmen. Studio recordings of [...] "Gold Digger", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] and [...] "Push It" [...] were released as singles, available for download. [...] "Gold Digger" [...] charted at number 59 in Australia, [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 38 in Australia, 73 in Canada and 46 in America, and [...] "Push It" [...] at number 60 in Australia. [...] "Gold Digger" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] are {{included on the}} album , with a studio recording of [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] included as a bonus track on discs purchased from iTunes. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered {{for use in the}} episode at a reduced licensing rate, something which surprised Murphy, who believed {{he would not be able}} to secure the rights to the song. He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they give it to you, want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good price. That's been one of the cool and surprising things about this experience, that these people that the cast and we really admire and respect have found out about the show and are supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|Asmussen {{estimated}} overall game {{length to}} be 10 to 20 hours, [...] "depending on how good of a gamer you are." [...] Santa Monica studio director John Hight reassured players that God of War III lasts longer than 10 hours: [...] "We've {{done a lot}} of play testing on it... We know, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hardcore player, it'll take them longer than it took them to play either of the previous God of War games." [...] The finished game script was about 120 pages long, and the number of onscreen enemies increased from 15 in the previous games to a maximum of 50. To light the game, Turtle by Illuminate Labs was used. Head of development Christer Ericson of SCE Santa Monica Studio confirmed that God of War III has seamless loading; no loading screens and no hard disk drive installation requirement. SCE America animator Bruno Velazquez said that while the first two God of War titles had computer-generated imagery (CGI) cinematics, there would be no true CGI in the third game: [...] "all the cutscenes are created using our in-game engine." [...] A God of War III game trailer debuted on Spike's GameTrailers TV on February 11, 2010, and Asmussen confirmed that all footage is of gameplay. New camera angles were added; during some major battles the player can still control Kratos while the camera pans away from the fight, and a first-person camera view was used for the final portion of the Poseidon and Zeus boss fights. According to Sony Santa Monica director of technology Tim Moss, God of War III used 35 gigabytes (GB) of Blu-ray Disc. God of War IIIs budget was $44million USD, and the game had a staff of 132 {{at the end of its}} development.|$|E
6000|$|I see Crupp {{now with}} his arm bent before him {{on the table in}} a way we had, as though it was jointed {{throughout}} its length like a lobster's antenna, his plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a walnut shell into smaller and smaller fragments. [...] "Remington," [...] he said, [...] "has given us the data <b>for</b> <b>a</b> movement, <b>a</b> <b>really</b> possible movement. It's not only possible, but necessary--urgently necessary, I think, if the Empire is to go on." ...|$|R

2500|$|It's an idea <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> long track.... You {{know how}} [...] "Dazed and Confused" [...] and songs like that were broken into sections? Well, {{we want to}} try {{something}} new with the organ and acoustic guitar building up and building up, and then the electric part starts.... It might be a fifteen-minute track.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} 1937 that the first {{organiser}} was appointed, following an Annual Conference decision of 1936 that stated [...] "we are firmly of the opinion that, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> effective increase in membership, {{it is necessary that}} some person be employed for the whole of their time organising the schools". More officers were progressively appointed. There were 43 full-time administrative officers in 1996, who serviced the needs of the membership and undertook recruitment activities.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{revealed}} her long-held {{desire to}} return to British television in 2015. [...] "I have lived in America <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> long time, but I was never away from England. I was always there, I just didn't work there. I wasn't offered anything there really. So when the BBC called me last year, I was really thrilled. I mean, I {{wanted to do something}} England. The last thing I'd done was with Michael Palin. We did [...] in 1992, I think. We did a show about the class system in Britain and it was just wonderful fun. And from that HBO picked that up and I did [...] So it started from a British show." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{was really}} crucial. She was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great {{sounding}} board <b>for</b> me. She's <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good producer {{in the sense}} that she's very musical and has a great sense of song structure and so forth. So she was great to bounce ideas off. And she sang on nearly all the songs. So she was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> great part of this record.|$|R
5000|$|... "Japan" [...] and [...] "Centipede" [...] are studio recordings, each a Japanese bonus track <b>for</b> Heavy as <b>a</b> <b>Really</b> Heavy Thing and City respectively. The latter samples a {{percussion}} loop from [...] "Happiness in Slavery" [...] by Nine Inch Nails.|$|R
60|$|The boy stood, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, <b>really</b> bereft, by the {{apprehension}} he had conjured up, of {{the power}} to move.

2500|$|Bottum {{stated that}} he chose the name because it [...] "summed up what [...] did perfectly" [...] in that [...] "it's a really {{beautiful}} name <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hideous drug and that should make people think." [...] The artwork similarly put a beautiful face on a horrible image by depicting a soft blue airbrushed egret on the front cover, photographed by Werner Krutein, while on the back is {{an image of a}} cow hanging on a meat hook, created by Mark Burnstein. Both bassist Billy Gould and Mike Bordin said that the image on the rear of the album is not based on any opposition to vegetarianism but rather a preview of the music, suggesting its combination of being [...] "really aggressive and disturbing and then really soothing", the [...] "beautiful with the sick".|$|E
2500|$|Much of Off Beats tone {{is derived}} from its {{relation}} to urban culture. The fictional version of New York City that Quick has constructed is incredibly rich in detail, with attention to minuscule factors such as street addresses and subway/bus commute schedules. Often, the establishing shots of a scene will concentrate on landscape to capture in essence how a given area affects or portrays characters within that scene. Examples include shots of busy traffic and corner stores, Tory's messy room, and a dilapidated park. References are made to such problems as gang warfare, counterfeiting, illegal immigration, arms dealing, and terrorism {{in the form of}} bomb threats. Conspiracy theory and hacker subculture are also subjects that are explored. Editor Lillian Diaz-Przybyl has commented:"It features a spot-on, great depiction of New York. Everything Fake does wrong with setting, this does right. The location sets a brilliant backdrop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great story with a smart Walter Mitty twist, and cute guys to boot! It's truly manga with an American sensibility. The character designs are unique and appealing, the romance is sweet and understated, and it actually looks like Queens, which makes me really happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gaskarth, [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)" [...] is a up-tempo {{track that}} begins the album with [...] "a great guitar hook {{and lots of}} energy." [...] He said the song talks about [...] "feeling like you're being {{stretched}} to your limits by somebody. Gaskarth visited Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo at his house and ended up co-writing [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". He called Cuomo [...] "such a cool guy to work with." [...] Gaskarth said the track was [...] "an ode to {{having a good time}} and not taking yourself too seriously." [...] Barakat called the track [...] "a great song ... It has a cool Weezer/All Time Low/party hybrid-vibe to it." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Forget About It" [...] details [...] "that place in a relationship where people have been together <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> long time and they're afraid to let go." [...] Despite this, he said it was [...] "a totally fun song." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Guts" [...] was [...] "about finding within yourself the ability to say and do what you want no matter what the repercussions might be." [...] Maja Ivarsson from The Sounds provides guest vocals on the track. Gaskarth said Ivarsson was [...] "someone I’ve always respected vocally". He added that the pair [...] "both sound really similar ... she definitely sounds like a girl and I sorta sound like a girl so there’s a weird mix that happens but trust me it works for the song." [...] He called the track [...] "a departure for us as it's more universal and timeless than we've ever been." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remained}} {{still with}} my governess, who was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while <b>really</b> concerned <b>for</b> {{the misfortune of}} my comrade that had been hanged, and who, it seems, knew enough of my governess to have sent her the same way, and which made her very uneasy; indeed, {{she was in a}} very great fright.|$|R
60|$|On this sum {{he could}} {{have gone back to}} the Yangtse and retired <b>for</b> life <b>a</b> <b>really</b> wealthy man.

Why he had not toiled the whole five years under the spell of opium was the expensiveness of the habit. He had had no moral scruples. The drug had cost too much.|$|R

40|$|A signal-processing {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{in which the}} phenomenon of 'aliasing' is invoked to explain certain phenomena {{in the perception of}} musical tones, <b>for</b> which <b>a</b> <b>really</b> satisfactory explanation has not hitherto been available.
