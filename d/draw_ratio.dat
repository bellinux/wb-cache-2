The influences of heat-treatment, <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> and <b>drawing</b> temperature on melting behavior, crystalliza-tion, multi-pore-structure (MPS) and porosity were investigated. The {{results of this}} study demonstrated that the original crystal grains became more perfect and that new micro crystallites were produced through heat treatment. Defects were more easily formed by the micro crystallites in cold stretching. Heat treat-ment also made the pores contract. The MPS including TIPS pore, stretching pore and interfacial mi-crovoid was constructed after stretching. A model of interfacial microvoid was built. The model indicated that the area of interfacial microvoid increased as the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> became larger, reaching a maximum at a certain <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio.</b> Values above this maximum <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> made no contribution to further in-crease the triangular area of interfacial microvoid but made many TIPS pores close. As the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> increased, the pore diameter (PD) and total pore fraction (TPF) of the stretched pores increased whereas the TPF of the TIPS pores decreased. The pore diameter distribution (PDD) and the porosity resulted from the joint effect of multiple pores.

Linear stability analysis indicates that while both inertia and gravity enhance the stability in film casting, inertia plays a more dominant role regarding the critical <b>draw</b> <b>ratio.</b> In contrast, the disturbance frequency is {{more sensitive to}} the effect of gravity. The nonlinear results show that at the critical <b>draw</b> <b>ratio,</b> the system oscillates harmonically, indicating the onset of a Hopf bifurcation. For a <b>draw</b> <b>ratio</b> above criticality, finite-amplitude disturbances are amplified, and sustained oscillation is achieved. It is found that the growth rate increases with <b>draw</b> <b>ratio,</b> but decreases with inertia and gravity, which suggests that initial transients tend to take longer to die out for a fluid with inertia and gravity. Transient post-critical calculations show that the nonlinearity can be effectively halted by inertia and gravity. The oscillation frequency (film-thickness amplitude) decreases (increases) with <b>draw</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, the film oscillates more frequently but less fiercely with stronger inertia and gravity effects. The rupture of the film is also examined, and is found to be delayed by inertia and gravity.
