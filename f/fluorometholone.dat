40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the benefit of}} preoperative treatment with either topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroid in terms of clinical outcomes following trabeculectomy. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-one patients. METHODS: Between July 2005 and October 2007, 61 consecutive medically uncontrolled glaucoma patients scheduled for first-time trabeculectomy were randomized to 1 of 3 study topical medication groups: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketorolac), steroids (<b>fluorometholone),</b> or placebo (artificial tears). Patients instilled 1 drop 4 times daily for 1 month before the procedure and were examined on days 1 and 2, at weeks 1, 2, and 4, and at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after trabeculectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of postoperative surgical or medical interventions (needling, laser suture lysis, needling revision, and intraocular pressure [IOP]-lowering medication). RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (54 eyes) were entered for analysis. The mean number of preoperative medications was 2. 3 +/- 0. 9. The mean baseline IOP was 21. 0 +/- 6. 0 mmHg. The mean postoperative target IOP was 16. 5 +/- 1. 8 mmHg. The mean follow-up was 23. 6 +/- 4. 0 months. The percentage of patients requiring needling within the first year was 41 % in the placebo group, 6 % in the NSAID, and 5 % in the steroid group (P = 0. 006). The percentage of patients requiring IOP-lowering medication to reach the target IOP at 1 year was 24 % in the placebo group, 18 % in the NSAID group, and 0 % in the steroid group (P = 0. 054 overall; P = 0. 038 for steroids vs. others). The log-rank test showed a significant (P = 0. 019) difference in medication-free survival curves between the different groups. More specifically, patients in the steroid group needed significantly less medication over the total follow-up (P = 0. 007). CONCLUSIONS: Topical ketorolac or <b>fluorometholone</b> for 1 month before surgery was associated with improved trabeculectomy outcomes in terms of likelihood of postoperative needling. In the steroid group, there was a significantly reduced need for additional postoperative IOP-lowering medication compared with the other groups.

40|$|Glucocorticoids are {{commonly}} used as palliative or chemotherapeutic clinical agents for treatment {{of a variety of}} cancers. Although steroid treatment is beneficial, the mechanisms by which steroids improve outcome in cancer patients are not well understood. Na,K-ATPase beta-subunit isoform 1 (NaK-β 1) is a cell-cell adhesion molecule, and its expression is down-regulated in cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a key event associated with cancer progression to metastatic disease. In this study, we per-formed high-throughput screening to identify small molecules that could up-regulate NaK-β 1 expression in cancer cells. Compounds related to the glucocorticoids were identified as drug candidates enhancing NaK-β 1 expression. Of these compounds, triamcinolone, dexa-methasone, and <b>fluorometholone</b> were validated to increase NaK-β 1 expression at the cell surface, enhance cell-cell adhesion, attenuate motility and invasiveness and induce mesen-chymal to epithelial like transition of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells in vitro. Treatment of NaK-β 1 knockdown cells with these drug candidates confirmed that these compounds medi-ate their effects through up-regulating NaK-β 1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that thes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Topical preparations, high in phosphate, {{may cause}} {{calcification}} when {{used on a}} damaged corneal surface. The knowledge of the phosphate concentration in medications helps to prevent corneal calcifications. Our study gives {{an overview of the}} amount of phosphate contained in ophthalmic corticoid preparations. METHODS: Samples of 38 commercially available corticoid preparations were tested. The quantification of phosphate was performed using the molybdate method on a Modular P autoanalyzer. RESULTS: 18 of 38 preparations (47 %) had a phosphate concentration above physiological levels (> 1. 45 mmol/l). It varied greatly, and ranged from less than 0. 1 mmol/l (18 preparations) to 62. 6 mmol/l. The corticoids that were tested included betamethasone sodium phosphate (18. 3 - 35. 5 mmol/l), dexamethasone (0. 1 - 17. 6 mmol/l), dexamethasone sodium phosphate (< 0. 1 - 62. 6 mmol/l), <b>fluorometholone</b> (< 0. 1 - 22. 5 mmol/l), and prednisolone acetate (< 0. 1 - 0. 5 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS: The phosphate concentration in corticoid-phosphate formulations varies greatly, and is mainly determined by the chosen buffer. The prednisolone acetate preparations showed physiological phosphate concentrations.
