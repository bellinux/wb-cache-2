25|$|The common {{kingfisher}} (Alcedo atthis) {{also known as}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> and river kingfisher, is a small kingfisher with seven subspecies recognized within its wide distribution across Eurasia and North Africa. It is resident in much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.|$|E
40|$|The first granulometrical {{analysis}} of soil samples from nesting {{banks of the}} Eurasian King-fisher (Alcedo atthis) is reported. In total 29 samples from 22 banks located in the Czech Re-public were analysed using the dry sieve analysis and decantation. Twelve standardized parti-cle size fractions were determined in all groups of samples. Mean particle size of soil samples from banks occupied by Kingfishers averaged 991 ± 1747 µm, the variability {{of the content of}} particular soil particle fraction is higher than previously published on Sand Martins and Bee-Eaters. The results suggest that the presence/absence of some particle size fractions in extreme values is decisive for the presence/absence of Kingfishers in each appropriate nesting bank. Among banks unoccupied by Kingfishers were those with soil particles above 40, 000 µm, or with the content of particle size fractions 2, 346 – 774 µm below 5 %. Kingfishers do not occupy banks with the content of the fraction 9. 2 – 3. 0 µm higher than 2. 156 %, or with the content of the particle size fraction 3. 0 – 1. 0 higher than 0. 415 %, too. Soils composed from grains exceed-ing any of these values are expected to be unoccupied by the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Kingfisher...</b>|$|E
50|$|Three lakes {{created by}} gravel {{workings}} alongside the River Wylye {{have been turned}} into a wildlife reserve called the Langford Lakes Nature Reserve, under the ownership of the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve has an area of fifty acres, and species include mallard, gadwall, tufted duck, common pochard, northern shoveller, <b>Eurasian</b> wigeon, <b>kingfisher,</b> great crested grebe, common tern, osprey, brown trout, greyling, otters, and water voles.|$|R
50|$|Birds:There {{are various}} kinds of birds found in this area like <b>kingfisher,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> golden oriole, black drongo, little grebe, sandpiper, hoopoe. Some places near the Harisiddhi border {{also serves as a}} habitat of the long tailed {{blackbird}} and cranes.|$|R
50|$|Samaspur Sanctuary is {{situated}} near Salon in Rae Bareli district. It lies at about 122 km from Lucknow on Lucknow-Varanasi highway. It {{was established in}} 1987 on about 780 hectares of land. Nearest railway station is Unchahar and the nearest airport is Fursatganj, Raebareli. The best time to visit the place is between November to March. More than 250 varieties of birds can be seen here. Some of the birds come here {{from a distance of}} more than 5000 km, including Greylag Goose, Pintail, Common Teal, Eurasian Wigeon, Northern Shoveler, Ruddy Shelduck (Surkhab) etc. Local birds include Knob-billed Duck, Lesser Whistling-duck, Indian Spot-billed Duck, <b>Eurasian</b> Spoon-bill, <b>Kingfishers,</b> Vultures etc. Twelve varieties of fish are there in the lake at Samaspur.|$|R
50|$|Getterön Nature Reserve {{is one of}} {{northern}} Europe's premier birdwatching sites. In the reserve's wetland nesting species like gadwall, garganey, black-tailed godwit, ruff, dunlin, little tern, and pied avocet. The pied avocet {{also serves as a}} symbol for the nature reserve. Also in the winters there are many different species at Getterön, for example little grebe, water rail, common <b>kingfisher,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> bittern, bearded reedling, whooper swan, and smew. Also birds of prey, like the peregrine falcon, are common.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{animal species}} {{live in the}} Abrod nature reserve. Some bird species that are {{permanently}} present include northern goshawk, great reed warbler, Eurasian reed warbler, long-tailed tit, <b>Eurasian</b> skylark, common <b>kingfisher,</b> mallard, garganey, greater white-fronted goose, greylag goose, bean goose, tree pipit, grey heron, common pochard, common buzzard, common linnet, European goldfinch, European greenfinch, Eurasian siskin, white stork, western marsh harrier, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, hawfinch, common raven, carrion crow, common quail and corn crake. Many of these species are also reproducing in the area. Some bird species that are only wintering here include Eurasian sparrowhawk, merlin and European crested tit.|$|R
