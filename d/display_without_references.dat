50|$|C56 31 was the 31st of the Class C56 steam {{locomotives}} {{produced by}} Japanese Government Railways (JGR). It was manufactured by Nippon Sharyo in Ishikawa Prefecture in 1936. C56 31 {{was the first}} train to run on the Thai-Burma Railway, {{also known as the}} Death Railway. It operated there during the war, after which it was used in Thailand. After the war it was brought back to Japan and restored, and is now displayed in the Yūshūkan, the museum attached to Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. It is <b>displayed</b> <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to the deaths during the construction of the railway, which are estimated at around 100,000.|$|R
30|$|This {{difference}} between the URM and other methods is depicted when evaluating the treatment of expansion cases, where direct measurements on 2 D slices from spiral CT [26] were used, and by other papers applying 3 D <b>display</b> <b>without</b> any <b>reference</b> [30] or with unstable reference [31, 32]. Semi-automation in URM allowed identification of reproducible skeletal points, such as R- and L-Max on the wide lateral surfaces of maxilla where are no sharp 3 D skeletal landmarks can be identified. Thus, many researchers were obliged to use dental points to evaluate 3 D skeletal expansion [18 – 20] even though dental points are unreliable landmarks. Conversely, the URM measured mediolateral change by projecting R-and L-Max identified on superimposed pre- and post-CBCT scans on C-FH (Fig. 4) derived from structures unaffected by treatment. In addition, with the URM, only one reading for each measurement was sufficient to produce a descriptive standardized result describing exactly how much basal bone of maxilla moved medio-laterally and in which direction projecting changes on C-FH. Thus, the operator can compare pre-and post-treatment results, simplifying data interpretation.|$|R
