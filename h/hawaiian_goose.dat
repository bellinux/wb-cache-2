5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose)</b> from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E

50|$|The nene is the world's rarest goose. It is {{believed}} that it was once common, with approximately 25,000 <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese</b> living in Hawaii when Captain James Cook arrived in 1778. Hunting and introduced predators, such as small Asian mongooses, pigs, and cats, reduced the population to 30 birds by 1952. The species breeds well in captivity, and has been successfully re-introduced; in 2004, it was estimated that there were 800 birds in the wild, as well as 1,000 in wildfowl collections and zoos. However, there is some concern of inbreeding due to the small initial population of birds. The nature reserve WWT Slimbridge, in England, was instrumental in the successful breeding of <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese</b> in captivity. Under the direction of conservationist Peter Scott, it was bred back from the brink of extinction during the 1950s for later re-introduction into the wild in Hawaii. There are still <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese</b> at Slimbridge today. They can now be found in captivity in every WWT centre. Successful introductions include Haleakala and Piiholo ranches on Maui. The nene population stands at 2,500 birds.|$|R

50|$|Whitgift {{is renowned}} locally for its {{wide variety of}} animals, most notably the {{peacocks}} which have graced the grounds since the 1930s, and the flamingos. In 2005 Sir David Attenborough visited the school to open the ponds, the enclosure of which also houses two albino wallabies (a gift from the Queen, given in 2002 after the school's ponds re-opened), and various waterfowl, including <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese,</b> which the zoo successfully bred. Unfortunately both wallabies drowned.The headmaster subsequently purchased four more wallabies to replace the dead two.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is known}} for its unique {{volcanic}} features, its long scenic drive with numerous overlooks, and the unusually clear views of the night sky available. Haleakalā {{is one of the best}} places in the United States for amateur astronomy, and binoculars and telescopes are available for rent from many local merchants. Nēnē (<b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese,</b> Branta sandvicensis) can also be seen in their natural habitat in Haleakalā Crater. Although nēnē died out entirely in the park, in 1946 they were re-introduced with the help of the Boy Scouts, who carried young birds into the crater in their backpacks.|$|R
50|$|After the 1946 tsunami {{devastated the}} Puna Shipman property, killing half the {{endangered}} <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese</b> (nēnē) he was raising there, he built pens at Ainahou to continue raising the nēnē. After the war, {{it was estimated}} only about 30 birds existed in the wild. Herbert Shipman reintroduced two pairs to the Pohakuloa Training Area, and worked with British ornithologist Peter Scott to expand the breeding program to England, possibly saving the species from extinction. The shipman family also kept many exotic plants at the ranch, {{including some of the}} first orchids raised on the island. Herbert (president of the Hawaii Orchid Society) was awarded a gold medal in 1957 by the American Orchid Society for contributions to the industry.|$|R
50|$|The major {{landowner}} in {{the area}} is the family descended from Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842-1911). His son Henry Alexander Baldwin created the Piiholo Ranch out of the larger Haleakala Ranch, named after Haleakalā, the highest point in Maui. The ranch now features eco-tourism. The endangered <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose</b> Branta sandvicensis known as Nēnē in the Hawaiian language, is being reintroduced here under supervision of Peter Baldwin.|$|E

50|$|Reintroductions of captive bred populations {{can occur}} to {{replenish}} wild populations of an endangered species, {{to create new}} populations or to restore a species after it has become extinct in the wild. Reintroductions helped bring the wild populations of <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese</b> (nene) from 30 birds to over 500. The Mauritius kestrel was successfully reintroduced into the wild after its captive breeding programme. Reintroductions can be very difficult and often fail if insufficient preparations are made, as species born in captivity may lack {{the skills and knowledge}} needed for life in the wild after living in captivity. Reintroductions can also fail if the causes of a birds decline have not been adequately addressed. Attempts to reintroduce the Bali starling into the wild failed due to continued poaching of reintroduced birds.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that the nene evolved from the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), which most likely arrived on the Hawaiian islands about 500,000 years ago, shortly after the island of Hawaii was formed. This {{ancestor}} is the progenitor of the nene {{as well as the}} prehistoric Giant Hawaii goose and nēnē-nui (Branta hylobadistes). The nēnē-nui was larger than the nene, varied from flightless to flighted depending on the individual, and inhabited the island of Maui. Similar fossil geese found on Oahu and Kauai may be of the same species. The Giant Hawaii goose was restricted to the island of Hawaii and measured 1.2 m in length with a mass of 8.6 kg, making it more than four times larger than the nene. It is believed that the herbivorous Giant Hawaii goose occupied the same ecological niche as the goose-like ducks known as moa-nalo, which were not present on the Big Island. Based on mitochondrial DNA found in fossils, all <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>geese,</b> living and dead, are closely related to the giant Canada goose (B. c. maxima) and dusky Canada goose (B. c. occidentalis).|$|R

5000|$|The {{environmental}} impact statement for Kaheawa {{led to the development}} of a habitat conservation plan (HCP), the first HCP ever used for a wind farm of this scale in the United States. The plan helps fund conservation efforts for four protected species, including three endemic birds and one endemic bat: the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose</b> (nene), the Hawaiian petrel (uau), the Hawaiian shearwater (ao), and the Hawaiian hoary bat (opeapea). [...] The project is also researching how to best protect the nesting areas of seabirds.|$|E
50|$|He {{stood as}} a Conservative in the 1945 general {{election}} in Wembley North and narrowly failed to be elected. In 1946, {{he founded the}} organisation with which he was ever afterwards closely associated, the Severn Wildfowl Trust (now the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust) with its headquarters at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire. There, through a captive breeding programme, he saved the nene or <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose,</b> from extinction in the 1950s. In the years that followed, he led ornithological expeditions worldwide, and became a television personality, popularising the study of wildfowl and wetlands.|$|E
50|$|Lorant had {{a love of}} {{all forms}} of {{wildlife}} and early in his career had become a skilled taxidermist. This helped him to secure a job with conservationist Peter Scott at his Slimbridge Wildfowl Reserve and subsequently with the renowned London taxidermist Roland Ward. At Slimbridge, among other projects, Lorant worked on the breeding scheme for the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose,</b> which was nearly extinct except for the specimens held there. He was also responsible for capturing migrating Russian white-fronted geese for ringing. In the late 1950s, Lorant was featured several times on Peter Scott's BBC Television programme Look.|$|E
50|$|William Herbert's {{youngest}} son Herbert Cornelius Shipman (1892-1976) {{took over the}} W.H. Shipman Company in 1943 after his father's death. Herbert {{is best known for}} breeding the endangered <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose</b> (known as nēnē in the Hawaiian language, Branta sandvicensis). He started with four birds in 1918 at his coastal Puna Shipman estate, eventually moving the breeding program to the family's 'Ainahou Ranch after the 1946 tsunami almost decimated his existing flocks. He is credited with saving the breed and keeping the nēnē from extinction. Herbert also started commercial growing of orchids and introduced the anthurium to the Island of Hawai'i.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinctions between}} the two geese {{have led to a}} great deal of {{confusion}} and debate among ornithologists. This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada goose and larger types of cackling goose. Most interestingly, the old [...] "lesser Canada goose" [...] was believed to be a partly hybrid population, with the birds named taverneri considered a mixture of minima, occidentalis and parvipes. In addition, it has been determined that the barnacle goose is a derivative of the cackling goose lineage, whereas the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>goose</b> is an insular representative of the Canada goose.|$|E
