40|$|Monocrystalline Ni–Mn–Ga alloys show magnetic-field-induced strains (MFIS) {{of up to}} 10 % as {{a result}} of {{reversible}} twinning; by contrast, polycrystalline Ni–Mn–Ga shows near-zero MFIS due to strain incompatibilities at grain boundaries inhibiting twinning. Recently, we showed that porous polycrystalline Ni–Mn–Ga exhibits a small, but non-zero, MFIS value of 0. 12 % due to reduction of these incompatibilities by the porosity. Here, we study the effect of pore architecture on MFIS for polycrystalline Ni–Mn–Ga foams. Foams with a combination of large (550 μm) and small (80 μm) pores are fabricated by the replication method and exhibit thinner nodes and struts compared to foam containing only large (430 μm) pores. When magnetically cycled, both types of foams exhibit repeatable MFIS of 0. 24 – 0. 28 % without bias stress. As the cycle number increases from a few tens to a few thousands, the MFIS drops due to damage accumulation.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the fetal hematocrit (Hct) decrease along repeated intravascular intrauterine fetal transfusions (IUTs) and test the hypothesis that, after consecutive IUTs, there is a lower Hct drop oV. Methods From July 1996 to June 2006, pregnancies submitted to IUT for fetal hemolytic anemia treatment had their data assessed. The daily rate of decrease in fetal Hct was calculated by dividing the diVerence between the posttransfusion Hct of the previous IUT and the pretransfusion Hct of the current IUT, by the number of days between the transfusions. Fetuses with other abnormalities or submitted to intraperitoneal transfusions were excluded. Results Eighty-one women were submitted to IUT during the alluded period, ensuing 296 intrauterine transfusions. The perinatal survival was 89. 9 % (n = 80), with 92. 0 % (n = 69) of nonhydropic fetuses survival. Hydropic fetuses showed higher hematocrit drop oV than nonhydropic ones (P < 0. 01). Compared to the interval between the Wrst and second IUT, the daily fetal Hct decline was lower after the third one (P < 0. 05). Stratifying by the presence of hydrops, nonhydropic fetuses showed a smaller decrease at the third and fourth intervals (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). Among hydropic fetuses, there is a trend of smaller Hct decrease along successive IUTs (interval 3, P = 0. 08; interval 4, P = 0. 07; and interval 5, P = 0. 10). Conclusions Following some IUTs, fetal hematocrit <b>decrease</b> <b>is</b> <b>lower</b> and larger intervals between the transfusions could be accomplished.

40|$|International audienceThis work aims {{to study}} the {{evolution}} of NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 redox performance with CO as fuel for Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) applications. The oxygen carrier (OC) was investigated under alternating oxidizing and reducing conditions in a fixed bed reactor simulating the cyclic conditions of CLC. The study of the operating temperature influence reveals that total reduction capacity increases with temperature, due to {{the reaction of the}} binder NiAl 2 O 4. Regeneration step performed under low oxygen concentration (5 vol. %) shows that the decrease in total reduction capacity during multiple cycles is minimized and the purity of produced CO 2 is higher. Therefore, carrying out the regeneration step at lower oxygen concentrations can increase oxygen carrier lifetime. Characterization studies revealed the formation of a nickel rich layer at the surface (up to 20 μm thick at 900 °C) and a partial sintering of particles regenerated under 20 vol. % of oxygen. However, these phenomena are not observed on the particles regenerated under low oxygen concentration. The formation of this layer {{can be explained by the}} fact that nickel oxidation is carried out by migration of Ni 2 + cations through the layer of NiO initially oxidized at the surface of the particle, the layer becomes thicker during cycles, because NiO does not return to its initial position. At higher temperature, the diffusion velocity increases and therefore the layer formed is thicker. Specific surface area of the oxygen carrier decreases as cycles number increases from 9. 4 m 2 /g for the fresh material to 4. 4 and 2. 3 m 2 /g after thirty cycles at 750 °C and 900 °C respectively. The same trend is observed for porous volume. However, the <b>decrease</b> <b>is</b> <b>lower</b> when particles are regenerated under low oxygen concentration (6 m 2 /g) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{nowadays}} groundwater {{resources are}} mostly affected by increasing water abstraction, {{they will have}} toface the impact of climate change. Even in a temperate climate {{as the one in}} northern France these two driverswill have strong impact on the aquifers. Evolution of groundwater resource is most often studied based onevolution of the rainfall infiltration that is assumed to be the aquifer recharge, although river-aquifer and multilayeraquifer exchanges are also part of the recharge and can only be estimated using a hydrogeological model. Moreover, providing a change of the piezometric level is usually not found to be meaningful by stakeholder as a 1 meter variation can have different impact depending on the hydrogeological context. Therefore, in this study, toprovide greater insight into the impact of groundwater, two new indicators are used: the evolution of the extensionof groundwater-fed wetlands and the frequency with which a crisis piezometric head is exceeded. The crisispiezometric levels are used locally by stakeholders {{and as soon as the}} observed piezometric heads fall below theselevels, actions are taken to preserve the water resource. For the present study, the local crisis piezometric heads were extended to the whole studied basins, the Seine andUpper Rhine Graben basins. The results show that the two basins under study are not affected in the same way by climate and groundwaterabstraction changes. The Seine multi-layer aquifers are projected to suffer from a substantial decrease in rainfall infiltration (about 20 %), while the <b>decrease</b> <b>is</b> <b>lower</b> in the Upper Rhine Graben aquifer (about 6 %). In 2050, the extension of groundwater-fed wetlands is expected to lose about 900 m 2 /km 2, while the crisispiezometric heads are expected to be exceeded about 40 % and 26 % of the time on average on the Seine and UpperRhine Graben aquifers, respectively. The reduction of the groundwater abstraction has a large impact locally but isnot efficient enough to overcome the impact of climate change, although the impact is more sensitive on the Upper Rhine Graben than on the Seine, and particularly on the extension of wetlands and low flow. Sensitivity to the parameters that drive the river-aquifer exchange was found to be second order compared to theuncertainty due to the climate model in the Upper Rhine Graben, although these parameters have a considerable impact on present-day estimation of the aquifer balance. The two indicators are found to be highly useful to discuss the impact of climate change on groundwater with stakeholders. In order to be able to extent such studies to the whole aquifers of France, and to have a survey of such impact as soon as new downscaled projections are available, the AquiFR project is bringing together hydrogeologicalapplications used by stakeholder in a common plateform that will be based at Météo-Franc...|$|E

In this report, the effect of formalin fixation on the human bronchi AF, hence on the contrast, was studied by spectrofluorometric point measurements and DAFE (Diagnostic AutoFluorescence Endoscopy) broad field imaging.

30|$|The {{decrease}} in velocity under an observation station represents one {{interpretation of the}} cause of a phase delay. When a wave reflects off a surface and returns to the station, a phase delay is observed if the seismic wave velocity decreases along the propagation path. The delay can also be explained by an increase in the distance between an observation station and a reflection surface, because the propagation distance of the reflected wave is determined by the distance between an observation station and a reflection surface. Assuming that the distance to the reflection surface did not change, the observed phase delays after the main shock were equivalent to a 2 % or lower seismic velocity decrease at six stations (TJT 2, S 15, S 09, S 04, LS 4, and LS 1) near the trench. Ito and Hino (2013) studied the sea floor in the same region as the present study, and detected decreases in seismic velocity of 1 – 5 % after the main shock in the overall analysis region. Moreover, a {{decrease in}} seismic velocity of 2 % in the southern Fukushima Prefecture (Minato et al. 2012) and 0.1 – 0.5 % in the Iwate Prefecture (Takagi et al. 2012) were reported after the main shock using land data. In the present study, the observed seismic velocity <b>decreases</b> <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> than those of Ito and Hino (2013), but roughly equivalent to those of other regions that shook during the main shock.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{insemination}} of cryopreserved semen always results in lower fertility when compared to fresh semen; on the other hand there is an increased interest and demand for frozen equine semen by the major breeder associations because of the utility arising from semen already "on hand" at breeding time. In this paper, we demonstrated that equine sperm cells express L-type voltage gated calcium channels; their localization is restricted to sperm neck and to the principal piece of the tail both in fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa. We also studied, at the membrane level, the causes of cryoinjury focusing on the function of L-calcium channels. We demonstrated that in cryopreserved spermatozoa the mean basal value of [Ca 2 +]i is higher than that of spermatozoa from fresh semen (447. 130 nM vs 288. 3 nM, P< 0. 001) and that L-type channels function differently in response to their agonist/antagonist in relation to semen condition (fresh or frozen-thawed). We found that upon agonist addition to the culture medium, the [Ca 2 +]i increase was higher in frozen than in fresh semen (Δ[Ca 2 +]i= 124. 59 nM vs 16. 04 nM; P< 0. 001) while after the antagonist addition the [Ca 2 +]i <b>decrease</b> <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> in frozen than in fresh semen (Δ[Ca 2 +]i= 32. 5 nM vs 82. 5 nM; P< 0. 001). In this paper we also discuss the impact of cryopreservation on sperm physiology...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether orexin affects gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) secretions in the prepubertal male and female rats. Forty prepubertal rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Animals in group 1 and 2 were male and 3 and 4 were female. Animals in group 1 and 3 received infusions of 1 μg orexin and group 2 and 4 received infusions of 2 μg orexin into their third ventricle. Blood samples were collected from jugular veins, every 30 min from 4 h before the first infusion of orexin until 4 h after the last orexin infusion. Infusions of 1 and 2 μg orexin significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased the mean plasma concentrations and pulse amplitudes of GnRH and LH in prepubertal female animal. Also, infusions of 1 and 2 μg orexin significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased the mean plasma concentrations and pulse amplitudes of GnRH and LH in prepubertal male animal, but this <b>decrease</b> <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> in than female prepubertal rat. Infusions of 1 and 2 μg orexin did not change the mean plasma concentrations of FSH in the animal of all groups. Infusions of 1 and 2 μg, orexin significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased the glucose levels of the prepubertal female animals. The conclusion of this experiment indicated that orexin may negatively affect the GnRH and LH in the prepubertal rats with negative energy balance, but not in those with the positive energy balance...|$|R
40|$|X-rays {{are widely}} used in {{medicine}} and materials science to identify impurities or fractures within the target object. In material science, x-rays {{can be used to}} identify the thickness of samples with different material densities. The current method is to collect a radiograph using estimated conditions, evaluate the results, then make changes to the conditions. The residual image can be rescanned making it possible to obtain an image of lower radiographic density. By tabulating or graphing the effects of energy changes and rescans, a more informed choice of conditions is possible. For this study, six materials were chosen with a material density ranging from 1. 74 - 16. 65 g/cc. During each experiment, different voltages are used and several rescans are taken if the residual image on the film plate was not erased. When comparing the rescans, the largest drop in radiographic density occurred between the original scan and the first rescan. The relative amount of radiographic density <b>decreased</b> <b>is</b> <b>lower</b> after each scan. The percent change in radiographic density between rescans ranged from 4 - 12 % overall. As the material density or thickness increased, the data consistently showed the radiographic density decreased. The denser, thicker materials may only need a few rescans at the higher voltages, and less dense, thinner materials may need more. The change in voltage showed a similar trend as that of the rescans. The voltages used in this experiment were too high for most of the materials and thicknesses, but some general trends were observed...|$|R
