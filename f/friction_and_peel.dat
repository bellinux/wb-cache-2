40|$|The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is an {{instrument}} {{that is capable of}} measuring intermolecular forces between single molecules. Multi-Parameter Force Spectroscopy (MPFS) is a technique that uses the AFM. MPFS enables the acquisition of force curves and thermal resonance of the system under investigation. This technique can shed light on the mechanical behavior at the molecular level. Improvements described herein have enhanced the sensitivity of MPFS over background noise. This investigation focuses on the mechanical and interfacial properties of three carbon nanostructures: long nanotubes, nanocoils, and nanoloops. Different types of adhesion are encountered, measured <b>and</b> discussed: <b>friction,</b> rupture, <b>and</b> <b>peeling.</b> The elastic modulus of long carbon nanotubes is calculated from frequency shifts when the system is put into tension. An elastica model is applied to the post-buckled carbon nanotubes, which enables the estimation of the static coefficient of friction on chemically modified surfaces. The compression of a nanocoil at large contact angles reveals that changes in oscillation amplitude do not occur from damping, but from adding stiffness into the systems measured herein. This result is counter to the assumptions of dynamic force spectroscopy. Finally, carbon nanoloops are brought into and out of contact with several different surfaces. The force curve and frequency response of the system shows the difference between rupture <b>and</b> <b>peeling.</b> The results presented herein lead {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanical and tribological properties of the carbon nanostructures.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the <b>friction</b> <b>and</b> wear behavior of high-strength alloys Ti- 6 Al- 7 Nb used in femoral stem and compare it with a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy cylindrical bar corresponding to ISO 5832 - 3 part 3 / 01 - 07 - 199 standard. The tribological behavior was investigated by wear tests, using ball-on-disc and pin-on-disc tribometers. These tests consisted of measuring the weight loss <b>and</b> the <b>friction</b> coefficient of samples. The oscillating <b>friction</b> <b>and</b> wear tests have been carried out in ambient with oscillating tribotester in accordance with standards ISO 7148, ASTM G 99 - 95 a, and ASTM G 133 - 95 under different conditions of normal loads (3, 6, and 10 [*]N) and sliding speeds (1, 15, and 25 [*]mm·s− 1). As counter pairs, a 100 Cr 6 steel ball with 10 mm in diameter was used. Results show that the two alloys had similar <b>friction</b> <b>and</b> wear performance, although their grain structures and compositions are different. Occurrence of large frictional occurred, is probably caused by formation and periodic, localized fracture of a transfer layer. Higher friction with larger fluctuation and higher wear rate was observed at the higher siding speed. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wear mechanism transforms from ploughing <b>and</b> <b>peeling</b> off wear at low sliding speed to plastic deformation and adhesive wear...|$|R
40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) and gas chromatographyolfactometry (GC-O) {{were used}} to determine the aromatic composition and aroma active compounds of fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil of Jinchen sweet orange fruit. Totals of 49 and 32 compounds were identified in fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil, respectively. GC-O was performed to study the aromatic profile of Jinchen fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil. A total of 41 components appeared to contribute to the aroma of fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil. Twelve components were the odorants perceived in both samples. The aromatic compositions of fruit juice were more complex than that of peel oil. Ethyl butanoate, ÃŽÂ²-myrcene, octanal, linalool, ÃŽÂ±-pinene, and decanal were found to be responsible for the aromatic notes in fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil. Nineteen components have been perceived only in the juice and ten compounds were described as aromatic components of only the peel oil by the panelists. These differences lead to the different overall aroma between fruit juice <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> oil...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Green {{banana flour}} shows good {{potential}} as a functional ingredient for special-purpose foods, {{but there are no}} data in the literature concerning the use of a green banana pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour for the development of products such as pasta. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop tagliatelle pasta substituting the wheat flour with different concentrations of a green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour. The pasta formulations were prepared replacing the wheat flour by the green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour in two concentrations: 15 % and 30 %. A control formulation with wheat flour was also prepared. The green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour presented higher ash, total fibre and total phenolic compound contents than traditional wheat flour. The pasta formulation with the addition of 15 % green banana flour showed the highest ash content and the best sensory acceptability of all the formulations. It was concluded that it was possible to develop a tagliatelle pasta with satisfactory acceptance replacing the wheat flour by a green banana mixed pulp <b>and</b> <b>peel</b> flour...|$|R
