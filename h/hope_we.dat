25|$|It hurt. It hurt because we'd gone to New Zealand full of <b>hope.</b> <b>We</b> were a {{promising}} and emerging young side, we'd worked damned hard and we'd played good cricket {{most of the}} time. But we'd lost. We'd lost again. Every setback was making it harder to maintain optimism about the future.|$|E
25|$|Part four charts {{the task}} ahead, which Unger says {{is to find}} the {{collective}} equivalents to the personal experiences of love, faith, and <b>hope.</b> <b>We</b> must strive to discover the structures that can realize these passions in the everyday world. All too often visions of the future human and environment exclude from social life the personal connections represented in the passions, choosing instead to focus on the recreation of the material world. Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions so we may transcend our context and become more godlike.|$|E

500|$|On October 20, 1872, Briggs {{arrived at}} Pier 50 on the East River, New York City, to {{supervise}} the loading of the ship's cargo for Genoa: 1,701 barrels of poisonous denatured alcohol. A week later, Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter. On Sunday, November 3, Briggs wrote to his mother, telling her {{that he intended to}} leave on Tuesday, adding that, [...] "Our vessel is in beautiful trim and I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> shall have a fine passage." ...|$|E
500|$|On the occasion, Ezra Cornell {{delivered}} a brief speech. [...] He said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> have {{laid the foundation}} of an institution which shall combine practical with liberal education. ... I believe we have made {{the beginning of an}} institution which will prove highly beneficial to the poor young men and the poor young women of our country." [...] His speech included another statement which later became the school's motto, [...] "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." ...|$|E

500|$|We {{found both}} {{her and her}} crew {{to be easy to}} work with and low-key. I think we would have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to have somebody like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can do here." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Drynan {{was named}} Executive Director of the Brampton Public Library system in July 1993. In August that year, Drynan decided to evict the sculpture, {{after three years}} at the {{entrance}} of the art gallery at the Brampton Library branch. In a letter to community services commissioner Donald M. Gordon, Drynan wrote: [...] "I am sure that the statue has artistic merit and needs to be preserved. However, it is quite inappropriate in its present location within the newly renovated gallery. Its presence dominates any other exhibits which are placed in the area. I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can find a solution without having yet another tempest in a teapot." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{dared to}} <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> had invented {{something}} that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong... No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} hope he doesn't {{try to do}} you any harm, Dave," [...] said Jessie, {{and gave}} a little shiver. [...] "I was <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> had seen the last of that horrid young man." ...|$|R

500|$|In July 1968, the Beatles moved Apple Corps, their {{multimedia}} corporation, into 3 Savile Row. A {{studio was}} built in the basement; though it was poorly designed, the Beatles recorded Let It Be there before a new studio was constructed in 1971 at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Various artists, including Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, and Marc Bolan recorded in the basement studio until it closed in May 1975. The Beatles' final live performance, known as the [...] "rooftop concert", was held {{on the roof of the}} building, on 30 January 1969, and was recorded for the documentary film Let It Be; the last words of the band, spoken by John Lennon as the police stopped the performance, were [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> passed the audition." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting in}} the green room, Larson met Ed Long, a Baptist {{minister}} from California booked for the third episode of the session. They struck up a conversation. Long recalled that Larson asked {{how many times he}} had seen the show. When Long replied he had seen it only once, Larson responded by looking at him as though he [...] "were from another planet." [...] Larson told Long, [...] "I really <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> don't have to play each other" [...] before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes. The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session.|$|E
500|$|The Ankang city {{government}} promised to [...] "pursue strict legal and disciplinary action" [...] once {{the investigation was}} finished. [...] On June 14, the city issued a formal apology. [...] "Since the illegal actions by some officials have seriously hurt Feng Jianmei and her family, we want to offer our deep apologies {{to them and to}} the generic public," [...] read the statement. [...] The same day, deputy mayor Du Shouping visited Feng in the hospital to express the city's [...] "sincere apologies." [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can earn your forgiveness," [...] he said in a statement published on the city's webpage. The Chinese government also said it had released a pamphlet emphasizing that late term abortion is prohibited and that the legal rights of pregnant women should be maintained.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you're going to say. You <b>hoped</b> <b>we</b> should always remain good friends." [...] This formula, as Lord Warburton uttered it, was {{certainly}} flat enough; {{but then he}} was interested in making it appear so.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{signs of}} de Vervillin, hey! Greenly?" [...] the admiral asked, when his {{survey of the}} whole fleet had ended. [...] "I was in <b>hopes</b> <b>we</b> might see {{something}} of him, when the light returned this morning." ...|$|R

500|$|Following {{the first}} race, Kurt Busch drove to victory lane. During the press conference, Busch said, [...] "To be in those positions, {{you have to}} have a good {{drafting}} partner. I had that with Regan Smith , had it with [...] McMurray on Saturday night [...] But you can't be in those positions if you don't build a great race car." [...] Also by winning the race, Kurt Busch would be the leader at the start of the Daytona 500, after Earnhardt was involved in an accident. Second-place finisher Smith stated: [...] "Kurt (Busch) and I worked good all day and we had good cars hooked up together. I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> find each other and do the same thing on Sunday." [...] The first event took 58 minutes and 12 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.065 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Around midday, Rupert {{was joined}} on Marston Moor by Newcastle, {{accompanied}} by a mounted troop of [...] "gentleman volunteers" [...] only. Rupert greeted him by saying, [...] "My Lord, I wish you had come sooner with your forces, but I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> shall yet have a glorious day." [...] Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies, with separate garrisons, recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect, would eventually separate. He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army. Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to Newcastle) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately. Furthermore, Rupert wished {{to compensate for the}} Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares, and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.|$|E

Biffle qualified eighth, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. ninth and Clint Bowyer tenth. The four drivers that failed to qualify were Tony Raines, Dave Blaney, Papis and Mike Bliss.

After the qualifier Gordon said, [...] "Our efforts here have improved because we've really focused on it, They started with qualifying, and luckily last time they showed up in the race. ... So we certainly <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can take this qualifying effort and create those types of results as well." ...|$|E

6000|$|They had all {{forgotten}} him, and Sewell {{felt as if}} he {{had neglected}} this helpless guest. [...] "Why, no, you mustn't go! I was in <b>hopes</b> <b>we</b> might do something to make the day pleasant to you. I intended proposing--" ...|$|R
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I <b>hope,</b> <b>we</b> laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I can't imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> do something like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so sad," [...] added Lady Jane; [...] "I <b>hoped</b> <b>we</b> {{might have}} gone on so nicely together. And now I hope your Uncle Giles will not hear of it. He would be so shocked, and never trust you again." ...|$|R
