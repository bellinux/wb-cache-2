50|$|Flaked barley is unmalted, dried barley {{rolled into}} flat flakes. It imparts a rich, grainy flavor to beer {{and is used}} in many stouts, {{especially}} Guinness stout; it also improves <b>head</b> formation and <b>retention.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of advanced oil burner concepts {{has long been}} a part of Brookhaven National Laboratory`s (BNL) oil heat research program. Generally, goals of this work include: increased system efficiency, reduced emissions of soot and NO{sub x}, and the practical extension of the firing rate range of current burners to lower input rates. The report describes the results of a project at BNL aimed at the {{development of}} air atomized burners. Two concepts are discussed. The first is an air atomizer which uses air supplied at pressures ranging from 10 to 20 psi and requiring the integration of an air compressor in the system. The second, more novel, approach involves the use of a low-pressure air atomizing nozzle which requires only 8 - 14 inches of water air pressure for fuel atomization. This second approach requires the use of a fan in the burner instead of a compressor although the fan pressure is higher than with conventional, pressure atomized <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> burners. In testing the first concept, high pressure air atomization, a conventional <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> burner was modified to accept the new nozzle. In addition, the burner head was modified to reduce the flow area to maintain roughly 1 inch of water pressure drop across the head at a firing rate of 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour. The burner ignited easily and could be operated at low excess air levels without smoke. The major disadvantage of this burner approach is the need for the air compressor as part of the system. In evaluating options, a vane-type compressor was selected although the use of a compressor of this type will lead to increased burner maintenance requirements...|$|R

50|$|Wheat {{is used in}} German and American wheat beers, in lambic {{and other}} Belgian ales, and in English ales.

50|$|The Army is {{planning}} on using the existing pads {{used on the}} Advanced Combat Helmet for the ECH. A single pad that cushions the entire helmet may be developed. The ECH has a 4-point chinstrap/napestrap <b>head</b> <b>retention</b> system. The Marine/Navy and Army variants are differentiated in that the Marine/Navy version uses an X-Back retention system (called the Class I) and the Army uses the H-Back retention system (called the Class II).|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} technical advances made to {{the concept}} of a low pressure, air atomized oil burner for home heating applications. Currently all oil burners on the market are of the pressure atomized, <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> type. These burners have a lower firing rate limit of about 0. 5 gallons per hour of oil, due to reliability problems related to small flow passage sizes. High pressure air atomized burners {{have been shown to be}} one route to avoid this problem but air compressor cost and reliability have practically eliminated this approach. With the low pressure air atomized burner the air required for atomization can be provided by a fan at 5 - 8 inches of water pressure. A burner using this concept, termed the Fan-Atomized Burner or ''FAB'' has been developed and is currently being commercialized. In the head of the FAB, the combustion air is divided into three parts, much like a conventional <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> burner. This report describes development work on a new concept in which 100 % of the air from the fan goes through the atomizer. The primary advantage of this approach is a great simplification of the head design. A nozzle specifically sized for this concept was built and is described in the report. Basic flow pressure tests, cold air velocity profiles, and atomization performance have been measured. A burner head/flame tube has been developed which promotes a toroidal recirculation zone near the nozzle for flame stability. The burner head has been tested in several furnace and boiler applications over the firing rate range 0. 2 to 0. 28 gallons per hour. In all cases the burner can operate with very low excess air levels (under 10 %) without producing smoke. Flue gas NO{sub x} concentration varied from 42 to 62 ppm at 3 % O{sub 2 }. The concept is seen as having significant potential and planned development efforts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Particulates {{and complex}} organic {{mixtures}} were sampled from the exhaust of a flame <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> residential oil burner combusting No. 2 fuel oil at three firing conditions: continuous at Bacharach Smoke No. 1, and cyclic (5 min on, 10 min off) at Smoke Nos. 1 and 5. The complex mixtures were recovered by successive Soxhlet extraction of filtered particulates and XAD- 2 sorbent resin with methylene chloride (DCM) and then methanol (MeOH). Bacterial mutagenicity [see Paper II (8) ] {{was found in}} the DCM extractables. Samples of DCM extracts from the two cyclic firing conditions and of the raw fuel were separated by gravity column chromatography on alumina. The resulting fractions were further characterized by a range of instrumental methods. Average yields of both unextracted particulates and of DCM extractables, normalized to a basis of per unit weight of fuel fired, were lower for continuous firing than for cyclic firing. For cyclic firing, decreasing the smoke number lowered the particulates emissions but only slightly reduced the average yield of DCM extractables. These and similar observations, here reported for two other oil burners, show that adjusting the burner to a lower smoke number has little effect on, or may actually increase, emissions of organic extractables of potential public health interest. Modifications of the burner firing cycle aimed at approaching continuous operation offer promise for reducing the amount of complex organic emissions. Unburned fuel accounted for roughly half of the DCM extractables from cyclic firing of the flame <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> burner at high and low smoke number. Large (i. e., greater than 3 ring) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were not observed in the DCM extractables from cyclic firing. However, nitroaromatics, typified by alkylated nitronaphthalenes, alkyl-nitrobiphenyls, and alkyl-nitrophenanthrenes were found in a minor subfraction containing {{a significant portion of the}} total mutagenic activity of the cyclic low smoke samples (8). Oxygen-containing PAH, typified by phenalene- 1 -one and its alkyl derivatives, are important mutagens from cyclic firing at high smoke conditions. Thus, oil burner effluents differ markedly from those of several other combustors, including the automotive diesel engine, where multiring PAH, typified by fluoranthene and alkylated phenanthrenes, account for a significant portion of the effluent mutagenicity. Implications for combustion and emissions source identification are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{residential}} {{oil burner}} market is currently {{dominated by the}} pressure-atomized, <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> burner. At low firing rates pressure atomizing nozzles suffer rapid fouling of the small internal passages, leading to bad spray patterns and poor combustion performance. To overcome the low input limitations of conventional burners, a low pressure air-atomized burner has been developed watch can operate at fining rates as low as 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour (10 kW). In addition, the burner can be operated in a high/low fining rate mode. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at a fixed input rate of 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination. At the test home, instrumentation was installed to measure fuel and energy flows and record trends in system temperatures. Laboratory efficiency testing with water heaters and boilers has been completed using standard single purpose and combined appliance test procedures. The tests quantify benefits due to low firing rates and other burner features. A two stage oil burner gains a strong advantage in rated efficiency while maintaining capacity for high domestic hot water and space heating loads...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{measured}} the emissions {{from a wide}} range of heating equipment burning different fuels including several liquid fuel options, utility supplied natural gas and wood pellet resources. The major effort was placed on generating a database for the mass emission rate of fine particulates (PM 2. 5) for the various fuel types studied. The fine particulates or PM 2. 5 (less than 2. 5 microns in size) were measured using a dilution tunnel technique following the method described in US EPA CTM- 039. The PM 2. 5 emission results are expressed in several units for the benefit of scientists, engineers and administrators. The measurements of gaseous emissions of O{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }, CO, NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } were made using a combustion analyzer based on electrochemical cells These measurements are presented for each of the residential heating systems tested. This analyzer also provides a steady state efficiency based on stack gas and temperature measurements and these values are included in the report. The gaseous results are within the ranges expected from prior emission studies with the enhancement of expanding these measurements to fuels not available to earlier researchers. Based on measured excess air levels and ultimate analysis of the fuel's chemical composition the gaseous emission results are as expected and fall within the range provided for emission factors contained in the US-EPA AP 42, Emission Factors Volume I, Fifth Edition. Since there were no unexpected findings in these gaseous measurements, the bulk of the report is centered on the emissions of fine particulates, or PM 2. 5. The fine particulate (PM 2. 5) results for the liquid fuel fired heating systems indicate a very strong linear relationship between the fine particulate emissions and the sulfur content of the liquid fuels being studied. This is illustrated by the plot contained in the first figure on the next page which clearly illustrates the linear relationship between the measured mass of fine particulate per unit of energy, expressed as milligrams per Mega-Joule (mg/MJ) versus the different sulfur contents of four different heating fuels. These were tested in a conventional cast iron boiler equipped with a flame <b>retention</b> <b>head</b> burner. The fuels included a typical ASTM No. 2 fuel oil with sulfur below 0. 5 percent (1520 average ppm S), an ASTM No. 2 fuel oil with very high sulfur content (5780 ppm S), low sulfur heating oil (322 ppm S) and an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (11 ppm S). Three additional oil-fired heating system types were also tested with normal heating fuel, low sulfur and ultralow sulfur fuel. They included an oil-fired warm air furnace of conventional design, a high efficiency condensing warm air furnace, a condensing hydronic boiler and the conventional hydronic boiler as discussed above. The linearity in the results was observed with all of the different oil-fired equipment types (as shown in the second figure on the next page). A linear regression of the data resulted in an Rsquared value of 0. 99 indicating that a very good linear relationship exits. This means that as sulfur decreases the PM 2. 5 emissions are reduced in a linear manner within the sulfur content range tested. At the ultra low sulfur level (15 ppm S) the amount of PM 2. 5 had been reduced dramatically to an average of 0. 043 mg/MJ. Three different gas-fired heating systems were tested. These included a conventional in-shot induced draft warm air furnace, an atmospheric fired hydronic boiler and a high efficiency hydronic boiler. The particulate (PM 2. 5) measured ranged from 0. 011 to 0. 036 mg/MJ. depending on the raw material source used in their manufacture. All three stoves tested were fueled with premium (low ash) wood pellets obtained in a single batch to provide for uniformity in the test fuel. Unlike the oil and gas fired systems, the wood pellet stoves had measurable amounts of particulates sized above the 2. 5 -micron size that defines fine particulates (less than 2. 5 microns). The fine particulate emissions rates ranged from 22 to 30 mg/ MJ with an average value of 25 mg/MJ for the three stoves tested...|$|R
50|$|Protein {{degradation}} via a proteolytic rest plays many roles: {{production of}} free-amino nitrogen (FAN) for yeast nutrition, freeing of small proteins from larger proteins for foam {{stability in the}} finished product, and reduction of haze-causing proteins for easier filtration and increased beer clarity.

50|$|Eisbock is a {{traditional}} specialty beer of the Kulmbach district of Germany that is made by partially freezing a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume. It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, <b>head</b> <b>retention</b> is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although {{this should not be}} hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence.

5000|$|Doppelbock or double bock is a {{stronger}} version of traditional bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by St. Francis of Paula. Historically, doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweet, thus serving as [...] "liquid bread" [...] for the Friars {{during times of}} fasting, when solid food was not permitted. Today, doppelbock is still strong—ranging from 7%-12% or more by volume. It isn't clear, with color ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although <b>head</b> <b>retention</b> may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavor is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16-26 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer [...] "Salvator" [...] ("Savior"), which today is trademarked by Paulaner. Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add [...] "" [...] to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 [...] "-ator" [...] doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.

Optical microscopy was used for the morphometric analyses of the cell counts, spermatogenic cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. Prenatally exposed animals presented reduced body and testicular weight with an increased gonadosomatic index (GSI). Testicular volume also decreased, as well as the tubular diameter in testes of the same animals.

Methods and Results: Twelve strains were used to ferment a chemically defined wort and hopped ale or stout wort. Fermented products were assessed for foam using the Rudin apparatus, and filterability and haze characteristics using the European Brewing Convention methods, to reveal differences in these parameters {{as a consequence of the}} choice of yeast strain and growth medium. Conclusions: Under the conditions used, the choice of strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae effecting the primary fermentation has an impact on all of the parameters investigated, most notably when the fermentation medium is devoid of macromolecular material.

The three-dimensional trajectory curve shapes of the mandibular movements were consistent with the respective subject movements. Mean XYZ coordinate values and paired t-test results were as follows: X axis: - 0. 0037 ± 0. 02953, P = 0. 502; Y axis: 0. 0037 ± 0. 05242, P = 0. 704; and Z axis: 0. 0007 ± 0. 06040, P = 0. 952.
