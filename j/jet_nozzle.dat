25|$|Vortex tubes {{were used}} by South Africa in their Helikon vortex {{separation}} process. The gas is injected tangentially into a chamber with special geometry that further increases its rotation to a very high rate, causing the isotopes to separate. The method is simple because vortex tubes have no moving parts, but energy intensive, about 50 times greater than gas centrifuges. A similar process, known as <b>jet</b> <b>nozzle,</b> was created in Germany, with a demonstration plant built in Brazil, and they {{went as far as}} developing a site to fuel the country's nuclear plants.|$|E

[...] City was released on February 11, 1997, and received highly favorable critical reception. Kerrang! praised the album for its heaviness, claiming it sounded like [...] "sticking your head into the <b>jet</b> <b>nozzle</b> of a Stealth Bomber", while Metal Hammer ranked it No.13 on its [...] "Top20 Albums of 1997" [...] list. The album soon gained a cult following and a loyal fan base for the band. City {{is considered to be}} the band's best effort by a large number of fans and critics alike. In 2002, the album was No.45 on Revolver magazine's [...] "69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time" [...] list, and also appeared on their [...] "Must Have Metal Albums" [...] list in 2005. It also appeared on the [...] "100 Most Important Albums of the Nineties" [...] list conducted by Terrorizer. Townsend himself stated City [...] "is the real Strapping record.

Diffusers that uses <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> are called <b>jet</b> diffuser {{where it will be}} arranged in the side wall areas in order to distribute air. When the temperature difference between the supply air and the room air changes, the supply air stream is deflected upwards, to supply warm air, or downwards, to supply cold air.|$|R
2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a new {{approach}} to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. [...] This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible. [...] Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the <b>jet</b> <b>nozzle</b> pack attached to the pilot's body. [...] These inventions are known as [...] "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or [...] pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.|$|E
2500|$|Aerodynamic {{enrichment}} processes include the Becker <b>jet</b> <b>nozzle</b> techniques developed by E. W. Becker and associates using the LIGA {{process and the}} vortex tube separation process. These aerodynamic separation processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the gas centrifuge. They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes {{can be considered as}} non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of UF6 with hydrogen or helium as a carrier gas achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant. [...] A demonstration plant was built in Brazil by NUCLEI, a consortium led by Industrias Nucleares do Brasil that used the separation nozzle process. However all methods have high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat; none are currently still in use.|$|E

40|$|In Mauritius, flood jet {{and double}} hollow cone nozzles are used on {{knapsack}} sprayers for applying herbicides in sugar cane whereas standard flat fan nozzles are most common on boom sprayers. The spray distribution {{from all these}} nozzles include fine droplets that may be easily carried by wind and cause damage to susceptible crops grown in the neighbourhood. Air-inclusion nozzles (flat fan type), designed to produce coarser droplets and reduce spray drifts, have been evaluated for herbicide application in sugar cane; the new nozzles were tested more particularly for their herbicidal efficacy in post-emergence of weeds and sugar cane. Results show that post-emergence weed control obtained by the Air-Bubble <b>Jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{is comparable to the}} hollow cone nozzles (on knapsack sprayers) and flat fan nozzles (boom sprayers. Air Inclusion (wide angle) nozzles tested on knapsack sprayers were found to be superior to the flood <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and comparable to double cone <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles.</b> With two passes per cane interrow, an Air Inclusion (wide angle) nozzle mounted on a knapsack sprayer enables significant reduction of spray volume usually required with the double cone <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
50|$|A V/STOL {{aircraft}} normally either lands vertically or {{it makes}} a conventional runway landing. For a vertical landing it uses downward thrust from the lift fan and/or rotated <b>jet</b> <b>nozzle(s),</b> while for a runway landing the <b>jet</b> <b>nozzle(s)</b> are pointed rearward. With a rolling vertical landing the aircraft uses downward jet thrust to hover while it is still moving fast enough to also generate wing lift. This allows for a rolling landing with a significantly reduced approach speed and landing distance.|$|R

50|$|The {{need for}} ice {{particle}} generators, cooled storing facilities and conveying equipment can be eliminated by forming the ice particles *in situ* during the water jet formation.

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{pressure}} characteristics of pulse jet pipe, pulse <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> and ceramic filter {{can be measured}} by high-frequency {{dynamic pressure}} sensor. The research {{is focused on the}} influence of cleaning pressure, the diameter of nozzles, and the ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of pulse jet pipe on pulse cleaning performance. The results show that the difference of pulse <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> performance increases when cleaning pressure increases. The main reason leading to the difference of pulse cleaning is that the increasing rate of static pressure along cleaning direction is slow after the first large increase. The diameter of pulse <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> has a significance affect on cleaning performance so that the uneven performance can be improved by decreasing the diameter of nozzle along the cleaning direction ladder likely. The ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of the pulse jet pipe is a key factor in cleaning performance, and the best range of the ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of the pulse jet pipe in the research is from 45 % to 55 %...|$|R

The type possessed two means of exercising attitude control over the aircraft; aerodynamic surfaces which were used during conventional flight, and air <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles</b> during hovers and vertical flight. Bleed air was extracted from the four lift engines (using approximately 10 per cent of the intake air mass/thrust) to power variable nose, tail and wing tip air <b>jet</b> <b>nozzles,</b> which acted to provide pitch, roll and yaw control at low speeds during which there would be insufficient airflow over the aerodynamic surfaces for conventional controls to be effective.|$|R
