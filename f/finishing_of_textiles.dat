30|$|Despite their several advantages, {{there are}} some {{drawbacks}} associated with natural colorants, such as low exhaustion of dyes and poor fastness of dyed fabrics (Micheal et al. 2003).

Metal salt mordants form complexes with dye molecules on one side and with the functional groups of textile substrate on the other side resulting in improved fastness properties or exhaustion as well as producing wide range of shades with the same dye molecule (Shahid et al. 2013; Cristea and Vilarem 2006).

30|$|Functionalization of {{textiles}} with nanoparticles has attracted intensive attentions {{of scientists and}} engineers in recent years. A number of strategies {{have been developed to}} enhance functions {{of textiles}} [1 – 4], such as antibacterial treatment [1, 5], self-cleaning coating [6, 7], and UV protection enhancement [8, 9].

Silver nanoparticle as a broad antibacterial agent is widely used for antibacterial <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> [12, 13]. Besides antibacterial property, noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., silver and gold) possess particular localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property, which leads to bright colors. Some strategies have been developed to utilize noble metal nanoparticles to functionalize different fibers such as cotton, wool, and silk. The coloration of fibers has been achieved through treatment with silver nanoparticles, taking advantage of the LSPR optical property of noble metal nanoparticles [5, 14, 15]. Similarly, gold nanoparticles can also endow fabrics with different functions including colors, UV protection, and antibacterial properties [16 – 18].|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the use of {{stereoscopic}} virtual technology in textile and fashion studies in particular to the area of chemical experiment. The development of a designed virtual platform, called Stereoscopic Chemical Laboratory (SCL), is introduced. Design/methodology/approach - To implement the suggested educational approaches of SCL, a set of teaching and learning materials with emphasis on the application methods was revised from the existing subjects. The architecture of SCL includes building of virtual objects with the Autodesk software Maya and designing of interactivity by using Unity, a game engine system. Prototype version of the SCL has been passed to selected academic colleagues and students for further evaluation and application feedback. Findings - Textile students can conduct laboratory experiments associated with coloration and <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> technologies in a stereoscopic 3 D and multisensory laboratory, and hence enhance their learning experience. With the use of SCL, students can learn relevant experiment tools, experimental processes, procedures, and safety and health precautions.

40|$|Abstract Laccases are multi-copper {{containing}} oxidases (EC 1. 10. 3. 2), {{widely distributed}} in fungi, higher plants and bacteria. Laccase catalyses the oxidation of phenols, polyphenols and anilines by one-electron abstraction, with the concomitant reduction of oxygen to {{water in a}} four-electron transfer process. In the presence of small redox mediators, laccase offers a broader repertory of oxidations including non-phenolic substrates. Hence, fungal laccases are considered as ideal green catalysts of great biotechnological impact due to their few requirements (they only require air, and they produce water as the only by-product) and their broad substrate specificity, including direct bioelectrocatalysis. Thus, laccases and/or laccase-mediator systems find potential applications in bioremediation, paper pulp bleaching, <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles,</b> bio-fuel cells and more. Significantly, laccases {{can be used in}} organic synthesis, as they can perform exquisite transformations ranging from the oxidation of functional groups to the heteromolecular coupling for production of new antibiotics derivatives, or the catalysis of key steps in the synthesis of complex natural products. In this review, the application of fungal laccases and their engineering by rational design and directed evolution for organic synthesis purposes are discussed. </p...|$|E

40|$|The carpet {{industry}} and their suppliers have noted {{a loss of}} market share in commercial settings such as schools and hospitals {{over the past several}} years. This has occurred most notably in the southeastern U. S. where humidity is high and environmental conditions support the growth of mold and mildew.

Since the copolymerization of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) with an ionizable polymer, such as chitosan, results in a microgel that is responsive to both temperature and pH, the microparticulate hydrogel of poly-NiPAAmchitosan copolymer (PNCS) was synthesized using surfactant-free emulsion method. The microparticle size in dry (collapsed) state is estimated at 200 nm by SEM and TEM, and effect of temperature and pH on microparticles was investigated by DLS and UV–vis spectrophotometry. The incorporation of PNCS microparticles to cotton material was done by a simple pad-dry-cure procedure from aqueous microparticle dispersion that contained 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) as a crosslinking agent.

In the current work, the novel natural mordant like chitosan with different concentrations (10 % and 20 % of weight of fiber) was applied on cotton and fabric was printed with natural dyes such as catechu, turmeric, and marigold using screen printing method. All the three dyes were used in powder form in print paste with different concentrations (1 %, 5 %, and 10 %) and guar gum was used as thickener. The printed samples using chitosan as a mordant showed the equivalent color values to that of prints obtained using alum as a mordant.

Hence, this research effort was aimed at elucidating the relationship between molecular weight (MW) of chitosan and its antimicrobial activity upon six dermal reference microorganisms, as well as the influence of the interactions with cotton fabrics on said activity. Using 3 chitosans with different MW, as well as two chitooligosaccharide (COS) mixtures, a relevant antimicrobial effect was observed by 24 h for the six microorganisms tested; it was apparent that the antimicrobial effect is strongly dependent on the type of target microorganism and on the MW of chitosan – being higher for lower MW in the case of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the reverse in the case of both Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, a strong anti-fungal effect was detectable upon C. albicans, resembling the action over Gram-positive bacteria. Interactions with cotton fabric resulted in a loss of COS activity when compared with cultured media, relative to the effect over Gram-negative bacteria. However, no significant differences for the efficacy of all the 5 compounds were observed by 4 h. The three chitosans possessed a higher antimicrobial activity when impregnated onto the fabric, and presented a similar effect on both Gram-positive bacteria and yeast, in either matrix.

30|$|CDS are cyclic {{oligosaccharides}} {{produced with}} {{the transformation of}} starch by bacteria’s such as Bacillus macerans (Astray et al. 2009; Jeang et al. 2005). These are capable of forming inclusion compounds with hydrophobic substances (Valle 2003) and found in different forms viz. consisting of six α-CD, seven β-CD, eight γ-CD and various other derivatives, such as δ, ζ, ξ, θ and ή-cyclodextrins or more glucopyranose units linked by α-(1, 4) bonds (Aggrawal and Warmoeskerken 2008; Lo et al. 2003; Martel 2002 a, b; Ribeiro et al. 2008). The most notable feature of CDs is their ability to form solid inclusion complexes (host–guest complexes) with a very wide range of solid, liquid and gaseous compounds by molecular complexation. Complex formation between host and guest is a dimensional fit between host cavity and guest molecule in which no covalent bonds are broken or formed during formation of the inclusion complex and hydrophobic interactions might be the main driving forces for CD-based host–guest compounds (Lo et al. 2003; Ribeiro et al. 2008). Since each guest molecule is individually surrounded by a cyclodextrin (derivative) the molecule is micro-encapsulated from a microscopic point of view, this property of β-cyclodextrin can be utilized in <b>finishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> like antimicrobial finish, aroma finishing and flame retardant finishing (Eugenio et al. 2005).
