5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E

60|$|I could 'ear {{several people}} talking, {{and it seemed}} to me there was quite a crowd out there, and by and by that bell was going like mad. Then people started kicking the gate, and shouting, but I took no notice until, presently, it left off all of a sudden, and I <b>'eard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice asking what it was all about. I suppose there was about fifty of 'em all telling it at once, and then there was the sound of a fist on the gate.|$|R
50|$|In {{the home}} a water hammer may occur when a dishwasher, washing machine or toilet shuts off water flow. The result may be <b>heard</b> as <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang, {{repetitive}} banging (as the shock wave travels {{back and forth}} in the plumbing system), or as some shuddering.|$|R
5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> thump outside of her house. Through her window {{she could see}} a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen {{what appeared to be a}} red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The flight left Hong Kong on 25 July 2008 {{shortly after}} 9:00 am HKT (0100 UTC). At 10:17 HKT (0217 UTC), {{passengers}} and crew <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang; the cabin de-pressurised and {{a hole in the}} floor of the passenger deck appeared, as well as a hole in the outside wall of the cargo deck. During the emergency, parts of the aircraft's floor and ceiling collapsed. Passengers reported that, despite the noise and the deployment of the oxygen masks, there was very little panic. The pilots conducted an emergency descent from 29,000feet to ensure adequate oxygen supply for the passengers, reaching 10,000feet by 10:24 HKT (02:24 UTC).|$|E
500|$|Neither pilot aboard Flight 159 {{initially}} saw {{how close}} DAL 379 {{was to the}} runway. [...] As Flight 159 sped down the runway, the captain observed that the DC-9 was [...] "off the runway" [...] by only [...] "five, six, seven feet or something of that nature." [...] As the Boeing 707 passed the Delta plane, the pilots <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang which coincided with a movement of the flight controls and a yawing motion of the aircraft. Thinking he had hit the DC-9, Flight 159's first officer attempted to abort the takeoff, and both pilots attempted to use their aircraft's thrust reversers, brakes, and spoilers to stop the aircraft.|$|E

500|$|On February 27, 2007, {{at about}} 10am, {{a suicide bomber}} killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney. The Taliban claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target. They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation. The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> boom... The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate." [...] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|John, {{the author}} of Revelation, was exiled to the island of Patmos, {{possibly}} {{during the reign of}} the emperor Domitian.

In , the figure whom John sees identifies himself as [...] "the First and the Last," [...] who [...] "was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever" [...] — a reference to Jesus' resurrection.|$|E
60|$|Slugger and Nappy {{had just}} started to move away toward the lake shore, {{intending}} to sneak behind some rocks and bushes, when they <b>heard</b> Fred give <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> shout from {{the entrance to the}} second cabin. Then Andy gave a long whistle.|$|R
6000|$|All {{three were}} {{wrapped up in}} oil-skins; {{but in spite of}} this they had a general {{sensation}} of dampness, for it had been raining more or less ever since they started. Jack was below, when he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> far <b>louder</b> roar of the wind than before, and heard his uncle shout, [...] "Brail up the main as far as you can, Tom--the jib is about all we want now!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The long-tailed {{gentoo penguin}} ( [...] ) (Pygoscelis papua) is a penguin {{species in the}} genus Pygoscelis, most {{closely related to the}} Adélie penguin (P. adeliae) and the {{chinstrap}} penguin (P. antarcticus). The first scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster with a reference point of the Falkland Islands. They call in a variety of ways, but the most frequently <b>heard</b> is <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> trumpeting which is emitted with its head thrown back.|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 {{expedition}} would {{feature the}} only [...] "close encounters" [...] of the Mackal expeditions. It occurred when, {{while on a}} river, they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> splash and saw what Greenwell described as [...] " [...] large wake (about 5") ... originating from the east bank". Greenwell asserted that the wake must {{have been caused by}} an [...] "animate object" [...] that was unlike a crocodile or hippo. Additionally, Greenwell noted that the encounter occurred at a sharp river bend where, according to natives, Mokèlé-mbèmbé frequently lived due to deep waters at those points.|$|E
2500|$|Geldof's police {{statements}} and {{evidence to the}} coroner indicated that he patiently listened to Hutchence who was [...] "hectoring and abusive and threatening". A friend of Yates and Geldof confirmed the substance of this call and added that Geldof had said, [...] "I know what time the call ended, it was 20 to 7, I was going to log it as a threatening call". The occupant in the room next to Room 524 <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> male voice and swearing at about 5am; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.|$|E
2500|$|On May 7, 2014, four {{dead bodies}} were {{discovered}} after {{a fire in}} a [...] Tampa mansion that Blake owned and was leasing out. A neighbor, who was walking her dog(s), <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> explosion, saw a house engulfed in flames around 5:40a.m., and called 911. Police later found that tenant Darrin Campbell had purchased fireworks and gasoline cans {{three days before the}} fire, and that all four victims – Campbell, his wife Kim, and their children, Colin, 19, and Megan, 16 – had been shot with a gun registered to him. [...] Blake was cleared of any involvement.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning she}} was driving her cows through the meadows when she <b>heard</b> near by <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> groan that almost sounded human. She hastened to the spot from which the noise came, and found it {{proceeded}} from a lion who lay stretched upon the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Jamie {{suffered}} {{cruciate ligament}} {{damage to his}} left knee during a preseason friendly in August 2016, in what {{would prove to be}} his final game for the club, with a scan confirming a nine month layoff. Reacting to the setback Griffiths commented [...] "I twisted one way and I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> really <b>loud</b> crack.I just hoped I hadn’t torn my ACL, but unfortunately that’s what’s happened, It’s the worst injury I’ve ever had." ...|$|R
50|$|At 2:23 pm CDT, Delta Flight 1288 {{was cleared}} for takeoff on Runway 17. As the first officer was {{advancing}} the throttles and reaching an airspeed of 40 knots, the cockpit lost lighting and instrumentation. The rear cabin passengers and flight crew <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> very <b>loud</b> bang and experienced a blast-like sensation. The pilot then ended takeoff by bringing the throttle to idle and engaging the brake, which brought the aircraft to an eventual stop without use of reversers or spoilers.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{destruction}} of Alba by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken. [...] The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice from the grove on {{the summit of the}} mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (nundinae). [...] Nonetheless a plague ensued: [...] in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt. The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|In the train's front car, Chris Gross was {{suddenly}} {{thrown out of}} his seat. [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang {{and a lot of}} screaming," [...] he recalled. Flames were within a foot of his face; another passenger got the emergency exit open and pulled him out. The five passengers who died were all sitting near him, he claimed. Jamie Wallace, in the second car, said that passengers there initially tried to {{come to the aid of}} those in the front car, but [...] "we could not get the head car doors open for some reason, it was jammed." [...] After failed efforts to break the door open, [...] " [...] number of us started smelling fumes from the car, the fuel, and we said, 'You know what, we need to get out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|There was one {{eye-witness}} to {{the accident}} [...] Grete Mortensen, {{who was working}} outdoors at a kindergarten in Gamvik. Mortensen's comments were key to locating the aircraft after the crash. She stated that she <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> splash and informed the initial commission that [...] "a while later" [...] she saw a fighter jet in the area. The initial commission did not at the time ask for the time frame between her sightings of the two aircraft. In 1987 she specified that the fighter came about one to five minutes after the splash. The final commission stated that the later specification very well could {{have been influenced by}} the media reports. The last commission stated that the first commission's non-interest in following up her comments were used by the media to raise doubt about the existence of a fighter in the area.|$|E
5000|$|In later testimony, First Officer Donatos Lilis said: [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> very <b>loud</b> noise, like {{iron bars}} beating against each other. Perhaps {{the cover of}} a pump had broken. Then there was an awful explosion." [...] Five crewmen died immediately, as fire broke out and oil started leaking from the hull as the plates overheated. As the fire engulfed the ship, flames rose 100m high and, after a series of further explosions occurred, between 30-40,000 tons of oil poured into the sea.|$|R
60|$|The short, sharp report {{died out}} in the still, frosty air; Crystal vainly {{strained}} her ears to catch {{the sound of a}} fall or a groan. But in the confusion that ensued she could not distinguish any individual sound. She knew that Mme. la Duchesse and Jeanne had screamed, she <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> few <b>loud</b> curses, the clatter of bits and bridles, the snorting of horses and presently the noise of several horses galloping away, {{out in the}} direction of Chambéry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band and}} its new {{director}} also clicked over his arrangement of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", which featured the striking {{effect of a}} single trumpet playing {{the first half of}} the song, joined later by soft woodwinds and tuba, and finally bringing the full power of the brass only in the final verse. When it was played at the [...] "Big Game" [...] against Cal, just eight days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Barnes said, [...] "I've never <b>heard</b> such <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> silence." ...|$|R
2500|$|One witness on the ground, {{who was out}} walking, {{stated that}} [...] "the plane had lost balance, and then we saw it going down". Others {{described}} the plane as being lower {{than it should have}} been. [...] "I wondered why the plane wasn't flying higher as it was flying towards the hill", one stated. [...] "Then within three or four minutes I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> explosion". Another said that [...] "it was raining. I saw the plane flying very low from the window of my office". Imran Abbasi told The New York Times that he [...] "could tell it was trouble because it stayed so low even though the mountains were up ahead". He stated that the jet was [...] "flying as low as a four-story building". It was reported that Abbasi said that [...] "as the aircraft started to turn, the right side of its front banged into the highest mountain, emitting an instant billow of blue fire and black smoke".|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 25 March the men on Seneca <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> {{explosion}} within their convoy, and shortly afterward saw distress rockets in the air. They found the British ship Cowslip had been torpedoed and was sinking. Immediately a boat was put over with Third Lieutenant F. W. Brown in charge. [...] They soon returned with 15 of Cowslips men, along with one of Cowslips boats with 19 others. Boatswain P. W. Patterson and a fresh boat crew took Cowslips boat back, while Lieutenant Brown returned with Senecas boat. Patterson's boat took 20 survivors on board and towed seven others in a small dinghy. Brown's boat rescued the last 19 on board the sinking vessel. Only five officers and one enlisted man were lost, and they had been killed in the explosion. This rescue was beyond the call of Senecas duty as the escort vessels were to attack enemy submarines, but it was understood that when a ship was torpedoed the escorts were not expected to expose themselves to a similar fate by stopping to rescue the survivors. However, Captain Wheeler was commended for taking what was considered a [...] "justifiable risk".|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd {{not have}} quitted it {{could we have}} tarried at home," [...] began Ambrose; {{but at that moment}} there was a sudden commotion, a {{trampling}} of horses was <b>heard</b> outside, <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> imperious voice demanded, [...] "Is my Lord Archbishop within?" [...] a whisper ran round, [...] "the King," [...] and there entered the hall with hasty steps, a figure never to be forgotten, clad in a hunting dress of green velvet embroidered with gold, with a golden hunting horn slung round his neck.|$|R
60|$|She went on, but he {{remained}} standing stock {{still in the}} dusk. She had already reached the three palms when she <b>heard</b> behind her <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> peal of laughter, cynical and joyless, such as is heard in smoking-rooms {{at the end of}} a scandalous story. It made her feel positively faint for a moment.|$|R
60|$|The {{boat was}} turned and rowed {{out to sea}} for some distance, then they again headed her in the {{direction}} in which they wished to go, but keeping the guns well in shore of them until they judged by the sound that they were nearly opposite to her, then they rowed straight towards her. The sound of their oars was <b>heard,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> hail informed them of the exact position of the ship, and two or three minutes later a dark image loomed {{up in front of the}} boat.|$|R
