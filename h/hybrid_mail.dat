25|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>mail,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as L-mail, is the electronic lodgement of mail from the mail generator’s computer directly to a Postal Service provider. The Postal Service provider is then able to use electronic means to have the mail piece sorted, routed and physically produced at a site closest to the delivery point. It is a type of mail growing in popularity with some Post Office operations and individual businesses venturing into this market. In some countries, these services are available to print and deliver emails to those who are unable to receive email, such as the elderly or infirm. Services provided by <b>Hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> providers are closely related to that of mail forwarding service providers.|$|E
2500|$|Mainly {{during the}} 20th century, {{experimentation}} with <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> has combined electronic and paper delivery. [...] Electronic mechanisms include telegram, telex, facsimile (fax), email, and {{short message service}} (SMS). There have been methods which have combined mail {{and some of these}} newer methods, such as INTELPOST, which combined facsimile transmission with overnight delivery. These vehicles commonly use a mechanical or electro-mechanical standardised writing (typing), that on the one hand makes for more efficient communication, while on the other hand makes impossible characteristics and practices that traditionally were in conventional mail, such as calligraphy.|$|E

40|$|Brain-computer interface-based {{communication}} {{plays an}} important role in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications; electronic mail is one of the most common communication tools. In this study, we propose a <b>hybrid</b> BCI-based <b>mail</b> client that implements electronic mail communication by means of real-time classification of multimodal features extracted from scalp electroencephalography (EEG). With this BCI mail client, users can receive, read, write, and attach files to their mail. Using a BCI mouse that utilizes hybrid brain signals, that is, motor imagery and P 300 potential, the user can select and activate the function keys and links on the mail client graphical user interface (GUI). An adaptive P 300 speller is employed for text input. The system has been tested with 6 subjects, and the experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|To {{speed up}} the {{delivery}} to H.M. Forces, the BFPO developed a <b>hybrid</b> form of <b>mail,</b> known as the 'e-Bluey', in which letters can be sent directly by internet to the British Armed Forces serving in theatre. The letters are downloaded and printed and then dispatched to the recipient via the traditional military postal system. Letters sent by serving Armed Forces members {{to family and friends}} in the UK (from Operational Theatres) are downloaded and printed at various locations in the UK and then delivered to the Royal Mail for final delivery.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to present a useful application for the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{that is expected to}} one day replace the analog phone system in use today. ISDN itself and its continuing evolution are detailed. The system developed as a part of this thesis involved the creation of an inexpensive 2 ̆ 2 phone terminal 2 ̆ 2 that can serve as an ISDN terminal and also as a bridge to a Local Area Network (LAN). The 2 ̆ 2 phone terminal 2 ̆ 2 provides a <b>hybrid</b> electronic <b>mail</b> system that allows the attachment of speech to text within a message. Messages created with this 2 ̆ 2 phone terminal 2 ̆ 2 could theoretically be sent locally using the LAN interface and globally using ISDN to other users with either 2 ̆ 2 phone terminals 2 ̆ 2 or multimedia personal computers. For this project, the two 2 ̆ 2 phone terminals 2 ̆ 2 created were interconnected via an Ethernet and using an 80486 PC to act as a Central Office System. This Central Office System provides speech/message storage for the 2 ̆ 2 phone terminals. 2 ̆ 2 It makes use of speech compression techniques to minimize the storage requirements. The speech compression techniques used as well as the field of speech coding in general are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Zumbox was a {{proposed}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> service for receiving postal mail via the web. [...] The service {{was intended to}} work in parallel to traditional postal services, whereby a digital mailbox—a Zumbox— would be created for every street address in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|In December 2013 {{the company}} inaugurated its second <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> {{production}} center in Santa Catarina. The new facility near Florianópolis will serve {{the south and}} the states of Ceará and Bahia. It has the ability to scan and produce 2.7m items each month, a little smaller than the Brasilia plant’s 4.5m capacity, which was opened in August of that year. At the moment, the two plants together are producing about 2.5m mailpieces a month, including communications for the Ministry of Health and notifications for the Federal Highway Police and the Judiciary. The company is also planning to open a facility in São Paulo later this year, while next year facilities will be opened in Belém, Salvador and Belo Horizonte as the company’s <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> capabilities expand.|$|E
50|$|V-mail, {{short for}} Victory Mail, was a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> process used by America during the Second World War {{as the primary}} and secure method to {{correspond}} with soldiers stationed abroad. To {{reduce the cost of}} transferring an original letter through the military postal system, a V-mail letter would be censored, copied to film, and printed back to paper upon arrival at its destination. The V-mail process is based on the earlier British Airgraph process.|$|E
50|$|Post {{offices and}} other mail service {{providers}} typically offer a mail forwarding service, {{commonly known as}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> or virtual post office box services, to redirect mail addressed to one location to another address - usually for a given period. In {{the case of the}} United States Postal Service's First Class Mail, it is generally for a period of one year. British Royal Mail provides a service called Mail Redirection, enabling redirection for up to two years. Customers of such a service usually, but not exclusively, use mail forwarding when they change address.|$|E

5000|$|An online {{post office}} is a {{commercial}} mail receiving agency that implements the concept of <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail,</b> enabling conventional mail to become electronic, or electronic correspondence to be printed and mailed at a remote location. As paper correspondence becomes inconvenient for businesses that are evolving to maintain a paperless office, services have emerged to outsource the task of scanning snail mail as it arrives. Some online post offices will scan envelopes for subscribing customers, and offer handling options (E.g. whether to scan the contents, store, or shred them). Some providers will systematically scan and make the contents immediately available.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{evidence}} that posts are increasingly using <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> solutions in the developing world to leapfrog historic lack of investment in up-to-date infrastructure and service quality. This is similar to a country without an extensive land line phone network moving directly to a mobile phone network. Developments in technology are often used by private companies to fill gaps in public postal service. In the UK, there has been a mushrooming of service providers because of the particular regulatory conditions which require Royal Mail to offer advantageous downstream access postal rates to providers of hybrid services.|$|E
5000|$|The name, e-bluey, {{comes from}} the aerograms that are (still) {{provided}} for troops on active service and their families at home. Self-adhesive strips {{along the edges of}} the paper allowed it to be folded and sealed without the added weight of an envelope, meaning that more of them could be carried by air or by hand for the same total weight. Because of the blue paper these self-contained kits were inevitably known as [...] "blueys", and the name came to carry something of an emotional charge due to the significance of receiving a possibly rare bluey from a loved one. [...] "e-Bluey" [...] was thus a natural term for the BFPO's electronic <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> system.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, a first formal {{cooperation}} agreement came between the Russia and Italy {{to work together}} to develop the postal system in Russia. On late November 2013 Russian Post and Poste Italiane have signed a new agreement to cooperate further in order to improve the Russian postal system. The agreement, which was signed along with their technology supplier Selex, was sealed at a trade summit in Trieste during an official visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin, following up earlier agreements between the three companies. Along with development of e-commerce and international express mail services, the new agreement aims to develop <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> in Russia for businesses, direct marketing and e-government services. This would allow mailers to send information electronically to be turned into physical mailpieces local to the recipient.|$|E
50|$|E-COM, {{short for}} Electronic Computer Originated Mail, was a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> process used from 1982 to 1985 by the U.S. Postal Service to print {{electronically}} originated mail, and deliver it in envelopes to customers {{within two days}} of transmission. The E-COM service allowed customers to transmit messages of up to two pages from their own computers, via telecommunication lines, {{to one or more}} of 25 serving post offices (SPOs) located in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. After an electronic message was received as a SPO, it was processed and sorted by ZIP Code, then printed on letter-size bond paper, folded, and sealed in an envelope printed with a blue E-COM logo. In order to be eligible for the service, customers were required to send a minimum of 200 messages per transmission.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> is {{mail that}} is {{delivered}} {{using a combination}} of electronic and physical delivery. Usually, it involves digital data being transformed into physical letter items at distributed print centres located {{as close as possible to}} the final delivery addresses. An e-mail letter (also L-mail and letter mail) is a letter which sent as an email using a computer then printed out and delivered as a traditional (physical) letter. It is a communication means between the virtual cyber- and the material real world. The printer or mail transfer agent prints the electronic mail on paper, the mail transport agent packs it into an envelope and the mail delivery agent or postman delivers it to the receiver's mailbox. Generally there is a fee for this service; however very small amounts and single email letters may be free of charge depending on the service provider and generally fees are much lower than directly sending mail or using a franking machine.|$|E
40|$|Driven {{by market}} opening and {{increased}} competition from electronic communication, postal operators have started extending their {{scope of business}} by offering <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> services in addition to physical mail conveyance. This paper discusses commercial and regulatory aspects of reverse <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail,</b> i. e. the electronic delivery and archiving of physical mail messages. It argues that postal operators are well positioned to offer hybrid services due to their established brands and their reputation. The introduction of reverse <b>hybrid</b> <b>mail</b> is able to significantly {{reduce the cost of}} postal operations {{while at the same time}} fitting customers' needs better than traditional postal services. However, these effects rely on the assumption that a postal operator is actually allowed to introduce an electronic delivery system of letters to entire regions and to thereby partially substitute the physical delivery to the doorstep.
