50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the <b>knife</b> <b>switch</b> are the slow opening speed and {{the proximity of}} the operator to exposed live parts. Metal-enclosed safety disconnect switches are used for isolation of circuits in industrial power distribution. Sometimes spring-loaded auxiliary blades are fitted which momentarily carry the full current during opening, then quickly part to rapidly extinguish the arc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Knife</b> <b>switches</b> {{are made}} in many sizes from {{miniature}} switches to large devices used to carry thousands of amperes. In electrical transmission and distribution, gang-operated switches are used in circuits up to the highest voltages.|$|R
50|$|The {{telegraph}} keys {{or telephone}} dial creates trains of on-off current pulses {{corresponding to the}} digits 1-9, and 0 (which sends 10 pulses). This equipment originally consisted of two telegraph keys engaged by <b>knife</b> <b>switches,</b> and evolved into the rotary dial telephone.|$|R

They toured the UK throughout January and February 2006, supported by White Rose Movement, Duels, Young <b>Knives,</b> <b>Switches</b> and Klaxons. They also completed their first tour of the UK since the release of Ten New Messages, including their biggest headline concert, a sold out show at Brixton Academy.|$|R
50|$|Signaling {{began in}} an {{appropriately}} primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being {{equipped with a}} bell, first operated over a second wire and later with the same wire using a condenser. Telephones connected to the earliest Strowger automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the <b>knife</b> <b>switch,</b> one for each telegraph key, one for the bell, one for the push button and two for speaking.|$|E
50|$|Though used {{commonly}} in the past, knife switches are now rare, finding use {{largely in}} science experiments where {{the position of}} the switch may be plainly seen in demonstration. The <b>knife</b> <b>switch</b> is extremely simple in construction and use, but its exposed metal parts present a great risk of electric shock, and the switch is subject to arcing when opened at higher voltages, which poses a further risk of shock or burns to the operator and can cause fires or explosions under certain conditions.|$|E
50|$|Two {{diamond-shaped}} pantographs - controllable with a valve in each cab - led {{the current}} from the catenary {{to the two}} main knife switches {{on the roof of}} the locomotive body. From these main knife switches the current was transferred to the Earthing <b>knife</b> <b>switch.</b> This was then led to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. The huge lightning protection inductor was removed later since the practical experience showed that it was not necessary.|$|E
50|$|Open <b>knife</b> <b>{{switches}}</b> were {{supplanted by}} safety switches with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure {{which can only}} be opened by switching off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} central {{power stations}} used simple open <b>knife</b> <b>switches,</b> mounted on insulating panels of marble or asbestos. Power levels and voltages rapidly escalated, making opening manually operated switches {{too dangerous for}} anything other than isolation of a de-energized circuit. Oil-filled equipment allowed arc energy to be contained and safely controlled. By the early 20th century, a switchgear line-up would be a metal-enclosed structure with electrically operated switching elements, using oil circuit breakers. Today, oil-filled equipment has largely been replaced by air-blast, vacuum, or SF6 equipment, allowing large currents and power levels to be safely controlled by automatic equipment.|$|R
50|$|On {{half-duplex}} channels {{the radio}} station: receiver, transmitter, and antenna or antennas are usually interconnected by so-called transmit/receive or (T/R) switches that effectively connect and disconnect {{the receiver and}} transmitter from the antenna or antennas {{as required by the}} radiotelegraph channel protocol in use. T/R switches may be controlled by a variety of techniques. Typical T/R switch control methods and protocols are: manual operation, automatic semi break-in operation and automatic full break-in operation. T/R switches are analog high power radio frequency or RF switch devices which may take many practical forms ranging all the way from simple mechanical manually operated <b>knife</b> <b>switches</b> to fully automated modern semiconductor devices.|$|R
50|$|A switchblade (also {{known as}} an {{automatic}} knife, pushbutton knife, ejector <b>knife,</b> <b>switch,</b> Sprenger, Springer, flick knife, or flick blade) {{is a type of}} knife with a folding or sliding blade contained in the handle which is opened automatically by a spring when a button, lever, or switch on the handle or bolster is activated. Most switchblade designs incorporate a locking blade, in which the blade is locked against closure when the spring extends the blade to the fully opened position. The blade is unlocked by manually operating a mechanism that unlocks the blade and allows it to be folded and locked in the closed position.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>knife</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a type}} of switch used {{to control}} the flow of {{electricity}} in a circuit. It is composed of a hinge which allows a metal lever, or knife, to be lifted from or inserted into a slot or jaw. The hinge and jaw are both fixed to an insulated base, and the knife has an insulated handle to grip at one end. Current flows through the switch when the knife is pushed into the jaw.Knife switches can take several forms, including single throw, in which the [...] "knife" [...] engages with only a single slot, and double throw, in which the knife hinge is placed between two slots and can engage with either one. Also, multiple knives may be attached to a single handle and can be used to activate more than one circuit simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|The five-position <b>knife</b> <b>switch</b> {{common to}} all Nighthawks {{provides}} five tone settings (or pickup combinations), but on the three-pickup models, the tone knob includes a push-pull feature that provides access to {{a second set of}} five, for a total of ten tones. It is often said that when the knob is pulled out, the humbuckers' coils are split, but this is somewhat misleading. All Nighthawks have a mixture of humbucking and split-coil tones whether or not they have the push-pull feature. On the two-pickup models, only positions two and five use both coils of the same pickup; the other three positions are split-coil. On the three-pickup models, one or both humbuckers are split in positions one, two, four, and five with the tone knob pulled up, and in position five with the tone knob pushed down. (See the graphic at right.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Knife</b> <b>switches</b> {{consist of}} a flat metal blade, hinged at one end, with an {{insulating}} handle for operation, and a fixed contact. When the switch is closed, current flows through the hinged pivot and blade and through the fixed contact. Such switches are usually not enclosed. The knife and contacts are typically formed of copper, steel, or brass, depending on the application. Fixed contacts may be backed up with a spring. Several parallel blades can be operated {{at the same time}} by one handle. The parts may be mounted on an insulating base with terminals for wiring, or may be directly bolted to an insulated switch board in a large assembly. Since the electrical contacts are exposed, the switch is used only where people cannot accidentally come in contact with the switch or where the voltage is so low as to not present a hazard.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the company was laid in Vienna in 1907 in the Wattgasse 53 in the 16th district Ottakring. The company initially produced <b>knife</b> <b>switches,</b> the forerunners of today's disconnectors, which are counted from construction to the simplest and the first electrical switches {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. The other main products in the first four decades of the company's existence were lever and roller switches. At the end of the 1920s the new plastic material bakelite was used in switch construction. Kraus & Naimer is the patent owner of numerous innovations in switchgear technology. For the first time, the company introduced a cam switch in the modular design (model C15) to the market in 1948, whereby customer-specific switches can be manufactured. The method of mass production of individual products is generally known in the industry also under the term mass customization.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power system}} became {{operational}} on 19 June 1891 and was run continuously {{for the first}} 30 days. The entire plant required 15 to 20 attendants for its operation. The instruments and controls were rudimentary, solenoid type gravity balance Voltmeters and ammeters mounted on lacquered wooden boards. Workers had to take special care {{because of the high}} voltages used. Power was connected by closing simple <b>knife</b> <b>switches</b> and the system was shut down (the electrical circuit [...] "opened") by a worker garbing a connecting line at the power pole and pulling it out of the arc-light style plug mounted on the pole (a sometime dangerous maneuver that produced 6 to 8 foot (1.83-m to 2.44-m) long high voltage arcs). One continual problem was repairing damage from lightning strikes, a common occurrence at the mountainous location. The alternators were set on paraffin soaked oak platforms to add insulation and Westinghouse engineers tried various types of lightning arrestors. The alternators were designed with removable parts making the task of repairing them a little easier.|$|R
5000|$|Signalling {{began in}} an {{appropriately}} primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being {{equipped with a}} bell in a ringer box, first operated over a second wire, and later over the same wire, but with a condenser (capacitor) in series with the bell coil to allow the AC ringer signal through while still blocking DC (keeping the phone [...] "on hook"). Telephones connected to the earliest Strowger automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the <b>knife</b> <b>switch,</b> one for each telegraph key, one for the bell, one for the push-button and two for speaking. Large wall telephones in the early 20th century usually incorporated the bell, and separate bell boxes for desk phones dwindled away {{in the middle of}} the century.|$|E
5000|$|V5 - In 2000 Squier made an {{exclusive}} run of six string Stagemasters for Mars Music. They came in HH configuration only and {{were available in}} three colors: Blueburst, Redburst, and Blackburst. Notable difference is the regular headstock that is not reversed {{like all the other}} Stagemasters. These came with a bolt on 24 fret neck, Licensed Floyd Rose tremolo bridge with a locking nut, black hardware, one vol/one tone knob, and a 3-way <b>knife</b> <b>switch.</b> These are known as the [...] "Mars Stagemasters". The 2nd generation 24-fret Solid Body Stagemaster featured many upgrades and was [...] "designed to compete with guitars costing 4 to 5 times as much." [...] One upgrade was wax potted pickups stock with the guitar. Another upgrade was rear-mounted electronics allowing for a guitar without pickguards. The Deluxe model featured neck-through three-piece maple necks, while the standard models featured a bolt-on one-piece neck with no scarf joint with the contoured heel. The reverse headstocks on the Stagemasters allow for completely straight string pull. Another nice feature is the inclusion of a brass bridge sustain block on the licensed Floyd Rose bridge, unusual quality in a budget-priced guitar. In 2002 the Stagemaster was renamed to Showmaster due to a trademark claim from Kramer, who made a guitar called the Stagemaster in the mid-late 1980's. V3 and V4 model Stagemaster guitars are known to exist labelled as [...] "Showmaster".|$|E

6000|$|The Indians {{could not}} wait for his arrival. They came out, men, women, and children, to meet him, with whoops and yells, and when they had made his captors fasten him to a stake, they fell upon him, and tore off {{all that was left}} of his clothes, and amused {{themselves}} till midnight by dancing and screaming round him, and beating him with rods and their open hands. In the morning he was ordered to run the gantlet, through two rows of Indians of all ages and sexes, armed with <b>knives,</b> clubs, <b>switches,</b> and hoe handles, and ready to cut, strike, and stab at him as he dashed by them {{on his way to the}} council house, a quarter of a mile from the point of starting. But Kenton was too wary to take the risks before him. He suddenly started aside from the lines; he turned and doubled in his course, and managed to reach the council house unhurt except for the blows of two Indians who threw themselves between him and its door. Here a council was held at once, and he was sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but the sentence was ordered to be carried out at the town of Wapatimika on Mad River. A white renegade among the Indians told him of his fate with a curse, and Kenton resolved that rather than meet it he would die in the attempt to escape. On the way to Wapatimika he gave his guard the slip and dashed into the woods; and he had left his pursuers far behind, when he ran into the midst of another party of Indians, who seized him and drove him forward to the town. A second council was now held, and after Kenton had run the gantlet a second time and been severely hurt, the warriors once more gathered in the council house, and sitting on the ground in a circle voted his death by striking the earth with a war club, or by passing it to the next if inclined to mercy. He was brought before them, as he supposed, to be told when he was to die, but a blanket was thrown upon the ground for him to sit upon in the middle of the circle, and Simon Girty, the great renegade, who was cruder to the whites than the Indians themselves, began harshly to question him about the number of men in Kentucky. A few words passed, and then Girty asked, [...] "What is your name?" [...] "Simon Butler," [...] said Kenton, and Girty jumped from his seat and threw his arms around Kenton's neck. They had been scouts together in the English service, before the Revolution began, and had been very warm friends, and now Girty set himself to save Kenton's life. He pleaded so strongly in his favor that the council at last voted to spare him, at least for the time being.|$|R
