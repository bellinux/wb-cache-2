40|$|This study tested whether {{contract}} farming or farmers professional cooperatives (FPCs) <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> social <b>benefit</b> of pork production and income of breeding farmers in China. The main concern {{of this study}} is whether institutional arrangement like {{contract farming}} or FPCs actually <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> welfare of farmers as expected. To answer this question accurately, we estimated the differentiated market demand of pork products in order to quantify <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> by transaction types. Our study finds that contract farming or FPCs <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of pork products, but farmer's income remained lower than that of traditional transaction types. This finding is new in terms of quantifying distribution of the economic values among sales outlets, agro-firms and farmers. It is more reliable because it explicitly captures impacts from both demand side and supply side by structural estimation. In practice, we need to keep it mind the bargaining power of small farmers will not improve instantly even when the contract farming or FPCs are introduced...|$|R

30|$|A {{principal}} {{contribution of}} this study is to provide empirical evidence on long term earnings associated with general training as an alternative to vocational/specific training. Heterogeneity among the unemployed, and in labor market demand for skills, implies that variety in the supply of training may allow individuals to capitalize on comparative advantages and <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of investments. With data on earnings 13  years post-enrolment showing differences between long-term and short-term outcomes, our analyses underscore the need for long follow-up periods to appropriately assess such programs. We also find strong indications that individuals tend to act on their comparative advantages. Characteristics predicting enrolment in general or specific training tend to be associated with estimated relative treatment effects that favor the chosen type of training. Methodologically, robustness checks for ability bias and time-varying characteristics prior to the program confirm our main findings.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the potential market price for the transfer of water among sectors in the Northern Taiwan region. This region is the major semiconductor and information technology product manufacturing area in Taiwan and plays an important role in contributing to domestic GDP. To this end, a regional water endogenous price economic model using a nonlinear programming approach is adopted in which the activity of transferring water from the agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector in a water market is taken into consideration. In addition, the potential water transfer price is estimated using this empirical model under the assumption of social welfare maximization. The scenario results prove that the activity of transferring water from the agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector could <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> both in the water market and the agricultural sector...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} U-shaped {{relation}} between the relative weight of bank loans in total corporate debt and the firm's market-to-book ratio-a proxy for expected growth-which reconciles most existing theories. Using data on Japanese firms for 1983 - 97, we do find that, in the lower range of growth spectrum, firms with better prospects take more bonds in their debt mix: when the firm's prospects <b>improve,</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> from private debt initially fall relative to its costs. In contrast, in the higher range of growth, firms with more growth potentials take more monitored debt, reflecting, amongst other factors, the higher information and contracting costs of public debt faced by extreme growers. We can explain the seemingly conflicting evidence that Anderson and Makhija (1999) and Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein (1993) provide in this respect. We also find that keiretsu firms do not behave significantly different from non-keiretsu ones...|$|E
30|$|The {{theoretical}} {{argument for}} entry regulation through needs testing {{is based on}} increasing returns to scale, i.e. taxi dispatchers with allocated vehicles constitute a network with increasing returns to density. Arnott (1996), among others, has created a model for this argument [9]. Controlling the number of vehicles {{can also be used}} as an instrument by which “living wages” are assured in an industry where wages vary with demand. In economic terms, controlling supply is used to increase the attractiveness of the industry for operators and <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> from economies of scale and scope. On a policy level, entry restrictions are seen in the context of non-direct economic support for keeping prices (fares) below market levels and maintaining a 24 -h service, even when not economically viable. In effect, a monopoly rent is accepted as compensation for prices below market level and a 24 -h service, as these and the network effects dictate an undersupply of taxis, and overcharging in the free market solution.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{start by}} using various {{economic}} and pedagogical concepts {{to understand the}} specificities of MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) plat-forms.

Our conclusion is that the most sustainable approach {{is what we call}} the ‘subcontractor model’, flavored by touches of the other four models. We then claim that MOOC platforms can play a key transformative role in the higher education sector by making teach-ing practices evolve, rather than by replacing incumbent institutions. Finally, we derive a number of directions for public policy: governments should act to foster the cooperation between MOOC platforms and other higher education institutions, so as to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> that can arise from these technolog-ical innovations; a particular focus should also be given to professors in order to encourage them to innovate in their teaching practices...|$|E
