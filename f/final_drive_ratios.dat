25|$|All four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were built}} at the Muncie, Indiana Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model {{and part of the}} 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.|$|R

5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{had been}} used over their power and speed ratings until 2004. Delayed trains were [...] "force-fit" [...] into the timetable by overspeeding up to 10% over timetable speeds. This required both overspeeding the prime mover and modifying the traction motors' <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios.</b> This practice was banned after the Pamukova train derailment.|$|E

50|$|Spicer driveshafts drove two Timken double-reduction axles with an 11.66:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{front axle}} {{was an unusual}} triple {{reduction}} type which did not need universal joints on the outer ends and allowed a tighter turning radius. The two rear axles were a double reduction type. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> were 9.02:1 for gas powered trucks and 10.11:1 for diesels. All drivelines of both manufacturers were built by Mack.|$|E
50|$|The engine’s {{power is}} {{transferred}} via a sequential six-speed sport gearbox, which is operated pneumatically using shift paddles {{mounted on the}} steering wheel. The gearbox {{is one of the}} standard components, which are used by all the DTM manufacturers. It has 11 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios,</b> which allow the engineers and drivers to react to the respective circuit and engine characteristics when setting the car up.|$|E
50|$|The 4T60-E {{featured}} a 245mm torque converter with varying stall speed and gear ratios. For example, a '95 Beretta features a 1650 rpm stall converter {{as opposed to}} '99 Century converter with a stall of 2095 rpm. In the 4T60 family of transmissions, the combination of drive-chain sprocket ratios and the differential gear ratio together offer up to 12 different possible <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> to allow the transmission family to cover various engine and vehicle applications.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "MN5" [...] 4T45E is able {{to handle}} {{vehicles}} up to 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) GVWR. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.63, 3.29, 3.05, and 3.91. This same transmission {{is used in the}} Saturn Vue Green Line hybrid vehicle with the addition of an auxiliary oil pump and hybrid-aware electronics. It is designed for 3.0-3.5 L engines producing up to 205 ft·lbf (278 N·m) of torque, but was also commonly mated to some versions of GM's 4-cylinder Ecotec line.|$|E
50|$|On the {{mechanical}} side, the S4 25quattro {{was the second}} Audi, after the B7 RS4 to be fitted with the latest Torsen T-3 asymmetric ATB centre differential for its quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Under normal grip conditions, this is set with a default rearwards torque distribution bias of 40:60 front to rear, and a maximum of 100% torque can automatically be apportioned to the rear axle (and up to 80% to the front) as conditions warrant. The <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are 3.889.|$|E
50|$|A {{belt drive}} is still subject to stretch but {{operates}} very quietly, cleanly, and efficiently. A toothed belt is frequently used. However, {{they are not}} as durable when subjected to high horsepower as a chain. You can not alter the length and change <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> as easily as chains. They also can not wrap as closely around as chains. And require larger pulleys compared to chain sprockets to get an effective final drive ratio. Replacing a drive belt typically requires removal of the swingarm, since belts cannot be split the way a chain with a master link can.|$|E
50|$|All models use {{the same}} ZF {{six-speed}} automatic transmission, XJ6 petrol versions have a lower <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

50|$|The car {{employed}} {{rack and}} pinion steering. At the front it had disc brakes, with drum brakes controlled via a dual-line hydraulic system at the rear. Suspension was independent, employing MacPherson struts at the front and an unusual combination of full-width swing axles and half-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The front suspension was substantially modified after the car's initial presentation: production cars incorporated modified front suspension geometry, a lowered steering ratio and a steering damper, intended to reduce the unusually strong self-centring propensity which was {{a feature of the}} pre-production cars originally presented to journalists. The cars as sold also incorporated an updated gear-box and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> along with re-sized wheels.|$|E
50|$|The 4T65-E was {{introduced}} to replace the 4T60-E in 1997. The 4T65-E included a larger 258 mm torque converter for some models and many other changes to improve reliability. It is able to handle vehicles up to 6500 lb (2948 kg) GVWR with up to 280 ft·lbf (380 N·m) of torque. A number of <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are available, with many distinct models. Starting in mid year 2000 models, all 4T65-E models received an upgraded valve body. Starting in 2003 the internal electronics were changed, hardened 4th gear shaft, ratcheting sprags for input and third gear were added. The last application was the 2011 Chevrolet Impala as GM has transitioned to the 6T70 family transmissions for 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{designer}} was theoretically {{free to choose}} any ratio for the gearbox and final drive, there is one additional consideration which meant that the top gear of most gearboxes was 1:1 or [...] "direct drive". This is chosen for efficiency, as {{it does not require}} any gears to transmit power and so reduces the power lost by them. This was particularly important {{in the early days of}} cars, as their straight-cut gears were poorly finished, noisy and inefficient. The final drive then took this output and adjusted it in a fixed-ratio transmission arrangement that was much simpler to build. <b>Final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> of 4:1 were common, meaning that the wheels would turn at one fourth the rate they would if directly connected to the engine.|$|E

(April) The mass {{production of}} the Daewoo-FSO Polonez Kombi in passenger (<b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> 3,9) and van version (<b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> 4,3) with 1.6 engine (MPI). The new steering wheel (From Daewoo Nubira), arm-rests introduced. Start of sale planned for June 1999. (May) Official premiere of the Daewoo-FSO Polonez Kombi 1.6 GSi MPI on the Poznan Motor Show.|$|R
50|$|Variant of the AA80E {{used for}} the AWD Lexus LS460. Gear ratios are the same, but a shorter 3.133 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> is used.|$|R
50|$|The 4T60E {{transmission}} received revised gearing (3.29:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> vs. 3.06:1) {{to compensate}} for the lower torque of the smaller displacement Chevy V6.|$|R
5000|$|The 5L40-E was {{designated}} in either [...] "M82" [...] (rear-wheel drive) or [...] "MX5" [...] (all-wheel drive) versions for service in BMW vehicles from 2000 model year until the design was superseded by (for BMW) the 6L45E and (for all others) the 6L50E series electronic automatic transmissions in 2007 [...] It {{is designed for}} service in vehicles up to 4000 lb (1814 kg) GVWR and in service was mated to a selection of <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> 3.42:1, 3.73:1, or 3.91:1 depending on the carline. The 5L40-E had been designed for 1.8-3.6 L engines with a maximum of 250 ft·lbf (340 N·m) of torque. It was underrated when used in combination of M57D30 engines. As the M57D30 rated torque output of 390/410Nm.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} 32-valve {{cylinder}} heads, the V8 engine was essentially {{of the same}} design as that used in the 308 GTSi model. Total displacement was , with a bore and stroke of 81 mm x 71 mm. Output on European specification cars was [...] at 7000 rpm, and [...] at 6800 rpm for US specification variants. The gear and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> were altered to suit the revised characteristics of the four valves per cylinder engine. One other significant benefit of the QV four valve heads was {{the replacement of the}} non-QV models sodium valves which have been known to fail at the joint between the head and the stem. Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and Marelli Digiplex electronic ignition were carried over from the GTBi/GTSi. All US market examples were fitted with catalytic converters.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha YZF750 is a {{motorcycle}} that was produced from 1993 to 1998 in two forms, the standard R and the homologation model single seat SP. The 750R {{was the only}} version sold in the US.Mechanically the later SP differed from the R in the following areas: adjustable swingarm pivot position, 39 mm Keihin FCR flatslide carburetors, a lower screen, a removable rear subframe and a single seat. The primary drive, gear box and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are different on the SP. The rear suspension unit is different and vastly improved for the earlier SP however the R from 1996 also had the Ohlins rear shock. The SP was the homologation model of the Yamaha YZF750 for the World Superbike Championship before the rules changed to allow 1000cc bikes. The bike won the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race four times between 1987 and 1996.|$|E
50|$|Reha Drive, {{this also}} allows a 60% {{reduction}} in the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> (<b>ratio</b> 0.4). However, it is specifically designed for hand-cranked disability vehicles and requires less pressure for shifting.|$|R
50|$|Long chassis cars {{came with}} {{different}} transmission ratios whereby the 1:1 ratio matched fourth gear {{and there was}} no overdrive. The <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> was also raised for the longer cars.|$|R
50|$|The Getrag 282 used in Quad 4-equipped 1990 to 1991 Pontiac Grand Prixs and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes {{is rumored}} to use a 3.77/2.19 1st/2nd gear while {{retaining}} the 3.61:1 <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R
