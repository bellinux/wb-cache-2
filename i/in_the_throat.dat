5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  6, the {{correlation}} between the movable fluid saturation and the effective pore radius is small, and the correlation coefficient is 0.4627, suggesting unevenly developed, poor pores (Fig.  6 a). Comparably, the movable fluid saturation is more correlated with the weighted average effective <b>throat</b> radius with <b>the</b> correlation coefficient of 0.7835 (Fig.  6 b). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>throats</b> with radius less than 0.7  µm, movable fluid saturations are all below 50 %, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throats</b> coarser than 0.7  µm, the movable fluid saturation obviously increases with the weighted average effective throat radius (except for samples 10 and 11). Therefore, it is safe to conclude that <b>throat</b> is <b>the</b> key factor that affects the occurrence characteristics of movable fluids. Larger effective throat radius is favorable for fluids to flow and contributes to larger movable fluid saturation.|$|R

40|$|A pore {{network model}} (PNM) has been {{developed}} to simulate gas–liquid trickle flows inside fixed beds of spherical particles. The geometry has been previously built from X-ray micro-tomography experiments, and <b>the</b> flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throats</b> between pores is modeled as a pure viscous Poiseuille two-phase flow. The flow distribution between pores and throats is obtained by solving mass and momentum balance equations. As a first application of this simple but powerful meso-scale model, a focus is proposed {{on the ability of}} PNM to estimate pressure drop and liquid saturation in co-current gas–liquid flows. PNM results are compared to the classical 1 D pressure drop models of Attou et al. (1999), Holub et al. (1992) and Larachi et al. (1991). Agreement and discrepancies are discussed, and, finally, it has been found that the actual PNM approach produces realistic pressure drops as far as inertial contributions to friction are negligible. Concerning liquid saturation, the PNM only estimates its value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throats</b> between pores. As a consequence, liquid saturations are overestimated, but they can be easily corrected by an ad hoc empirical model...|$|R
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms residing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only {{at certain times}} and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E

5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of mechanical entrapment by nanoparticles {{occurs when the}} size of the particles is larger than the pore size or pore <b>throat</b> of <b>the</b> reservoir formation (Fig.  2). Log jamming by nanoparticles occurs due to the accumulation of nanoparticles at <b>the</b> pore <b>throat</b> larger than <b>the</b> size of the nanoparticles. The accumulation of the nanoparticles at <b>the</b> pore <b>throat</b> creates additional pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjacent pore <b>throat,</b> thereby forcing out trapped oil droplets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pores (Sun et al. 2017).

5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throat</b> or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>throat,</b> tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Throat</b> chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
