The DER, and TER (Target Emission rate) calculated through either the UK Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP rating), 2005 edition, or the newer SBEM (*Simplified Building <b>Energy</b> <b>Model)</b> which is aimed at non-dwellings, became the only acceptable calculation methods. Several commercial energy modeling software packages have now also been verified as producing acceptable evidence by the BRE Global & UK Government. Calculations using previous versions of SAP had been an optional way of demonstrating compliance since 1991(?). They are now a statutory requirement (B. Reg.17C et al.) for all building regulations applications, involving new dwelling/buildings and large extensions to existing non-domestic buildings.|$|E
500|$|In {{modeling}} {{protein structure}} as of CASP6, Robetta first searches for structural homologs using BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and 3D-Jury, then parses the target sequence into its individual domains, or independently folding units of proteins, by matching the sequence to structural {{families in the}} Pfam database. [...] Domains with structural homologs then follow a [...] "template-based model" [...] (i.e., homology modeling) protocol. [...] Here, the Baker laboratory's in-house alignment program, K*sync, produces a group of sequence homologs, and each of these is modeled by the Rosetta de novo method to produce a decoy (possible structure). [...] The final structure prediction is selected by taking the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> as determined by a low-resolution Rosetta energy function. [...] For domains that have no detected structural homologs, a de novo protocol is followed in which the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> from a set of generated decoys is selected as the final prediction. [...] These domain predictions are then connected together to investigate inter-domain, tertiary-level interactions within the protein. [...] Finally, side-chain contributions are modeled using a protocol for Monte Carlo conformational search.|$|E

40|$|Developing countries' {{energy use}} is rapidly increasing, which affects {{global climate change}} and global and {{regional}} <b>energy</b> settings. <b>Energy</b> <b>models</b> are helpful for exploring the future of developing and industrialised countries. However, energy systems of developing countries {{differ from those of}} industrialised countries, which has consequences for <b>energy</b> <b>modelling.</b> New requirements need to be met by present-day <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> to adequately explore the future of developing countries' energy systems. This paper aims to assess if the main characteristics of developing countries are adequately incorporated in present-day <b>energy</b> <b>models.</b> We first discuss these main characteristics, focusing particularly on developing Asia, and then present a model comparison of 12 selected <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> to test their suitability for developing countries. We conclude that many models are biased towards industrialised countries, neglecting main characteristics of developing countries, e. g. the informal economy, supply shortages, poor performance of the power sector, structural economic change, electrification, traditional bio-fuels, urban-rural divide. To more adequately address the energy systems of developing countries, <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> have to be adjusted and new models have to be built. We therefore indicate how to improve <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> for increasing their suitability for developing countries and give advice on modelling techniques and data requirements.

40|$|Baselines are {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} key input assumption in long-term <b>energy</b> <b>modelling,</b> but <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> have traditionally been poor on identifying baselines assumptions. Notably, transparency on the current policy content of model baselines is now especially critical as long-term climate mitigation policies have been underway {{for a number of}} years. This paper argues that the range of existing energy and emissions policies {{are an integral part of}} any long-term baseline, and hence already represent a "with-policy" baseline, termed here a Business-as-Unusual (BAuU). Crucially, existing energy policies are not a sunk effort; as impacts of existing policy initiatives are targeted at future years, they may be revised through iterative policy making, and their quantitative effectiveness requires ex-post verification. To assess the long-term role of existing policies in <b>energy</b> <b>modelling,</b> currently identified UK policies are explicitly stripped out of the UK MARKAL Elastic Demand (MED) optimisation <b>energy</b> system <b>model,</b> to generate a BAuU (with-policy) and a REF (without policy) baseline. In terms of long-term mitigation costs, policy-baseline assumptions are comparable to another key exogenous modelling assumption [...] that of global fossil fuel prices. Therefore, best practice in <b>energy</b> <b>modelling</b> would be to have both a no-policy reference baseline, and a current policy reference baseline (BAuU). At a minimum, <b>energy</b> <b>modelling</b> studies should have a transparent assessment of the current policy contained within the baseline. Clearly identifying and comparing policy-baseline assumptions are required for cost effective and objective policy making, otherwise <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> will underestimate the true cost of long-term emissions reductions.
