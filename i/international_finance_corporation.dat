The IFC {{is a member of}} the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. It was established in 1956, as the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, to advance economic development by investing in for-profit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development. The IFC's stated aim is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and achieve better living standards by mobilizing financial resources for private enterprise, promoting accessible and competitive markets, supporting businesses and other private-sector entities, and creating jobs and delivering necessary services to those who are poverty stricken or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sessional Paper Number 1 was {{published}} by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country's need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government opinion that the airline {{would be better off}} privately owned, thus resulting in the first privatisation attempt. The government named Philip Ndegwa as Chairman of the Board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the Public Enterprise Reform paper {{was published}}, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In , Brian Davies, was appointed as the new managing director of the company. Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on privatisation, working for British Airways' Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company to provide Kenya Airways with privatisation advice. In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Corporation</b> was appointed to provide assistance in the privatisation process, which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost million in debts and would convert another million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximate million. British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines expressing interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.|$|E

5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Corporation,</b> the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
5|$|The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were {{designed}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the World Bank, then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became operational in 1946. Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could {{play an important role}} in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms, rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests. In 1956 the <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Corporation</b> became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars) in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars) loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG). In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking. In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), Eurobank (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National Bank of Greece (20 million).|$|E
5|$|With {{a payroll}} of 6,632 at March 1990, the airline had {{a fleet of}} three Airbus A310-200s, three Boeing 707-320Cs, eight Boeing 737-200s and two DC-10-30s. A large {{domestic}} network serving the 19 Nigerian states was operated, as well as routes to East and West Africa; intercontinental flights from Lagos to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London, New York and Rome, from Kano to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London and Rome, and from Port Harcourt to London were also undertaken. The carrier suffered a major accident on 11 July 1991, when all 261 people on board a Douglas DC-8-61, registration C-GMXQ, crashed near Jeddah. In 1992, Nigeria Airways had three Boeing 707s impounded in Europe, {{and the number of}} flights experienced a 32% reduction following the termination of services to Conakry, Freetown and Robertsfield (Monrovia). Privatisation was first considered in 1993 with a proposal to split Nigeria Airways in two companies, one bearing the same name and operating domestic routes and a new one named Air Nigeria, which would undertake the international operations. In July 1994, an Airbus was impounded at London Heathrow Airport owing to a debt worth ₤100,000. On 21 December of the same year, a Boeing 707, registration 5N-ABK, crashed near Hadejia on a freighter flight from Jeddah, killing three of a crew of five. Further staff reductions continued throughout {{the first half of the}} 1990s, and at September 1995 the airline had 4,500 employees. In 1997 the UK Civil Aviation Authority banned the airline from operating into its territory citing safety concerns; in return, the Nigerian government barred British Airways from operating in the country. The service was restored in 1998 when the carrier began codesharing with British Airways, deploying a leased Boeng 747-200 that wore a Nigeria Airways livery and was operated on the Lagos–London Heathrow route with mixed English and Nigerian crews. By the late 1990s, the Nigerian government decided the carrier would be privatised by selling 40% and 20% to foreign and local investors, respectively, and keeping the rest of the shares. In 1999, the <b>International</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Corporation</b> (IFC) was commissioned by the Nigerian government to assist in the process of restructuring and privatisation of the airline. Among three options, one of them was to partner with a large European airline; Air France, British Airways, German-based Lufthansa, Swissair and the British carrier Virgin were all considered. Another alternative was to liquidate the carrier.|$|E
