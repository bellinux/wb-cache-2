40|$|Pressured by {{internal}} and external institutional stakeholders, {{institutions of higher education}} increasingly are challenged to demonstrate efficiency and productivity. One approach to illustrate productivity and efficiency is to examine how resources are allocated within the institution {{and the extent to which}} allocated resources meet institutional goals such as high first-year retention and 6 -year <b>graduation</b> <b>rates.</b> Focusing on private Baccalaureate Liberal and General colleges and universities, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between institutional expenditures related to instruction, academic support, student services, institutional support, and institutional grants (i. e. student financial aid) and retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates.</b> Framed by Berger 2 ̆ 7 s (2001 [...] 2002) view that organizational behavior can impact student departure, this inquiry had three goals: (a) to understand the relationship between institutional expenditures and retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates,</b> (b) to understand the relationship of institutional selectivity, institutional expenditures and retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> and (c) to investigate if these relationships have changed in the past ten years (1992 [...] 2002). The results confirmed Berger 2 ̆ 7 s theory: institutional expenditures accurately predicted retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates.</b> In examining specific institutional expenditures, the results indicated that expenditures dedicated to instruction, academic support and institutional grants positively contributed to retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> whereas expenditures dedicated to student services and institutional support negatively contributed to retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates.</b> There was a positive relationship between institutional selectivity and retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> illustrating that highly selective institution have higher retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> than less selective institutions. Institutional grants (i. e. student financial aid) positively contributed to retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> at low selectivity institutions but there was no significant relationship between institutional grants and retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> at highly selective institutions. Results of the longitudinal analysis demonstrated that the accuracy of institutional expenditures to predict retention and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> had been consistent over a 10 -year period.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to determine: What affects the <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> of Illinois public high schools? This {{question will be}} answered based on explanatory variables deemed important by previous research. The relationship between Illinois public high school <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the percentage of}} low income students in the high school, the percentage of parental involvement within the school, instructional expenditures per pupil, and the number of students enrolled in the school will be examined. The data was gathered from various sources including the Interactive Illinois Report Card and the Illinois State Board of Education.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} an increase in minimum admissions standards on college enrollment and <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> of student-athletes. In 1996, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) enacted Proposition 16, which increased admission standards for freshmen student-athletes at Division I schools, in an effort to improve <b>graduation</b> <b>rates.</b> Results indicate that Proposition 16 increased <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> significantly for Black student-athletes, and had no significant impact on <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> for White student-athletes. Results also indicate that <b>graduation</b> <b>rates</b> declined for Black student-athletes at Division II schools, which may have been driven by students transferring to Division I. As a result of the higher admission standards, Division I schools changed recruiting patterns and relied less on freshmen student-athletes, particularly Black student-athletes, to fill scholarships. Even though fewer Black freshmen student-athletes enrolled in Division I schools, the overall number of Black student-athletes did not change, suggesting that a greater proportion of transfer students into Division I schools were Black.
