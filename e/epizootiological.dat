25|$|In 1960’s, {{a number}} of F. magna {{outbreaks}} in cervids were reported {{in some areas of}} former Czechoslovakia. The prevalence of infection varied from 70 to 80% in red deer and maximum parasite burden was 144 worms. In addition, sudden deaths were documented in free or game ranging deer. The highest mortality was reported in free ranging roe deer in Písek County in the South Bohemia of former Czechoslovakia. In the same region, moreover, the parasite was found in livers of slaughtered cattle. Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971) confirmed red deer, fallow deer and roe deer as main definitive hosts of F. magna in Europe. In 1960’s, F. magna was enzootic in former Czechoslovakia in following four major areas: (1) České Budějovice and Třeboň county, including Nové Hrady Mountains; (2) the area along the Vltava River on the Vltava-Týn hills near Hluboká and Bechyně; (3) Písek and Milevsko county; (4) the Brdy mountains and the Hřebeny mountains. In following years, F. magna was only reported from these areas. Recently, geographical distribution of F. magna in cervids was determined in the Czech Republic. The giant liver fluke was confirmed in the same areas as reported in 1960’s. However, seven new endemic areas of F. magna were discovered suggesting that the parasite is spreading in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the appearance of F. magna in the Šumava Mountains has <b>epizootiological</b> importance due to possibility of spread of the parasite into the German territory (Bavaria). During the last few years, a new European enzootic area has established in the Danube watershed in Central Europe. In 1988, F. magna was isolated from a 3-year old red deer female found dead near the Gabčíkovo water plant at the Danube River in Slovakia. The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.|$|E

In the Czech territory, Ullrich reported the first appearance of F. magna in fallow deer as late as 1930. At the same time, Salomon (1932) diagnosed the fluke in one hunted red deer near Görlitz (Saxony) in Germany. Other isolated findings of the fluke were recorded in Italy and Poland. From 1948 till 1961, sporadic occurrence of the parasite in red deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were reported by several authors in former Czechoslovakia. However, all reports were published {{on the basis of}} incident discoveries in hunted deer and no massive infections were documented.In 1960’s, a number of F. magna outbreaks in cervids were reported in some areas of former Czechoslovakia.

The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.Soon after the Slovakian first report, F. magna was found in red deer in Hungarian parts of Danubian floodplain forests. The prevalence reported by the same authors was up to 90%. F. magna infection of cervids is a considerable problem in northern part of Hungary (Szigetköz) and the southern Danubian territory in the Gemenc area. Since the autumn of 2000, F. magna has been found in Austrian territory, east of Vienna. In years 2000-2001, the prevalence of the giant liver fluke in red deer in Austrian parts of Danube (east of Vienna) was 66.7%. [...] Appearance of American liver fluke was reported in Croatia in January 2000. The prevalence of fascioloidosis among red deer in Hungary was 21,1-60,7 % between 1998-2005. During the necropsy of 459 deer livers (using Egri's method) the number of flukes per host ranged from 1 to 138 in the same period. Regarding the origin of F. magna enzootic area in the Danube River watershed, it is essential to point out that cervids were not introduced into these localities, neither recently nor in the past. Origin of the F. magna population in Danubian floodplain forests in Central Europe remains therefore unclear.|$|E

40|$|Periodic {{outbreaks}} of epizooties of foot-and-mouth disease in {{countries of the}} Middle East and Africa pose a serious health threat to European states, in particular countries of the Mediterranean region and the Balkan peninsula.

Incidentally imported infections may be identified. Population studies with sensitive direct and serological methods indicate no infection in dutch residents. T. spiralis infections in pigs in the Netherlands can not be demonstrated by trichinoscopy. More sensitive methods introduced after 1961 demonstrated incidental low degree infection spread all over the country. The change in pig husbandry almost excludes the transmission of T. spiralis to pigs in the Netherlands. A permanent <b>epizootiological</b> surveillance of 0. 5 to 1 % of the total pig population in the Netherlands since 1979 and direct control measurements on selected farms indicate that no T. spiralis infection occur in the Dutch pig population.

It seems justified, based on the conclusions above mentioned, to certify that port from animals raised in the Netherlands is free from trichinella.

40|$|Giant American {{liver fluke}} Fascioloides magna is a {{parasite}} from the Trematoda class, {{which is of}} a great <b>epizootiological</b> importance for both deer and local ruminants. The parasite significantly influences the deer health status. Importantly, the deer also spread the parasite eggs in the environment infesting the local ruminants (cattle, sheep, goat) thus creating great economic losses. The fluke appeared in Europe {{for the first time in}} the nineteenth century when the invaded American deer was imported. Over the last decades, F. magna was detected in  many European countries, recently even in Croatia (Baranja region). Bosnia and Herzegovina is a natural habitat of the population of European deer (Cervus elaphus) along the border with Croatia, following the water course of the Sava river from Kozara to Semberija so that the seasonal migration of deer from Croatia and back have been observed.

To achieve diagnosis of this rickettsia in cattle and campeiro deer of Brazilian Pantanal, a comparison was made between a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with intercalating Sybr Green fluorochrome and primers based on msp 5 gene of A. marginale; a conventional PCR (C-PCR); and parasitological examination using thin blood smear stained with Giemsa-MayGrunwald. Both PCRs showed good performance in the diagnosis of A. marginale in cattle, and were superior to the parasitological exam. The RT-PCR detected seven positive campeiro deer (16. 3 %).

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a pathogenic fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) associated with declines of frogs in the American and Australian tropics, suggests that at least the proximate cause, may be known for many previously unexplained amphibian declines. We have monitored boreal toads in Colorado since 1991 at four sites using capture–recapture of adults and counts of egg masses to examine the dynamics of this metapopulation. Numbers of male toads declined in 1996 and 1999 with annual survival rate averaging 78 % from 1991 to 1994, 45 % in 1995 and 3 % between 1998 and 1999. Numbers of egg masses also declined. An etiological diagnosis of chytridiomycosis consistent with infections by the genus Batrachochytrium was made in six wild adult toads. Characteristic histomorphological features (i. e. intracellular location, shape of thalli, presence of discharge tubes and rhizoids) of chytrid organisms, and host tissue response (acanthosis and hyperkeratosis) were observed in individual toads.

The past two decades have seen the emergence of pathogenic {{infectious diseases}}, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and tick-borne diseases, which represent a substantial global threat to human health (1). Emergence is associated with...|$|E
40|$|In 2004, <b>epizootiological</b> {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on mass mortalities of tunicates Halocynthia roretzi in Goje, Korea. The clinical characteristics of infected H. roretzi were weakness of the tunic, loss of elasticity, and finally death involving a rupture of the tunic. Histological studies revealed severe hemocyte infiltration in the connective tissue surrounding the intestine and mantle of infected H. roretzi. Hypertrophied eosinophilic hemocytes containing several cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed in the connective tissue surrounding the intestine, gill and mantle. Ultrastructural examination revealed {{the presence of a}} parasite in the cytoplasm of hemocytes. Secondary cells were observed in the primary cell of the parasite. Spore formation within primary cells suggests that the parasite may be an intrahemocytic paramyxean parasite (IPP) and may cause mass mortality of H. roretzi. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|The p 44 gene of {{the agent}} of human granulocytic {{ehrlichiosis}} (aoHGE) encodes a 44 -kDa major outer surface protein. A technique was developed for the typing of the aoHGE based on the PCR amplification of the p 44 gene followed by a multiple restriction digest with HindIII, EcoRV, and AspI to generate {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} patterns. Twenty-four samples of the aoHGE were collected from geographically dispersed sites in the United States and included isolates from humans, equines, canines, small mammals, and ticks. Six granulocytic ehrlichiosis (GE) types were identified. The GE typing method is relatively simple to perform, is reproducible, and is able to differentiate among the various isolates of granulocytic ehrlichiae in the United States. These characteristics suggest that this GE typing method may be an important <b>epizootiological</b> and epidemiological tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanically}} transmitted haemoflagellate,Trypanosoma evansicauses 'surra', a wasting {{disease of}} domestic animals and is highly endemic in distribution in Southeast Asia. The detection ofT. evansiis important {{for improving the}} <b>epizootiological</b> and animal health status of the region. The specificity and sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers constructed fromT. evansirepetitive DNA sequences were studied in the present investigation. Using the assay, {{it was possible to}} amplify template DNA ofT. evansiderived from buffaloes, camels and horses to a threshold sensitivity level of 0. 5 pg and to detect DNA from as few as five organisms in 10 (l crude blood samples. Following experimental infection of calves with 5 × 105 T. evansi, positive signals could be observed as early as 12 h post-infection. DNAs from two common haemoflagellates of cattle,Babesia bigeminaandTheileria annulatawere not amplified with the primers. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{different aspects}} of canine brucellosis caused by Brucella canis. The disease is present in {{a large number of}} countries all over the world, where it inflicts severe economic damages, in particular in the commercial breeding and major dog breeding facilities. The disease was discovered in 1966 in the United States of America, but there were no data about its presence or distribution in our country until 1999. It was established, following the initial investigations, that the prevalence of the disease is extremely high, and that it amounted to 4. 27 % among pet dogs in the territory of Belgrade. Investigations of stray dogs in the territory of Podgorica showed that the seroprevalence (an equal titer or higher than 1 / 200) was 9. 37 %, while the prevalence among stray dogs in the territory of Belgrade was 10. 87 %. Data for other parts of Serbia are mostly lacking, and the seroprevalence for stray dogs in the Municipality of Pozarevac amounted to over 15 %, while not a single serologically positive case was found among pet dogs. In addition to the <b>epizootiological</b> specificities of the disease established in our country, isolates of B. canis from the territory of Serbia also indicate digressions in the test of resistance to colors with respect to the referent strain RM 6 / 66. All isolates (SR 1 -SR- 7) are resistant to base fuchsine, and it is probable that this characteristic could also be an important <b>epizootiological</b> marker. Even though the isolation of the cause is the most reliable diagnostic method, {{it is not possible to}} achieve this in most cases. That is why one of the most important tasks is to define the most ideal tests for the serological diagnostics of the disease, and the obligation of reporting the disease makes it imperative that wider-scale investigations are conducted and that measures are taken toward reducing the number of positive cases in our country. ...|$|E
40|$|Marteilia refringens {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} pathogens of bivalve molluscs. Previous sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of M. refringens isolates derived from the infected mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovinciallis) and the oyster (Ostrea edulis) in Europe did not reveal genetic polymorphisms despite indications from <b>epizootiological</b> data that distinct types may exist. We investigated the existence of polymorphisms in the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA genes. The sequences of this region proved to be clearly dimorphic among Marteilia from five sampling sites. The distribution of the two genetic types, named "O" and "M", appeared to be linked to the host species, oysters and mussels, respectively. We therefore support the recognition of two species of Marteilia in Europe and propose that the "O" type corresponds to M. refringens and the "M" type to M. maurini. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIVs) {{have been}} implicated in all human influenza pandemics in recent history. Despite this, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the mechanisms underlying the maintenance and spread of these viruses in their natural bird reservoirs. Surveillance has identified an AIV ‘hotspot’ in shorebirds at Delaware Bay, in which prevalence is estimated to exceed other monitored sites by an order of magnitude. To better understand the factors that create an AIV hotspot, we developed and parametrized a mechanistic transmission model to study the simultaneous <b>epizootiological</b> impacts of multi-species transmission, seasonal breeding, host migration and mixed transmission routes. We scrutinized our model to examine the potential for an AIV hotspot to serve as a ‘gateway’ for the spread of novel viruses into North America. Our findings identify the conditions under which a novel influenza virus, if introduced into the system, could successfully invade and proliferate...|$|E
