The purchaser was alerted {{to the existence of}} other Potter books on the <b>inside</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> and directed to a list of books on the back cover. Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.|$|E

Prior to July 1, 2013, Canadian passports were issued by Passport Canada, an independent operating agency of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada. They are normally valid for {{five or ten years}} for persons 16 years of age and older, and five years for children under 16. In 2015, 67 per cent of Canadians had passports, and 22.88 million Canadian travel documents were in circulation as of March 31, 2015.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular 22 pages of story, each issue included extra material. Because the opening credit page was a two-page splash across the <b>inside</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> and page one, an additional page needed to be inserted to make the story start on the recto side of the page. Brubaker's solution was to use page two as a cast list with short descriptions that updated as the story progressed, which he felt was [...] "old-fashioned and neat". Jess Nevins and Devin Faraci, among others, contributed essays and articles {{at the end of}} each issue about crime and misfortune among actors famous in the 1940s. The back cover of each issue included promotional images or reviews for the fictional movie being filmed in the comic. These typically foreshadowed future events or expanded on minor characters.|$|E
500|$|One offbeat {{feature of}} the {{magazine}} was the habit of including very short (less than a page) vignettes of fiction, usually but not always relating to the cover, without credit. These were most probably {{the work of the}} editor in many cases, though Frank Belknap Long wrote several of these for the <b>inside</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> of the magazine. There was never a letter column, though in the very last issue there was a note that one was planned for future issues. The book review column, always titled [...] "Universe in Books", appeared fairly regularly but was liable to be dropped if {{there was no room for}} it. It was originally signed [...] "The Editor", and was presumably written by Sam Merwin; Robert Frazier took the column on when Merwin left at the end of 1953. Santesson took over in October 1955 and wrote every column that appeared from that point on. After the first few issues, which contained editorial essays from both editor and publisher, the editorials disappeared, though Santesson did sometimes fill a blank space with a few editorial comments.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{with the}} April 1951 issue, a regular column on science fiction fandom began, titled [...] "Fandora's Box". It {{was written by}} Mari Wolf, an active fan, for five years, and {{was taken over by}} Robert Bloch from June 1956 through the end. The column had an {{excellent}} reputation, {{and was one of the}} few such columns in the professional magazines. Every issue carried an editorial, and a letter column appeared in every issue but the very last. A book review column began in June 1953, and appeared in every issue except the last one. It was initially by Mark Reinsberg, and was taken over by Henry Bott in May 1954 after two months in which both reviewers contributed to the column. A [...] "Cosmic Pen Club" [...] column, where fans could post requests for pen-pals, began in February 1957; as with the book reviews it appeared regularly, excepting only the last issue. Beginning in September 1951, the <b>inside</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> was often used for an [...] "Introducing the Author" [...] feature, with short pieces by and about a writer or artist who appeared in the issue. These included photographs of the authors in question, a feature not typically found in other magazines. Among the better-known authors featured were Heinlein, Evan Hunter and Philip K. Dick. [...] "Introducing the Author" [...] skipped four issues from October 1954 to January 1955, and ceased altogether with the April 1956 issue. One issue, May 1953, included pictures from that year's World Science Fiction in Chicago, rather than a feature about an author. The most frequently appearing cover artists were Harold W. McCauley, Lloyd Rognan, Malcolm Smith and William Terry.|$|E

2500|$|As in 1883 {{when the}} Scots invented Rugby Sevens, the tournament was {{to lead a}} trend.

2500|$|This series {{takes place}} in a roughly {{contemporary}} setting, usually understood to be in the near future with respect to the publication dates of the first two novels. [...] Since the series was written over the course of decades, {{it is not possible to}} establish an exact year in which each story takes place; historical events mentioned in the books (such as the dates of the Apollo space program and the name of the President of the United States) do not always correspond to the [...] "real world". [...] In recognition of this, and of the cosmic nature of the series, the <b>inside</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> of Many Waters states that the series is set in Kairos, a way of looking at time as [...] "real time, pure numbers with no measurement", reflecting her belief that [...] "God's time and our time are not the same".|$|E
2500|$|The {{school was}} founded in the 12th century around 1160 by a local magnate, Walkelin de Derby (also called Walkelin de Ferrieres, or de Ferrers) and his wife, Goda de Toeni, who gave their own house to an Augustinian priory called Darley Abbey {{to be used for}} the school. Local legend has it that it was the second oldest school in England. However, there is no firm {{information}} as {{to the site of the}} original school. Recorded in a book entitled [...] "Distinguished Alumni of Derby School" [...] by J.M.J. Fletcher and published in 1872 there is a drawing of [...] "St. Helen's House in Olden Times" [...] on the <b>inside</b> <b>front</b> <b>cover</b> which it is believed was the original house given to the Augustinian Monks.
