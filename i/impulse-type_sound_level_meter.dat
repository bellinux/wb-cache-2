30|$|To {{calibrate}} {{the sequence}} of sound signals and survey points with an absolute measure, we made frequent measurements of <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> using a digital <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> (BAFX, China), recording peak levels for (1) background sound; (2) environmental sonic events (e.g., thunder); (3) peak levels for windy gusts; and (4) peak levels during test signal recording. We used the IEC standard measuring method of frontal address, as shown in Long [37, p. 122] and repeated and recorded each test signal several times, averaging level readings for each sound source. For <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>metering,</b> we used the dBA scale, the acoustical reference scale most closely aligned with human auditory perception, as explained in Howard and Angus [38, p. 95 – 100]. Our <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> was less sensitive than the amplitude range of perceptible (and distinguishable) <b>sound</b> <b>levels,</b> as noted on audio recordings documenting researchers’ observations throughout. In the context of intermittent and increasing wind gusts during our survey, the 30  dB threshold of the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> did not permit the instrument to detect many of the quieter sounds we could hear, understand, and record; therefore, for a few survey events we have made relative estimations of levels calculated from audio recordings (as noted later in Table  1, shown in the “Findings and interpretation” section, where we discuss the relationship of background noise levels and signal audibility). The sonic frequency range of detection for the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> was between 31.5  Hz and 8  kHz, which is adequate to assess levels of the lower-frequency sounds produced by all sources, and to capture the perceptually most important higher frequencies. Full-range frequency data captured on the audio recordings provides the complete spectrum of source frequencies as transformed at each receiver location, important to post-survey analyses.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Cucumis melo {{includes}} {{a wide range}} of varieties. The acoustic is production, transmission and energy received form medium vibrations. Acoustic or sonic tests applies for grading productions, ripening determination of fruit firmness and sorting of broken eggs and so on in agriculture. Currently these methods are generalized for measuring non-spherical fruits properties. The primary objective of the present research was to investigate the effect of acoustic system variables such as impact places, impactor material type, pendulum angle and <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> position on acoustics response of two different melon varieties, including Zard-Eyvanekey and Sousky-Sabz. These results can be useful for designing acoustic implements related to agricultural products. Materials and Methods This research was conducted on 65 samples of Zard-Eyvanekey and Sousky-Sabz varieties (export varieties). A laboratory recording system used to acquire the acoustic impulse information that was comprised a mechanical excitement mechanism (an impactor such as pendulum), <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> a lap-top computer and software to control the experimental setup and to analyze its results (Cool Edit Pro 2. 0 Software), and melon-bed. The impactor consists of diameter and long copper rod 3 mm and 256 mm, respectively. The ball mass was 72. 13 gram. The acoustic signal was sensed by a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> (SLM) type 2270 B&K company Denmark. The samples locate on soft cushion for keeping because this bed prevents vibration distortion and causes free vibration. We consider three measurements on equator or mid-section of each fruit (approximately 120 degree) for diminishing inherent diversity of sample shapes. The <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> was placed at a distance of 2 - 5 mm from the fruit surface. The effects of <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> impactor ball and pendulum angle on sound signals were investigated. The effects of other parameters were analyzed by factorial test in randomized complete plot by three replications for each sample. The treatments were 36 and 65 melons of each variety were selected. Results and Discussion The average samples peaks were 10576 and 28663 at 90 and 180 degrees respect to impact place, respectively. Other factors such as impactor ball type (steel), impact angle (70 degrees) and variety type (Zard-Eyvanekey) were constant. The resonance frequency was 123. 05 Hz for both SLM position. The averages of peak <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> were 55. 29 and 52. 38 dB at 90 and 180 degrees positions, respectively. It concluded that the change of sound pressure meter (SLM) position of 90 to 180 degree caused to increase <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> but had no effect on reach the time to peak and resonance frequency. The effect of impactor ball material and impact angle of pendulum on recording signals approximately resemble up and did not state here. The factor <b>levels</b> were <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> position respect to impact place (two levels), impactor ball material (three levels) and impact angle of pendulum (three levels). We found that effect of <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> position; ball material and impact angle variables on <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> values and interaction effect of <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b>  impact angle on FFT magnitude was significant at 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUnattended noise {{measurements}} {{are more and}} more common for noise assessment in the environment. Multiple sources are usually measured with a random position with respect to the measurement point. Noise generated by ground transportation, leisure activities, construction sites is coming from all directions, although mainly the horizontal direction. Placed vertically and configured for a reference direction of 90 ° from its axis, the goal is to meet the requirements of the IEC 61672 standard on <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meters</b> taking into account noise incidence from the horizontal direction. The main technical difficulty is the criterion for the maximum level difference allowed between two random incidence angles (directivity). The objective can be fulfilled using a cone-shaped device on top of the microphone. When measuring attended noise with the instrument in hand, the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> must be pointed at the source according to standard IEC 60651.
