40|$|Debranning {{of wheat}} {{to remove the}} outer 7 % of the kernel, prior to {{grinding}} or milling reduced xylanase activity in wheat wholemeal and wheat <b>endosperm</b> <b>flour</b> by up to 80 and 60 %, respectively, whereas {{there was no significant}} reduction of xylanase inhibiting activity. Flours obtained after debranning and milling showed no major differences in moisture content, whereas ash content decreased and protein and arabinoxylan content decreased slightly with increasing debranning degree. Part of the xylanase activity in the flour was lost on addition of Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI). Since TAXI specifically inhibits glycosyl hydrolase family 11 xylanases and since endogenous cereal xylanases belong exclusively to family 10, part of the xylanase activity in the flour is most likely of microbial origin. Debranning also significantly reduced alpha-amylase activities in wheat wholemeal and wheat flour. Debranning prior to milling can, therefore, impact on flour functionality. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Total wheat <b>endosperm</b> (<b>flour)</b> protein extracts were prepared from mature wheat for two-dimensional electrophoresis, across both acidic (pH 4 - 7) and basic (pH 6 - 11) pH ranges. Three particular regions of the proteome maps were chosen for close comparison, involving two sets of gluten proteins and a nongluten protein region (involving small heat shock proteins), based on previous protein characterisation. Differences in the nongluten protein regions (heat shock proteins and other unidentified polypeptides) are of particular interest as being possible targets for use in developing new approaches to cultivar discrimination, such as the development of simple immunoassays. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Cereal grains can be {{considered}} as an agricultural raw material rich in several biopolymers. The major biopolymers are starch, protein, non-starch polysaccharides and lipids. Primary extraction of the biopolymers normally involves dry or wet milling, or a combination of the two. Conventional dry milling primarily separates the grain into its anatomical components, which are to some extent enriched in certain biopolymers, for example <b>endosperm</b> <b>flour</b> is approximately 80 % starch. Further enrichment of particular polymers can be achieved on the basis of density through air-classification. Wet milling, which also involves size separation by sieving and density separation by hydroclones and centrifugation, is particular effective at separating and purifying the individual biopolymers. Improvements in the efficiency of extraction of individual biopolymers may be achieved by several strategies. Co-products of food processing may be particularly rich in a certain biopolymer, for example hominy chop from maize dry milling is a valuable source of oil. Solvents that specifically extract specific biopolymers may be used, for example aqueous-alcohol to extract the prolamin proteins. Commercial hydrolytic enzymes, such as hemicellulases and amylases, can be used to purify crude protein extracts by removal of contaminating polysaccharides. Solvent recovery and reduction in energy costs are also crucial to the viability of extraction...|$|E

In order to investigate structure-nutrition relationships, an appropriate method for the complete functional and structural characterization of cell wall polysaccharides in various cereal <b>endosperm</b> <b>flours</b> is described. This involves the separation of soluble polymers and the residual cell wall fraction without using organic solvents, and the fractionation of soluble polymers into arabinoxylan- and (1 - 3, 1 - 4) -β-d-glucan-rich fractions for subsequent analysis.

From a nutritional functionality viewpoint, soluble and insoluble forms offer different potential health advantages, so {{it is important to}} define both the features controlling solubilisation and the properties of each of the soluble and insoluble fractions. Factors known to affect the stability of arabinoxylan (AX) and β-glucan (BG) solutions include AX branching extent and type, and the ratio of cellotriose to cellotetraose units (DP 3 /DP 4) in BG.

40|$|Arabinoxylans are {{one group}} of dietary fiber {{components}} in cereal grains, and specific health benefits have been linked with their molecular fine structures and hence with physicochemical properties such as solubility in aqueous media. To characterize the fiber quality for functional foods, starchy endosperm and bran fractions from 11 durum wheat lines were analyzed for total and water-soluble arabinoxylans, (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan, and bound ferulic acid. The arabinoxylan contents ranged from 11 to 16. 4 % (w/w) in bran and from 1. 5 to 1. 8 % in the starchy endosperm. Of the starchy endosperm arabinoxylans, 37 % was soluble in water. No correlation was found between arabinoxylan content and bound ferulic acid in bran, although a relatively high level of this antioxidant was found in endosperm (38. 3 μg/g <b>endosperm</b> <b>flour).</b> Enzymatic fingerprinting was performed to define the major fine structural features of arabinoxylans from both regions of the grain.

In the presence of NADPH, homogeneous thioredoxin h and partially purified wheat endosperm thioredoxin reductase (NADPH), (EC 1. 6. 4. 5), purothionin promoted the activation of chloroplast fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 11). Under these conditions, NADPH provided the reducing equivalents {{for a series of}} thiol reactions in which (a) thioredoxin reductase reduced thioredoxin h thereby converting it from disulfide (S-S) to sulfhydryl (SH) form; (b) the sulfhydryl form of thioredoxin h reduced the disulfide form of purothionin—a 5 kilodalton seed storage protein with 4 S-S bridges; and (c) the sulfhydryl form of purothionin reductively activated fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase. The results show that, since thioredoxin h does not react effectively with fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, the thioredoxin system can activate an enzyme through purothionin by secondary thiol redox control. In a related type reaction, purothionin, inhibited the activity of either Escherichia coli or calf thymus ribonucleotide reductase with reduced thioredoxin as hydrogen donor. The results suggest that purothionin competes with ribonucleotide reductase for reducing equivalents from thioredoxin. Thus, inhibition of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis should be considered a possible mechanism when examining the toxic effects of purothionin on mammalian cells in S-phase...|$|E
40|$|Rye bran of two {{different}} particle sizes (coarse: 440 mm and fine: 28 mm) were prepared by milling of commercial rye bran. Coarse and fine rye bran was added into a blend of rye <b>endosperm</b> <b>flour</b> and corn starch (70 : 30) to achieve two bran levels, 15 or 30 %, to produce directly puffed extrudates. A co-rotating twin screw extruder was used with a screw speed of 500 rpm, barrel temperature profile: 40 - 70 - 75 - 90 - 95 - 110 - 110 C and constant feed rate of 67 g/min. Feed moisture content of 17 % was used either as in barrel-water feed or as preconditioning. Fine bran addition effectively improved macrostructural properties as compared to coarse bran through increasing expansion by 3. 3 e 11. 7 % and piece density by 3. 8 e 10. 5 %. Reduction of bran particle size significantly (P < 0. 05) increased crispiness by 66. 7 e 203. 3 %. Particle size reduction of bran had only minor influences on cell wall thickness, cell area and hydrolysis index of the extrudates.

On average, 42 % and 36 % of WU-AX were recovered in bread WE-AX fraction, causing its 11 % and 8 % increase, respectively for endosperm and wholemeal breads.

40|$|Different {{methods are}} {{available}} for obtaining oat fractions with elevated soluble fibre content. Separation of flour particles based on their size and density gives fractions with maximum around 20 % of ?-glucan, whereas higher B-glucan contents can be obtained via various extraction processes. Any of these approaches yields vast amounts of endosperm-rich low B-glucan flour as a side product. The addition of extra value into this side fraction would have {{a huge impact on}} the feasibility of whole oat fractionation process. The composition of low ?-glucan oat flour provides no nutritional superiority over other cereal products. Instead, due to high lipid content it has some technological limitations such as a high tendency to stick in elevators, barrels and transporters. Also, when such flour is mixed in water, it will readily form large clumps, which make it difficult to form homogeneous mixtures. Due to these limitations, oat <b>endosperm</b> <b>flour</b> is typically used in low value products such as animal feed. The purpose of our work was to introduce new technological functionality into low B-glucan oat flour and simultaneously overcome negative aspects associated to this fraction. This was achieved by hydrothermal treatment yielding partially damaged starch (Kiiliäinen et al, 2004). Several desired changes were observed due to this treatment and the hydrothermally treated flour hydrates easily already at room temperature. Concurrently with the starch damage a relocalisation of oat lipids was also noticed, resulting in re-duced extractability of the lipids. These changes provide the basics for the use of hydrothermally treated oat flour in baking and ready made food applications where it can offer a cost effective replacement for other water binding agents such as pre-gelatinized starch products.

40|$|Oats are a {{good source}} of protein and dietary fibre, {{especially}} ?-glucan. Due to the health benefits of ?-glucan, oats have gained popularity in snack food formulations. The literature review deals with oats and its components, removal of lipids and fractionation of oat products. The particular emphasis of the literature review was given to studies on the effects of different oat fractions and extrusion process variables on the properties of oat-containing extrudates. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out how different oat fractions and extrusion process variables (screw speed, water content and feed rate) affect the physical and chemical properties of the extrudates. The measured physical properties were expansion, hardness and water content. Extrusion trials were carried out by using defatted oat <b>endosperm</b> <b>flour</b> (EF) as the main ingredient. Whole grain oat flour (WF) was used as a reference. To improve the nutritional quality, defatted oat protein concentrate (PC) and defatted oat bran concentrate (OBC) were added to EF. The oat fractions were defatted by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2). Pregelatinised corn starch (CS) and waxy corn starch (WS) were added in some trials to increase the expansion of the extrudates. A co-rotating twin-screw extruder was used for the extrusion. Different process variables were: water content of the mass (16, 18 and 20 %), screw speed (240, 370 and 500 rpm) and feed rate (68, 76 and 84 g/min). The temperature profile of the extruder barrel was held constant in all of the trials: 40, 70, 70, 100, 110, 130 and 130 °C (sections 1 6 and die). Screw speed had significant effect on the expansion and hardness. Expansion increased and hardness decreased with increasing screw speed. Water content of the mass affected all the response variables in WF extrudates and all but not hardness and torque in EF extrudates. Increased water content of mass decreased the expansion and hardness in WF extrudates. Feed rate did not have significant effect on the physical properties. When using EF, more expanded and less hard extrudates compared to the WF were obtained. Addition of PC or OBC (10 %) decreased the expansion and increased the hardness. Mixing of EF with corn starch (CS or WS; 30 %) gave less hard and more expanded extrudates compared to pure EF. The highest expansion was achieved by the addition of WS. Even addition of OBC (20 %) in a presence of WS (30 %) gave highly expanded and less hard extrudates with high ?-glucan content 7. 4 % (dry weight). Decreasing the particle size of OBC (by ultra-fine milling) or the molecular weight of ?-glucan (by enzymatic hydrolysis) did not affect the physical properties of the extrudates even though small decrease in hardness was observed in the trial with enzyme-hydrolysed OBC. The results showed that defatted oat fractions can successfully be used in extrusion when mixed with corn starch. Screw speed had the most profound effect on the physical properties of the oat-containing extrudates followed by the water content of mass...|$|E

For all flours and processes, the distributions of soluble/insoluble cell wall dietary fibre {{as well as}} the chemical composition (arabinoxylan (AX) branching patterns, β-glucan DP 3 /DP 4 (DP = degree of polymerisation) ratios) of solubilised fractions were characterised. The results show that overall the total amounts of AX and β-glucan (BG) were not significantly affected by processing but that there were similar increases in the soluble fibre fraction (20 - 29 %) for baked, extruded, and boiled/cooked processes for each flour, with lower (10 - 15 %) increases for all flours processed into dough. In all cases, solubilised fractions of AX and BG had very similar chemical structures to the starting flour, suggesting that increased solubilisation was not due to specific chemical fractions. Confocal images illustrate loosely-held associations of β-glucan with the cell walls of processed foods in contrast to some of the arabinoxylans which appear more tightly held within the residual cell walls. The similarities in behaviour across the three grains are consistent with mechanical treatments during food preparation resulting in similar extents of disentanglement of physically-constrained AX and BG leading to their partial solubilisation...|$|R

40|$|Acrylamide {{formation}} in cooked food {{has become a}} significant problem for the food industry. This study concerned the accumulation of free asparagine, one of the precursors for acrylamide formation, in wheat and rye grain. Asparagine concentration {{was found to be}} greatly affected by environmental conditions (E), genetic factors (G) and the interaction between the two (G x E). One of the environmental conditions controlling free asparagine accumulation in wheat grain was sulphur deficiency, which caused an increase of up to thirty-fold in free asparagine concentration. Sulphur deficiency and free asparagine concentration were linearly related to the amount of acrylamide that formed when wheat flour was heated at 180 °C. Asparagine concentration was also the main determinant of acrylamide {{formation in}} rye but, unlike in wheat, it was not affected by sulphur availability, at least under field conditions. Rye flour had lower acrylamide forming potential than wheat per unit of asparagine, possibly due to different concentrations of other free amino acids in the grain (proline). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for free asparagine concentration and therefore acrylamide risk were found on chromosomes 18, 2 A and 7 A. QTL were also identified for alanine, glutamine, glycine, lysine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan and tyrosine possibly aided by the environmental factors. A cluster of these QTL was located on chromosome 3 A in an area associated with the control of wheat yield. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI- TOF-MS) was used to show the distribution of asparagine in developing wheat grain fourteen days post anthesis. In grain from plants grown under normal conditions, most free asparagine was in the embryo and aleurone layer (bran fraction), while in grain from plants grown under sulphur deficient conditions there was great accumulation of free asparagine in the <b>endosperm</b> (white <b>flour</b> fraction). Reduction of acrylamide content could be achieved immediately by selection of low acrylamide risk varieties for cultivation and avoidance of sulphur deficiency in wheat. Further improvement could be made by breeding new, low asparagine varieties based on the QTL analyses. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{hydration}} capacity and hydration rate of wheat bran on optimal mixing time and water absorption of bread dough and bread loaf volume was investigated using coarse bran as such as well as after toasting, milling, presoaking and combinations of the latter. Comparison of untreated bran material with bran material that was either toasted to obtain a lower hydration rate than untreated bran, or presoaked to exclude hydration rate effects showed that a slower hydration rate led to increased mixing time but did not affect baking absorption nor maximum loaf volume. Also the use of milled bran, having a higher hydration rate compared to untreated bran, led to a decreased mixing time compared to when untreated bran was used. Again, water absorption and bread loaf volume remained unaffected. Results suggest that a high wheat bran hydration rate leads to faster immobilization of the water required for hydration of the bran rich dough system and hence enhances friction and energy input by the mixer in the developing dough. They further indicate that reduction of bran particle size also leads to faster dough development due to increased proper contacts between <b>flour</b> <b>endosperm</b> particles.

The starch digestibility increased as the particle size of flour decreased, but {{no significant difference}} in starch digestibility was observed among sorghum flours milled from grains with different hardness. To further understand the digestion of starch in sorghum, the effects of protein on starch digestion and amylose content in starch were determined. pH value was a factor affecting protein digestion since protein digestibility was higher at pH 2. 0 than that at pH 1. 3. Protein hydrolysis increased with time of pepsin treatment, leading to an increased starch digestion. RS content was 10. 61 - 29. 54 % in native sorghum flours and 8. 47 - 26. 28 % in isolated sorghum starch. The amounts of [Gamma]-kafirins extracted increased with time of pepsin treatment while [Alpha]- and [Beta]-kafirins decreased. The starch in sorghum flour with median hardness had a higher amylose content (23. 9 %) than the starch in hard and soft flours (~ 21 %), which gave lower starch digestibility. Protein digestibility decreased after cooking while starch digestibility increased. Sulfhydryl groups decreased after cooking, indicating that disulfide bonds formed between protein molecules and may have formed a barrier for enzymes to access and digest starch. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that the protein matrix was less evident after pepsin treatment. As a result, starch digestion increased after protein matrix was removed...|$|R

Analyses of 81, 920 near infrared spectra followed by partial least squares data treatment enables determination of purity with respect to endosperm versus nonendosperm content for each individual pixel in the image. Heterogeneity is revealed by the resulting image, and a mathematical weighted summation provides the composite composition for the field of view. The advantages of the solid-state technology employed in this method include the high sensitivity of individual indium antimonide detector elements and the programmed electronic wavelength switching of the liquid crystal tunable filter, which operates with no moving parts. The organic chemical content of endosperm (primarily starch and protein) is compared to nonendosperm components (cell walls, aleurone, pericarp, etc.) using the vibrational spectroscopic response of different molecules within the solid mixture. This objective quantitative chemical imaging method was applied to determine the endosperm purity profile of 29 flour streams from a commercial flour mill in which the break system is preceded by a debranning operation. A cumulative <b>flour</b> <b>endosperm</b> purity plot reveals distinct changes in purity as successively less pure streams are incorporated to increase the yield. The sensitivity and chemical structure basis of the endosperm purity method described should be useful in assessing the effects of new equipment installation or significant changes in operational settings on the efficiency of a commercial milling process...|$|R
40|$|In {{the cereal}} milling industry, wheat grains are {{fractionated}} at a histological scale for recovering the starchy <b>endosperm</b> into <b>flour</b> or semolina and collecting the peripheral tissues in bran fractions. The proportions of each {{tissue in the}} resulting fractions impact their nutritional quality or their end-use properties. The evaluation of tissue dissociation at the particle scale is {{required in order to}} understand, control and optimize the fractionation processes. If the identification of tissues in wheat grain is commonly performed, it remains challenging for powders. In powders, methods are mainly based on their specific biochemical composition or their specific spectral properties, in particular their autofluorescence. These methods were developed to give quantitative assessments of a bulk tissue composition in flour or bran fractions. None of these methods allowed the estimation of tissue dissociation at the particle scale even when an imaging system has been used. Recent equipments are available to acquire multispectral fluorescence images at the macroscopic scale using filters with specific excitation/emission wavelengths. These fluorescence macroscopes allow obtaining images of a representative number of particles together with a spatial resolution of less than 3 μm. In such images, the intensities measured for each pixel are not spectra, but are spectral profiles relevant to identify tissues (Baldwin et al., 1997). To identify the tissular origin from this information, we propose to develop a prediction model on particles using calibration data coming from the observation of tissue sections. This approach is based on several assumptions. The first one is that the multispectral autofluorescence of plant tissues is specific and the second is {{that it is possible to}} measure fluorescence intensities in a reproducible way. The objective of the present work was to check the fluorescence macroscope as an efficient device for measuring and comparing fluorescence intensities. Wheat was retained as a model plant for which two major tissues of the grain had specific autofluorescence properties: the aleurone layer with mainly a UV fluorescence response and pericarp that fluoresce using both UV and visible excitation wavelengths (Jensen et al., 1982; Symons et al., 1993). Moreover particles of pure tissue can be obtained after hand isolation or fractionation process (Hemery et al., 2007). The autofluorescence properties of tissues in sections and particles were compared in two mounting media (air and water) using a multispectral fluorescence macroscope. The variability of fluorescence profiles was studied by selecting pixels in cross-section or in particles mounted in air or in water. The statistical variations were studied by principal component analysis and variance analysis. The first effect, mainly described by principal component 1, was to differentiate the two tissues, aleurone layer and pericarp. The differences between each tissue came from UV and visible filters as expected. The second effect, mainly described by component 2, was a difference between the two mounting media. The differences between sections or powders were not correlated to the other factors and were considered as not significant. Our results show that profiles extracted from multispectral images of cross-sections or particles are similar and allow the identification of plant tissues. Hence tracking the tissues by predicting them on images of particles from profiles found in images of cross-section should be possible. The choice of the mounting media is flexible, multiples options are viable, but the adopted solution must be strictly applied to all the samples analyzed. If implemented, the prediction from cross-section could be less tedious than other methods requiring dissection and lead to the identification of more tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of staple foods in African countries {{is still a}} very time-consuming job. This is particularly the case in sub-Saharan countries where millet and sorghum form the basic diet and where most grain is processed by hand. As a result of expanding urban populations and higher demand for leavened bread and fast foods, wheat requirements have increased considerably in developing countries. In order to promote the use of local grains, the FAO established the Composite Flour Programme in 1964 and started implementation in 1970 by developing methods and products for commercial production in Senegal. Leavened bread made from wheat flour has been used in the Mediterranean for at least three thousand vears. This staple subsequently spread all over the world. The fascination for Western food encouraged the habit of bread consumption in most of the large cities in developing countries. Over the last few decades wheat flour and the American loaf of bread have become familiar products on markets of all continents. Those developing countries influenced by French culture, however, have shown more interest in the consumption of the French 'baguette'. In many developing countries bread is now part of the daily diet of most urban households. Breadmaking has been widely introduced in several African countries. In Kenya, for example, bread consumption has been increasing by 15 % per year since 1978. In some parts of Zaire notably around Kinshasa, bread has virtually replaced the traditional starchy staple 'shikwanga' derived from locally-grown cassava. The popularity of bread encouraged women in several countries to organize baking cooperatives. These efforts were not only in order to produce bread locally but also for making a little extra income. Many of these initiatives have come up against serious problems such as high costs of both transporting flour and fuel for firing the poorly designed ovens. It is true that bread has several advantages over traditional staple foods. It requires no further preparation once purchased and it can be kept for several days in a range of environmental conditions. Moreover, the nutritional value of bread is higher than that of other staple foods such as cassava, rice or potatoes. Nevertheless, bread remains a luxury as far as developing countries are concerned, given the fact that wheat imports and their subsidies are a major drain on local budgets. Wheat accounts for nearly three quarters of all grain imported by African countries. Almost all of Zaire's country's wheat is imported from the American mid-west. For climatic reasons, wheat suitable for breadmaking can be grown in very few countries in tropical areas. Wheat substitutes could be a solution to these problems but many difficulties are encountered in making bread with non-wheat materials. The secret of bread making The main problem is that non-wheat materials do not possess glutenforming protein which, through kneading, gives bread its unique texture and flavour. Only two cereals, wheat and rye, contain this extensible protein. For breadmaking, one requires a flour from a wheat of fairly high gluten content. When the dough is mixed, and subsequently fermented, the protein chains produce a lattice network which holds the carbon dioxide gas released during fermentation. During baking, the carbon dioxide is driven off leaving behind the open crumb texture of leavened bread Making bread by substituting part of the wheat, rather than all of it is not new. The {{preparation of}} such composite flours, however, generally demands a more complex processing. Non-wheat materials require dry extraction milling to remove fibre and fat. In times of scarcity, non-wheat materials were generally used to extend bread supplies. In ancient times, barley was frequently added and bread containing a large amount of barley flour was often the staple food of the poor. The use of flour from barley, potatoes, rye and maize occurred throughout the two World Wars. It {{is important to note that}} these additives were crops grown in temperate regions. It is known that tropical and subtropical cereals. tuber and root starches have often been added to wheat flour but, unfortunately, there are very few reports about these experiences. More recently, the use of composite flour has become fashionable in the West. This has perhaps helped in reconsidering breadmaking with blends of wheat and non-wheat materials of tropical origin. International efforts for local bread Gluten-free flour has long been used for the preparation of dietetic bread types, especially for patients suffering from coeliac diseases. Going even further, the Dutch Institute for Grain, Flour and Bread Research (TNO), in Wageningen, developed bread made entirely made from non-wheat material. The FAO Composite Flour Programme was designed to effect savings in foreign exchange by reducing wheat imports. Following this initiative, several programmes at the national level have been set up. At the Food Technology Institute (Institut de Technologie Alimentaire, ITA), Dakar, a project was established in 1970 to develop processing techniques for the commercialization of millet products. A similar experience started in Sudan in the late 1970 's, with special emphasis on the use of sorghum. The volume of a loaf of bread made with millet flour is generally smaller than that of genuine wheat flour loaf. At the end of the ITA project in Dakar, around 1974, millet bread was produced daily for sale and a commercial bakery was opened. An original method for making French type millet bread, using 30 % millet flour and 70 % wheat flour, was developed by experimental research on the use of millet flour. In 1979 Senegal made it obligatory to use 15 % millet flour and 85 % wheat flour in bread baked in Dakar and the Cape Verde region. By the end of 1982 two commercial mills in Dakar were equipped for millet milling with a capacity of approximately 100 tonnes per day. They produce millet/ wheat flour mixtures following the official requirements for breadmaking Based on the experience in Senegal, a project was launched at the Food Research Centre (FRC) in Khartoum, Sudan, including a sorghum milling and bakery pilot plant. It is interesting to note that another project has been started this year in Burkina Faso to mix wheat with 5 % of maize flour. Insofar as the FRC Sudan project is concerned, a survey showed that bread made with 30 % sorghum flour and 70 % wheat flour was evaluated as palatable to excellent. As with millet bread, the volume of a sorghum loaf remains small and the texture is drier and less elastic. However, it can be kept longer than bread made out of wheat alone. Neither the texture nor the flavour are much affected by the addition of sorghum flour. The capacity of the pilot bakery could reach a maximum of about 15, 000 loaves per 24 hours (3, 000 kg of flour per day). The distribution of the bread made with up to 25 % sorghum flour was limited to selected clients. Disadvantages of composite flour processing Bread made from composite flour containing low protein materials will require enrichment. Cottonseed flour, fish meal, groundnut and cowpeas are among the products that can be used as protein supplements. Such concentrates should be free from materials which might spoil the flavour, volume and texture of the bread. They should also be free from harmful substances such as gossypol in cottonseed and trypsin inhibitor in soya. Composite flours can also be used for other diverse food commodities. A large percentage of local grains (up to 50 %) can be used in the manufacturing of biscuits and noodles. Non-wheat flours have different milling characteristics. Sorghum and millet flours, for example, have a higher ash and fat content in fine fractions than in coarse fractions, contrary to wheat. The outer layers should be removed by decortication before grinding the <b>endosperm</b> to <b>flour.</b> In Senegal, millet is always decorticated before it is milled. Many consumers dislike the product made by mechanical decortication, so most of the millet in Senegal is decorticated and ground by hand. Specific studies on millet decortication show that dry milling techniques increase the yield by 10 - 20 % compared with traditional pounding; they lighten the workload and also improve flour quality. In Sudan, decorticating sorghum is less cumbersome and in towns most sorghum is ground in stone mills without decortication to produce 100 % extraction flours. A fluffy bread texture is difficult to obtain with local cereals. Many years of research have been devoted to this subject, e. g., by the TDRI (Tropical Development and Research Institute) in London, the IDRC (International Development Research Centre) in Canada, by several research institutes in France and by two Belgian universities, the Catholic University of Louvain and the University of Leuven. The latter developed a leavening agent, utilizing pentosan (a rye extract) that raises the dough. Nevertheless, the loaves are still quite different in form from wheat products and also have Inwer nutrient value. Not all sorghum varieties can be used with success in industrial processing. Many popular varieties generally used for traditional dishes are not suitable for mechanical processing due to their softness and the difficulties encountered in separating the bran. The softness of the grain is probably the most important criterion. The consumer prefers a white color and fine flour irrespective of the variety from which it is produced. For efficient production, quality control is essential in purchasing sorghum suitable for milling. White varieties are often mixed with small amounts of coloured kernels, which diminish considerably the quality of the flour. Today deliveries with an impurity rate exceeding 3 % are no longer accepted. New products Traditionally, millet and sorghum are primarily eaten with vegetables and a meat sauce in the form of millet couscous or porridge in several northern and western African countries; sorghum ugi in Kenya or kisra in Sudan. In Sudan, four sorghum mills with a capacity of 150 tonnes per day are producing commodities for traditional dishes. Sorghum flours are more appropriate for producing biscuits and other commodities where the volume is not of prime importance. Snack foods, such as chips, have been developed at the FRC and it was found that they have a good market potential. Research on foodstuffs sometimes lead to new products. Pearl aura is a new polished sorghum product developed at the FRC. It is an attractive ready-to-use cereal, similar to rice, and costs approximately one third as much as rice for the Sudanese consumer. Furthermore, it has a white colour and a good taste. The only disadvantages are the fact that pearl aura requires more water and a longer cooking time than rice. The nutritive value has been estimated to be about the same as rice. Marketing tests suggest that this product may have a promising future. Another example of the use of local varieties for commercial food manufacturing is a project on weaning foods in Benin. Baby food flours which are manufactured in Ouando are made out of locally grown maize, sorghum and soya. Only rice is imported for some products in this project. This semi-industrial manufacturing plant can even be operated manually. The marketing is organized by small traders and the products have been readily accepted by families. Efforts for the future After thirty years of research and development on breadmaking and the use of non-wheat flour compounds, it has become clear that these programmes have not led to concrete results. This is perhaps why projects are now more oriented towards commercial processing of traditional dishes which utilize local grain types. Food emergencies, particularly those involving large numbers of refugees, have become increasingly frequent in recent years. Doubts are still expressed about the impact of food aid, especially its possible detrimental effects on production in the recipient country, its failure to reach the most needy and its influence on food eating habits. The European consumption pattern has also been given too much attention. While focussing research mainly on technical constraints and problems, cultural and economic aspects have been overlooked. Pilot projects conceived to cover demands at national levels were often set-up on too large a scale requiring considerable amounts of local grain necessitating a steady production and reliable quality. Moreover, imported commodities are available at anytime and subsidies make their purchase less expensive. It is cheaper and easier to feed bread to a growing and influential urban population than to increase agricultural production in the countryside and improve transportation and distribution systems. It has to be acknowledged that most of the composite flour breadmaking projects in Africa did not succeed. A report on this subject published by the FAO in 1982 states that :None of these projects actually succeeded in applying large scale flour processing plants over the long term. Most of these research operations did not get beyond the laboratories or pilot installations. The main target of all these efforts was primarily the making of bread. More work is now needed on local dishes and the commercial processing and distribution of ready-to-use traditional food commodities. The first steps in this direction have already been taken in Togo with the support of the French CEEMAT (Study and Experimentation Centre for Agricultural Mechanization) on ready-to-use gari made from cassava. Marketing efforts have already proved successful. If 40 % of the population of sub-Saharan countries alone will be living in urban areas towards the year 2000, precooked traditional food may become very useful.
