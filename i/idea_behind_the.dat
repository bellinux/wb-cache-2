5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> {{shock therapy}} scene {{was based on}} Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|E
5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> episode {{came from}} the {{financial}} crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the producers wanted {{to set up a}} story about a bank collapse so severe it could result in an economic collapse. The episode was filmed in May 2008, with a lot taking place in London's Blue Fin building. About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! on ITV1. Critical reactions towards the episode were positive for including a change in plot.|$|E
5|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> main {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Hype Williams and was filmed in downtown Los Angeles.

5|$|In {{the last}} days of World War II Steinhaus, still in hiding, heard a rumor that University of Lwów was to be {{transferred}} to the city of Breslau (Wrocław), which Poland was to acquire {{as a result of the}} Potsdam agreement (Lwów became part of Soviet Ukraine). Although initially he had doubts, he turned down offers for faculty positions in Łódź and Lublin and made his way to the city where he began teaching at University of Wrocław. While there, he revived the <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Book from Lwów, where prominent and aspiring mathematicians would write down problems of interest along with prizes to be awarded for their solution, by starting the New Scottish Book. It was also most likely Steinhaus who preserved the original Scottish Book from Lwów throughout the war and subsequently sent it to Stanisław Ulam, who translated it into English.|$|E
5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In {{the case of the}} Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction. The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the emergence of new nations. The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny of others and to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1959, it was {{organized}} {{to consist of}} the 1st Battle Group, 65th Infantry, {{an element of the}} 92nd Infantry Brigade. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was formally transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, in an activity where Gen. Cesár Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodríguez. That same year, Company B of the 65th Regiment created Employer's Day (Día del Patrono in Spanish) where the employer's of the volunteers that serve in the PRNG are instructed about the job that their employees do with the entity and participate in training of their own. The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> initiative was facilitating the processing of the request of leave-of-absence to train for two weeks during the summer. On 1 May 1964, it was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 92nd. It was reorganized again on 1 April 1971, to consist of the 1st Battalion and the separate Company E. This was followed by another reorganization on 1 September 1978, to consist of the 1st and 2nd Battalions within the 92nd, as well as the separate Company E. Less than two years later another reorganization on 29 February 1980, eliminated the separate Company E while retaining the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E

25|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> {{pullback}} {{is essentially}} the notion of precomposition of one function with another. However, by combining this idea in several different contexts, quite elaborate pullback operations can be constructed. This article begins with the simplest operations, then uses them to construct more sophisticated ones. Roughly speaking, the pullback mechanism (using precomposition) turns several constructions in differential geometry into contravariant functors.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt to}} predict the bulk melting point of {{crystalline}} materials was first made in 1910 by Frederick Lindemann. The <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> theory was the observation that the average amplitude of thermal vibrations increases with increasing temperature. Melting initiates when the amplitude of vibration becomes large enough for adjacent atoms to partly occupy the same space. The Lindemann criterion states that melting is expected when the vibration root mean square amplitude exceeds a threshold value.|$|E
