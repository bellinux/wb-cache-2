25|$|Medal {{manufacturer}} Stange {{was authorized}} to begin producing Eagle Scout medals in 1968, {{at the same}} time as Robbins– they created six distinct models. The 1968 version is very similar to the Robbins version, but the bend in the scroll is much flatter, more like a sideways V as compared to the S on the Robbins scroll. The BSA was added back to the front, and the obverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1970. A major re-design of the eagle pendant was made in 1974 to match the new NESA logo. In 1978, Robbins ceased manufacturing Eagle Scout medals and Stange switched to the last design used by Robbins. Minor differences are in the white edged ribbon and the sterling silver markings. In 1980 the price of silver rose dramatically and the medal was changed to silver-plated, die-struck copper. Very early versions were silver-plated and oxidized, thus the scroll and pendant are black. Later versions were oxidized, buffed and lacquered to maintain the silver shine. Sterling silver medals were produced from the same dies and from this time were only available on special order. The year 1993 saw a number of changes. The clasp on the scroll was changed from the pin on type to a <b>double</b> <b>clutch</b> back. The pendant was changed to pewter and enlarged due to the lighter rigidity of the material.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>clutching</b> (also called <b>double</b> de-clutching) is {{a method}} of {{shifting}} gears used primarily for vehicles with an unsynchronized manual transmission, such as commercial trucks and specialty vehicles.

5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of transmission synchronizers (in the 1920s), <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> was a technique required to prevent damage to an automobile's gearing during shifts. Due to the difficulty and most often unnecessary redundancy involved in learning the technique, coupled {{with the advent of}} synchronized gearing systems, it has largely fallen into disuse. However, drivers of large trucks often use the <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> technique when unable to keep the transmission unloaded during shifting, as large vehicles are usually equipped with older, simpler and more durable unsynchronized gearboxes.|$|R
50|$|For an aural {{example of}} <b>double</b> <b>clutching,</b> the sound track to the iconic auto chase in the 1968 police movie Bullitt, where the police detective {{character}} played by Steve McQueen, driving the green Ford Mustang GT 390, chases the hit {{men in the}} Dodge Charger {{through the streets of}} San Francisco, has McQueen <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> on most shifts (which may not have actually happened that many times, but the chase footage as edited with added sound makes it appear so). Apart from acting, McQueen was an avid race car and motorcycle enthusiast.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> is {{a testing}} {{requirement}} when obtaining a commercial driver's license, most experienced truckers learn to shift gears without using the clutch. This {{is known as}} floating gears or float shifting, which thus eliminates the clutch except during starting and stopping. Skip shifting is when a gear is left out, usually on an upshift, for example shifting 2-4-6 while accelerating {{with the help of}} gravity down a hill. This technique saves unnecessary shifting work and saves fuel.|$|R

50|$|In {{a gearbox}} with neutral between gears, a typical shift {{actually}} involves two gear changes, once into neutral, and {{again into the}} next gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the engine and transmission of the force from the opposing components. Using the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is double (de)clutching. Due {{to the absence of}} a neutral spacing, <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> is ill-advised for sequential gear changes, as in a fully sequential gearbox such as a typical motorcycle.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the heel-toe-double-clutch is to {{downshift}} more than one gear to use engine braking in the intermediate gear. This provides maximum braking and optimal engine speed for exiting the corner while causing the least wear of the entire drive train. While this is not <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> in the conventional sense, the term is used to describe this technique since the clutch pedal is pressed more than once. Note that racers will sometimes skip gears during downshifts depending on the vehicle speed {{as there is no}} need to shift through every gear when significant speed has been lost.|$|R
50|$|Clutches usually {{consist of}} one single white egg, {{although}} <b>double</b> egg <b>clutches</b> have been recorded. This pigeon incubates its eggs for approximately 21-23 days. Young birds fledge at about 28 days from being hatched.|$|R

50|$|These {{transmissions}} {{were much}} {{lighter than the}} 16s transmissions and could also tolerate a greater range of engine power up to 440 hp thanks mostly to their <b>double</b> <b>clutch</b> pressure plate capability and robust gear design.|$|E
50|$|The Clio IV {{features}} {{new equipment}} such as hands-free, rear camera connectivity with more than 50 applications (Renault R-Link infotainment system, powered by Android & TomTom) and a six-speed <b>double</b> <b>clutch</b> automatic gearbox that will be available starting early 2013.|$|E
50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called <b>double</b> <b>clutching.</b> <b>Double</b> <b>clutching</b> is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|Small trucks use {{the same}} type of {{transmissions}} as almost all cars, having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh (synchronizers). Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as [...] "crash boxes", require double-clutching for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as [...] "floating", a method of changing gears which doesn't use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of <b>double</b> <b>clutching,</b> especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, {{in order}} to shift down, engine RPM must be {{increased}} while the gearbox is in neutral and the clutch is engaged. This requires the driver to slow the vehicle sufficiently, shift into neutral, apply throttle to bring the RPM up to a suitable speed, and finally shift into gear. This operation can {{be very difficult to}} master, as it requires the driver to gauge the speed of the vehicle and throttle to the intended gear accurately; vehicle weight and road gradient are important factors as they influence the vehicle's acceleration or deceleration during the shift. <b>Double</b> <b>clutching</b> is when the clutch pedal is depressed while shifting to neutral to match engine speed to the intended gear and vehicle speed, and again depressed for shifting into gear.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>double</b> <b>clutch</b> is a move {{associated}} with a layup or a dunk; it is a change of ball position in mid-air (similar to the [...] "up and under" [...] move, but performed while the player is in the air). It is effectively used by many players.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission {{options were}} a 7-speed <b>double</b> <b>clutch</b> {{transmission}} (DCT) with launch control (Same DCT transmission as the M3 but with different software programming) or a 6-speed manual transmission {{controlled by a}} short-throw [...] "M" [...] stick. The manual transmission has a heavy-duty clutch with more holding power than the regular 335i.|$|E

This is paired with an Active M-Differential with torque vectoring between the rear wheels. In North America, the F10M was available with a 6-speed manual transmission, the only market to be offered this option.|$|E
50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is <b>double</b> <b>clutching</b> required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|R
40|$|Waders (Charadrii) provide {{biologists}} with {{an astonishing}} variety of mating systems to study(1). Male and female birds establish breeding units in which behaviour varies from monogamy, polygyny, polyandry, <b>double</b> <b>clutching,</b> lekking and serial monogamy to sex role reversal, and many mixed mating systems exist(1). This diversity is currently {{explained by the}} costs and benefits of males and females either cooperating or defecting during breeding attempts(2, 3). The oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) is a typically monogamous species: removal experiments show that both parents are needed to raise chicks to fledgings(4 - 6). However, occasional polygyny has also been reported(7). Here we describe polygynous oystercatcher trios and the reproductive consequences of such polygyny. There is a 'classical' form of polygyny (two female territories within the male territory), but oystercatchers also show a remarkable variant, accompanied by female-female cooperation, female-female copulations and joint nesting...|$|R
50|$|The NL {{looked to}} be {{running out of time}} thanks to {{scoreless}} innings by AL pitchers Pat Hentgen of the Blue Jays and Wilson Álvarez of the White Sox. In the 9th the AL brought in veteran closer Lee Smith who had resurrected his dominant stuff one last time with the Orioles that season. He quickly walked Marquis Grissom to lead off. Then got Craig Biggio to hit a sharp grounder to third baseman Scott Cooper at third. However, Cooper <b>double</b> <b>clutched</b> ever so slightly and the AL just missed turning the double play on Biggio. This allowed Fregosi to pinch-hit slugger Fred McGriff, who he had saved up, to come to the plate as the tying run. The Crimedog promptly drove a Smith's splitter into the centerfield stands to tie up the game in dramatic fashion.|$|R
