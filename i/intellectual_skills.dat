40|$|The study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} type-of-practice strategies (massed or distributed) had an effect on learning a verbal information (reading) or <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> (math) task for second- and fourth-grade students. One hundred and ninety students from eight second- and fourth-grade classrooms participated in the study. Classrooms were randomly assigned to the two practice conditions and all students participated in a 9 - week integrated learning system (ILS) intervention. The present study found that <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> tasks are learned slightly more effectively in a massed than distributed practice mode, though the difference was not statistically significant. Students also learned verbal information tasks more effectively in the massed practice mode, though the difference was not statistically significant. The differences between the two practice conditions were not as great on verbal information tasks, however, and no statistically significant differences were found. Additional analyses, using the number of lesson units completed, showed that having completed a greater number of math lessons had a positive effect on the math test scores. These analyses suggest that a stronger treatment or better adherence to the treatment could have caused a statistically significant effect for massed practice in <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> domains. Replication is needed to provide a more solid foundation for this assertion. It was concluded from this study, due to the moderate effect size differences and the identical cost factor for incorporating the two types of practice, that the use of massed practice would be more prudent for <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> tasks. Massed practice is also more effective in the higher order verbal information area. Strong research inference suggests the continuance of distributed practice for 2 ̆ 2 lower level 2 ̆ 2 tasks, particularly in the verbal information areas. Further research is needed to discover factors that limit or negate the spacing effect...|$|R

The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it {{in the run-up to the}} invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills</b> required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little [...] "refresher" [...] work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost courier on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings.

For {{the solution of the}} above problems, the overall conception of this research was designed as follows. The <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> plays a more and more important role in elements of technical abilities of workers due to the evergreater progress in modern science and technology, the higher automatic degree in industry. If the <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> in training was emphasiged, the formation of technical ability in whole would be accelerated. For this purpore, the research adopted psycho-simulation method to realize the conception. 现代技工培训的心理模拟教学研究课题是根据我国工业领域新技术革命和传统产业革命对技工培训的新要求而提出的。通过对西方、苏联和我国技术培训心理学研究的沿革和现状的分析，研究者认为，我国技术培训研究存在的主要问题是忽视对技术能力的理论探讨，其具体表现为：宏观上对技术能力的结构、组成要素及其主从关系认识不明；微观上缺乏对技术能力形成规律的方法研究。为了探讨上述问题，本研究的整体构想是：随着现代科学技术的不断进步，工业领域的生产设备自动化程度日益提高，在劳动者的技术能力的各要素中，心智技能已愈来愈居主导地位。如果在技术培训中突出对心智技能的科学训练，将从整体上加速技术能力的形成。为此，本研究采用心理模拟教学的途径、手段和方法来实现这一构想。本研究是在生产设备自动化程度较高的北京手表厂进行的，含前期技工学校学员的培训研究共历时五年。本研究分为三个阶段、即三个子实验来进行： 1 ）设计培训目标的现场研究； 2 ）建立心理模型的实验研究； 3 ）技工岗位培训的实验研究...|$|R
