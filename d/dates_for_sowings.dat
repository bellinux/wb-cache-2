40|$|CERES-wheat and SWAGMAN Destiny models, respectively, {{were used}} to {{estimate}} the optimum time of sowing, and trade-off between yield and net recharge of the watertable, for wheat grown after rice in northern Bangladesh and southern NSW, Australia. Simulated wheat yields in Bangladesh, <b>for</b> <b>sowings</b> from Sept to Jan, with two supplemental irrigations, ranged from 0. 4 to 4. 6 t/ha. November-sown crops yielded more than the earlier- or later-sown crops due to reduced water and heat stress during grain filling. In Australia, simulated yields of non-irrigated wheat were always greater for April than June sowings due to less water deficit {{at the end of}} the season. With an initial shallow (0. 5 m), fresh (1 dS/m) watertable, simulated yields usually exceeded 3 t/ha, and declined as watertable salinity increased. Nonirrigated wheat almost always lowered the watertable. Frequent irrigation increased simulated yields to 5 - 6 t/ha, regardless of initial conditions and sowing date, but this was at the cost of decreased discharge or increased recharge leading to rising watertables...|$|R
40|$|Shifts in {{sowing date}} change the {{combination}} of temperature and photoperiod to which durum wheat is exposed, affecting crop phenology and grain yield. Three durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) varieties were field sown at month intervals over a whole year. The number of spikelets on the main culm and {{the duration of the}} period of spikelet initiation were recorded. Grain yield, spike number, and mean kernel weight were determined, too. With all sowing dates, plants formed a spike within the main culm and reached the stage of first node detectable. Physiological maturity was achieved only <b>for</b> <b>sowings</b> performed between October and May. Grain yield was highest in November and both yield and yield components were strongly affected by sowing date. The number of spikelets ranged from 11 to 24, according to sowing date and variety. It decreased from November to May in consequence of the shorter initiation period, and we hypothesize that a 12 -h-daylength or longer interrupts spikelet initiation. The decrease of spikelet number was the main determinant of yield reduction with the delay of sowing from November to March...|$|R
