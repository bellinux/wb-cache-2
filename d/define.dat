40|$|Abstract The main {{theme of}} {{this thesis is about}} Graph Coloring Applications and <b>Defining</b> Sets in Graph Theory. As in the case of block designs, finding <b>defining</b> sets seems to be {{difficult}} problem, and there is not a general conclusion. Hence we confine us here to some special types of graphs like bipartite graphs, complete graphs, etc. In this work, four new concepts of <b>defining</b> sets are introduced: •	<b>Defining</b> sets for perfect (maximum) matchings •	<b>Defining</b> sets for independent sets •	<b>Defining</b> sets for edge colorings •	<b>Defining</b> set for maximal (maximum) clique Furthermore, some algorithms to find and construct the <b>defining</b> sets are introduced. A review on some known kinds of <b>defining</b> sets in graph theory is also incorporated, in chapter 2 the basic definitions and some relevant notations used in this work are introduced. chapter 3 discusses the maximum and perfect matchings and a new concept for a <b>defining</b> set for perfect matching. Different kinds of graph colorings and their applications are the subject of chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with <b>defining</b> sets in graph coloring. New results are discussed along with already existing research results, an algorithm is introduced, which enables to determine a <b>defining</b> set of a graph coloring. In chapter 6, cliques are discussed. An algorithm for the determination of cliques using their <b>defining</b> sets. Several examples are included. ...|$|R
