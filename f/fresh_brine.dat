2500|$|Spanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most {{commonly}} {{applied to}} green olive preparation, around 60% {{of all the}} world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered [...] "treated" [...] when the lye has penetrated {{two-thirds of the way}} into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or [...] "Terroir" [...] of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in <b>fresh</b> <b>brine</b> and acid corrected, to be ready for market.|$|E

40|$|Background. Salted fish {{products}} are popular {{in many countries}} around the world. Salting {{is one of the}} oldest techniques for fish preservation, and is essentially intended to increase the shelf-life of the product depressing water activity by means of dehydration and salt uptake by the fish muscle. However, the current demand for salted fish is driven more by the flavour of the product than for preservation purposes. Vacuum-packaging represents a static form of hypobaric storage. It is widely used in the food industry because of its effectiveness in reducing oxidative reactions in the product at relatively low cost. Low temperature storage is one of the primary methods to maintain fish quality, based on the reduction in the rates of microbiological, chemical and biochemical changes. Material&nbsp; and methods. Fresh Golden mullets were rapidly beheaded, scaled, gutted and immediately washed with tap water then, samples were taken to the laboratory in ice box for chemical and microbial analysis of fresh fish, other samples were put in the brine (6 liter water and 2160 g salt was used for brine solution). After 14 days of brining, fish were taken out of brine solution and drained, then they were Vacuum Packed and labelled (each pack contained two fish about 1500 g weight). All the packs were stored in a refrigerator 4 &deg;C. Some quality aspects including Total Volatile Nitrogen (TVN), Peroxide Value (PV), Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA), Total Viable Count (TVC), Halophilic Bacteria (HB) and presence of Clostridium Botulinum were determined in <b>fresh</b> mullets, <b>fresh</b> <b>brined</b> mullets after 14 days of brining, and in (Vacuum Packed) VP samples stored at 4 &deg;C at intervals of 30, 60 and 90 days. Results. &nbsp; TVN increased from ten mg/ 100 g in <b>fresh</b> <b>brined</b> after 14 days to 30. 80 mg/ 100 g in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, PV increased after brining from 1. 50 meq/kg in <b>fresh</b> <b>brined</b> to 28. 90 meq/kg in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, TBA increased from 0. 07 mg MDA/kg in <b>fresh</b> <b>brined</b> to 0. 10 after 60 days and then, decreased to 0. 09 mg MDA/kg in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage and&nbsp; TVC decreased from 4. 70 log CFU/gr in <b>fresh</b> <b>brined</b> to 4. 40 log CFU/ gr after 30 days and then, increased to 5. 70 log CFU/gr in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, HB increased from 4. 55 log CFU/gr in <b>fresh</b> <b>brined</b> to 6. 30 log CFU/gr after 90 days of storage period at 4 &deg;C and exceeded the permissible level. Clostridium botulinum toxin was not detected in any of the samples throughout the storage. Conclusions. The results from this study clearly suggested that a combination of brining, vacuum packaging and storage at refrigerated temperature prolongs the shelf-life of Golden mullet to a great extent.

40|$|Postprocessing {{contamination}} of the products in a processing plant {{has been identified as}} one of the major reasons for food contamination with Listeria; brining is one such postprocessing area. Our previous study has shown that the combinations of UV and antimicrobials reduces the number of this organism significantly in <b>fresh</b> <b>brine,</b> but brine is usually recycled from days to weeks depending on its use. Therefore, this study is focused on the reduction of L. monocytogenes in recycled chill brine (obtained from a frankfurter processor) using the combinations of UV and antimicrobial agents, such as citric acid (CA), hydrogen peroxide (HP) and dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC). Results show that the combinations of UV and 2000 ppm and 4000 ppm HP were the most effective treatments in reducing the Listeria population with the total processing time of 120 min. Both of these treatments were found to be more effective than UV or HP alone. Additionally, all other treatments, such as the combinations of UV and CA (0. 2 and 0. 5 %) and UV and DMDC (250 and 500 ppm) were comparatively less effective.

The combinations of UV + 0. 5 % CA and UV + 500 -ppm DMDC were found to be the most effective, where L. monocytogenes was undetectable via enrichment at 45 and 60 min of treatment, respectively. CA (0. 5 %) when used in the absence of UV resulted in nondetection of L. monocytogenes. However, the reduction rate was higher when UV was used concurrent with CA.

40|$|Optimization of {{waterflooding}} sweep efficiency {{has been}} widely applied in reservoir engineering to improve hydrocarbon recovery while delaying water breakthrough and minimizing the bypassed oil in reservoirs. We develop a new framework to optimize flooding sweep efficiency in geologic formations with heterogeneous properties and demonstrate its application to waterflooding and geological CO 2 sequestration problems. The new method focuses on equalizing and delaying (under constant total injected volume) the breakthrough time of the injected fluid at production wells. For application to CO 2 sequestration where producers may not be present, we introduce the concept of pseudo production wells that have insignificant production rates (with negligible effect on the overall flow regime) for quantification of hypothetical breakthrough curves {{that can be used}} for optimization purpose. We apply the new method to waterflooding and CO 2 sequestration optimization using two heterogeneous reservoir models. We show that in water flooding experiments, the proposed method improves the sweep efficiency by delaying the field breakthrough and equalizing breakthrough times in all production wells. In this case, the optimization results in increased oil recovery and decreased water production. We apply a modified version of the proposed algorithm to geologic CO 2 sequestration problems to maximize the storage capacity of aquifers by enhancing the residual and dissolution trapping. The results from applying the proposed approach to optimization of geologic CO 2 storage problems illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in improving residual and solubility trapping by increasing the contact between available <b>fresh</b> <b>brine</b> and the injected CO 2 plume through a more uniform distribution of CO 2 in the aquifer...|$|E

30|$|For SW, {{the rate}} of {{adsorption}} of asphaltenes to the interface {{is much higher than}} NAs (Moradi et al. 2013; Verruto et al. 2009).

In this salinity, asphaltenes adsorb onto the interface and NAs dissociate gently into the bulk brine. Because of this mechanism, the pH and conductivity of brine decline at very low rate. Since the amount of polar components in crude oil drops, the IFT values of the aged oil–fresh brine show an ascending trend, while IFT values for cases of <b>fresh</b> oil–aged <b>brine</b> and aged oil–aged brine display a descending trend, due to the presence of the transferred NAs inside the aged brine,.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to develop a thin-film semiconductor thermoelectric heat pump of cylindrical shape for the desalination of sea water. Methods. To improve the efficiency of the desalination device, a  special thin-film semiconductor thermoelectric heat pump of  cylindrical shape is developed. The construction of the thin-film  semiconductor thermoelectric heat pump allows the flow rates of  incoming sea water and outflowing <b>fresh</b> water and <b>brine</b> to be  equalised by changing the geometric dimensions of the desalinator.   The cross-sectional area of the pipeline for incoming sea water is equal to the total area of outflowing <b>fresh</b> water and <b>brine.</b> Results. The use of thin-film semiconductor p- and n-type branches  in a thermo-module reduces their electrical resistance virtually to  zero and completely eliminates Joule's parasitic heat release. The  Peltier thermoelectric effect on heating and cooling is completely  preserved, bringing the efficiency of the heat pump to almost  100 %, improving the energy-saving characteristics of the  desalinator as a whole. To further increase the efficiency of the  proposed desalinator, thermoelectric modules with radiation can be  used as thermoelectric devices. Conclusion. As a consequence of the creation of conditions of high rarefaction under which water will be converted to steam, which, at  20 ° C, is cold (as is the condensed distilled water), energy costs can  be reduced. In this case, the energy for heating and cooling is not  wasted; moreover, sterilisation is also achieved using the ultraviolet  radiation used in the thermoelectric devices, which, on the one hand, generate electromagnetic ultraviolet radiation, and, on the other, cooling.

40|$|Carbon dioxide {{sequestration}} using brines {{has emerged}} as a promising technology to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change due to its large storage capacity and favourable chemistries. However, the permanent storage (mineral trapping) of CO 2 in brines takes significantly long periods of time as the formation of carbonates is very slow. The main parameters (brine pH, system temperature and pressure, brine composition) have been reported to have the major effect on mineral trapping of CO 2 sequestration in brines. It is suggested that the precipitation of mineral carbonates is mostly dependent on brine pH and is favoured above a basic pH of 9. 0. In order to promote the formation of carbonates, brine pH could be enhanced by using additives. Synthetic brines were used in this study instead of natural brines due to the difficulty in obtaining and storing <b>fresh</b> natural <b>brines.</b> Therefore, the suitability of using synthetic brines as analogues of natural brines for CO 2 sequestration studies was evaluated firstly.

This creates collision of fluid masses in the pipe, leading to a turbulent flow at high levels of density differences. We will study the flow and its effect in the mid section of the pipe. Since water is an incompressible fluid, because of the density difference, the mass of fluid that goes up is equal to the mass of the fluid going down. Thus at any instant of time, the net flow will be zero at any cross section of the pipe. Since the length to diameter ratio (L/d ratio) of the pipe is around 9 to 10, the flow will be axially homogeneous. Thus we have an axially homogenous flow with zero mean velocity and which is purely buoyancy driven. This is the basic flow for our experiments...|$|R

The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code FLUENT was used to simulate these experiments to evaluate the predictive capability of FLUENT for brine-water mixing in an SPR cavern. The data-model comparisons show that FLUENT simulations predict the mixing plume depth reasonably well. Predictions of the near-wall brine concentrations compare very well with the experimental data. The simulated time for the mixing plume to reach the vessel wall was underpredicted for the small injection tubes but reasonable for the large injection tubes. The difference in the time to reach the wall is {{probably due to the}} three-dimensional nature of the mixing plume as it spreads out at the air-brine or oil-brine interface. The depth of the mixing plume as it spreads out along the interface was within a factor of 2 of the experimental data. The FLUENT simulation results predict the plume mixing accurately, especially the water concentration when the mixing plume reaches the wall. This parameter value is the most significant feature of the mixing process because it will determine the amount of enhanced leaching at the oil-brine interface...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variations in geochemistry and isotopes of groundwaters at the Con Mine in Yellowknife, N. W. T., Canada, have provided insights {{to the impact of}} mining on the local hydrogeological environment. The study explores the use of mine hydrology in an analogous setting {{to assess the impact of}} a radioactive waste repository on groundwater flow, and surface to depth pathways in the Canadian Shield. The 50 years of mining activity at the Con mine fit the time frame envisaged for the construction and operation of a repository. Inflow at eighteen boreholes and three faults was periodically monitored from 1994 to 1996. Groundwater discharge in the mine is a mixture of <b>fresh</b> water to <b>brine,</b> with maximum TDS of 290 g/L, at depths of 701 m to 1, 615 m below surface. Three end-members are identified: (1) Shield brine typical of deep crystalline environments, (2) early Holocene precipitation and glacial melt water, and (3) recently recharged meteoric water. A body of glacial water emplaced at the time of deglaciation, has remained stable under the low hydraulic gradients in deep groundwater flow in the low-relief setting of the shield terrain, until disturbed by the steep surface to depth gradients imposed by mining activities.
