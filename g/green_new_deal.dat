The group put forward plans to invest in green energy, provide greater regulation of the finance sector, and strengthen ties between environmentalists, industry, agriculture, and trade unions. The proposals were put forth in response to fears over the recession, climate change, and increasing energy prices, and {{stressed the need for}} integrative policies towards tackling all three.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{developing}} countries {{have argued that}} a global <b>Green</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> may undermine national sovereignty regarding a country's control over its natural resources. Brazil, Mexico, and India have emphasized national sovereignty when discussing the <b>Green</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal,</b> with India also expressing fears of a green [...] "economic straitjacket". Bolivia, on its part, has argued that a <b>Green</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal</b> may signal the [...] "privatization and commodification of nature". China, while voicing some support for a <b>Green</b> <b>New</b> <b>Deal,</b> {{also pointed out that}} it may result in [...] "trade protectionism under the pretext of environmental protection".|$|E

30|$|Third, the <b>New</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> is {{beneficial}} for a smooth {{relationship between the}} government and the market. The function and role of the government and the market will be well defined in the <b>New</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Deal.</b> The Deal, the essence of which is innovation, clearly states the sound way of environment protection, resource consumption, and green development. The conventional concept of sustainable development is for the long term and cross-period. The proposed idea of the <b>New</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> is for a limited period, namely, its implementation could be within the control of government leaders during their terms. It is a very realistic idea and easily designed and operated.|$|R

50|$|On 1 May, the Government {{announced}} the <b>new</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Home Improvement Fund (GDHIF), a new energy efficiency incentive available to households in England and Wales for taking measures {{to improve the}} energy efficiency in their homes. The households will be eligible to claim up to £7,600 for improving their homes. The Incentive went live on 9 June 2014.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of searching for new {{opportunities}} and models {{for the development of}} the Bulgarian economy in the post-crisis period, it has become even more obvious that we need a fundamental change in the existing conceptual framework. The existing model of economic growth, based on conventional manufacturing has to be transformed into a new much more resource-conservation one. Promoting ‘green’ manufacture could be the right response to this new challenge. The economic incentives stimulating towards launching a <b>new</b> model of <b>green</b> <b>new</b> <b>deals</b> aim to promote the creation of <b>new</b> <b>green</b> jobs, to establish energy-efficient production and clean technology. All this requires timely, adequate and responsible government policy. The active intervention of public authority requires a new distribution of the functions and competences between the private and public sectors keeping in mind the lessons learnt from the mistakes and omissions made so far. By analogy, ‘ecological’ capital should be created and developed along with human capital. This capital along with the existing couple of financial capital – new information and communication technologies (NICT) are to become the driving force of a <b>new</b> type of <b>green</b> economic deal. The target of the efficient macroeconomic policy for stimulating the development of green economy should be the establishment of a model of long term eco-friendly production on all markets and at all levels through a set of fiscal and regulatory measures. This new model should aim to accomplish a social benefit in the long term rather than maximizing company profits in the short run. sustainable development, ecological capital, eco-innovations, green economy, eco-fiscal polic...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{development}} in China {{has been driven}} by reform in the past three decades since the Third Plenary Session of the 11 th Central Committee of the CPC. To transform the model of economic development, we must choose a high-quality and effective development direction to promote reform. There is no doubt that scientific development and the <b>New</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> would facilitate system innovation. But the task of comprehensive reform to the political and economic systems must be planned as soon as possible and launched when the time is ripe.|$|R

30|$|Nature has {{protected}} {{human beings}} since their {{appearance on the}} earth, giving us the basic conditions for life. In ancient China, philosophers proposed {{the thought of the}} integration of human beings and heaven and following nature. It stresses the harmony between nature and human beings as well as admiration of the laws of nature. Since industrialization, human beings have acquired a strong power to leverage nature and modernize the world. In turn, nature has also taken revenge on human beings for abusing this power. Humans have not been aware of the mistake we have made until a few years ago. Now, we start to show our kindness towards nature and would like to create harmony between two sides with the <b>New</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Deal.</b>|$|R
