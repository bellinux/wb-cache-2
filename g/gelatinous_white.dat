30|$|In case {{of metal}} {{phosphide}} poisoning, a forensic scientist generally carries out a phosphide/phosphine gas {{test for the}} detection and identification of phosphide in the viscera (Bhadkambekar et al. 2008). Silver nitrate test {{is used for the}} detection of phosphine after acid hydrolysis by sulfuric acid on metal phosphide. But this test will answer only for unutilized phosphides and not for absorbed phosphine. So there is no role in testing the blood for phosphine (Balali-Mood M. Phosphine. Simple Qualitative Test(s). Available at [URL] Accessed 6 Nov 2015). If this test is positive, the presence of zinc or aluminium in the viscera at high levels could provide the information about the specific metallic phosphides. But, the human body also contains trace amount of these elements, within certain ranges, which can be differentiated from their quantities. Hence, it is ideal to detect and quantify these metals along with phosphide determination to be able to frame a definitive opinion (Bhadkambekar et al. 2008). But in developing countries like India, because of high case load and procedural cost, quantitative analysis is not routinely performed. To detect the aluminium, we should add ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide to the sample solution which will form a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>white</b> precipitate, and will turn into red lakes on addition of alcoholic alizarin (Vogel 1979 a).|$|E

30|$|The nHA of {{controlled}} size and morphology [57] were prepared {{by using a}} method of chemical precipitation as reported in previous communication [34]. Briefly, 400  mL solution of (NH 4)H 2 PO 3 and 300  mL solution of Ca(NO 3) 24 H 2 O were prepared separately by dissolving 19.75  g of (NH 4)H 2 PO 3 and 57.5  g of Ca(NO 3) 24 H 2 O in 400 and 300  mL of deionized water, respectively. Before dropwisely mixing the solution of (NH 4)H 2 PO 3 with Ca(NO 3) 24 H 2 O, the pH of Ca(NO 3) 24 H 2 O solution was adjusted to 10.4 by adding an adequate amount of NH 4 OH. After dropwise addition of {{the total amount of}} (NH 4)H 2 PO 3, the solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for about 1  h for proper mixing of the reactants. On keeping the mixture, a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>white</b> precipitate was obtained, which ultimately seeded to nHA after ageing for 4  days. The prepared nHA were separated and washed gently with double-distilled water until pH  7. Before vacuum evaporation by drying process, the separated nHA were suspended in 1 -butanol to avoid clustering of nHA on drying. After vacuum evaporation, nHA were dried at 80  °C in vacuum oven to remove the traces of solvent and finally annealed at 700  °C for 4  h in hot air oven. To confirm the formation of nHA, FT-IR (FT-IR Spectrophotometer Mattason, Galaxy 7020 A) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (ESCA, ESCA LAB VIG Microtech, Mt 500 / 1, Etc. EAST Grinstead, UK) were recorded.|$|E
40|$|Kefir, a {{mixed culture}} that ferments lactose, {{is known for}} the {{production}} of a refreshing fermented beverage popular in EasternEuropean countries by inoculating milk with kefir grains. Kefir grains are <b>gelatinous</b> <b>white</b> or creamcoloured, water insoluble, irregular granules with diameter ranging 0, 33, 5 cm. They are composed mostly of proteins and polysaccharides in which the complex microbiota is enclosed. The beverage consists of a microbial diversity that includes lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and their metabolites. The aim of this work was to compare the fermentation and the microbiota of kefir, using milk and cheese whey as substrates. The grains were added in the proportion of 5 % in 250 ml of each substrate. Assays were performed at 25 °C for 48 h. The concentrations of lactose, ethanol, lactic acid and acetic acid were quantified by HPLC. To determinate the composition of microbiota in Kefir of fermentation, PCRDGGE analysis was used. The fermentation of milk and cheese whey by kefir grains are observed in this study. It can be observed that the lactose concentration {{at the end of the}} milk fermentation was lower in comparison with that obtained at 48 h for cheese whey fermentation. Despite the higher lactose consumption during the fermentation of milk by kefir grains, the concentrations of ethanol, acetic acid and lactic acid did not show significant differences with those obtained during the cheese whey fermentation. No changes in the DGGE profiles in all fermentations were observed to fungal and bacterial communities. It was thus concluded that lactose from cheese whey is converted to products with higher yields than lactose from milk, in addition to showing the same group of microorganisms for both fermentation process...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{processing}} {{is commonly}} carried out using hydrometallurgy or pyrometallurgy. These two techniques, whilst widespread, have inherent {{issues associated with}} selectivity and efficiency. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the use of ambient temperature ionic liquids (IL) to dissolve and recover metals from ionic media. The first stage of the study involved the development of a new stable reference electrode for use in IL media. This was used to obtain activity coefficients for three different silver salts in three different imidazolium-based ILs containing matching anions. Activity coefficients were also obtained for silver chloride, anhydrous copper (II) chloride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in the deep eutectic solvent (DES) Ethaline and it was found that these solutions displayed ideal behaviour, even at high concentrations. The electrochemistry of metal complexes in ionic liquids was studied using cyclic voltammetry in an ethylene glycol: choline chloride eutectic (Ethaline) and these potentials were plotted against the corresponding redox potentials in aqueous media to try to determine how speciation affected the reactivity of metals in solution. The speciation of a range of metal chlorides in a range of DESs was investigated and it was found that the majority of the metal ions tended towards chloride speciation, with a few exceptions for the more oxophilic early transition metals. The addition of a substantial amount of water in the form of hydration shells did not affect the metal speciation significantly. In IL media, the speciation tended towards the anionic component of the liquid, depending on its strength as a ligand. The fundamental redox behaviour and speciation data were used to develop a practical method to separate copper from gallium in waste semiconductor scrap. Lumps of the alloy were electrodissolved in Ethaline and this was followed by selective electrowinning of the copper as metal and precipitation of the gallium as a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>white</b> hydroxide. In addition, iodine could be used as a powerful oxidising agent in DES media to oxidise a small amount of gold and recover valuable paleontological microfossils...|$|E

50|$|The Dufour's gland of wasps in P. jacobsoni is {{relatively}} enlarged {{when compared to}} other social wasps and secretes a substance similar to the abdominal substance secreted by those wasps. However, in addition to its conserved uses, the abdominal substance from the Dufour’s gland {{can be used in a}} different context as an ant guard. In addition to its role in nest protection, the substance secreted via the Dufour’s gland is vital to brood rearing as well as oviposition and self-grooming. P. jacobsoni also produces richer secretions from its Dufour’s gland than various species that do not produce ant guards including L. flavolineata and P. mellyi. The contents of that gland, then, may have been naturally selected for their efficiency in defense and protection of the nest, via differential success of substances that do and do not produce ant guards.

50|$|The {{immature}} fruit {{bodies of}} Phallus species grow underground, are roughly spherical to ovoid, {{and have a}} soft or <b>gelatinous</b> surface. Conspicuous <b>white</b> rhizomorphs extend {{from the base of}} this structure and help to anchor it in the soil. The outer tissue layer, or peridium, is white to pale, smooth, firm-membranous. The slimy spore mass, or gleba, is attached to outer surface of the cap, and is colored dark olivaceous to blackish brown. The stalks of Phallus mushrooms are called receptacles: they are upright, cylindrical, hollow, spongy, and bearing roughly bell-shaped cap with irregularly branching ridges on the outer surface. Some species have an indusium, a net-like structure that extends from the cap to the ground. The gleba is slimy and pale greenish-yellow; in several species the gleba has a foul, carrion-like odor, which attracts insects that then help disperse the spores. Mosquitoes, however, that feed on the gleba are killed, suggesting the fungus may contain compounds that could be used as an attractant or biocontrol agent.|$|R
40|$|Nata de coco {{is known}} as a <b>gelatinous</b> substance, <b>white</b> to creamy-yellow, firm, glossy and not sticky, {{produced}} by some bacteria, which forms on the surface of coconut water medium during fermentation. Acetobacter xylinum (current name: Gluconacetobacter xylinus) is the common bacteria which synthesized nata de coco. Besides coconut water, there are some alternatives for making nata, such as cassava. Gluconacetobacter sp. was employed in this study to produce nata de coco from cassava hydrolysate medium (U) and compared it qualitatively and quantitatively to coconut water medium (K). In U medium, glucose was the main product derived from hydrolysis of cassava. Fermentation was conducted three times with each former fermentations became sources of inocula for the next fermentations, respectively. All data were analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Fermentation product of nata from U medium were relatively stable in thickness, wet weight, dry weight, yield, water content, and log from total bacteria (quantitative) and in colour, texture, transparency, and surface of nata (qualitative). Glucose was rapidly consumed by bacteria then other sugar (fructose and sucrose). Glucose consumption and nata yield was affected by the number of bacteria. However, nata yield was not significantly influenced by glucose consumption. Nata yield was possibly influenced by other factors such as nutrient content in U medium. Growth dynamics of Gluconacetobacter sp. was measured in log cfu mL- 1 on Hassid-Barker Agar (HBA) medium and relative number of 16 S rRNA genes. Bacterial growth during fermentation in U medium were relatively more stable than fermentation on K medium although the yield in K medium gradually increased and were higher than U medium...|$|R
