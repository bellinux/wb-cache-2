40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems of}} signal processing for image communication and restoration. Significant attention is devoted to developing novel stochastic models for images, investigating the information theoretic performance bounds for them, and designing efficient learning and inference methods for the proposed models. Unlike the commonly accepted approach in which the design of communication systems is performed by first compressing the data into binary representation and then channel coding it to recover from transmission errors, this thesis advocates the joint source-channel coding solution to the problem. The joint approach potentially leads to significant performance gains in emerging multiuser communication scenarios like <b>digital</b> audio and <b>video</b> <b>broadcast</b> (DAB and DVB) and multicast over wireless and wireline networks, multimedia communication in heterogeneous environments, and situations with uncertainty and fluctuations in the data source or channel parameters as is typic [...] ...|$|R

30|$|There {{has been}} a {{tremendous}} progress recently in the usage of <b>digital</b> images and <b>videos</b> for {{an increasing number of}} applications. Multimedia services that have gained wide interest include <b>digital</b> television <b>broadcasts,</b> <b>video</b> streaming applications, and real-time audio and video services over the Internet. The global mobile data traffic grew by 81 % in 2013, and during 2014, the number of mobile-connected devices will exceed the number of people on earth, according to predictions made by Cisco. The video portion of the mobile data traffic was 53 % in 2013 and is expected to exceed 67 % by 2018 [1]. With this huge increase in the exposure of image and video to the human eye, the interest in delivering quality of experience (QoE) may increase naturally. The quality of visual media can get degraded during capturing, compression, transmission, reproduction, and displaying due to the distortions that might occur at any of these stages.|$|R

50|$|The two {{principal}} digital broadcasting systems are ATSC standards, {{developed by the}} Advanced Television Systems Committee and adopted as a standard in most of North America, and DVB-T, the <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcast</b> - Terrestrial system used {{in most of the}} rest of the world. DVB-T was designed for format compatibility with existing direct broadcast satellite services in Europe (which use the DVB-S standard, and also sees some use in direct-to-home satellite dish providers in North America), and there is also a DVB-C version for cable television. While the ATSC standard also includes support for satellite and cable television systems, operators of those systems have chosen other technologies (principally DVB-S or proprietary systems for satellite and 256QAM replacing VSB for cable). Japan uses a third system, closely related to DVB-T, called ISDB-T, which is compatible with Brazil's SBTVD. The People's Republic of China has developed a fourth system, named DMB-T/H.|$|E
50|$|PDTV {{encompasses}} {{a broad array}} of capture methods and sources, but generally it involves the capture of SD or non-HD digital television broadcasts without any analog-to-digital conversion, instead relying on directly ripping MPEG streams. PDTV sources can be captured by a variety of digital TV tuner cards from a digital feed such as ClearQAM unencrypted cable, Digital Terrestrial Television, <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcast</b> or other satellite sources. Just as with Freeview (DVB-T) in the United Kingdom, broadcast television in the United States has no barriers to PDTV capture. Hardware such as the HDHomeRun when connected to an ATSC (Antenna) or unencrypted ClearQAM cable feed allows lossless digital capture of MPEG-2 streams (Pure Digital Television), without monthly fees or other restrictions normally implemented by a Set-top box. Although different from the analog hole, Pure Digital Television capture imposes no technological restriction on what is done with the stream; playback, Mash-Ups and even recompression/pirated distribution are possible without the permission of the rights holder.|$|E
50|$|HD Encodulators are a {{new class}} of device in <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcast</b> (DVB). Encodulators are devices that bundle a digital encoder and an RF agile {{modulator}} into one package. Encodulators accept uncompressed video as either HD or SD and encode the source to an MPEG transport stream. This transport stream can be based on either MPEG-2 or MPEG-4(H.264) broadcasting codecs. Once the video is encoded it is passed on to the modulator component of the device. The agile modulator overlays the MPEG transport stream onto a high frequency carrier wave for DTV broadcast. In the US this is typically in the 50 - 900 MHz range for terrestrial television, and 900 - 2600 MHz for satellite distribution. Standards used for terrestrial broadcast are 8-level Vestigial Sideband Modulation (8VSB) for over the air, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) for cable TV. A typical example of an encodulator are the units from Thor Broadcast. These units include both a high definition encoder and a frequency agile modulator for all major DVB modulation types. Many more manufacturers are moving to this sort of consolidated hardware platform. In the last year other manufacturers such as Comlan have released similar units. In the future we will see more and more broadcasting companies moving to consolidated equipment, both to save on rackspace and on cost.|$|E
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>video</b> {{data can}} be copied {{repeatedly}} without loss of quality. Therefore, copyright protection of video data is a more important issue in <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> delivery networks than it was with analog TV broadcast. One method of copyright protection is {{the addition of a}} "watermark" to the video signal which carries information about sender and receiver of the delivered video. Therefore, watermarking enables identification and tracing of different copies of video data. Applications are video distribution over the World Wide Web (WWW), pay-per-view <b>video</b> <b>broadcast,</b> or labeling of video discs and video tapes. In the mentioned applications, the video data is usually stored in compressed format. Thus, the watermark must be embedded in the compressed domain. We present a scheme for robust watermarking of MPEG- 2 encoded video. The scheme is of much lower complexity than a complete decoding process followed by watermarking in the pixel domain and re-encoding. Although an existing MPEG- 2 bitstre [...] ...|$|R
