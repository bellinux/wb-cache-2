50|$|The {{gene for}} SLPI is {{expressed}} by cells at many mucosal surfaces {{located in the}} tissues of the lungs, cervix, seminal vesicles, and parotid ducts. SLPI {{is also one of}} the <b>dominantly</b> <b>present</b> proteins in nasal epithelial lining fluid and other nasal secretions. Many diseases, such as emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are characterized by increased levels of neutrophil elastase. SLPI is one of the major defenses against the destruction of pulmonary tissues and epithelial tissues by neutrophil elastase. SLPI is considered to be the predominant elastase inhibitor in secretions, while α1-antitrypsin is the predominant elastase inhibitor in tissues. Several diseases, including those listed, are actually the result of SLPI and α1-antitrypsin defenses being overwhelmed by neutrophil elastase. It has been suggested that recombinant human SLPI be administered to treat symptoms of cystic fibrosis, genetic emphysema, and asthma. In addition, SLPI has occasionally been monitored in an effort to coordinate its levels with different pathological conditions. Increased levels of SLPI in nasal secretions and bronchoalveolar fluids may be denotive of inflammatory lung conditions or allergic reactions, and increased levels of SLPI in plasma may be indicative of pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|The {{area around}} Lovozero {{has the highest}} {{concentration}} of speakers. It is {{the largest of the}} Eastern Sami languages by number of speakers. Its future, however, appears to be not as bright as that of Skolt Sami or Inari Sami because the language is used actively by only very few people today. The Sami languages closest to Kildin are Ter Sami and Akkala Sami. The latter is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Kildin Sami. Originally, Kildin Saami was spoken in the mainland areas with the largest pockets of these people in clustered areas and in the coastal parts of the Kola Peninsula. Kildin Saami speakers can be found in rural and urban areas, with one of them being in the administrative center of the Murmansk area. Kildin Saami enclaves can be found throughout villages in Lovozero, Revda, Kola, Loparskaja, Teriberka, but can also be found in larger more sizable areas of Russia such as Olenegorsk and Apatity. Lovozero is known as the area where the Kildin Saami are <b>dominantly</b> <b>present</b> and where the language is still widely spoken amongst the small population: 700-800 ethnic Kildin Saami among a total village population of approximately 3,000. Today, the language has only about 100 active and perhaps 600 passive speakers. As a result of relocation, migration, and forced movement of the group, the community has really fragmented and become divided over other areas in Russia, thus leading to an inability for the revival and sustenance of their language, traditions, customs, and beliefs. From a strictly geographical point of view, only Kildin and Ter, spoken on the Peninsula, should be regarded as ‘Kola Saami.|$|E

This paper questions the traditional investment evaluation logics of power production (LCOE) in the interesting case of rooftop PVs and based on customer value generation logics presents a new approach for evaluating the profitability of rooftop PV investments. The approach recognizes the value that PVs produce to real estate owners and utilize basic real estate investment models to evaluate the profitability of PVs.

40|$|The {{ability of}} non-professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) to process and present antigen to {{the immune system}} {{has been the subject}} of debate in {{autoimmunity}} and tumour immunology. The role of muscle cells in the processing and presentation of antigen to T cells via class I and class II MHC pathways is of increasing interest. Muscle cells are the targets of autoimmune attack in the inflammatory muscle diseases, and direct intramuscular injection of antigen-expressing DNA constructs is under scrutiny as a means of vaccination. Furthermore, the immunological properties of muscle cells are of relevance in attempts to transfer myoblasts as replacement cells in dystrophic diseases or as depot cells for the secretion of certain molecules in deficiency states. Using class I and class II MHC transfectant clones of the C 2 C 12 myoblast cell line, myoblasts have been shown to be capable of presenting antigen to, and stimulating secretion of IL- 2 by, T cell hybridomas via both of these pathways. The epitopes which are <b>dominantly</b> <b>presented</b> by professional APC after processing of native antigens were also presented by the myoblast cell line after processing of either ovalbumin (class I) or hen egg lysozyme (class II). Further, antigen processing and presentation via the class II pathway were enhanced by pretreatment of the myoblasts with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Up-regulation of invariant chain expression by this treatment may have contributed to this enhanced presentation, but an effect of IFN-gamma on the expression of other molecules such as H- 2 DM may have also played a role. The demonstration of the antigen-presenting properties of these myoblasts is of relevance to all three areas mentioned above. In each situation myoblasts comprise a significant population within muscle. In the case of inflammatory muscle diseases the process of muscle degeneration and regeneration is on-going, while in the vaccination procedure some muscle damage occurs, and vaccination is more effective when muscle damage has preceded inoculation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{my project}} {{was to examine the}} extent to which {{endogenous}} expression of a largely renal-specific antigen influences the repertoire in adulthood of autoreactive T cells specific to that antigen. The renal-specific antigen, human α 3 (IV) NC 1, is the target of autoimmune attack in Goodpasture’s disease. This protein was expressed and purified in recombinant (using bacterial and mammalian cell expression systems) and purified in native (extracted from human tissue) forms. Transgenic mice were generated that express HLA-DR 15 (associated with Goodpasture’s disease) as their sole MHC class II molecule, and for which α 3 (IV) NC 1 can be endogenous or exogenous. The CD 4 T cell responses of these mice were then tested following immunisation with α 3 (IV) NC 1. In mice with endogenous expression of α 3 (IV) NC 1 there were no consistent detectable proliferative T cell responses to any α 3 (IV) NC 1 peptides in a set of overlapping peptides representative of the entire sequence. In the mice lacking endogenous α 3 (IV) NC 1 there were consistent responses to the peptide α 3 (IV) NC 1 136 - 150. This contains part of the peptide recognised by the most abundant autoreactive T cells in patients with acute Goodpasture’s disease. Therefore, the T cell responses seen in man to an endogenous (auto) antigen have similar fine specificity to those seen in mice responding to the same protein as a foreign antigen. This is surprising as one might expect self-tolerance in man to be most secure to such <b>dominantly</b> <b>presented</b> and immunogenic (in HLA DR 15 mice) self peptides. However, recent work suggests that the peptide most commonly presented in humans is normally destroyed during antigen processing, giving a possible explanation for the lack of tolerance. Future work should study why tolerance is ineffective to this particular peptide, whether tolerance can be reinforced, these questions could be addressed using a transgenic mouse model that develops Goodpasture-like pathology. In addition, how processing is defective in Goodpasture’s disease could be explored by making antigen presenting hybridomas from patient samples or from the transgenic mouse line described within this thesis.

40|$|The area of {{methanol}} synthesis {{and utilization}} has been attracting research interests {{due to its}} {{positive impact on the}} environment and also from energy perspectives. Methanol synthesis from CO 2 hydrogenation not only produces methanol which is a key platform chemical and a clean fuel, but can also recycle CO 2 {{which is one of the}} major greenhouse gases causing global warming. As a mobile energy carrier (particularly as a hydrogen carrier), methanol is a versatile molecule which is able to generate H 2 via its decomposition. Catalysis plays a decisive role in the success of both methanol synthesis from CO 2 hydrogenation and its reverse decomposition reaction. Pd/Ga 2 O 3 binary catalyst has recently been identified as an active catalyst for the methanol synthesis reaction. In this thesis, it is reported the shape effect of Pd promoted Ga 2 O 3 for this reaction. The catalytic H 2 evolution from methanol photodecomposition has also been studied over these catalysts. Three shapes of Ga 2 O 3 nanomaterials (i. e. rod and plate β-Ga 2 O 3, and particle γ-Ga 2 O 3) have been synthesized, followed by doping with Pd metal to form corresponding Pd/Ga 2 O 3 nanocatalysts. It was found that a (002) polar Ga 2 O 3 surface which was <b>dominantly</b> <b>presented</b> on the plate form was unstable, giving a higher degree of oxygen defects and mobile electrons in the conduction band than the other non-polar (111) and (110) surfaces of the rod form. It was shown that a significantly stronger metal support interaction was found between the (002) polar Ga 2 O 3 on the plate form and Pd, which gave higher methanol yield and selectivity. For methanol photodecomposition, it was found that, for pure Ga 2 O 3 catalysts of different shapes, the plate form with a highest degree of defects (unstable polar surface) could encourage a non-radiative catalytic recombination of electron and hole pairs upon irradiation, hence giving a highest photocatalytic activity for H 2 production. Once Pd was introduced onto these oxide surfaces, it was noted that there was a fast and readily electron transfer from the conduction band of Ga 2 O 3 to Pd due to the formation of a Schottky junction between the two materials. This produces metal sites for hydrogen production and further enhances the rate of the photocatalytic reaction over the radiative recombination of excitons. However, it was also found that at higher Pd content (> 1 %), the significantly shortened exciton lifetimes reduce the catalytic rate hence giving an overall volcanic response of activity to increasing Pd content for each shape of Ga 2 O 3. At the higher Pd content, the plate form appeared to sustain a longer lifetime for photocatalysis compared to the other forms at the equivalent Pd loading.

Dissolved and particulate trace metal con centrations, as well as fractions of dissolved trace metals, fraction ated based on their different chemical affinities to ion exchangers, were determined using ultra-clean techniques and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Large variations of dissolved (< 0. 45 mm) metal concentrations in the East China Sea shelf waters were found (n = 16) and ranged between 0. 036 - 0. 287 nM for Cd, 0. 87 - 8. 66 nM for Cu, and 2. 66 - 6. 04 nM for Ni. Particulate metal contributions were highest near the river mouth. Dis solved Cd and Ni were pre <b>dominantly</b> <b>present</b> (98 % for Cd and 86 % for Ni) as Chelex-labile fractions in the shelf waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the vibration modes of tooth and explain the vibration characteristics of tooth. By using the finite element method (FEM) software, the Eigen vibration of 3 -D finite element model of maxillary central incisor tooth was analyzed. Crown vibration was <b>dominantly</b> <b>present</b> in the natural modes. In general, tooth vibration was mostly dominated by the first 4 natural modes and the natural frequencies of the tooth studied were 879. 65, 1286. 76, 1827. 21 and 2087. 59 Hz, respectively. Corresponding natural mode shapes were as follows: 1 st, the whole tooth vibrates along its axis in crown to root direction; 2 nd, the crown swings mainly in labio-lingual direction; 3 rd, the crown twists about its axis; and 4 th the crown swings mainly in mesio-distal direction. The present data suggest that the modal analysis can be successfully applied in the field of study on the tooth under the loading of masticatory force...|$|E
40|$|Surface sediments {{collected}} from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and the Daya Bay (DYB) were analyzed for total metal concentrations and chemical phase partitioning. The total concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the PRE were obviously higher than those in DYB. The maximum concentrations of trace metals in DYB occurred in the four sub-basins, especially in Dapeng Cove, while the concentrations of these metals in {{the western side of}} the PRE were higher than those in the east side. Such distribution pattern was primarily due to the different hydraulic conditions and inputs of anthropogenic trace metals. The chemical partitioning of metals analyzed by the BCR sequential extraction method showed that Cr, Ni, and Zn of both areas were <b>present</b> <b>dominantly</b> in the residual fraction, while Pb was found mostly in the non-residual fractions. The partitioning of Cu showed {{a significant difference between the}} two areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{chemistry}} of euhedral magnesiohornblende phenocrysts from the Takahinatayama lava dome of Onikobe volcano in Miyagi Prefecture was studied by EPMA to document temperature-dependent cation substitutions. The {{relationships between the}} site populations of ^ A 1 ^ and other cations (based on a unit formvla of 23 oxygens) indicate that the following substitutions are active : Mg^ +sSi^ 〓Ti^ + 2 ^ Al^ (Ti-tschermakite) Mg^ +Si^ 〓Fe^ + Al^ (ferri-tschermakite) □+Si^ 〓Na_A+^ Al^ (edenite) Crystal chemical considerations of ^ Al indicate that iron is <b>present</b> <b>dominantly</b> as ferric iron in this amphibole rather than ferrous iron. Furthermore, the bimodal distribution of ^ Al in the single crystal specimen suggests that the chemical stibstitution of Al in the tetrahedral sites occurred in two stages. Possibly, in the later of the two stages, the introduction of Al in the tetrahedral sites was facilitated by {{a slight increase in}} the size of the tetrahedral sites due to thermal expansion of the amphibole lattice...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, the {{inadequacy}} of linear and mechanistic thinking (positivism/reductionism) in understanding both the source and the solutions of the many unwanted and undesirable biophysical and sociocultural impacts of modern agriculture, underlying that agriculture in its <b>present</b> (<b>dominantly</b> industrial) form is not sustainable, gives rise to multiple alternative proposals. The need to solve increasingly complex problems {{with a view to}} sustainability reinforces various ‘cross-disciplinary' forms of learning and problem solving, ‘integrating' perspectives and insights; cooperation by diverse academic experts and practitioners is called for. The current paper aims at addressing the dynamics of different forms of knowledge in the construction of knowledge, especially for sustainable (rural) development. In particular, the objective is to discuss the tentative contribution of Critical Realism (CR) in the understanding of the interfaces between different forms of knowledge (and their bearers/actors) in both theoretical and practical terms. CR with its realist, differentiated and stratified ontology claims, contra positivism, that science should aim at exploring the mechanisms which contribute to the generation of what is experienced. Therefore, it allows for new insights concerning ‘cross-disciplinary' research and development intervention. Thus, the implications of CR, especially on the problem of ‘transdisciplinarity' as well as on problems pertaining ‘participatory processes', are addressed...|$|R
