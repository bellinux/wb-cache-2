5|$|With the {{differentiation}} {{of legal and}} physical custody, {{it is possible for}} a court to make separate determinations of whether to grant <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody,</b> <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody,</b> or both.

50|$|Many states {{recognize}} {{two forms}} of joint custody: <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody,</b> and <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody.</b> In <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody,</b> both parents share the ability {{to have access to}} educational, health, and other records, and have equal decision-making status where the welfare of the child is concerned.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> and <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> are different aspects of custody, and determination is often made separately in many states' divorce courts.

5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} form of <b>joint</b> <b>custody</b> in which, {{rather than having}} the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the question: Does <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> increase child support payments? It describes differences in formal child support payments {{for those with}} and without <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> among divorce cases. It examines legal custody differences in the short-term after divorce {{as well as in}} the intermediate term, through the sixth year after divorce, to assess whether any economic benefits of <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> endure through a significant part of childhood. To the extent that legal custody differences in payments exist, we ask whether family and case characteristics, such as parents' incomes, number of children, and amount of child support orders account for these differences. Finally, the paper uses statistical methods that adjust for the fact that unmeasured characteristics may affect both the adoption of <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> as well as higher child support payments. Ignoring these unmeasured differences may overstate the benefits of <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> for child support payments. The paper aims to provide a less biased estimate of the effects of <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> on child support payments than is available from most previous studies...|$|R

5|$|After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it would interfere with their <b>joint</b> <b>custody</b> arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E

One benefit of <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> is that the burden of sole custody is not placed on the parent as the time involved in raising the children is divided among the two parties involved, allowing each of the parties more time to spend on their careers, for instance. A second benefit of <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> is that the children will still have a [...] "significant period" [...] of time {{with each of the}} parents, which closely resembles the relationship before the divorce, legal separation, or break-up. A third benefit of <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> is that it helps ensure that the children will grow up with both a male and a female role model, which may not be ensured through sole physical custody, for instance.|$|R

500|$|When parents {{divorce and}} the {{children}} are in the picture, many problems will arise during the difficult process of determining custody. [...] For instance, {{if there is an}} argument regarding <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody,</b> the process to earn legal custody will take longer than anticipated and will ultimately impact the relationship of the parents {{and the children}}. [...] It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds, which, in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody. [...] Another criticism of having a <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> arrangement {{is that it is a}} frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child's life (regardless of what the decree of <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> states), which generally leads to conflict. Additionally, in a <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> arrangement, if the parents of the children do not get along, this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made about their children, which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved, but also for the parents.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{getting a}} divorce, a judge will decide {{the next few}} steps for any {{children}} involved when dealing with <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody.</b> Itâ€™s typical, with two parents, for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights. <b>Joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> can be awarded to either both of the parents or just one of the parents, depending on the situation and the judgments. <b>Joint</b> legal <b>custody</b> involves having the parents make difficult decisions for their children. The parents decide how to raise their children in matters of schooling, spirituality, social events, sports religion, medical concerns, and other commonplace decisions. In <b>joint</b> legal <b>custody,</b> both parents share the ability to have access to their children's records, such as educational records, health records, and other records.

500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} criticisms to <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody.</b> A {{criticism of the}} <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> arrangement is that {{due to the nature}} of the arrangement, the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations, leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved, including the children.

There are numerous opinions that the constant moving back and forth between two homes will have a negative impact on children emotionally.

40|$|My thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{educational}} environment of minor children after their parentsÂ´ divorce. I focused on <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody,</b> which means that each of the parents shall have significant periods of physical custody, i. e. more or less continuing contact with children. Legal institution of <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> was introduced to the legal practice in the Czech Republic in 1998, when the amendment of the Family Act was adopted. Unfortunately, <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> is not often used in practice and experts do not even share the same opinion of this phenomenon. If <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> is chosen as educational environment for minors, big claims are posed both on parents and their children. The objective of my work was to find out, how <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> works in concrete families with minors at the age of 6 to 15, and whether parents and children are satisfied with this family arrangement. Partial objectives were to find out what are the most frequently used periods of physical custody { [...] } how many days the minor lives with one parent before he/she leaves to live with the other one; whether such family arrangement influences minorsÂ´ school attendance and quality of communication within the family. A qualitative research, the polling method and the technique of a half-standardized interview have been applied. In the framework of the research, interviews with parents and their children in five families with <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> were carried out. The results showed, that the arrangement of <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> has been working in these families for several years and that the polled family members are mostly satisfied. Most frequently used period of living with one of the parents is a one week period, and Friday is usually the day of moving from one parent to the other. If parents are able to cooperate and communicate well with each other, there is not even a problem with school attendance. All members of the families agreed that they are able to communicate well with each other. The results of my thesis might be used by counselling services that are provided for divorcing couples and all the facts and information about experience with <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> might help to those parents who consider such family arrangement...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{practice}} of <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody,</b> where children spend equal time in each parentâ€™s home after they separate, is increasing in many countries. It is particularly common in Sweden, where this custody arrangement applies to 30 per cent {{of children with}} separated parents. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine childrenâ€™s health-related quality of life after parental separation, by comparing children living with both parents in nuclear families to those living in <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> and other forms of domestic arrangements. Methods Data from a national Swedish classroom study of 164, 580 children aged 12 and 15 -years-old were analysed by two-level linear regression modelling. Z-scores were used to equalise scales for ten dimensions of wellbeing from the KIDSCREEN- 52 and the KIDSCREEN- 10 Index and analysed for children in <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> in comparison with children living in nuclear families and mostly or only with one parent. Results Living in a nuclear family was positively associated with almost all aspects of wellbeing in comparison to children with separated parents. Children in <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> experienced more positive outcomes, in terms of subjective wellbeing, family life and peer relations, than children living mostly or only with one parent. For the 12 -year-olds, beta coefficients for moods and emotions ranged from âˆ’ 0. 20 to âˆ’ 0. 33 and peer relations from âˆ’ 0. 11 to âˆ’ 0. 20 for children in <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> and living mostly or only with one parent. The corresponding estimates for the 15 -year-olds varied from âˆ’ 0. 08 to âˆ’ 0. 28 and from âˆ’ 0. 03 to âˆ’ 0. 13 on these subscales. The 15 -year-olds in <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody</b> were more likely than the 12 -year-olds to report similar wellbeing levels on most outcomes to the children in nuclear families. Conclusions Children who spent equal time living with both parents after a separation reported better wellbeing than children in predominantly single parent care. This was particularly true for the 15 -year-olds, while the reported wellbeing of 12 -years-olds was less satisfactory. There is a need for further studies that can account for the pre and post separation context of individual families and the wellbeing of younger age groups in <b>joint</b> physical <b>custody.</b> Funding Agencies|Lansforsakringsbolagens Forskningsfond||</p...|$|R
