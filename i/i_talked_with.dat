5|$|<b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> {{one soldier}} who lay {{shivering}} in a bunk {{in the hospital}} coach. He had no visible sign of injury but his face was a ghastly green shade. He wanted more blankets and a cigarette, and I gave him both. An hour later, I helped move his body to the other coach.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
25|$|The LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, after {{conducting}} {{an investigation into}} Johnson's death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote on Johnson's death certificate: <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica {{two or three weeks}} before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of {{the leading}} staff members of the Serbsky Center, {{strongly}} degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill. In his opinion, [...] "now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people." [...] In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, [...] "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know... Who? Bukovsky? <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so." [...] In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it [...] "has never been used for political persecution." [...] Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, [...] "are not very mentally healthy." ...|$|E

All our units were always {{under the command}} of the Krajina [...] or [...] Republika Srpska Army or the JNA. Of course I don't believe he signed anything, these were verbal orders. None of our talks was taped and I never took a paper and pencil when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> him. His key people were the commanders. Nothing could happen on the Serbian side without Milošević's order or his knowledge." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{situation}} grows tense. There {{are no more}} sea-birds, and the mutineers are starving. Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> Bert Rhine. To-day <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> him again, and he {{will never}} forget, I am certain, the little talk we had this morning.|$|E
