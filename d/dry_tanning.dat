50|$|The Badhik are {{strictly}} endogamous community, and practice {{the principle of}} clan exogamy. They are Hindu and observe all the major Hindu festivals but do not have exclusive family or clan deities. The Badhik are a landless community, providing {{the bulk of the}} agricultural labourers in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Traditionally, the community were hunters and gatherers, but now they are mainly butchers. Their subsidiary income is animal husbandry, poultry and <b>drying</b> and <b>tanning</b> of skins. A small number are also employed as agricultural labourers. As a Dalit community, they often suffer from societal discrimination. Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat. The panchayat acts as instrument of social control, dealing with issues such as divorce and adultery.|$|R
50|$|The Goravan Reservation is {{situated}} on the predominantly North-West facing dry piedemonts of the Urtz mountain ridge. Due {{to the lack of}} management historically boundaries of the reservation were not well defined and some discrepancies about the position of the reservation have been documented (Tadevosyan, 2001-2006). One may imagine a landscape of the reservation as a half of a broken plate partly buried in the sand. From the North and the West sandy habitats clearly limited by the village of Goravan with its cemetery, fields, fruit and vegetable plantations. On the South and East Sandy paths create a complex mosaic with <b>dry</b> <b>tan</b> limestone ridges,and the boundary of the reservation in these directions is not defined. The original governmental decision of 1959, and a number of publications cited that document state that the Goravan State Nature Reservation covers 200 ha of sandy desert adjacent to the Goravan village at 900-950 m above sea level. However, the most recent field surveys and analysis of LandSat satellite images demonstrate existence of more than 10 patches of sandy semi-desert with total area of only 175 hectares and situated between 894 and 1060 m above sea level (Tadevosyan, 2005, 2006a,b) (see map at https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=h&msa=0&sid=113927865166192486699.00044c8e9798dde5a38d1&ll=39.913818,44.718819&spn=0.056616,0.110378&z=13). Trials to obtain an original map showing boundaries of the reservation failed. Therefore, it is still unknown whether this discrepancy a result of a different delineation of the boundaries of the reservation in 1959, an approximation or uncertain measurements used in the governmental decision of 1959, historical changes in land use, or from the one or more factors acting together. Conservation of sandy habitats has been formulated a primary goal of the reservation in 1959. However field work done in 1998-2005 show that surrounding rocklands have their own conservation value, which somewhat exceeds that of sandy habitats. Rocky slopes support a number of critical wildlife species which are absent form the sandy habitats, or disappeared from sandy habitats but preserved in rocklands. Either way there is a need in re-determination of the boundaries of the reservation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{seeds are}} rarely eaten fresh by Somali children, more {{often they are}} first dried in the shade during 7-10 days and then the hard seed coat is removed. For storage, the seeds have to be roasted or boiled to prevent fungal attack, to kill insects eggs and larvae inside the seeds and to harden the seed coat. [...] After {{roasting}} in the hot ash, which leads to yield losses due to damage of the seeds, the seeds are coated in weed ash and stored in sacks {{in the house for}} personal use or for trade at local markets at a later time. The seeds treated this way are storable for about one year. Pastoralists keep the seeds in containers out of <b>dried</b> and <b>tanned</b> camel leather, where they can be stored for many years. The firewood for roasting is often taken from the shrub, which hampers the regeneration of the population in addition to the complete removal of all the seeds.|$|R

Necklaces of lion and tiger-teeth, bits of <b>dried</b> meat, finely <b>tanned</b> hides and earthen pots, beautifully decorated, they thrust upon us until we were loaded down, {{and all the while}} Al-tan glared balefully upon us, seemingly jealous of the attentions heaped upon us because we had served Chal-az.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the functions of chipped and ground stone tools from the coast of Karaga Bay in Northeastern Kamchatka, Russia. The specimens analyzed include 27 stone tools restored after the excavations at the Karaga 6 (11 th to 13 th centuries) {{as well as the}} Karaga 10 and 13 (15 th to 17 th centuries) sites in 2012. The high-power approach of the lithic use-wear analysis was applied. Because of microscopic observations, six specimens displayed distinct use-wear polish. Polish morphology indicated that two utilized flakes and a retouched flake were used for hide working, while a side scraper exhibited a use-wear polish that was mainly generated by plant working. Two end scrapers also showed traces of plant working,whereas evidence of <b>dry</b> hide <b>tanning</b> was found on one specimen. The findings show that utilized or retouched flakes, not end scrapers, were the main tools for hide working from the 11 th to 17 th centuries C. E. in Northeastern Kamchatka. This result is extremely suggestive for the explanation concerning the diffusion process of the Paleo-Asiatic type scrapers that have been used by the indigenous peoples in Kamchatka. Finally, ethnographic implications regarding the long-term history of stone scrapers are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} told of a time in China, a long time ago, when men were liable to be conscripted into {{military}} service, and sent to serve far away and often not return home for years, if ever. A girl's father was forced into the army and sent off, far away. Missing her father very much, she then promised the family horse that she would marry him, if he went and found her father, and brought him back home. Surprisingly enough, the horse ran off, and eventually returned with the father, who, horrified {{at the idea of}} his daughter marrying a horse, killed it. The skin was then hung up in the courtyard to <b>dry</b> for <b>tanning.</b> However, one day, when the daughter was out playing, the wind blew, the horsehide flew, wrapped around the daughter, and off they disappeared. After days of searching for his daughter in the horsehide, eventually her father found that she had been transformed into a silkworm in a mulberry tree. This was the origin, it was told, of the Horse-Head Lady, goddess, and patroness of sericulture (Yang, 164).|$|R

5000|$|Criollo: It {{is located}} in america and can only be grown in your back yard no in the foothiilsand {{in the foothills of}} the Venezuelan Andes. Criollo is {{considered}} to have the finest flavor and aroma. In Pre-Columbian times criollo, traveled north to Central America and the Caribbean, the Spaniards took it across the world as far as Asia. Today, criollo is in danger of extinction and of being replaced by high yielding, disease resistant forastero. Criollo pods are usually deeply ridged, warty, and with pointed ends. When the criollo beans are cut open, the cotyledons range from pure white to shades of pink. When properly fermented, the criollo beans <b>dry</b> to a <b>tan</b> color and exude a distinct chocolate aroma. Venezuelan criollo are highly appreciated by chocolate connoisseurs for their lack of bitterness and astringency, and their pure, lingering chocolate taste.|$|R

40|$|Leather {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{globally}} spread biomaterial which is obtained by the processing of different animal skins. It encompasses a wide palette of applications, from footwear and clothing to upholsteries and different types of furniture [1], [2], [3]. The main constituent of animal skins is collagen, a supramolecular fibrillar protein in the form of a triple helix. This form endows leather with elasticity, good mechanical properties and softness. A major disadvantage resides in the inapplicability of raw animal hides, due to their microbiological instability and decay through rotting. Microbiological stability is obtained through the tanning process, characterized by protein crosslinking and <b>drying</b> afterwards. After <b>tanning</b> the leather exhibits the required properties for the desired specific applications in terms of aspect, availability and sustainability [4], [5]. The study aims to elucidate the thermal decomposition process of chrome-free tanned bovine hide (wet-white) using a new product based on titanium and aluminium salts compared with the same hide tanned by chromium salts (wet-blue). The thermal behavior was studied by dynamic thermogravimetry in nitrogen atmosphere, up to 700 oC. A comparative thermal decomposition study between the different tanned bovine leathers was undertaken...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the economy was based on agriculture: large-scale cotton farming, coffee and cereals, and cattle raising, goats, sheep and cattle, favoring the export of sheep skins raw or <b>tanned,</b> <b>dry</b> leather and salty, as well as lump cotton and live cattle. Cotton was the culture that most contributed to the economic development of the municipality. Between 1930 and 1955, the production was so great that the producers started to benefit it in the field even using handmade machines. Faced with the success of cotton growing, modern cotton factories were installed in the city. The municipality had six plants in operation. Since 1980, the crop has declined, due to several factors, as an interruption of financial aid by the government, (such as crop insurance), cotton boll weevil (pests that destroy crops), high interest rates for production financing, and of the processing. Currently, the production of passion fruit has been outstanding, in the district of Itaquaraí, one of the largest production locations in Brazil.In 1930, two important events marked the economic history of the municipality: the arrival of the mining company Magnesita S.A., founded by two French friends naturalized Brazilian and resident in Brazil, Miguel Pierre Cahen and Georges Louis Minviele - in partnership with Antônio Mourão Guimarães -, a politician of the time, and the construction of the Federal Railroad Network (RFFSA), which would facilitate the transportation of the newly discovered ore to the port of Aratu in Salvador. Both events occurred in 1939. The Magnesita company was authorized to operate in 1940 through Decree nº 6220 and since then, it has exploited most of the magnesite and mineral talc reserves contained in Serra das Éguas. In the 1970s Brumado arrived at the Brazilian Refractory Products Industries (IBAR S.A.). The company interested in extracting magnesite has established its facilities {{in the northern part of}} the saw. In the following years, the municipality witnessed great changes, such as large-scale population growth, construction of houses and commercial establishments. Faced with this great attraction, people from other cities were arriving, commerce strengthened, and the city of Brumado became known by recent events. To the south of the former Serra das Éguas farm was formed a kind of closed condominium: the Catiboaba village; The Presidente Getúlio Vargas village was also formed around the company, fruit of the flow of workers who came from the most varied places to work in the mines of magnesite and mineral talc. In 1969, it was the turn of Xilolite S.A., which also settled on the north side of the mountain range and has since exploited magnesite and mineral talc, with the acquisition of one of the mines in 1973. In 1993, Matsulfur, a cement factory, later acquired by Lafarge, under the name Cement Brumado, today Cimpor (Cement of Portugal), belonging to InterCement (Grupo Camargo Corrêa).|$|R
