5|$|Auditory {{defenses}} {{can also}} be used, which {{in the case of}} the <b>Grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> refers to vibrations generated by the butterfly upon expanding its wings in an attempt to communicate with ant predators.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} <b>Grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
25|$|The site is of high entomological interest, with 29 {{varieties}} of resident breeding species of butterfly recorded. The horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) is locally plentiful and supports both the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and the Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus) butterflies. Other butterfly species {{to be found}} on and around the site include for the Duke of Burgundy (Hamaeris lucina), the <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> (Pyrgus malvae), the dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), and the small blue (Cupido minimus).|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} a dump for motor {{vehicles}} until 1976, when it was acquired by Wycombe Council. The Chiltern Society took over the management in 2013. It is steeply sloping chalk grassland with a diverse range of species, including birds such bullfinches, blackcaps and garden warblers, are butterflies such as dingy, <b>grizzled</b> <b>skippers</b> and green hairstreaks.|$|R
50|$|The skipper's {{preferred}} habitats are {{now considered}} more varied {{than the original}} speculation that they only lived in shale barrens. Usually living in openings near pine or oak forests, the butterflies tend to populate sparsely vegetated, often disturbed, barrens with exposed rock or soil. One thing that does seem to remain a constant is the abundance of larval host plants in the populated area. Whether it is cinquefoil or wild strawberry, the <b>grizzled</b> <b>skippers</b> gravitate toward these plants as they act {{as a source of}} sustenance for both the butterfly larvae and the adults. A thriving population of Appalachian <b>grizzled</b> <b>skippers</b> was found inhabiting a distinct range of the Wayne National Forest in southern Ohio that has recently been developed for a new highway bypass project. Other known disturbed habitats the butterflies frequent are power lines, pipelines, forest roads, fire lanes, clear cuts and south facing slopes.|$|R

5000|$|Pyrgus is a genus in the skippers {{butterfly}} family, Hesperiidae, {{known as}} the <b>grizzled</b> <b>skippers.</b> The name [...] "grizzled skipper" [...] best describes this genus, but in some countries the name [...] "checkered" [...] or [...] "chequered skipper" [...] is applied to some species. Strictly speaking, [...] "chequered skippers" [...] applies to butterflies of the genus Carterocephalus. They occur in the Holarctic with an additional group of species extending to the Neotropic.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves of}} cinquefoils are eaten by the {{caterpillars}} of many Lepidoptera, notably the <b>grizzled</b> <b>skippers</b> (genus Pyrgus), butterflies of the skipper family. Adult {{butterflies and moths}} visit cinquefoil flowers; for example, the endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) takes nectar from common cinquefoil (P. simplex). The Polish cochineal (Porphyrophora polonica), a scale insect once used to produce red dye, lives on cinquefoils and other plants in Eurasia. Some, but not all, cinquefoils are insect-pollinated, producing nectar that lures bees, hoverflies, muscid flies, butterflies, true bugs, and ants.|$|R
50|$|Wildflowers {{found on}} the common include thyme, marjoram, rock-rose, St John's wort, autumn gentian and violets. Butterflies are {{particularly}} notable including common blue, brown argus, <b>grizzled</b> and dingy <b>skipper,</b> green and purple hairstreak, and dark green fritillary. Other insects such as grasshoppers, glow-worms and moths are abundant. Birds identified at the site include; blackcap, whitethroat, buzzard, kestrel and sparrowhawk.|$|R

The butterflies are known to grow anywhere from around 29 to 33 millimeters in size. The <b>grizzled</b> <b>skipper</b> rarely flies above three feet off the ground and does so in quick, jerky movements. The skipper is hard to spot while flying because of its dingy color and its likeness to the exposed ground. When threatened, the butterfly typically lands in the vegetation, making it hard to find for predators.|$|E
