50|$|The {{acquisition}} of territories {{had a strong}} impact on Utah-Idaho Sugar, as it allowed sugar to be <b>imported</b> <b>duty-free</b> from Hawaii (since 1876), Puerto Rico (1901) and Philippines (1913). Tariffs were discounted 20% for Cuba since 1903. The Revenue Act of 1913 reduced sugar duties by 25% in 1913, and called for the tariffs to end by May 1916. Prices for sugar were at a record low by 1913, and the only factory constructed in 1913 was the Payson factory, already under construction before the Revenue Act passed. Utah-Idaho Sugar wages were reduced 10%, and the stock price was at a new low.|$|R

50|$|Intense {{population}} growth in the Northern states, especially in the US-Mexican border, changed the country's demographic profile {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, as the 1967 US-Mexico maquiladora agreement through which all products manufactured in the border cities could be <b>imported</b> <b>duty-free</b> to the US. Since the adoption of NAFTA in 1994, however, which allows all products to be imported duty free regardless of their origin within Mexico, non-border maquiladora share of exports has increased while that of border cities has decreased, allowing for the growth of middle-size cities in different regions in Mexico. This has also led to decentralization and growth of other metropolitan areas that conform regional centers of economic growth, like Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla, San Luis Potosí, León and Torreón.|$|R

40|$|Many {{development}} experts {{worry that}} continuing reductions of tariff levels in high-income countries will limit trade flows from developing countries that benefit from preferential trade programs because of “preference erosion. ” Using {{a panel of}} U. S. import data between the years of 1997 and 2005, I find that reductions in preference margins will significantly diminish imports of some products, particularly from lowermiddle and low income countries; for example, a one percent reduction in the U. S. tariff on a product that is currently <b>imported</b> <b>duty-free</b> from developing countries will decrease imports of that product from lowermiddle countries {{by an average of}} 2. 6 percent. However, many products produced by developing countries fail to qualify for preferential tariffs, thus a gradual reduction in all U.

5000|$|Batista {{encouraged}} large-scale {{gambling in}} Havana. In 1955, {{he announced that}} Cuba would grant a gaming license to anyone who invested US$1 million in a hotel or $200,000 in a new nightclub—and {{that the government would}} provide matching public funds for construction, a 10-year tax exemption, and waive duties on imported equipment and furnishings for new hotels. Each casino would pay the government $250,000 for the license, plus a percentage of the profits. The policy omitted background checks, as required for casino operations in the United States, which opened the door for casino investors with illegally obtained funds. Cuban contractors with the right connections made windfalls by <b>importing,</b> <b>duty-free,</b> more materials than needed for new hotels and selling the surplus to others.

50|$|About 500 {{companies}} in the Dominican Republic manufacture goods primarily for the North American market. Situated in 50 industrial free zones around the country, these mostly foreign-owned corporations take advantage of generous tax and other financial inducements offered {{by the government to}} businesses that operate within the zones. Approximately 200,000 people, or about 8 percent of the workforce, are employed in this sector. They mostly produce clothing, electronic components, footwear, and leather goods, which are assembled. The raw materials or semi-manufactured goods are usually <b>imported</b> <b>duty-free</b> from other developing countries (electronic parts are imported from industrialized Puerto Rico) and put together in the free zones. Products created are cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, textiles, perfumes & foodstuffs. The value of exports amounted to US$1.9 billion in 1996, but the contribution to the trade balance was only US$520 million because many of the basic materials for the free zones had to be imported and paid for.|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of relatively high American {{barriers to trade}} in textiles and apparel {{and the importance of}} the sector to the Pakistani economy make increased market access a potentially powerful tool of U. S. policy. Unfortunately, recent proposals to extend duty-free market access for Pakistani exports restrict the product and geographic coverage so severely that they would be meaningless in practice. Moreover, the analysis in this paper suggests that the concerns about job loss in the U. S. textile industry from broader coverage are exaggerated. A serious trade package for Pakistan would expand the geographic coverage to allow <b>duty-free</b> <b>imports</b> from all of Pakistan, expand the product coverage for clothing, and cover all other Pakistani exports as well.

5000|$|Because of high sugar {{prices and}} the {{anticipated}} effect of World War I on imported sugar supplies, {{as well as the}} large profits the company was receiving, Nibley began an aggressive factory expansion campaign, detailed above. The federal government combated high prices with the Lever Act and then the Sugar Equalization Board which had the authority to regulate the [...] "price, production, and purchase of sugar". Uncertainty to the supply of sugar caused the Sugar Equalization Board to remain in power past the end of the war, and the United States Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer stated he would prosecute those who sold sugar over an established rate (13 cents per pound, or 20 cents per pound from Louisiana cane sugar). Further, the acquisition of territories had a strong impact on Utah-Idaho Sugar, as it allowed sugar to be <b>imported</b> <b>duty-free</b> from Hawaii (since 1876), Puerto Rico (1901) and Philippines (1913).

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{delivered}} {{at a conference}} entitled: ‘Reconsidering Colonialism’, which was held at The Skilliter Centre for Ottoman Studies, Newnham College, Cambridge: 5 - 6 February 2010. Until the early twentieth century, bread was graded and its quality sanctioned social distinctions in Maltese society. At a time when harvest failure often meant famine and death, setting the price of bread {{was one of the}} most difficult tasks from late medieval times to the early nineteenth century. During its stay in Malta, the Hospitaller Order of St John (1530 - 1798) depended heavily on <b>imported</b> <b>duty-free</b> grain from Sicily. Matters did not change much when Malta was a British Protectorate (1800 - 1814) but the island witnessed an overhaul in its system of grain provisioning as a British colony (1814 - 1964). In an attempt to improve the quality of bread for the mass of Maltese, the British colonial administration introduced a ‘free-trade’ policy. However, the new policy was based on the introduction of high tariffs on basic commodities like wheat, which in turn led to the fluctuation and steep increase of prices. Thus, rather than improving the quality of life, the new tariff laws forced many Maltese, peasants and urbanites alike, to spend most of their income on bread and they were left with little money to buy other commodities. Hardship reached a climax by World War I and harvest failures culminated in a popular rebellion in June 1919. peer-reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|The Government of South Korea {{enacted the}} [...] "Automotive Industry Promotion Law" [...] in 1962. Under this legislation, the {{importation}} of assembled automobiles was outlawed, subsidies were made available to assemblers who were also afforded tariff exemption on {{the importation of}} parts. Responsibility for deciding which firms would be authorized to undertake automobile manufacturing was held by the Minister of Trade and Industry, {{who at the time}} opted to appoint just one company for each product segment to maximize economies of scale. The minister initially favored the Sammi Corporation for passenger automobiles. Preference was shifted to Saenara Motors after the latter made alleged political contributions to the party recently established by the military government. Consequently, Saenara signed an agreement with Nissan who provided the company with technical assistance and a 35 million loan to facilitate the construction of a factory in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon. Saenara Motors began <b>importing</b> <b>duty-free</b> Datsun Bluebird (310) semi-knock-down kits from Nissan in November 1962 at a cost of [...] per unit. The assembled cars were then retailed at —thus producing large profit margins that allowed Saenara to provide political donations to the government. Due to a shortage in foreign currency, the junta later forbid the firm from importing further kits, leading to the cessation of manufacture in May 1963, having built only 2,773 cars. Saenara collapsed that July, thus resulting in its ownership transfer under joint management by the ministry and Hanil Bank.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Estimates {{of illicit}} {{cigarette}} consumption are limited {{and the data}} obtained from studies funded by the tobacco industry {{have a tendency to}} inflate them. This study aimed to validate an industry-funded estimate of 35. 9 % for Hong Kong using a framework taken from an industry-funded report, but with more transparent data sources. METHODS: Illicit cigarette consumption was estimated as the difference between total cigarette consumption and the sum of legal domestic sales and legal personal <b>imports</b> (<b>duty-free</b> consumption). Reliable data from government reports and scientifically valid routine sources were used to estimate the total cigarette consumption by Hong Kong smokers and legal domestic sales in Hong Kong. Consumption by visitors and legal duty-free consumption by Hong Kong passengers were estimated under three scenarios for the assumptions to examine the uncertainty around the estimate. A two-way sensitivity analysis was conducted using different levels of possible undeclared smoking and under-reporting of self-reported daily consumption. RESULTS: Illicit cigarette consumption was estimated to be about 8. 2 - 15. 4 % of the total cigarette consumption in Hong Kong in 2012 with a midpoint estimate of 11. 9 %, as compared with the industry-funded estimate of 35. 9 % of cigarette consumption. The industry-funded estimate was inflated by 133 - 337 % of the probable true value. Only with significant levels of under-reporting of daily cigarette consumption and undeclared smoking could we approximate the value reported in the industry-funded study. CONCLUSIONS: The industry-funded estimate inflates the likely levels of illicit cigarette consumption. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.
