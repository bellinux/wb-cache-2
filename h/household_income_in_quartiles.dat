40|$|To {{describe}} {{recent trends}} in prevalence of pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM) (i. e., type 1 or type 2 diabetes) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among delivery hospitalizations in the United States. Data on delivery hospitalizations from 1993 through 2009 {{were obtained from}} the Health Care Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Diagnosis-Related Group codes were used to identify deliveries and diagnosis codes on presence of diabetes. Rates of hospitalizations with diabetes were calculated per 100 deliveries by type of diabetes, hospital geographic region, patient's age, degree of urbanicity of patient's residence, categorized median <b>household</b> <b>income</b> for patient's ZIP Code, expected primary payer, and type of delivery. From 1993 to 2009, age-standardized prevalence of diabetes per 100 deliveries increased from 0. 62 to 0. 90 for PDM (trend p < 0. 001) and from 3. 09 to 5. 57 for GDM (trend p < 0. 001). In 2009, correlates of PDM at delivery included older age [40 - 44 vs. 15 - 24 : odds ratio 6. 45 (95 % CI 5. 27 - 7. 88) ], Medicaid/Medicare versus private payment sources [1. 77 (95 % CI 1. 59 - 1. 98) ], patient's ZIP Code with a median <b>household</b> <b>income</b> <b>in</b> bottom <b>quartile</b> versus other quartiles [1. 54 (95 % CI 1. 41, 1. 69) ], and C-section versus vaginal delivery [3. 36 (95 % CI 3. 10 - 3. 64) ]. Correlates of GDM at delivery were similar. Among U. S. delivery hospitalizations, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing. In 2009, the prevalence of diabetes was higher among women in older age groups, living in ZIP codes with lower <b>household</b> <b>incomes,</b> or with public insurance.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that in a segmented housing market, housing price structure is different in each segment and whole market area price structure does not reflect a realistic housing price structure effectively. Submarket existence is tested in order to average <b>household</b> <b>income</b> <b>in</b> neighbourhoods in the Istanbul housing market. Whether the consequential variations in prices in each segment have large effects on the overall prices of housing is emphasized by the replication of the Schnare and Struyk (1976) process. The empirical results show that as a stratifier, average <b>household</b> <b>income</b> <b>in</b> neighbourhoods affects housing prices in each segment and, considering the submarkets based on average <b>household</b> <b>income</b> <b>in</b> neighbourhoods, is an effective for the Istanbul housing market.
