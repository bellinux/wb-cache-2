5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site.

5|$|Manitoba's early economy {{depended}} on mobility and {{living off the}} land.

Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over <b>its</b> <b>competitors</b> ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires.

Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E
