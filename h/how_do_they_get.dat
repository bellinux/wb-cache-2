He brings up Chinna along with his son, Sanjay (Rajiv Kanakala) and daughter. However the jailer's father hates Chinna since he was born to a prisoner. In a {{dramatic}} situation, Chinna kills the Jailer’s brother and is put in jail. Upon release, the jailer and his family tell Chinna {{to stay away from}} them. So Chinna moves into a rough neighborhood that happens to be {{under the control of the}} local mafia there. He overpowers the mafia there eventually and becomes a protector for the people there. A clerk in the commissioner’s office (Charmy) enters as a co-tenant in Chinna's house. Love sprouts between them. However, she mistakenly assumes that Chinna is a soft natured guy. She's unaware of his reputation in that locality nor of his murderous past. Their relationship breaks when she finally discovers the truth about Chinna. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> back together? Why did Chinna kill the jailer’s brother? Will Chinna become a part of the jailer’s family again?

Arguably, one {{of the ways in which}} they do this is through the {{practice}} of remote sensing, among which satellite imagery is one of the most widespread and potent tools of engaging, representing and constructing space.

Based on a discussion of the iconic satellite picture of the Korean Peninsula by night, this article shows how satellite imagery constructs – seemingly by itself – North Korea as a distant, foreign and secluded other place in world politics.

In this paper, I give a short historical background of how Africa has evolved over the years into modern day Africa in order to understand how Africa has come to be what, and where it is today.

I further argue that consequent upon that, it is only the synergy of globalization in its controlled form, an educated populace, and a strong middle class that can be the catalyst, the fuel that can cause the essential ingredients of democracy to manifest itself in the society and eventually democracy take root.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} concerns about democratic politics involve information – who has access to it, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> it, and of what quality and type is it? The answer to each of these questions invariably involves other people, and {{it is for this reason}} that modern democracy is unthinkable save in terms of social networks. Fully understanding democratic politics requires us to wrestle with the choices and constraints that individuals face as they navigate the political world and acquire political information. By “choice ” we are referring to the decisions that individuals make about what environments to inhabit – what neighborhood to live in, what church to join, and what people to befriend. Individuals frequently make those choices for reasons unrelated to politics and then live within the “constraints, ” or range of available information defined by those choices. The distribution of politics in socially-defined contexts – geographical or otherwise – then limits subsequent political decisions; for example, the neighborhood may be politically homogenous but dissimilar to the individual, and the trusted friend might be ignorant of politics. In this essay, we consider the choices individuals make and the constraints that follow as we discuss what social network research has taught us about 1) how citizens form reasoned opinion...|$|E

A state, or states, {{with an interest in}} a case may file an amicus brief for one party or another appearing in front of the Court. Research has shown that the more states who join on a brief, the more impact it may have with the Justices. If one or a few states has an interest in a case and wants their brief to be considered <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> other states to join on a brief?

In this paper, I look at amicus briefs filed in the United States Supreme Court by states either when a state is a party or when they took interest in the case by filing a brief. When considering these cases (131 of them) the question I seek to answer is does partisanship determine who joins on an amicus brief? In order to answer this question, I focus on social network analysis of the cases and states who file for each case. This method allows connections to be made between states as well as identifying the central or influential actors within the network. I find that states who file the most briefs are not necessarily the most influential and if partisanship plays a role, it does so at the individual level and not at the whole network level...|$|E
