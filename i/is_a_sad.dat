5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad,</b> disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Poor thing,' said Lady Merrifield; 'it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> trying {{retribution}} for schoolgirl folly {{and want}} of conscientiousness. I should think she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sadder</b> and <b>a</b> wiser woman.' ...|$|R
500|$|The song {{takes the}} form of a piano-based ballad, with {{conventional}} chord changes. McCartney described the chords as [...] "slightly jazzy" [...] and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love.|$|E
500|$|In {{the kitchen}} of his flat on Rue de la Trémoille, near the Champs-Élysées, Jarre set up a small {{recording}} studio. It included his first synthesiser, an EMS VCS 3, and an EMS Synthi AKS, each linked to Revox tape machines. For a 1969 exposition at the Maison de la Culture (Cultural House) in Reims, Jarre wrote the five-minute song [...] "Happiness <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sad</b> Song." [...] His first commercial release was in 1969 with La Cage/Erosmachine, a mixture of harmony, tape effects and synthesisers.|$|E
500|$|Attorney General John Ashcroft told a Senate {{hearing before}} the funeral: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{commentary}} when the observation of {{a memorial service for}} {{a former president of the}} United States must be labeled a National Special Security Event. Such is the fact of modern life in Washington and such is the nature of the war against al-Qaeda." [...] MPDC Chief Charles H. Ramsey agreed saying, [...] "In a post-9/11 world, we have to be very concerned...and aware of the potential that something could happen, not that we've received any information at all." ...|$|E

500|$|In the episode, SpongeBob {{wishes he}} could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several {{attempts}} to do so, including a biplane, bat wings, {{a lawn chair}} with balloons, and a giant kite pulled by a bicycle. All of these attempts fail, and SpongeBob faces ridicule from others. He tells those mocking him that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> day in Bikini Bottom, when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!" [...] They respond that they all have had unfulfilled dreams, and start chasing him. SpongeBob runs off a cliff and falls into a truck of mud, then into a truck of feathers.|$|E
500|$|The {{referendum}} {{was held}} in Sjöbo on 18 September 1988, {{the day of the}} Swedish general election, and passed with a 67 percent majority of the votes (6,237 for and 3,000 against), which led to even more criticism from the Swedish population. Then-Prime Minister of Sweden Ingvar Carlsson said the results were [...] "tragic", and the then-leader of the Centre Party, Olof Johansson, called the ban [...] "improper". The result of the referendum led to concerns from the Swedish government that other municipalities would follow in Sjöbo's footsteps. The day after the vote, Madeleine Ramel commented: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> result. Everyone is a loser. It is unfortunate for Sjöbo." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Mad Men parody, Childs found comedic {{potential}} in Homer's transformation into Don Draper, but concluded {{that this was}} [...] "where the episode could have gotten very funny very fast, but it doesn’t bring any of these jokes home." [...] She further elaborated that [...] "Don Draper <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> character, true, {{but there is some}} real comic {{potential in}} his pretensions and vanity. The writers are tapping into this aspect of his characterization to a small degree, but they aren’t really satirizing it." [...] Hughes was not impressed with the Mad Men parody and sarcastically stated that the spoof was [...] "so sharp, you'll swear it's 2008".|$|E

50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{moment for}} the Club when ‘Longun’ Wilson died in 1956. He had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} part of ‘the Blacks’ since 1928 and his presence as <b>a</b> trainer <b>was</b> missed.|$|R
500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E
500|$|Baltimore {{had become}} disenchanted with {{conditions}} in [...] "this wofull country", {{and he wrote}} to his old acquaintances in England lamenting his troubles. The final blow to his hopes was dealt by the Newfoundland winter of 1628–9, which did not release its grip until May. Like others before them, the residents of Avalon suffered terribly from the cold and from malnutrition. Nine or ten of Baltimore's company died that winter, and with half the settlers ill at one time, his house had to be turned into a hospital. The sea froze over, and nothing would grow before May. [...] "Tis not terra Christianorum", Baltimore wrote to Wentworth. He confessed to the king: [...] "I have found...by too deare bought experience [...] always concealed from me...that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> face of wynter upon all this land".|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Robson died of {{lung cancer}} at his home in County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E

5000|$|Moore {{died in his}} London {{apartment}} on 30 December 1886. Stannage (1978) writes that he died [...] "apparently friendless", and Cameron (2000) adds [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> end to <b>a</b> worthwhile colonial career." ...|$|R

2500|$|Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae said on Radio Kerry: This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{situation}} to see John O'Donoghue {{go like this}} [...] The man was hounded out of office, there's no doubt about it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 Gertrude Himmelfarb {{wrote that}} [...] "most {{professional}} historians {{have long since}} given up reading Macaulay, as they have given up writing the kind of history he wrote and thinking about history as he did. Yet {{there was a time}} when anyone with any pretension to cultivation read Macaulay." [...] Himmelfarb also laments that [...] "the history of the History <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> testimonial to the cultural regression of our times".|$|E
2500|$|On October 12, 1983, {{eight months}} after Karen's death, the Carpenter family celebrated the {{unveiling}} of the Carpenters' new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Richard said in his speech, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> day, {{but at the same}} time a very special and beautiful day to my family and me. My only regret is that Karen is not physically here to share it with us, but I know that she is very much alive in our minds, and in our hearts." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} with Rolling Stone Brazil, Gorky mentioned, (translated) “if I had to draw, this album would <b>be</b> like <b>a</b> sun with a happy face, and the former <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> moon face”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] sighed the Magician; [...] "you <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> bungle, {{taken all}} in all. I {{was wrong to}} make you as I did, for a more useless, {{conceited}} and brittle thing never before existed." ...|$|R

2500|$|It has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews, with most critics noting poor literary {{qualities of the}} work. Salman Rushdie said about the book: [...] "I've never read anything so badly written that got published. It made Twilight look like War and Peace." [...] Maureen Dowd described the book in The New York Times as being written [...] "like a Bronte devoid of talent," [...] {{and said it was}} [...] "dull and poorly written." [...] Jesse Kornbluth of The Huffington Post said: [...] "As a reading experience, Fifty Shades... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> joke, puny of plot".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{definition}} {{derives from}} Kerikeri te ana wai — [...] "the churning or boiling over of the waters". That would have aptly described the freshwater river tumbling into the salt {{water over the}} falls which were then higher (being blasted early in the 1900s to accommodate a bridge). However, some Māori say it derives from hukerikeri which means [...] "bubbling up", and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> reasoning behind this. Hongi Hika, a famous or infamous chief depending on whether one fought with or against him, is reputed to have fathered {{the child of a}} captured slave at Kororipo Pā. As this was unacceptable to the tribe, the baby was placed in the water to drown but persistently rose to the surface, hence the [...] "bubbling up".|$|E
2500|$|Mohammed Rahim also {{composed}} three {{songs in}} this album. [...] "Fi Hagat" [...] {{was selected as}} the lead single, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> song about the feelings of an unappreciated lover. Rahim also presented two Egyptian songs of the lighter, simpler context, [...] "Okay" [...] and [...] "Einy Aleik" [...] which was rumored to have been the old album title. Both these songs show Ajram exploring deeper into contemporary Egyptian music. Walid Saad presented Ajram with three songs initially, one of which [...] "Sallemouly Aleih" [...] was excluded from the album and released as single months ahead. His song [...] "Emta Hashoufak" [...] presents a brand new style to Ajram reminiscent of sad Latin ballads. [...] "Kol Ma Teddi" [...] samples Cher's The Music's No Good Without You.|$|E
6000|$|Caleb made no rejoinder, but {{presently}} {{lowered his}} spectacles, drew up {{his chair to}} the desk, and said, [...] "Deuce take the bill--I wish it was at Hanover! These things <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> interruption to business!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sieg. [...] You shall, [...] Your harp, {{which by}} the way awaits you with [...] The Countess in her chamber. She {{complains}} [...] That you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> truant to your music: [...] She attends you.|$|R
