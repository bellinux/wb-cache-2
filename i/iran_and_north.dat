5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush {{referred}} to an {{axis of evil}} including Iraq, <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. is advocating that <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea {{should not}} develop nuclear weapons, while the U.S., {{the only country}} to have used nuclear weapons in warfare, {{maintains}} a nuclear arsenal of 5,113 warheads. However, this double-standard is legitimated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to which Iran is a party.|$|E
25|$|Because Powell {{was seen}} as more {{moderate}} than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz. At times, infighting among the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Cheney's office {{had the effect of}} polarizing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea.|$|E

[...] The Iranian newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami subsequently adopted the language in reference to the Shia insurgency in Iraq, writing in 2004 that [...] "if the line of Iraq's Shi'is needs to be linked, united and consolidated, this unity should be realized on the axis of resistance and struggle against the occupiers." ...|$|R

25|$|Soghoghtani's husband Tolui, whose appanages {{included}} eastern Mongolia, {{parts of}} <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> China, {{died at the}} age of 40 in 1232. Ögedei Khan, Genghis's third son who had succeeded his father, gave her enduring authority to handle Tolui's estates. The Secret History suggests that Ögedei may have consulted Sorghaghtani on various matters, and he always held her in high regard. Ogedei appointed her in charge of the Empire's administration, which meant she played a pivotal role in securing the lands won under Genghis Khan.|$|E
25|$|On several {{prominent}} issues, such as proliferation in <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council. In 2007, the Republic of Nauru {{raised the issue}} of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Ban referenced the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, and refused the motion. On 19 July 2007, Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan. Ban rejected the request, stating that Resolution 2758 defined Taiwan as part of China.|$|E

25|$|In February 2007, the US started formal {{negotiations}} with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations {{in those countries}} for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System. Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors {{is supposed to be}} built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US National Missile Defense from long-range missile strikes from <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea, but Czech PM Mirek Topolánek said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} has officially taken a silent policy towards {{the nuclear weapons}} ambitions {{of the state of}} Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea. Until 2005 when the program was cancelled, it was violating its own non-proliferation treaties in the pursuit of so-called nuclear bunker busters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done, in part, on indications that Weapons of Mass Destruction were being stockpiled (lately, stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells have been located in Iraq), and the Bush administration said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government's agreement to abandon its nuclear ambitions.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to taking {{the position of}} Middle East envoy, Rumsfeld served {{as a member of}} the President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control (1982–1986); President Reagan's Special Envoy on the Law of the Sea Treaty (1982–1983); a senior adviser to President Reagan's Panel on Strategic Systems (1983–1984); a member of the Joint Advisory Commission on U.S./Japan Relations (1983–1984); a member of the National Commission on the Public Service (1987–1990); a member of the National Economic Commission (1988–1989); a member of the Board of Visitors of the National Defense University (1988–1992); a member of the FCC's High Definition Television Advisory Committee (1992–1993); a member of the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission (1999–2000); a member of the Council on Foreign Relations; and Chairman of the U.S. Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organization (2000). Among his most noteworthy positions was Chairman of the nine-member Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States from January to July 1998. In its findings, the commission concluded that Iraq, <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea could develop intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities in five to ten years and that U.S. intelligence would have little warning before such systems were deployed.|$|E

25|$|In June 2017, the Senate voted 98 to 2 for a {{bill that}} had been {{initially}} drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia′s continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the 2016 election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>North</b> Korea; the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law. An identical bill was introduced by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in July and passed in the house on July 25, with 419 votes in favor and 3 against. On July 27, the bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate, which provoked Russia′s president Putin into pledging response to ″this kind of insolence towards our country″. On August 2, president Donald Trump signed the bill into law (the ″Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act″). Simultaneously, the president issued two separate, simultaneous statements. One of those said, ″While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions″. The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress, giving them time to reverse such a move. It targets Russia's defense industry by harming Russia's ability to export weapon, and allows the U.S. to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources. One of Trump′s statements noted that ″by limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill {{makes it harder for}} the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.″ The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of retaliatory measure {{on the part of the}} European Union.|$|E
