5|$|The Galileo {{affair was}} largely {{forgotten}} after Galileo's death, {{and the controversy}} subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned Dialogue) in Florence. In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the Dialogue. In 1758, the <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> against works advocating heliocentrism {{was removed from the}} Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.|$|E
5|$|I-495 forms a wide loop {{around the}} outer edge of Greater Boston. Other major interstates in Massachusetts include I-291, I-391, I-84, I-195, I-395, I-290, and I-190. Major non-interstate {{highways}} in Massachusetts include U.S. Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128. A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid 20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston, first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction grew, and in 1970 Governor Francis W. Sargent issued a <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop in the Boston area. A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the Big Dig, brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.|$|E

The Roundtable debated conditions for exempting horizontal co-operation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from <b>general</b> <b>prohibitions</b> against cartels. In a number of countries, either a legal provision exempts agreements between SMEs or such agreements are allowed under a de minimis clause. Country contributions and the discussion showed a diversity in the definition of an SME or of the threshold of de minimis or exemption, in the kinds of agreements which could be exempted and in the sectors where exemptions are found. One rationale offered for exempting agreements among SMEs is administrative, to lighten the burden on antitrust authorities. Another is economic, to achieve benefits in terms of efficiency or competition. And another is political, where the exemption results from lobbying by special interest groups...|$|R

25|$|In the 17th century, {{based on}} a {{question}} raised by the Bishop of Quebec, the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the beaver was a fish (beaver flesh {{was a part of}} the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law. Therefore, the <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> on the consumption of meat on Fridays did not apply to beaver meat. The legal basis for the decision probably rests with the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas, which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy. This is similar to the Church's classification of other semi-aquatic rodents, such as the capybara and muskrat.|$|E

25|$|According to biblical scholars, the shaving of hair, {{particularly}} {{of the corners}} of the beard, was originally a mourning custom; the behaviour appears, from the Book of Jeremiah, to also have been practiced by other Semitic tribes, although some ancient manuscripts of the text read live in remote places rather than clip {{the corners of the}}ir hair. Biblical scholars think that the regulations against shaving hair may be an attack on the practice of offering hair to the dead, which was performed in the belief that it would obtain protection in sheol; Nazirites shaved after contact with a corpse, captive women shaved after mourning the death of their parents, and the <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> in the Holiness Code is immediately followed by a rule against people cutting their own bodies {{for the benefit of the}} dead.|$|E

5000|$|These <b>general</b> <b>prohibitions</b> {{have been}} {{implemented}} for all national forest wildernesses in order to implement {{the provisions of the}} Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness Act requires management of human-caused impacts and protection of the area's wilderness character to ensure that it is [...] "unimpaired for the future use and enjoyment as wilderness." [...] Use of the equipment listed as prohibited in wilderness is inconsistent with the provision in the Wilderness Act which mandates opportunities for solitude or primitive recreation and that wilderness is a place that is in contrast with areas where people and their works are dominant.|$|R
25|$|The {{provision}} Congress most intensely {{focused on}} amending was Section 2, which prescribes a <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> of discriminatory voting laws. Two years earlier, the Supreme Court, in Mobile v. Bolden (1980), held that racially discriminatory laws violated the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments {{only if the}} laws were enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose; thus, showing that a law simply had a discriminatory effect was insufficient to state a constitutional claim of discrimination. The Court further held that Section 2 mirrored this constitutional standard. The decision had a major effect on voting rights litigation; civil rights lawyers decided not to pursue many planned cases, and courts overturned several judgments that were previously entered in favor of plaintiffs. This prompted nationwide outrage that weighed heavily on Congress as it considered amending the Act in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Since the Book of Genesis {{refers to}} young goats by the Hebrew phrase g'di izim, but the {{prohibition}} against boiling a kid... only {{uses the term}} g'di (גדי). Rashi, {{one of the most}} prominent talmudic commentators, argued that the term g'di must actually have a more general meaning, including calves and lambs, in addition to young goats. Rashi also argued that the meaning of g'di is still narrow enough to exclude birds, all the undomesticated kosher animals (for example, chevrotains and antelope), and all of the non-kosher animals. The Talmudic writers had a similar analysis, but believed that since domesticated kosher animals (sheep, goats, and cattle) have similar meat to birds and to the non-domestic kosher land-animals, they should prohibit these latter meats too, creating a <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> against mixing milk and meat from any kosher animal, excepting fish.|$|E

500|$|The {{constitutionality}} of Section 2, which contains a <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> on discriminatory voting laws, {{has not been}} definitively explained by the Supreme Court.

This [...] "results test" [...] contrasts with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, both of which directly prohibit only purposeful discrimination. Given this disparity, whether the Supreme Court would uphold the {{constitutionality of}} Section 2 as appropriate legislation passed to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, and under what rationale, remains unclear.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the violence and unfair treatment of gay men, the Sexual Offences Act 1967 was passed.

Those conditions were that the act had to be consensual, take place in private and involve only people that had attained the age of 21. This was a higher age of consent than that for heterosexual acts, which was set at 16. Further, [...] "in private" [...] limited participation in an act to two people. This condition was interpreted strictly by the courts, which took it to exclude acts taking place in a room in a hotel, for example, and in private homes where a third person was present (even if that person was in a different room).|$|R

500|$|The {{scope of}} the {{coverage}} formula {{was a matter of}} contentious Congressional debate. The coverage formula reached a jurisdiction if: (1) the jurisdiction maintained a [...] "test or device" [...] on November 1, 1964, and (2) less than 50% of the jurisdiction's voting-age residents either were registered to vote on November 1, 1964 or cast a ballot in the November 1964 presidential election. This formula reached few jurisdictions outside the Deep South. To appease legislators who felt that the bill unfairly targeted Southern jurisdictions, the bill included a <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> on racial discrimination in voting that applied nationwide. [...] The bill also included provisions allowing a covered jurisdiction to [...] "bail out" [...] of coverage by proving in federal court that it had not used a [...] "test or device" [...] for a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request. Additionally, the bill included a [...] "bail in" [...] provision under which federal courts could subject discriminatory non-covered jurisdictions to remedies contained in the special provisions.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to reauthorizing the original special provisions and expanding coverage, Congress amended and added several other provisions to the Act. For instance, Congress expanded the original ban on [...] "tests or devices" [...] to apply nationwide in 1970, and in 1975, Congress made the ban permanent. Separately, in 1975 Congress expanded the Act's scope to protect language minorities from voting discrimination. Congress defined [...] "language minority" [...] to mean [...] "persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage." [...] Congress amended various provisions, {{such as the}} preclearance requirement and Section 2's <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> of discriminatory voting laws, to prohibit discrimination against language minorities. Congress also enacted a bilingual election requirement in Section 203, which requires election officials in certain jurisdictions {{with large numbers of}} English-illiterate language minorities to provide ballots and voting information {{in the language of the}} language minority group. Originally set to expire after 10 years, Congress reauthorized Section 203 in 1982 for seven years, expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years, and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years. The bilingual election requirements have remained controversial, with proponents arguing that bilingual assistance is necessary to enable recently naturalized citizens to vote and opponents arguing that the bilingual election requirements constitute costly unfunded mandates.|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{amendments}} responded to judicial rulings with which Congress disagreed. In 1982, Congress amended the Act {{to overturn the}} Supreme Court case Mobile v. Bolden (1980), which held that the <b>general</b> <b>prohibition</b> of voting discrimination prescribed in Section 2 prohibited only purposeful discrimination. Congress responded by expanding Section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory effect, {{regardless of whether the}} practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose. The creation of this [...] "results test" [...] shifted the majority of vote dilution litigation brought under the Act from preclearance lawsuits to Section 2 lawsuits. In 2006, Congress amended the Act to overturn two Supreme Court cases: Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board (2000), which interpreted the Section 5 preclearance requirement to prohibit only voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a [...] "retrogressive" [...] discriminatory purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose, and Georgia v. Ashcroft (2003), which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates. In 2014, the Voting Rights Amendments Act was introduced in Congress to create a new coverage formula and amend various other provisions in response to the Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional. It was referred to the Constitution and Civil Justice congressional subcommittee on February 11, 2015, but no action was taken on it, and it expired.|$|E
