40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the reputation, tenure and cash compensation of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members {{and the likelihood of}} financial restatements. We examine these associations for 138 U. S. public firms that announced their restatements from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002 and a set of control firms matched on industry and size. We observe a negative association between financial restatements and (i) reputation of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members and (ii) the cash compensation paid to <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members. Our results suggest that <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee members holding multiple directorships have incentives to enhance and protect their reputation by ensuring the financial statements are of high quality. Our findings on compensation suggest that monetary incentives motivate independent directors to be vigilant and challenge management in their oversight of the financial reporting process...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether high surplus free cash flow is related to earnings management. This study hypothesizes managers of high surplus free cash flow companies have incentive to engage in earnings management.

This study expects that the positive relationship between surplus free cash flow and earnings management is moderated by <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to investigate: (1) the {{relationship}} between audit commitee independence and earnings quality, and (2) the influence of CEO duality on this relationship. We posit that an <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committee is more effective in monitoring the quality of financial statements, hence independence is related to higher earnings quality. We also conjecture that the dual role of CEO and chairman would reduce the effectiveness of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committees. Using a sample of 3, 017 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia from 2005 - 2010, we find that earnings quality is positively associated with audit committee independence, but {{the relationship}} is weakened by the existence of CEO duality. Our results imply that when a CEO has excessive control over {{the decisions of the}} board of directors by holding the position of chairman, the monitoring function of <b>independent</b> <b>audit</b> committees to assure high quality of earnings in financial statements becomes ineffective...|$|R
