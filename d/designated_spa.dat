40|$|To {{identify}} mutants potentially defective in signaling intermediates {{specific to}} phytochrome A (phyA), we screened for extragenic mutations that suppress the morphological phenotype exhibited by a weak phyA mutant (phyA- 105) of Arabidopsis. A new recessive mutant, <b>designated</b> <b>spa</b> 1 (for suppressor of phyA- 105), was isolated and mapped {{to the bottom}} of chromosome 2. spa 1 phyA- 105 double mutants exhibit restoration of several responses to limiting fluence rates of continuous far-red light that are absent in the parental phyA- 105 mutant, such as deetiolation, anthocyanin accumulation, and a far-red light-induced inability of seedlings to green upon subsequent transfer to continuous white light. spa 1 mutations do not cause a phenotype in darkness, indicating that the suppression phenotype is light dependent. Enhanced photoresponsiveness was observed in spa 1 seedlings in a wild-type PHYA background {{as well as in the}} mutant phyA- 105 background but not in a mutant phyA null background. These results indicate that phyA is necessary in a non-allele-specific fashion for the expression of the spa 1 mutant phenotype and that phyB to phyE are not sufficient for this effect. Taken together, the data suggest that spa 1 mutations specifically amplify phyA signaling and therefore that the SPA 1 locus encodes a component that acts negatively early in the phyA-specific signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} is increasingly recognised {{as a major}} problem and threat. During the last decades Gram-positive bacteria in general, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular, have been in focus both concerning matters of antibiotic resistance and as pathogens causing health care-associated (nosocomial) infections. In contrast to MRSA, studies on clonal distribution of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) are scarce. However, interest in MSSA has increased since it was shown that MRSA emerges from susceptible backgrounds by acquisition of a staphylococcal cassette chromosome element, carrying the mecA gene encoding methicillin-resistance (SCCmec). In an outbreak investigation of MRSA in Östergötland County, Sweden, in 2005, {{a high incidence of}} MSSA isolates with concomitant resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tobramycin (ECT-R) was detected. Analysis showed that 91 % of the investigated isolates were genetically related (clonal). The ECT-R clone was divided into four different but closely related patterns with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and was <b>designated</b> <b>spa</b> type t 002. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the ECT-R clone carried a pseudo-SCC element estimated to be 12 kb in size, showing a resemblance of more than 99 % with the SCCmec type II element of MRSA strain N 315 (New York/Japan clone). This suggested a probable derivation from a highly successful MRSA strain, which had partially excised its SCCmec. The clonal outbreak was concentrated in eight hospital departments and two primary care centres, all located in the city of Linköping. Despite a high exchange of patients with the hospitals in the neighbouring counties in southeast Sweden (Jönköping- and Kalmar County), the ECT-R clone seemed to be limited to Östergötland County. However, a tobramycin-resistant clone predominated by isolates of spa type t 084 was found in all three counties in southeast Sweden, and in particular among newborns, suggesting inter-hospital transmission. The ECT-R clone has survived as an abundant MSSA clone for a decade in Östergötland County, which indicates an insufficiency in the maintenance of basic hygiene guidelines, and that the clone probably possesses mechanisms of virulence and transmission that are yet to be discovered...|$|E

40|$|Currently, in the {{competitive}} environment, {{it is necessary to}} look at the possibility to focus on the spa treatment not only on its medical component part, but as well as on psychological and social component parts. Clients visiting spa facilities should leave the spa, after a completion of their treatment, as far as possible satisfied with all spa services provided; both curative ones and a catering, accommodation, leisure and with an overall approach of the staff to the client at all. Because of the fact, that I have been working in the Spa Aurora in the town of Třeboň already for four years in the field of medical services, I decided to process the bachelor thesis on the topic "Clients´ satisfaction with spa servicesq and to find out, how much the clients are satisfied with services provided just in the <b>designated</b> <b>spa.</b> Data were investigated through a questionnaire survey at clients of Spa Aurora in Třeboň during the month of November, 2009. Company questionnaires were used for the research. They were handed in total of 280 of them, of which 140 to clients, whose stay was covered by some of the health insurance companies of the Czech Republic (a complex or subsidized spa treatment) and 140 to clients, who paid the stay themselves from their own financial resources. Questionnaires were handed in to clients personally by spa employees and after their completion by respondents they were collected again by the spa employees. I thought, in hypotheses that men will be more satisfied with the spa services than women and that clients whose stay was covered by some of the health insurance companies will be more satisfied with the spa services than the clients paying the stay from their own financial resources. After carrying out the research by the questionnaire survey, the declared hypotheses were refuted, because there were no gender differences and no differences among insured and private patients in the satisfaction with the spa services. This fact indicates that the services provided in Spa Aurora reach a satisfactory level and a majority of clients departs satisfied with the treatment. The result of the bachelor thesis can be used by Spa Aurora employees to improve the provided services and their approach to the client...|$|E

An internationally important number of pairs of Black-tailed Godwit breeds in the Netherlands but the breeding population is declining steeply and is, in effect, unprotected, as the Netherlands has not <b>designated</b> <b>SPAs</b> for it. To contribute to firmer and more efficient protection of the Black-tailed Godwit, {{we set out to}} identify the core areas in the Netherlands where this species is expected to breed in 2020.

Because these areas are currently not designated for the breeding period of Black-tailed Godwit within the SPA network, the protection of this flagship species of Dutch meadows could be at risk. It seems likely that the Black-tailed Godwit population will continue to decline, with the result that the Netherlands will breach several policy commitments for the conservation of this species...|$|R

40|$|Three {{quarters}} of tracked Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) at Grassholm gathered in rafts around the colony, concentrated within a recently designated at-sea Special Protection Area (SPA), but rafting was not correlated with foraging effort. Aims To investigate the incidence, distribution and foraging implications of Northern Gannet rafting behaviour in waters {{adjacent to a}} large colony. Methods Using bird-borne global positioning system (GPS) loggers we reconstructed at-sea movement and used a speed filter to identify rafting behaviour within 10 km of the colony. We mapped the spatial distribution of rafting events from 160 breeding individuals over 5 years, and investigated the relationship between foraging effort (trip duration and total distance travelled) and the presence/absence of rafting. Results On average, 74 % of tracked birds engaged in rafting. Of the 381 foraging trips analysed, rafting was recorded on 237 (62 %). Birds {{were more likely to}} raft on outbound (224 trips, 59 %), than inbound journeys (38 trips, 10 %). Presence/absence of rafting did not correlate significantly with foraging trip distance or duration nor with duration of nest attendance. The majority of rafting was concentrated in a 2 -km radius around the colony within a recently <b>designated</b> seaward <b>SPA</b> extension. Birds showed low individual repeatability in rafting, although there was lower variation within, than among, individuals. Conclusion Our results show that rafting is important for breeding gannets on Grassholm, and a recently <b>designated</b> at-sea <b>SPA</b> encapsulates the core distribution of rafting. Rafting {{did not appear to be}} correlated with foraging behaviour. Given the dearth of literature on rafting and the wealth of GPS tracking data for seabirds, we suggest that similar research be conducted elsewhere to further elucidate the ecological and applied significance of this behaviour. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, the Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality {{notified}} four proposed Sites of Community Interest (pSCIs) to the European Commission (for {{protection as}} Special Conservation Areas (SCAs) under the Habitats Directive).

Based on this decision a process has been executed during {{the last four years}} {{for the development of the}} provisions of this Directive in Dutch legislation and policy, namely the North Sea Natura 2000 project. LEI facilitated this process by making an initial inventory of the fishing activities of both Dutch and foreign fleets in these areas (Van Oostenbrugge et al., 2010). The current status is that for the areas in the coastal zone, management measures have been finalised and implemented. In the Dutch exclusive economic zone the state of play is that for the Dogger Bank, Cleaver Bank and the Frisian Front management proposals are being prepared for decision making in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) context. Designating these areas under national law requires the Nature Protection Act to enter into force in the Dutch EEZ. This has been discussed in parliament (on 13 June 2012). Some questions remain on the importance of these areas for the Dutch fisheries and the economic consequences of management measures. The consequences of the management regime for the Dogger Bank are estimated by the ICES in the international process of the Dogger Bank Steering Group. The ministry of Economic Affairs has asked LEI to update the report from 2010 for the Frisian Front and the Cleaver Bank.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} considers {{the use of}} the Burren Way, a long-distance walking route in the northwest of Co. Clare. It is one of thirty two waymarked ways in Ireland, which area managed on a day-to-day basis by local volunteers under the authority of the central National Waymarked Ways Advisory Committee (NWWAC). Questionnaires, which were administered on the route, investigated users’ preferences and motivations for use, while online questionnaires investigated the landscape preferences of the wider walking community based on photographed scenes’ attractiveness to respondents. Further research comprised an electronic count of passers by at two points on the route, and a participative mapping exercise to investigate stakeholders’ patterns of route use. Spatial patterns of use where then further investigated using GIS overlays of preferences and commonly-walked routes with digital data on landscape character and land cover (CORINE) data. Results show that, while northern sections of the route pass through potentially attractive landscapes and are generally popular among stakeholders and walkers alike, the southern sections of the Burren Way are used less and considered less attractive. Suggestions are therefore made for improvements to the route of the Burren Way, based on current patterns of use, the findings of the preference survey and the existing environmental designations in the region. It was found that many additional routes could be developed within a small area, creating a network of loop walks.

40|$|Effective {{conservation}} {{plans and}} design of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for protected species should take into account ranging behaviour and foraging habitats, and this is particularly important for wide-ranging species. Montagu's harriers Circus pygargus are ground-nesting semi-colonial raptors typical of agricultural habitats. We studied the foraging behaviour of 14 radio-tracked male Montagu's harriers, in order to investigate the distance from nests of foraging birds, {{the extent to which}} foraging range overlapped with <b>SPAs</b> <b>designated</b> for this species, and foraging habitat selection within foraging ranges. Average foraging range size, estimated from either minimum convex polygon or kernel 90 %, was larger than 100 km 2. Only 19 ± 11 % of the foraging ranges were within SPA limits. Cereal (the main habitat used for nesting) was slightly counterselected for foraging, and most prey (64 %, n= 117) captured in that habitat were insects. Hunting attempts occurred significantly more frequently than expected in alfalfa, where most prey captured were small mammals (70 %, n= 102). Use of this habitat for foraging increased throughout the season. Most prey captured in other habitats (mainly tree crops, shrubs or uncultivated land) were birds (83 %, n= 43). SPAs included a higher proportion of cereal, but a lower proportion of alfalfa than areas outside SPAs. Overall, our results show that breeding Montagu's harriers use an area for foraging much larger than current sizes of most SPAs for the species, that habitats selected for foraging differ from those used for nesting and that preferred foraging habitats were less common inside SPAs than outside. Conservation management for this species should aim to protect foraging habitats within a large radius of the colonies, probably requiring measures to be applied outside protected areas. More generally, SPAs designed without including information of ranging behaviour and foraging habitats may be ineffective.

40|$|The Imperial Dock Lock Special Protection Area (SPA) in Leith Docks on the Firth of Forth {{currently}} {{supports the}} largest common tern (Sterna hirundo) colony in Scotland. The nest site, a former lock wall in an operational port, was <b>designated</b> as an <b>SPA</b> for the species in 2004 but {{very little is}} known about the ecology of common terns in this man-made environment. This thesis examined their ecology using a combination of long-term data for the Firth of Forth region and field research at the colony. The dynamics of the Firth of Forth breeding population of common terns was linked both to local influences of predators and the regional status of their main food source, the Firth of Forth sprat stock. Colonisation of Leith Docks resulted from relocation of birds from natural islands in the Firth of Forth which were abandoned due to unsustainable levels of predation by gulls. Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus) are active predators in Leith Docks but at relatively low levels. Predation attempts by mink present a serious threat and could be highly detrimental to the colony. Foraging studies revealed that terns are feeding primarily in the Forth of Forth rather than within the docks, and that their diet consists mostly of sprat, but also sandeels and gadoids. The importance of sprat in the diet is discussed in relation to the potential reopening of the sprat fishery. Surveys of birds commuting between the colony and the feeding grounds showed that a range of flight lines are used but to different extents, and found no evidence of collisions with buildings or other man-made structures. Terns were well-habituated to regular human activity but were sensitive to unusual or high-level human disturbance factors. Gulls and crows, rather than humans, were the greatest disturbance factors for nesting birds overall. Currently the Imperial Dock Lock SPA is the only site in the region that could support common terns breeding in considerable numbers, and so the future of the Firth of Forth population of common terns is now dependent on this one site. There are a number of management options available, and the future persistence of the population relies on the continued monitoring of breeding numbers of terns, of predation levels and further assessment of the sprat stock...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{requires}} that Member States designate Marine Special Protection Areas (SPAs) by 2008 or, {{where this is}} not possible, indicate what measures they will take to move towards future designation as rapidly as possible. This document outlines a “roadmap” for the Maltese government to undertake this work. Marine SPA designation is usually preceded by Marine Important Bird Area (IBA) identification. Currently, no Marine <b>SPAs</b> have been <b>designated</b> in Malta. Designation is obligatory for qualifying sites within Maltese waters up to 25 nautical miles (NM). There are several key species in Malta for which Marine <b>SPAs</b> can be <b>designated.</b> Malta has internationally important breeding colonies of Yelkouan Shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan), Cory’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and European Storm-petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus), as well as internationally important numbers of migrating sea ducks (particularly through the Gozo channel). There is therefore a pressing need to identify Marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs) {{as a first step}} and to designate these as Marine SPAs. Identification of Marine IBAs is challenging because of the paucity of existing data and the logistical difficulties of research at sea. Overcoming these challenges is possible (as has been demonstrated already in other EU countries, in particular Germany, Spain and Portugal) but requires the provision of sufficient funds to undertake surveys using costly but effective census techniques and the use of statistical models. Therefore, a major, carefully planned and suitably financed project is necessary to ensure that Malta can meet its EU obligations in <b>designating</b> Marine <b>SPAs.</b> Some provisional data are available for the designation of Marine SPAs. For example, BirdLife Malta has been collecting bird data since the 1960 s and some of this information can be used to identify Marine IBAs. The ongoing EU LIFE Yelkouan Shearwater Project is also collecting detailed data using a range of methods, which will assist in the identification of Marine IBAs for this species (although it should be stressed that this project alone will not be sufficient to complete this work). There are however substantial data gaps which will require filling. For example, almost nothing is known about marine habitat use by both Cory’s Shearwaters and European Storm-petrels away from their immediate breeding colonies. Even for Yelkouan Shearwater, little is known of the marine behaviour of birds from colonies beyond the Rdum tal-Madonna colony (which is the focus of the LIFE project). The use of the marine environment by migratory sea ducks also requires considerable study. BirdLife Malta and the LIFE project partners (supported by the EU and the Government) are the only bodies which currently have the skills and experience to undertake Marine IBA identification and they are already carrying out considerable research in this area. Key recommendations to the Government to meet its EU obligations include; (i) designate the Gozo Channel as a Marine SPA by end 2008 (data exist but require analysis by BirdLife Malta, which we hope to complete shortly); (ii) designate seaward extensions to coastal SPAs holding breeding colonies (additional data to that presented by Borg and Sultana (2004) exists, but requires analysis; in some cases, more research will also be required, but at key sites such as Ta Cenc, Rdum tal-Madonna and Dwejra, the information is likely to be sufficient to warrant the designation of extensions by the end of 2008); (iii) based on this document, plan a project to collect the missing data and complete a full Marine IBA inventory for the Maltese Islands with much of this work completed by 2010 and clear milestones laid out for the remainder; and (iv) commence the research and identification process for Marine IBAs according to the findings of the plan suggested in point ii. BirdLife Malta therefore expects that that the SPA designation process for sites where research has already been completed for Marine IBAs should commence by the end of 2008, in line with EU obligations. This is principally the Gozo Channel, but it should also be possible to designate some key nearshore shearwater rafting zones. In addition, BirdLife Malta expects that, by the end of 2008, the Maltese Government will develop a plan for Marine SPA designation research and begin to secure funding for this. BirdLife Malta and the LIFE project can assist in this process. This process should lead to a large-scale, fully-funded project to fill gaps in knowledge, develop an inventory of Marine IBAs in Malta and enable designation. N/...|$|R
