25|$|The wings were {{fitted with}} slotted flaps and full length {{leading edge slats}} and could be folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a {{variable}} angle of incidence, pivoting at the front spar and actuated by an electrically driven <b>jackscrew</b> attached to the rear spar. This arrangement reduced stalling speed and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The passage was {{a miserable}} one, with huge waves {{constantly}} crashing against the ship's topside deck until a key structural support timber fractured. The passengers had already suffered agonizing delays, shortages of food, and other shortages, {{and were now}} called upon to provide assistance to the ship's carpenter in repairing the fractured main support beam. This was repaired {{with the use of}} a metal mechanical device called a <b>jackscrew,</b> which had been loaded on board to help in the construction of settler homes. It was now used to secure the beam to keep it from cracking further, making the ship seaworthy enough.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2013, {{investigators}} from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis {{as the starting}} point: three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles, totalling 80 tons of weight, had not been properly secured. At least one armoured vehicle had broken loose on takeoff and rolled backwards, slamming into the airplane's rear bulkhead, puncturing the bulkhead and knocking out the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder. This also crippled hydraulic systems 1 and 2 and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the <b>jackscrew,</b> which rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Control of the aircraft was therefore lost, with the abnormal pitch-up rotation, stall, and crash to the ground ensuing. The damage to the tail controls and hydraulic systems {{made it impossible for}} the crew to regain control of the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Using side-scan sonar, {{remotely}} operated vehicles, and a commercial fishing trawler, workers recovered about 85% of the fuselage (including the tail section) {{and a majority}} of the wing components. In addition, both engines, as well as the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and CVR were retrieved. All wreckage that was retrieved from the crash site was unloaded at Port Hueneme, California for examination and documentation by NTSB investigators. Both the horizontal stabilizer trim system <b>jackscrew</b> (also referred to as [...] "acme screw"), and the corresponding acme nut, which the <b>jackscrew</b> turns through, were retrieved. As the <b>jackscrew</b> rotates it moves up or down through the (fixed) acme nut. This up and down motion moves the horizontal stabilizer for the trim system. Upon recovery from the crash site, and subsequent examination, the <b>jackscrew</b> was found with metallic filaments wrapped around it; these were later determined to be the threads from the acme nut.|$|E

50|$|Jackscrews {{are also}} used {{extensively}} in aviation, and are used to raise and lower horizontal stabilizers. The failure of a <b>jackscrew</b> on a Yakovlev Yak-42 airliner due to design flaws resulted in the crash of Aeroflot Flight 8641 in 1982. A similar failure on a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, resulting {{from a lack of}} grease, brought down Alaska Airlines Flight 261 in 2000. In 2013, National Airlines Flight 102 crashed {{as a result of a}} MRAP armoured vehicle breaking loose and breaking through the rear bulkhead, severing hydraulics lines and most importantly, destroying the <b>jackscrew,</b> rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. Investigators found that had the <b>jackscrew</b> not been destroyed, the 747-400F may have been able to perform a successful landing at Bagram Airfield.|$|E
50|$|Elevating a whole {{structure}} is typically done by attaching a temporary steel framework under the structure {{to support the}} structure. A network of hydraulic jacks is placed under the framework and controlled by a unified jacking system, elevates the structure off the foundation.

5000|$|The {{investigation}} {{then proceeded}} to examine why scheduled maintenance had failed to adequately lubricate the <b>jackscrew</b> assembly.

This and other evidence suggested to the NTSB that [...] "the SFO mechanic who was responsible for lubricating the <b>jackscrew</b> assembly in September 1999 did not adequately perform the task". Laboratory tests indicated that the excessive wear of <b>jackscrew</b> assembly could not have accumulated in just the four-month period between the September 1999 maintenance and the accident flight. Therefore, the NTSB concluded that [...] "more than just the last lubrication was missed or inadequately performed".|$|E
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board determined that inadequate maintenance led to excessive wear and eventual failure of a critical flight control system during flight. The probable cause was stated to be [...] "a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system <b>jackscrew</b> assembly's acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the <b>jackscrew</b> assembly".|$|E

50|$|An {{advantage}} of <b>jackscrews</b> over some {{other types of}} jack {{is that they are}} self-locking, which means when the rotational force on the screw is removed, it will remain motionless where it was left and will not rotate backwards, regardless of how much load it is supporting. This makes them inherently safer than hydraulic jacks, for example, which will move backwards under load if the force on the hydraulic actuator is accidentally released.|$|R
