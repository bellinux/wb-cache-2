5|$|The ruling {{clears the}} way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which will be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E

In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E

5|$|Society {{became more}} liberal (as seen, for instance, in the {{achievements}} of the Polish Film School and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a civil society started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomułka's thaw would be long over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent would end up removing Gomułka from power in 1970ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> themselves.|$|E
5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E

5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E

Poirot agrees with the decision, and he departs to prepare his report to the Yugoslavian police, even though he admits he will struggle with his conscience.

His successors lacked direction from Cairo and feared the political turmoil that had engulfed Egypt. As a result, they failed to continue the policies Gordon had put in place. The illegal slave trade revived, although not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> the merchants whom Gordon had put out of business. The Sudanese army suffered {{from a lack of}} resources, and unemployed soldiers from disbanded units troubled garrison towns. Tax collectors arbitrarily increased taxation.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. Quantum mechanics requires the energy to be large as Paul Dirac claimed it is, like a sea of energy. Other scientists specializing in General Relativity require the energy to be small enough for curvature of space to agree with observed astronomy. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows the energy to be as large as needed to promote quantum actions {{for a brief moment}} of time, even if the average energy is small <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> relativity and flat space. To cope with disagreements, the vacuum energy is described as a virtual energy potential of positive and negative energy.|$|E
25|$|Watering: Different {{species of}} tree have roots with {{different}} tolerances for soil moisture. Some species tolerate continual wetness, {{while others are}} prone to rotting if the soil remains wet for long periods. A standard bonsai practice is to grow trees in a soil mixture that drains rapidly, so that roots {{are not allowed to}} be wet for long. To compensate for the relatively low water retention of the bonsai soil, water is applied frequently. The tree absorbs sufficient moisture for its needs while the water is passing through the soil, then the soil dries enough to reduce the chance of rotting. It is the grower's responsibility to ensure that watering occurs frequently <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> the bonsai with high watering requirements, while not waterlogging trees that use little water or have roots prone to rotting.|$|E

25|$|Reserve auction is {{an auction}} where the item for sale {{may not be}} sold if the final bid is not high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> the seller; that is, the seller {{reserves}} the right to accept or reject the highest bid. In these cases a set 'reserve' price known to the auctioneer, but not necessarily to the bidders, may have been set, below which the item may not be sold. The reserve price may be fixed or discretionary. In the latter case, the decision to accept a bid is deferred to the auctioneer, who may accept a bid that is marginally below it. A reserve auction is safer for the seller than a no-reserve auction as they {{are not required to}} accept a low bid, but this could result in a lower final price if less interest is generated in the sale.|$|E

During the interview, Yakovlev admitted that the secret protocols were genuine. He condemned the protocols, but maintained that they had no impact on the incorporation of the Baltic states. Thus Moscow reversed its long-standing position that the secret protocols did not exist or were forgeries, but did not concede that events of 1940 constituted an occupation. It was clearly not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> the Baltics and on 22 August, a commission of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR announced that the occupation in 1940 was {{a direct result of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and therefore illegal. It was the first time that an official Soviet body challenged the legitimacy of the Soviet rule.|$|E
25|$|Solon's {{economic}} reforms {{need to be}} understood {{in the context of}} the primitive, subsistence economy that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship and yet there is no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th Century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in 'good years'.|$|E
