Height and spacing of <b>glare</b> <b>screen</b> barrier block are important parameters in highway design, since vehicles of different driver eye heights with different head light heights are plying on highways. Selection of spacing of glare block is a complex problem. A model has been proposed to determine optimum spacing of glare block for horizontal alignment. Glare block can be placed perpendicular to the road or inclined by a certain angle to obtain optimum cost. It is found that spacing is optimal when the sum of inclination angle(x) and degree of curvature (θ) is 70 º; i. e., x+ θ = 70 °...|$|E

30|$|While screens {{of mobile}} devices are not {{suitable}} for the primary interpretation of projectional radiographs or mammography, screen resolution, luminance and pixel size of these devices are sufficient for a technically adequate display of computed tomography (CT) examinations. Several {{studies have shown that}} interpretation of CT examinations on tablets with high-quality screens is possible [3 – 5], but this is still not recommended for primary interpretation, since there are potentially limiting factors [1, 6]. The touch screen of mobile devices must be clean to ensure visibility of all relevant details, which is difficult to ensure while commanding or manipulating the device with the tips of the fingers [7]. While control of environmental light is easy to obtain with stationary screens of radiological workstations, it is impossible to ensure this control for mobile devices. This is especially relevant since mobile devices usually have <b>glaring</b> <b>screens</b> with reflections more prominent than with workstation screens. Thus, it is only under optimal conditions that tablet screens are suitable for interpretation of CT examinations [8, 9].|$|R

The phones can't make calls, but are used to see other soldiers’ positions, mark IED and enemy troop positions, and even text each other. The smartphone used was the Motorola Atrix, which helped users due to their familiarity with commercial devices. Army leaders exclusively run the phones on the Android operating system because of its open architecture. The Army plans to field 600 Nett Warrior systems in each Infantry Brigade Combat Team to be worn by squad leaders. This will give squads access to Blue Force Tracking and connect them to the Tactical Ground Reporting (TIGR) system to report what they see in the field, like enemy positions, biometrics, and weapons caches.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 31 st Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2012 "Getting Southern Africa to Work", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Trees are planted or allowed to grow in road reserves for reasons such as aesthetics, <b>glare</b> <b>screens,</b> control of marginal access or median crossings and shade for rest areas. International research {{on the role of}} trees in road safety confirms that trees do pose a risk and positive policies to manage trees must be formulated and executed. South African provincial road authorities do not have comprehensive policies on trees. Some have policies with respect to the landscaping of road reserves, including planting of trees, at developments along the road. The road reserve must be managed to provide reasonable safety where vehicles run-off the road or hit objects on the roadway. This is in line with the philosophy of a forgiving highway. Some aspects of the management of highway trees are presented from international research. Trees must be classified with respect to factors including the distance from the road edge and possibility of falling on the road. A methodology to assess risk and manage trees is proposed. It is advised that road authorities adopt policies with respect to trees and develop strategies and procedures to manage trees to insure road safety, by maintaining clear zones (recovery areas) free of trees.

5000|$|Generally speaking, {{when people}} are working on {{computers}} their eyes move from the screen, to the background and to adjacent visual attractions. Each time the eye moves, it adjusts to the new lighting level. If the degree of adaptation between visual tasks is too great, eye strain, fatigue and stress result. Similarly, a significant cause of eye strain for computer users is reflected light from poorly placed light fixtures on glass <b>screens.</b> <b>Glare</b> and brightness ratios provide guidelines for lighting schemes within libraries to minimise eye strain.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} factors in verifying {{the way in which}} {{internal}} environments and buildings are qualified by people is daylight. The role of daylight in day to day basis and the fact of providing internal space quality make it that important. This {{is one of the reasons}} behind the constant need to integrate daylight into architecture, apart from high cost of fossil fuels or temporary electricity sources. Besides being one of the most efficient sources of energy, not to mention the fact that it’s completely free, there are other important aspects that should not be overlooked before entering the building. Generally, it is considered a pleasure to have daylight inside the building unless it distracts the occupants from accomplishing their daily tasks such as <b>glare</b> from computer <b>screens</b> as this can reduce productivity of offices and creates eye strain. Replacing artificial lighting with natural daylighting can be the best solution in terms of carbon footprint reduction and cutting costs to a minimum. It is essential to make sure that improper natural lighting or poor control doesn’t give overheating or glare discomfort...|$|R

40|$|Anti-reflective {{coatings}} {{are applied}} to substrates to increase the transmittance {{of light in the}} visible range of wavelength 400 – 800 nm through the substrate by changing the refractive index at the surface and directing more light through the substrate rather than being reflected away. This project investigated the possibility of applying a coating made from silica nanoparticles through an inkjet printer as opposed to dip-coating and spin-coating methods that are already used. Applying the coating from a printer will enable the ability to print directly onto items with various shapes like a phone screen and eye glasses and reduce <b>glare</b> on the <b>screen</b> or lens. A uniform coating onto glass and silicon wafer substrates was achievable. Experiments showed that print coating of solid and hollow silica films could increase the transmittance of light by 3 % or more. The silica coating had moderate mechanical resistance that is a point for further improvement. The process of print coating the silica nanoparticles had a tendency to clog ink cartridges but cautious care eventually showed that this complication was avoidable.

40|$|Long {{hours of}} {{computer}} {{work in the}} modern workplace are associated with visual and musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders, which are recognized by the World Health Organization as major occupational health concerns. The rising age of the workforce imposes new challenges in office ergonomics due to the changes in vision and musculoskeletal characteristics of these computer users. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of oculomotor demands on the most common complaints associated with prolonged computer use, blurred vision, eyestrain, and irritation of the eyes, a within-subject design laboratory study with 17 young subjects was conducted. Subjective ratings of symptoms and objective static and dynamic accommodation and convergence responses were recorded during and after a 2 -hour visually demanding computer task. Each subject repeated the task over 6 days using different combinations of natural and optically-modified oculomotor demands. While there was little effect of viewing distance on symptoms, an elevated static accommodation response and a reduced dynamic divergence response were found for the natural near viewing distance condition (33 cm) compared to the far viewing distance (100 cm). Optical manipulation had no effect at the far viewing distance (100 cm), whereas artificially decreasing the accommodation demand at the near viewing distance increased eyestrain. Divergence limits {{was identified as a}} factor for predicting the symptom of eyestrain. A second within-subject, full-factorial design laboratory study with 19 young and 7 older, presbyopic subjects investigated the effects of age, font size, and reflective glare on productivity, upper body posture, and visual and upper body discomfort, in a setting where the subjects could freely adjust their posture and chair position while performing visually demanding tasks on a computer. Compared to the larger font size, the smaller fonts had significant negative effects on all outcome measures: productivity (speed and accuracy) was lower, visual and neck symptoms were higher, and viewing distance was decreased. The reduced viewing distance was primarily due to forward torso flexion (78 %), followed by moving the chair forward (4 %) and forward head movement (3 %). <b>Screen</b> <b>glare</b> induced non-neutral upper body postures, including neck flexion, torso forward flexion, and head movement to the side. There was little effect of age and presbyopia on the study findings. In summary, the first study demonstrated no difference in visual symptoms when viewing a computer monitor for 2 hours at 33 vs. 100 cm distance. However, there was some evidence of persistent oculomotor effects at the 33 cm distance. The second study demonstrated the benefits of a larger font size and eliminating <b>screen</b> <b>glare</b> on productivity, upper body postures, and symptoms when performing visually intensive tasks. The benefits were similarly experienced by both the younger and older computer users. The non-neutral, forward leaning postures, observed in many computer users, are likely due to font sizes that are small relative to visual acuity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The ergonomically ideal {{computer}} lab for {{the enhancement of}} learner security Ergonomics is the discipline which focuses {{on the impact of}} human needs and capabilities on the design of technological systems for the purpose of promoting harmonious cooperation between humankind and technology. In computer studies, it studies the interaction between pupils and the computer environment in order to promote learner well-being. The future health and learning opportunities of learners are at risk if computer skills are not mastered in a safe and healthy environment. Risks associated with computers have increased because of the increased time young people spend with their computers both at school and for recreation. The use of computers as teaching aids has also increased. The {{purpose of this article is}} to report on research that was conducted in {{computer lab}}s in high schools in South Africa about the establishment of an ideal ergonomic environment in order to assure optimal learner security in the computer labs. Caring supervision is a prerequisite for optimal teaching and learning. Security expresses itself in a classroom environment in terms of pedagogical outcomes as well as the physical security and well-being of the pupil. The provision of security in the computer lab is not restricted to the present; it is also prospective in that it is aimed at the future security and health of the pupils. A computer environment that does not comply with ergonomic norms could harbour a number of health risks for students, including muscular-skeletal injuries due to an incorrect posture, also headaches caused by conditions such as a <b>glaring</b> <b>screen</b> or insufficient lighting. Pupils could also become victims of safety hazards such as electrical shorts and fires caused by electric cables lying on the floor, and faulty appliances. There are a number of guidelines available with respect to the design of a computer lab, amongst others concerning equipment and furniture, the support of wrists, the use of the mouse, keyboard, non-reflecting screens, the height of the screen, the adjustability of apparatus, lighting, a good view of the projector screen and white board, the document stand, and the size of the computer stand. An empirical survey was done to establish to what degree computer labs indeed complied with the guidelines and general expectations. A qualitative interpretivistic design was used. The study population (n= 8) consisted of all the Computer Application Technology teachers of high schools in one of the regions of the North-West Province of South Africa. Observations were recorded in all 8 of the schools. Use was made of an observation schedule. In addition to this, several photos were taken to confirm what had been observed. The observations were further confirmed by means of interviews with the teachers based on semi-structured questions. Categories of responses and observations were created on the basis of coding. The same was done with respect to the obstacles encountered by the respondents to change their computer rooms into ergonomically safe places. It was found that none of the computer science labs visited fully complied with the guidelines as stipulated above. Some of them had uneven floors, in others papers were lying around and cables ran over the floors creating electrical hazards, none had wrist support for using the mouse or the keyboard, only three had mouse pads but room to use the mouse was limited, no computer screens were adjustable, most computer stands were too small to place a book onto it, no desk could be adjusted, only two labs had document stands but they were incorrectly placed with respect to the rest of the apparatus, there were no upholstered chairs, no chair provided lower back support, none had footrests, and most did not provide for the addition of such a rest. In most rooms the lighting was inadequate or reflected from the screens, in some it was difficult to see on the data projector screen because of the lighting, the artificial lighting in one room was poor, and in no room any ergonomic awareness posters appeared on the walls. Most computer labs fortunately had recently serviced fire distinguishers. Teachers identified the following as obstacles to overcome before their labs would be ergonomically up to the required standard: ignorance on the part of the teachers, absence of guidelines with respect to safety and health, a shortage of money and the attitudes of all involved. They also had to contend with the possibility of fire and other health hazards such as uneven floors and untidy rooms. In addition to this, they were not aware of their liability due to neglect, and of the fact that the computer labs were actually contributing to the insecurity of their learners in terms of health problems. Teachers, schools and departments of education should take a number of urgent steps, the most simple of which is to resort to creative methods such as using pillows on chairs and books under screens. Schools should immediately draft safety and health guidelines for computer labs, and the ergonomic design of such rooms should enjoy high priority from departments of education. Teachers and principals should also not only be made aware of the need for ergonomically welldesigned classrooms, but should indeed receive in-service training in this regard. OPSOMMING Indien rekenaarlokale in skole nie aan die eise van ergonomiese geborgenheid voldoen nie, kan dit tot groot nadeel strek vir almal wat daarby betrokke is. Vir die leerders kan dit algemene gesondheidsrisko’s soos skeletale afwykings, hoofpyn en sigprobleme inhou, wat dikwels eers in die leerders se volwasse jare begin realiseer. Daarbenewens kan hierdie gesondheidsprobleme wat uit sulke swak ontwerpte lokale voortspruit, tot gevoelens van onsekerheid en niegeborgenheid by die leerlinge aanleiding gee. Vir die betrokke onderwysers en die skool as sorgsame toesighouers van die leerders, kan ’n verwyt van nalatigheid en die moontlikheid van aanspreeklikheid vir skadevergoeding ontstaan. In ŉ kwalitatiewe interpretivistiese studie by al die hoërskole met rekenaarlokale in een bepaalde streek in die Noordwes-provinsie, het dit aan die lig gekom dat nie een van hulle ergonomies korrek ontwerp en bestuur is nie. Voorstelle word gemaak vir die dringende regstelling van hierdie probleem. Die eerste stap is om goedkoop en voor die hand liggende maatreëls toe te pas, deur byvoorbeeld net ŉ kussing op ŉ stoel te plaas, die rekenaarskerm op ŉ paar ou boeke te plaas om dit op te lig, kabels en alle papier wat op die vloer lê en ’n brandgevaar kan veroorsaak, te verwyder. Van die ander aanbevelings wat gemaak word, behels groter betrokkenheid vanaf die kant van die provinsiale onderwysdepartement, meer fondse vir die korrekte inrigting van lokale en groter bewusmaking by onderwysers, skoolhoofde en leerders.

While interrogating Aadhithya, Vikram's best friend Prasad (Nagendra Prasad) is killed by Aadhithya, who switched souls into a police officer Sathya (Varun). When Vikram gets tempted and goes to shoot Aadhithya, Aadhithya switches souls again and now takes the role of Vikram and masks the killing of Vikram's best friend by saying that they both had personal vengeance. After coming to Vikram's home, Aadhithya (in Vikram's body) comes across Vikram's fiancee Mahalakshmi (Hansika Motwani). When Vikram (in Aditya's body) is surprised to find himself imprisoned, he explains that he is not Adithya to the police officer who killed Vikram's best friend and escapes from the prison. After escaping from the prison, Vikram calls the commissioner of the police and tells the mishap of events that occurred. Aadhithya overhears their conversation and kills the commissioner. Aadhithya says that he has a confession video which says that he blamed Aadhithya (Vikram in his body) for saving his father. At the same time, Vikram (Aadhithya) unlocks Vikram's (himself) police data and takes the video evidence of his father robbing the bank (Aadhithya in his father's body) and threatens to reveal it to the public, but Vikram does not get scared and contacts Chezhiyan (Nassar) (Aditya's head in archaeology where he gets the manuscript which gives him his power), and Chezhiyan thinks that he is being cheated and goes to Aadhithya (Vikram's body), but Aadhithya reveals himself to be in Vikram's body, and makes Chezhiyan his bait to catch Vikram while in the complex where Vikram was supposed to meet Chezhiyan. When Aadhithya was tracking Chezhiyan, Vikram hides and talks to Chezhiyan who says that Aadhithya's power is only in his body (in which Vikram is) and in other bodies, his power doesn't work, so Vikram uses Chezhiyan to take the manuscript from the commissioner's office. Aadhithya tracks Chezhiyan's phone, and finds and kills him. Vikram (in Aadhithya's body) goes there and puts a bomb on himself so that Aadhithya may get scared that if his body goes away, he won't be able to use his powers. Aadhithya and Vikram go to their original bodies and Aadhithya forces Vikram to unlock his bomb but Vikram knocks out Aadhithya and while taking him to arrest, Aadhithya goes to Vikram's father's (Aadukalam Naren) soul and beats Vikram; after that Aadhithya goes to Maha's soul and stabs Vikram and threatens to kill Maha if he does not remove his bomb, and so Vikram defuses the bomb, and Aadhithya drives off with Maha. Vikram chases them and ends up in a coast where the duos fight until Vikram gets the upperhand and knocks Aadhithya out, and returns with his wife to home. In the end Aadhithya wakes up again and <b>glares</b> into the <b>screen</b> which goes off with the title [...] "Bogan 2 to be continued".|$|R
