40|$|Earlier this week, the United States Supreme Court upheld, by a 5 - 4 vote, the states’ {{ability to}} execute {{death row inmates}} with a three-drug lethal {{injection}} cocktail that critics argue causes excruciating pain. The Court reasoned that states {{should be allowed to}} use the drug in question, despite its involvement <b>in</b> several botched <b>executions,</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because states can no longer attain more effective alternatives. In the majority opinion, the justices spin an erroneous tale about “anti-death-penalty advocates” pressuring pharmaceutical companies into refusing to supply other, more humane drugs to the states for use in capital punishment. This alleged radical activism on behalf of the “abolitionists” engendered great sympathy from the Court for the poor, blameless states who are just trying to execute people, but can’t because of all the pseudo-“guerrilla warfare” (as Justice Samuel Alito referred to it at oral argument) against capital punishment. This case thus raises the novel question of whether third parties should have the power to thwart—through behind-the-scenes maneuvering—a practice the Supreme Court has declared constitutional. And, more tellingly, whether the Court will show the same concern for others whose rights are also being obstructed by the stealth tactics of radical activists...|$|R

How this is altered by chronic dopamine depletion, such as in Parkinson’s disease, is not presently understood. We now report that, in dopamine-depleted slices of the striatum, MSNs generate giant spontaneous postsynaptic GABAergic currents (single or in bursts at 60 Hz) interspersed with silent episodes, rather than the continuous, low-frequency GABAergic drive (5 Hz) observed in control MSNs. This shift was observed in one-half of the MSN population, including both “D 1 -negative ” and “D 1 -positive” MSNs. Single GABA and NMDA channel recordings revealed that the resting membrane potential and reversal potential of GABA were similarincontrolanddopamine-depletedMSNs,and depolarizing,butnotexcitatory,actionsofGABAwereobserved. Glutamatergicand cholinergic antagonists did not block the GABAergic oscillations, suggesting that they were generated by GABAergic neurons. In support of this, cell-attached recordings revealed that a subpopulation of intrastriatal GABAergic interneurons generated bursts of spikes in dopamine-deprived conditions. This subpopulation included low-threshold spike interneurons but not fast-spiking interneurons, cholinergic interneurons, or MSNs. Therefore, a population of local GABAergic interneurons shifts from tonic to oscillatory mode when dopamine deprived and gives rise to spontaneous repetitive giant GABAergic currents in one-half the MSNs. We suggest that this may in turn alter integration of cortical signals by MSNs...|$|R
