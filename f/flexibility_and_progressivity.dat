40|$|Should the {{generosity}} of unemployment benefits <b>and</b> the <b>progressivity</b> of income taxes de- pend {{on the presence of}} business cycles? This paper proposes a tractable model where there is a role for social insurance against uninsurable shocks to income and unemployment, as well as inefficient business cycles driven by aggregate shocks through matching frictions and nominal rigidities. We derive an augmented Baily-Chetty formula showing that the optimal generosity <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> depend on a macroeconomic stabilization term. Using a series of analytical examples, we show that this term typically pushes for an increase in generosity <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> as long as slack is more responsive to social programs in recessions. A calibration to the U. S. economy shows that taking concerns for macroeconomic stabilization into account raises the optimal unemployment benefits replacement rate by 13 percentage points but has a negligible impact on the optimal progressivity of the income tax. More generally, the role of social insurance programs as automatic stabilizers affects their optimal design...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{influence}} {{of different types}} of nominal rate of personal income tax on the progressivity of effective taxation {{of different types of}} taxpayers in the member states of the European Union. The thesis is conceived for the year 2012. The first part of the thesis presents views of the economists on the progressivity of taxation. Next part contains a summary of scholarly literature that deals with effective taxation, tax <b>progressivity</b> <b>and</b> influence of individual elements of a personal income tax system on the effective taxation. The own work deals at first with research of effective taxation <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> of effective taxation in selected individual states of the European Union, which are: the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Austria.

40|$|The {{effect of}} taxes and {{benefits}} {{on the poor}} is usually measured using standard poverty and inequality indicators, stochastic dominance tests, <b>and</b> measures of <b>progressivity</b> <b>and</b> horizontal inequity. However, these measures can fail to capture an important aspect: {{that some of the}} poor are made poorer (or some of the non-poor made poor) by the tax-benefit system. We call this impoverishment and formally establish the relationships between impoverishment, stochastic dominance tests, horizontal inequity, <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> measures. The directional mobility literature provides a useful framework to measure impoverishment. We propose using a transition matrix and income loss matrix, and establish a mobility dominance criterion to compare alternate tax-benefit systems. We illustrate with data from Brazil...|$|R

Data quality and sample selection issues are highlighted, especially in the coverage of rural-urban migrants. Simple income-based profiles of incidence are matched to several influences that confound and complicate the measurement of progressivity. The issue of the informal economy is highlighted through analysis of both the extent of private inter-household transfers and remittances and their relationship with state transfers, and in the informal charges that accompany uptake of state services and other petty corruption. Second, the issue of user-charges for health and education services is considered, as a considerable portion of state transfers {{are related to the}} take up of schooling and health care. Third, the issue of behavioral effects is also considered, concentrating on private interhousehold transfers.

40|$|Dartmouth. The {{content of}} this paper is solely the {{responsibility}} of the authors. Many states are under court-order to reduce local disparities in education spending. While a substantial body of literature suggests that these orders and the resulting school finance equalizations have increased the level <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> of state education spending, there is little evidence on the broader effects of such measures on the change in total resources available not only for schools, but for other local government programs as well. When states spend more on education, both state and local budget constraints change. We find that while mandated school finance equalizations increase both the level <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> of state spending on education, states finance the required increase in education spending in part by reducing their aid to localities for other programs. Local governments, in turn, respond to the increases in state taxation and spending by reducing both their own revenue-raising and their own spending on education and on other programs. Thus, while state education aid does increase total spending on education, it does so at the expense of drawing resources away from spending on programs like public welfare, highways, and hospitals. These findings provide insight into the effectiveness o...|$|R

40|$|A microeconomic {{theoretical}} model shows that two factors - the compensation <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> effects - produce the shifting (if any) of tax rates on wage formation. From an analytical viewpoint, {{they may be}} positive or negative and of equal or different sign. A microfounded nested macroeconomic wage equation is then tested for nine European countries for the period 1960 - 88. Three robust regularities seem to emerge from our econometric results. First, in general, small open economies such as Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands have negligible compensation <b>and</b> <b>progressivity</b> effects: to maintain their external competitiveness they fix a real labour cost target independent of tax rates. Second, larger and less open European economies, in contrast, transfer indirect and social security tax rate increases on the real labour cost in the long run, except Italy and the UK; in these greater economies, {{a rise in the}} direct tax rate raises the steady-state gross real wage, both where the compensation <b>and</b> the <b>progressivity</b> effects move in opposite directions (as in France, Germany and Sweden), and a fortiori where (in Italy and the UK) the compensation effect is approximately zero, like in very open economies, but the progressivity effect is positive. Third, all European countries show a weakening of tax shifting on the real labour cost between the end of the 1970 s {{and the beginning of the}} 1980 s. This changing attitude on the part of unions usually runs parallel to the introduction of de facto fiscal indexation and a reduction in tax progressivity, which increasingly leads to the fixing of the steady-state wage rate so as to safeguard the country's external competitiveness.

This is a remarkable achievement since greater redistribution has been attained through significantly lower tax revenue.
