The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify differences between unintentional and intentional exposures and to evaluate the utility of <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> as a deterrent. Using the National Poison Data System, we performed a retrospective analysis of reported cases of ethylene glycol exposures from January 2006 to December 2013. Outcome classification was summed for intentionality and used as a basis for comparison of effect groups. There were 45, 097 cases of ethylene glycol exposures resulting in 154 deaths. Individuals more likely to experience major effects or death were older, male, and presented with more severe symptoms requiring higher levels of care. Latitude and season did not correlate with increased exposures; however, there were more exposures in rural areas. <b>Denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> use appeared to have no effect on exposure severity or number. Deaths due to ethylene glycol exposure were uncommon; however, there were major clinical effects and more exposures in rural areas.

40|$|In {{the attempt}} to gain more {{information}} on the mechanisms underlying bitter and/or sweet taste reception, we have investigated the responses of labellar chemosensilla in the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae to Na-saccharin, as compared to sweet stimuli (sucrose or fructose) and bitter stimuli (<b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> or amiloride). Electrophysiological and behavioral results indicate that the sweetener Na-saccharin inhibits the "sugar" cell in the labellar taste sensilla of the blowfly P. terraenovae. In multichoice preference tests, flies ingested more of the solutions containing sugar to those with sugar +Na-saccharin. This finding is in good agreement with the spike frequency reduction observed for the "sugar" cell activity. Analysis of the spike discharges also shows a positive dose-response for the "deterrent" cell following stimulation with Na-saccharin and <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate.</b> Flies drank any of the Na-saccharin solutions, regardless of their concentration, less than water, thus indicating a weak deterring effect on water drinking.

Cross adaptation was found to occur between responses to Na-saccharin and <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> or amiloride regardless of the order of adapting stimuli. In the case of sweet stimuli, cross adaptation occurred when the adapting stimulus was Na-saccharin, but it did not when the adapting stimuli were sucrose or fructose.

40|$|To {{discourage}} consumption, ethanol {{is often}} denatured using both volatile (e. g., {{methyl ethyl ketone}} and isopropanol) and nonvolatile (e. g., <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate)</b> chemical substances. As a result, the analysis of denatured ethanol samples is usually performed by multiple techniques such as gas chromatography for the volatile denaturants and liquid chromatography for the nonvolatile ones. However, the need for multiple techniques increases the cost of analysis and forms a severe obstruction for on-site product control. Using the full evaporation technique combined with gas chromatography and flame ionization detection, only one analytical methodology has to be used here to determine both volatile and nonvolatile denaturants in denatured ethanol. <b>Denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> is determined as benzyl chloride following an in-vial reaction.

40|$|Variation {{exists in}} the {{sensitivity}} of individual rodents and humans to different bitter tastants. An absence of uniform correlation in responsiveness to different bitter substances across individuals within a species suggests heterogeneity in the mechanisms underlying stimulus processing within this taste modality. Here, we examined taste responsiveness of individual rats to three bitter compounds (quinine hydrochloride, <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate,</b> and cycloheximide) in short-term lick tests to determine the magnitude of covariation among responses to these stimuli and infer commonalities in their receptor and neural mechanisms. Ratswere testedwith a given pair of bitter stimuli during three sessions comprising randomized trial blocks of six concentrations of each stimulus + deionized water. Psychophysical functions were generated for individual rats for respective stimulus pairs, and concentrations of each stimulus that produced equivalent lick suppression relative to water were correlated across animals. Behavioral taste responsiveness to quinine hydrochloride strongly covaried with responsiveness to <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> (r = + 0. 82). Lick responsiveness to quinine was less robustly correlated with that to cycloheximide (r = + 0. 44), and denatonium and cycloheximide responses failed to correlate.

40|$|Novel {{chemical}} entities (NCEs) may {{be investigated}} for emetic liability {{in a range}} of unpleasant experiments involving retching, vomiting or conditioned taste aversion/food avoidance in sentient animals. We have used a range of compounds with known emetic /aversive properties to examine the possibility of using the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, for research into identifying and understanding emetic liability, and hence reduce adverse animal experimentation in this area. Twenty eight emetic or taste aversive compounds were employed to investigate the acute (10 min) effect of compounds on Dictyostelium cell behaviour (shape, speed and direction of movement) in a shallow chemotaxic gradient (Dunn chamber). Compound concentrations were chosen based on those previously reported to be emetic or aversive in in vivo studies and results were recorded and quantified by automated image analysis. Dictyostelium cell motility was rapidly and strongly inhibited by four structurally distinct tastants (three bitter tasting compounds - <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate,</b> quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiourea, and the pungent constituent of chilli peppers - capsaicin). In addition, stomach irritants (copper chloride and copper sulphate), and a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor also rapidly blocked movement. A concentration-dependant relationship was established for five of these compounds, showing potency of inhibition as capsaicin (IC 50 â€Š=â€Š 11. 9 Â± 4. 0 ÂµM) > quinine hydrochloride (IC 50 â€Š=â€Š 44. 3 Â± 6. 8 ÂµM) > <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> (IC 50 â€Š=â€Š 129 Â± 4 ÂµM) > phenylthiourea (IC 50 â€Š=â€Š 366 Â± 5 ÂµM) > copper sulphate (IC 50 â€Š=â€Š 1433 Â± 3 ÂµM). In contrast, 21 compounds within the cytotoxic and receptor agonist/antagonist classes did not affect cell behaviour. Further analysis of bitter and pungent compounds showed that the effect on cell behaviour was reversible and not cytotoxic, suggesting an uncharacterised molecular mechanism of action for these compounds. These results therefore demonstrate that Dictyostelium has potential as a non-sentient model in the analysis of the molecular effects of tastants, although it has limited utility in identification of emetic agents in general...|$|E

40|$|This article {{consists}} of two experiments reporting conditioned flavor avoidance (or taste aversion) in laboratory rats that swam in the flavored water. A statistically reliable effect was demonstrated in Experiment 1 by using a simple conditioning procedure with sweet (sodium saccharin) water. Compared with control rats that had no swimming experience or those that swam in tap water, experimental rats showed avoidance of the sweet water in the choice test between it and tap water, if they had swum in the sweet water for 20 min over four days. Rinsing the rats off with tap water after the swimming {{had no effect on}} this flavor avoidance learning. This finding suggests that tasting the sweet water during swimming was critical. Experiment 2 confirmed the flavor avoidance learning in swimming rats by a differential conditioning procedure with sour (citric acid) and bitter (<b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate)</b> solutions.

Eight bitter stimuli were employed: <b>denatonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> (DB), quinine-HCl (QHCl), sucrose octaacetate (SOA), urea, L-tryptophan (L-trp), L-phenylalanine (L-phe), ranitidine-HCl, and Tetralone. The first experiment constructed individual psychophysical curves for each subject (n = 19) for each compound to account for individual differences in sensitivities when presenting bitter compounds in experiment 2. Correlation analysis revealed two groupings of bitter compounds at low intensity (1, L-trp, L-phe, and ranitidine; 2, SOA and QHCl), but the correlations within each group decreased as the perceived intensity increased. In experiment 2, intensity ratings and two-alternative forced-choice discrimination tasks showed that bitter compounds generally combine additively in mixture and do not show interactions with a few specific exceptions.
