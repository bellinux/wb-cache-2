We measured the concentration of these <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the different compartments of P. oceanica (leaves, rhizomes, roots and epibiota) in a non-polluted seagrass meadow representative of the Mediterranean and calculated the annual budget from a mass balance. We provide novel data on accumulation dynamics of many <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in P. oceanica compartments and demonstrate that <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> accumulation patterns are mainly determined by plant compartment rather than by temporal variability.

40|$|AbstractPhytoextraction {{makes use}} of trace element-accumulating plants that {{concentrate}} the pollutants in their tissues. Pollutants can be then removed by harvesting plants. The success of phytoextraction depends on <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> availability to the roots {{and the ability of}} the plant to intercept, take up, and accumulate <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in shoots. Current phytoextraction practises either employ hyperaccumulators or fast-growing high biomass plants; the phytoextraction process may be enhanced by soil amendments that increase <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> availability in the soil. This review will focus on the role of plant-associated bacteria to enhance <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> availability in the rhizosphere. We report on the kind of bacteria typically found in association with <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> – tolerating or – accumulating plants and discuss how they can contribute to improve <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> uptake by plants and thus the efficiency and rate of phytoextraction. This enhanced <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> uptake can be attributed to a microbial modification of the absorptive properties of the roots such as increasing the root length and surface area and numbers of root hairs, or by increasing the plant availability of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the rhizosphere and the subsequent translocation to shoots via beneficial effects on plant growth, <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> complexation and alleviation of phytotoxicity. An analysis of data from literature shows that effects of bacterial inoculation on phytoextraction efficiency are currently inconsistent.

We carried out comparative genomic analyses of copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt (in the form of vitamin B 12), and selenium (in the form of selenocysteine) in 747 sequenced organisms at the following levels: (i) transporters and transport-related proteins, (ii) cofactor biosynthesis traits, and (iii) trace element-dependent proteins. Few organisms were found to utilize all five <b>trace</b> <b>elements,</b> whereas many symbionts, parasites, and yeasts used only one or none of these elements. Investigation of metalloproteomes and selenoproteomes revealed examples of increased utilization of proteins that use copper in land plants, cobalt in Dehalococcoides and Dictyostelium, and selenium in fish and algae, whereas nematodes were found to have great diversity of copper transporters.

40|$|The <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> {{content of}} pyrite has {{received}} much research and {{is important to}} the fields of environmental geochemistry, ore deposit genesis and paleo-ocean reconstructions. Four aspects of the geochemistry of pyrite are investigated in this thesis: 1) the incorporation of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> into pyrite in a modern setting, 2) the variability of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in sedimentary pyrite in ancient marine settings, 3) the use of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in pyrite to interpret palaeo-ocean chemical conditions, and 4) modification of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in sedimentary pyrite associated with later metamorphic and hydrothermal processes. To facilitate these investigations, detailed LA-ICPMS analyses were performed on pyrite from 49 different shale and unconsolidated sediment formations. These include detailed studies of the Derwent and Huon Estuaries that serve as modern high and low metal environments of sedimentary pyrite formation; the Hamersley and Fortescue Basins sediments which provide low metamorphic grade Archean aged examples of sedimentary pyrite; the Kapai Slate which is a high metamorphic grade, hydrothermally overprinted example of Archean aged pyrite and a series of 44 other shale units that are used to create a database of average <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of sedimentary pyrite. The examination of <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> contents of sedimentary pyrite in modern settings is an important component of understanding how <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> are incorporated into pyrite. Recent studies have provided data on the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of pyrite from modern settings with current oceanic <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> contents. However, as the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of the oceans varies throughout geologic time it is important to examine the incorporation of trace metals in pyrite at higher <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> concentrations than present. The Derwent Estuary provides an ideal site to examine the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> uptake by pyrite in a high metal environment. Detailed mineralogical and geochemical analyses demonstrated the degree to which <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> were available to be incorporated into pyrite, and LA-ICPMS analyses show the amount of each element incorporated into the pyrite. The data showed that not only is it important to have significant quantities of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> available to be incorporated but also, if the concentrations of certain <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> available for incorporation are high, they can prevent other <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> from being incorporated into the pyrite. The data have also shown that even though some <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> can be incorporated into pyrite in contaminated estuaries, the amount of pyrite formed, and the amount of the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> within the pyrite, is not sufficient for pyrite to act as a major sink for the contaminants. To demonstrate how <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> contents in sedimentary pyrite have varied according to geologic time, depositional setting and pyrite texture, a data base of pyrite chemistry from 45 different shale units was produced using LA-ICPMS. Some <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> decrease with Earth evolution due to a decrease in Earth degassing and mafic magmatism. However, some elements, such as Mo, increase as a result of enhanced oxygenation that promoted the breakdown of sulfides and contributed additional <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> to the oceans. Depositional setting of the shales in which the pyrite forms, is also an important control on the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of sedimentary pyrite, with high <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> supply-settings having the highest <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content. Pyrite texture differs based on diagenetic history and content of Fe and S present at the time of pyrite formation. Generally coarser grained pyrite forms later in digenesis and finer grained pyrite forms earlier (though fine euhedral pyrite is an exception to this). While no systematic differences were noted across the entire dataset with pyrite texture, in individual samples the early formed pyrite had the highest <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content. The dataset also provides geochemical criteria to characterize sedimentary pyrite and can be used to support inferences made by mineral texture alone. Changes in pyrite from individual basins compared to the averages provided by the dataset {{can also be used to}} explain changes in ocean chemistry syn-pyrite deposition, similarly to how traditional analyses of whole rock are compared to average shale chemistry. The variations in pyrite chemistry, as determined by LA-ICPMS, in the shales from the Hamersley and Fortescue basins, Western Australia, were investigated to provide an alternative method for paleo-ocean reconstructions. Pyrite is a sink for several <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the marine environment and the amount of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> captured by sedimentary pyrite is essentially a record of the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of the ocean and/or sediments at the time of deposition. Therefore, the content of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in pyrite can be used to determine the chemical conditions of the ocean basin at the time of deposition of the sediments. In the Hamersley and Fortescue basins, <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> form cycles that generally increase up-section and then decrease abruptly at the end of each cycle. These cycles are interpreted to be reflective of a series of pulses of atmospheric oxygen which result in the decomposition of continental sulfides and thus an increase of metal flux to the ocean. Periodic drops in <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content reflect influxes of volcanically sourced S and/or Fe (as suggested by positive Δ 33 S shifts) which causes elevated pyrite production and a drawdown of <b>trace</b> <b>elements.</b> Whole rock analyses show similar relationships and support the use of pyrite analyses to determine paleo-oceanic conditions. One of the main benefits of using LA-ICPMS to determine <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of sedimentary pyrite is that it is a selective, in situ technique, unlike traditional bulk sample or sequential extraction techniques. This allows the determination of sedimentary pyrite <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content in areas that have undergone significant (greenschist facies) metamorphism and/or hydrothermal overprint. The Kapai Slate from the St Ives gold district is an ideal area to demonstrate this capacity. The sedimentary pyrite from the Kapai Slate fit all the geochemical criteria developed for sedimentary pyrite. These analyses were used to determine that the Kapai Slate was deposited in an anoxic to euxinic basin with relatively low iron content and biological productivity. The analyses of the pyrite from the Kapai Slate also showed that it is not likely to be a major source of gold for the St Ives gold district, though the contained pyrite is elevated in gold. Preliminary investigations suggest that ratios of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in pyrite may be a potential tool in mineral exploration, but further research is required for pyrite chemistry to be used as a robust technique with confidence. By analyzing pyrite from a number of different settings across geologic time this study has greatly increased the understanding of the controls on the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> contents in pyrite. The analyses of pyrite from the metal enriched Derwent Estuary have demonstrated the effects of high <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> abundance on <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content in pyrite. The data base of <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of pyrite has shown how the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> available for incorporation have varied throughout earth’s history and how that is reflected in the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of pyrite. A more detailed study of how this element content of pyrite varies within individual basins was provided by the Hamersley and Fortescue basin study which also demonstrated how the pyrite data can be used to determine paleo-oceanic conditions. Finally the Kapai Slate analyses provide an example of how metamorphism and hydrothermal over print effect the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> content of sedimentary pyrite and how, using LA-ICPMS, the sedimentary pyrite from these basins can still be used to determine paleo-oceanic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} (OA) is not {{an isolated}} threat, but acts in concert with other impacts on ecosystems and species. Coastal marine invertebrates will have to face the synergistic interactions of OA with other global and local stressors. One local factor, common in coastal environments, is <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> contamination. CO 2 vent sites are extensively studied in the context of OA and are often considered analogous to the oceans in the next few decades. The CO 2 vent found at Levante Bay (Vulcano, NE Sicily, Italy) also releases high concentrations of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> to its surrounding seawater, and is therefore a unique site {{to examine the effects of}} long-term exposure of nearby organisms to high pCO 2 and <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> enrichment in situ. The sea anemone Anemonia viridis is prevalent next to the Vulcano vent and does not show signs of <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> poisoning/stress. The aim of our study was to compare A. viridis <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> profiles and compartmentalization between high pCO 2 and control environments. Rather than examining whole anemone tissue, we analyzed two different body compartments—the pedal disc and the tentacles, and also examined the distribution of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the tentacles between the animal and the symbiotic algae. We found dramatic changes in <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> tissue concentrations between the high pCO 2 /high <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> and control sites, with strong accumulation of iron, lead, copper and cobalt, but decreased concentrations of cadmium, zinc and arsenic proximate to the vent. The pedal disc contained substantially more <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> than the anemone’s tentacles, suggesting the pedal disc may serve as a detoxification/storage site for excess <b>trace</b> <b>elements.</b> Within the tentacles, the various <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> displayed different partitioning patterns between animal tissue and algal symbionts. At both sites iron was found primarily in the algae, whereas cadmium, zinc and arsenic were primarily found in the animal tissue. Our data suggests that A. viridis regulates its internal <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> concentrations by compartmentalization and excretion and that these features contribute to its resilience and potential success at the trace element-rich high pCO 2 vent...|$|R

The effect of CRRT on <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> clearance is poorly characterized. The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the transmembrane clearance of chromium, copper, manganese, selenium and zinc during continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). The transmembrane clearance of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> was assessed prospectively in five critically ill children receiving CVVHDF at the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital. Pre-filter blood and effluent samples were measured for <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> concentrations. Transmembrane clearance of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> was calculated, and daily loss of each <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> was determined. Daily <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> loss via CVVHDF was compared with daily standard supplementation of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in pediatric parenteral nutrition. Five patients (age range 23 months to 15 years) with a body weight range of 10. 5 – 53 kg completed the study. The median transmembrane clearance of chromium, copper, manganese, selenium and zinc during CVVHDF was calculated as 0 ml, 0. 59 ml, 2. 48 ml, 1. 22 ml, and 1. 90 ml, respectively, per 1. 73 m 2 body surface area per minute.

40|$|The {{bioaccumulation}} of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in {{aquatic organisms}} {{can be described}} with a kinetic model that includes linear expressions for uptake and elimination from dissolved and dietary sources. Within this model, <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> trophic transfer is described by four parameters: the weight-specific ingestion rate (IR); the assimilation efficiency (AE); the physiological loss rate constant (k(e)); and the weight-specific growth rate (g). These four parameters define the <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> trophic transfer potential (TTP = IR. AE/[k(e) +g]) which {{is equal to the}} ratio of the steady-state <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> concentration in a consumer due to trophic accumulation to that in its prey. Recent work devoted to the quantification of AE and k(e) for a variety of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in aquatic invertebrates has provided the data needed for comparative studies of <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> trophic transfer among different species and trophic levels and, in at least one group of aquatic consumers (marine bivalves), sensitivity analyses and field tests of kinetic bioaccumulation models. Analysis of the trophic transfer potentials of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> for which data are available in zooplankton, bivalves, and fish, suggests that slight variations in assimilation efficiency or elimination rate constant may determine whether or not some <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> (Cd, Se, and Zn) are biomagnified. A linear, single-compartment model may not be appropriate for fish which, unlike many aquatic invertebrates, have a large mass of tissue in which the concentrations of most <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> are subject to feedback regulation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica on the cycling of a wide set of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> (Ag, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, V and Zn). We measured the concentration of these <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in different compartments of P. oceanica (leaves, rhizomes, roots and epiphytes) in a non-polluted seagrass meadow representative of the Mediterranean and calculated the annual budget from a mass balance. We provide novel data on accumulation dynamics of many <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in P. oceanica compartments and demonstrate that <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> accumulation patterns are mainly determined by plant compartment rather than by temporal variability. Epiphytes were the compartment, which showed the greatest concentrations for most <b>trace</b> <b>elements.</b> Thus, they constitute a key compartment when estimating <b>trace</b> <b>element</b> transfer to higher trophic levels by P. oceanica. <b>Trace</b> <b>element</b> translocation in P. oceanica seemed to be low and acropetal in most cases. Zn, Cd, Sr and Rb were the <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> that showed the highest release rate through decomposition of plant detritus, while Cs, Tl and Bi showed the lowest. P. oceanica acts as a sink of potentially toxic <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> (Ni, Cr, As and Ag), which can be sequestered, decreasing their bioavailability. P. oceanica may have a relevant role in the cycling of <b>trace</b> <b>elements</b> in the Mediterranean.
