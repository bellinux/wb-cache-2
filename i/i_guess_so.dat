6000|$|... "Yuh, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>so,</b> lil sunbeam. And {{before you}} could shoot, I'd crowd your tin liz into the bank, and jam right into it! I may get killed, but you won't even be a grease-spot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's <b>so,</b> too," [...] {{her father}} assented. [...] "'Ta'n't {{so much of}} a muchness as you might think, in that light." [...] He took refuge from the subject in an undirected whistle.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hannah, presently, [...] "there's no use {{sitting up}} all night." [...] She rose and kissed Janet again. [...] "I just can't believe it," [...] she declared, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>so</b> {{if you say}} it is." ...|$|R

It'll take 'em {{at least five}} minutes to get busy after us. They'll use the telephone, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>so</b> look out for snares ahead--and don't take the direct route. Who's this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur Kramenin. I persuaded him {{to come on the}} trip for his health." ...|$|E

The Injuns hev swarmed down on it time and ag'in, but they hev never burned it. Only such men as Colonel Zane, his brother Jack, and Wetzel could hev kept that fort standin' all these bloody years.

6000|$|... "The {{next night}} in we came again, and I {{saw that the}} third lieutenant's plan {{was going to be}} adopted; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>so</b> before; for the sail makers had been at work with two light ropes making a rope ladder, and the ship's smith had got some empty shells on deck, and had made a shift to screw some iron eyes into them for fixing ropes to. The gun was taken out of the pinnace and a little mortar fixed in her, and half a dozen ropes, each a hundred fathoms long, had knots put in them every two feet.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Eli {{rose and}} {{stood with his}} back to the fire. [...] "I didn't think of that," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>so.</b> And when I come to think of it, a Christmas isn't much of a Christmas, anyway, without children." ...|$|R

[...] "And {{from what}} I can gather of her looks I {{calculate}} you favour her--she {{was dark and}} not so very tall--not so tall as you, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>So</b> you're goin'" [...] (he pronounced it very slowly) [...] "you're goin' to be Mr. Ditmar's private stenographer! He's a smart man, Mr. Ditmar, he's a good man, too. All you've {{got to do is}} to behave right by him. He always speaks to me when he passes by the gate.

6000|$|As he {{advanced}} he {{held out}} his hand. [...] "Oh, you're the one that stopped that fellow that day when he was tryin' to scare my children. Well, I thought I should run across you some time." [...] He shook hands with Westover, in token of the gratitude which did not express itself in words. [...] "How are you? Treat you pretty well up at the Durgins'? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>so.</b> The old woman knows how to cook, anyway. Jackson's about the best o' the lot above ground, though I don't know as I know very much against the old man, either. But that boy! I declare I 'most feel like takin' {{the top of his head}} off when he gets at his tricks. Set down." ...|$|E
6000|$|To Upton the tramp in that {{wonderful}} wilderness of glistening white meant {{far more than}} the hunt. As a matter of fact the very thought of killing anything amid such pure surroundings was repugnant to him. To this feeling a big white hare which foolishly sat up to stare at him within fifteen minutes after he had left the cabin undoubtedly owed its life. Slowly the rifle had been raised until the sights rested squarely between the two innocent staring eyes. Then it had been as slowly lowered. [...] "I can't do it, puss. The others will get all we need to eat, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>so</b> suppose you remove your pretty self from the range of temptation," [...] said he, taking a sudden forward step. Thereupon puss promptly acted upon his advice, and so precipitately that Upton laughed aloud. [...] "Merry Christmas!" [...] he shouted as the bounding white form disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes shone, and {{her father}} said: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's <b>so,</b> {{come to think of}} it. She's been like a mother to you, this past year, ha'n't she? And it must have come pootty hard for her, sidin' ag'in' Jeff. But she done it." ...|$|R
5000|$|They argue, and {{the wife}} begins to admit her own guilt in the failing {{marriage}} -- [...] "There's some things you refuse to see; But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> sometimes <b>so</b> do I." [...] She takes account of the family they made together, and sees how much she stands to lose by cheating on the marriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now how in thunder {{did that}} {{get into my}} {{right-hand}} pocket? I always keep it in my vest," [...] he exclaimed; and the matter continued to disturb him after {{they were in the}} automobile. [...] "It's my lucky piece. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> excited at the prospect of seeing you when I dressed this morning I put it into my change. Just see what you do to me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I have lodging here?" [...] {{once more}} I said. He blew a whiff, and, leaning back his head, [...] "You come a piece through Bailey's woods, I s'pose, Acrost a bridge where a big swamp-oak grows? It don't grow, neither; it's ben dead ten year, Nor th' ain't a livin' creetur, fur nor near, Can tell wut killed it; but I some misdoubt 'Twas borers, there's sech heaps on 'em about.

6000|$|... "Sometimes we'd have a {{batch of}} college {{students}} Queer lot. Ignorant? Why, they didn't know the catheads from the main brace. But if you took them for fools you'd get bit, sure. They'd learn more in a month than another man would in a year. We had one, once, in the Mary Ann, that came aboard with gold spectacles on. And besides, he was rigged out from main truck to keelson in the nobbiest clothes that ever saw a fo'castle. He had a chestful, too: cloaks, and broadcloth coats, and velvet vests; everything swell, you know; and didn't the saltwater fix them out for him? I guess not! Well, going to sea, the mate {{told him to go}} aloft and help shake out the foreto'gallants'l. Up he shins to the foretop, with his spectacles on, and in a minute down he comes again, looking insulted. Says the mate, 'What did you come down for?' Says the chap, 'P'r'aps you didn't notice that there ain't any ladders above there.' You see we hadn't any shrouds above the foretop. The men bursted out in a laugh such as I guess you never heard the like of. Next night, which was dark and rainy, the mate ordered this chap to go aloft about something, and I'm dummed if he didn't start up with an umbrella and a lantern! But no matter; he made a mighty good sailor before the voyage was done, and we had to hunt up something else to laugh at. Years afterwards, when I had forgot all about him, I comes into Boston, mate of a ship, and was loafing around town with the second mate, and it so happened that we stepped into the Revere House, thinking maybe we would chance the salt-horse in that big diningroom for a flyer, as the boys say. Some fellows were talking just at our elbow, and one says, 'Yonder's the new governor of Massachusetts--at that table over there with the ladies.' We took a good look my mate and I, for we hadn't either of us ever see a governor before. I looked and looked at that face {{and then all of a}} sudden it popped on me! But didn't give any sign. Says I, 'Mate, I've a notion to go over and shake hands with him.' Says he 'I think I see you doing it, Tom.' Says I, 'Mate I'm a-going to do it.' Says he, 'Oh, yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>so.</b> Maybe you don't want to bet you will, Tom?' Say I, 'I don't mind going a V on it, mate.' Says he 'Put it up.' 'Up she goes,' says I, planking the cash. This surprised him. But he covered it, and says pretty sarcastic, 'Hadn't you better take your grub with the governor and the ladies, Tom?' Says I 'Upon second thoughts, I will.' Says he, 'Well Tom, you aye a dum fool.' Says I, 'Maybe I am maybe I ain't; but the main question is, do you wan to risk two and a half that I won't do it?' 'Make it a V,' says he. 'Done,' says I. I started, him a giggling and slapping his hand on his thigh, he felt so good. I went over there and leaned my knuckle: on the table a minute and looked the governor in the face, and says I, 'Mr. Gardner, don't you know me? He stared, and I stared, and he stared. Then all of a sudden he sings out, 'Tom Bowling, by the holy poker! Ladies, it's old Tom Bowling, that you've heard me talk about--shipmate of mine in the Mary Ann.' He rose up and shook hands with me ever so hearty--I sort of glanced around and took a realizing sense of my mate's saucer eyes--and then says the governor, 'Plant yourself, Tom, plant yourself; you can't cat your anchor again till you've had a feed with me and the ladies!' I planted myself alongside the governor, and canted my eye around toward my mate. Well, sir, his dead-lights were bugged out like tompions; and his mouth stood that wide open that you could have laid a ham in it without him noticing it." ...|$|E

I remember a few years later, my father remarking that Dick Van Dyke was the one of the most talented people he had ever met. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>so...</b> I have a copy of what must be the forerunner of TV Guide, with the program lineups of the stations in Atlanta in early 50's.|$|E
5000|$|Boyd noticed Cale was {{strongly}} leading {{the direction of}} the recording, but that as the songs were reforming, Drake gradually seemed to gain trust in his judgment. During the session he asked the songwriter if he was happy with the direction the songs were taking, and was met with an affirmative [...] "Yeh, yeh, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>so</b> yeh, yeh." [...] Boyd later wrote [...] "Despite Cale's domineering manner, he was very solicitous towards Nick, who seemed to be guardedly enjoying himself: his only choice was to relax and be carried along." [...] Although Boyd is credited with production, he admits his actual contribution was putting the two men in contact.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with iHeartRadio, Kevin Gates said that: [...] "I named the album after my daughter because of the anticipation. It was so high. I remember before the birth of my daughter, the anticipation was so high. I was scared, I was excited. I was going through mixed emotions at the time. When people set a high bar because I put out so much good quality music, that bar was so high. I just didn't want to. I was afraid of being a letdown. I was afraid of not being good enough. I {{was scared to death}} upon making the album, upon releasing the album. The reason I named my album Islah was because it was my first album. My first real studio album, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>so</b> to say. Everything else that I put out was mix tapes. The name Islah means to critique. To make better. A spiritual awakening. When my daughter came, she gave me all of those things." ...|$|E
5000|$|Howard {{began writing}} songs {{when he was}} eleven. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, he stated {{that when he was}} a kid he started playing guitar because he liked to put words together and make stuff up. [...] "I was quite an imaginative little kid <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>So</b> your standard little love songs turned into your standard adolescent love songs. I think you start getting your own take on things when you're a late teen. That's when everything changes." [...] Besides playing the guitar, Howard also played other instruments as a kid. He easily picked up the drums and contrabass, but after some time he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending King Edward VI Community College and Torquay Boys' Grammar School he began studying Journalism at University College Falmouth, Cornwall. Six months prior to completion of his course, Howard decided to focus on making music full-time, making melodic rootsy folk music, with progressively darker lyrics. His reputation grew around Cornwall and Devon, and soon spread to other areas of the UK. After a month of sold-out dates across Europe and the UK Howard was eventually asked to sign for Island Records.|$|E
