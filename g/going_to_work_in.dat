5|$|The {{absence of}} a large {{proportion}} of the male population of France also had important consequences on the position of women in occupied France and charity fundraising on behalf of the prisoners played an important role in French daily life until late in the occupation. Limited repatriation of certain classes of POWs did occur from 1940 and the Vichy French government was keen to encourage the return of prisoners, even launching the unpopular relève system in order to exchange prisoners of war for French labourers <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Germany. Nevertheless, many prisoners remained in German captivity until the defeat of Germany in 1945. Prisoners who returned to France, either by repatriation or through escaping, generally found themselves stigmatised by the French civilian population and received little official recognition.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the effort}} from WWE {{to promote the}} Brock Lesnar versus Goldberg contest, some critics {{expressed}} disappointment with the match, with many in Madison Square Garden booing both competitors and only cheering for Steve Austin {{because of the fact}} that both participants were set to leave the WWE after the event with Goldberg not signing a new contract and Lesnar <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the NFL. Goldberg returned to WWE in 2016 and reignited his rivalry with Lesnar, after the pair had been feuding for several months through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. This would set up a rematch between the two at the 2016 Survivor Series, where Goldberg defeated Lesnar after two consecutive spears and a Jackhammer in 1 minute and 26 seconds. A final match between them occurred at WrestleMania 33 in April 2017, where Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a match for the Universal Championship to end the feud.|$|E

The subtitle for the Gintama anime could be loosely translated as [...] "The {{starting point is}} the utmost importance for anything, so trying to outdo oneself is just about right."

500|$|Production of {{the album}} began in summer of 2004 with Destiny's Child taking help from {{frequent}} collaborators including Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins. The group worked on the album within {{a period of three}} weeks. Jerkins, who had worked with Beyoncé for her solo album Dangerously in Love, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, [...] "How is this going to work?' Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a group together?". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E
500|$|Rhys is a [...] "down {{to earth}} trucker", who {{functions}} as Gwen Cooper's normality base. At {{the start of}} the series he believes alien interference to be a result of hallucinations induced by psychotropic drugs in the water supply and that his girlfriend's job is nothing more unusual than generic [...] "special ops". Writer Stephen James Walker feels that Rhys [...] "originally didn't look to have much to him initially but really came into his own as Series One progressed", attributing this to the [...] "spot-on performance of the perfectly cast Kai Owen." [...] The original intention of the writers had been for Rhys to die at the end of series one, but Richard Stokes explains that it was overruled by show creator Russell T Davies, who felt that without Rhys, the show's main link to the real world would be lost. Executive Producer Julie Gardner expands on this by stating that [...] "It's a show where you've got to contrast the ordinary everyday with the extraordinary and (with) Gwen going home to Rhys and then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> an underground secret base... it's right to have that balance." [...] Actor Kai Owen attributes part of his character's success to his on-screen rapport with actress Eve Myles.|$|E
