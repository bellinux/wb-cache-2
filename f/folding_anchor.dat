50|$|The bird-dropping spider is {{a master}} of deception. It crouches {{stationary}} on a leaf or other level surface and exhibits an elaborate combination of form and colour, the posture it adopts and the character of its web so as to simulate accurately a patch of bird's excreta. The underside of its abdomen is chalky white and its legs black. It weaves a small irregular white web on the surface of a prominently placed leaf and adopts an upside-down pose near the centre of the web with its legs <b>folded,</b> <b>anchoring</b> itself in place with some spines on its legs. The effect of this is to create the impression of a semi-solidified bird's dropping with a white raised centre with black specks, a surrounding thinner, more liquid portion and even a drip effect on the lowest margin ending with a little knob. The mimicry is enhanced {{by the fact that the}} spider emits an odour not unlike bird excreta.|$|R
40|$|The {{ambiguous}} restraint for iterative assignment (ARIA) {{approach for}} NMR structure calculation is evaluated for symmetric homodimeric proteins by assessing {{the effect of}} several data analysis and assignment methods on the structure quality. In particular, we {{study the effects of}} network anchoring and spin-diffusion correction. The spin-diffusion correction improves the protein structure quality systematically, whereas network anchoring enhances the assignment efficiency by speeding up the convergence and coping with highly ambiguous data. For some homodimeric <b>folds,</b> network <b>anchoring</b> has been proved essential for unraveling both chain and proton assignment ambiguities...|$|R

On October 14, 2015, the Northwoods League officially announced that Rockford Baseball Properties, LLC (composed of league president Dick Radatz, Jr. and Chad Bauer) had purchased the ballpark and would field a team in the league to begin play in the 2016 season. The team would {{be a member of the}} South Division, with the La Crosse Loggers moving to the North Division (taking the place of the recently <b>folded</b> Alexandria Blue <b>Anchors).</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} a model decapeptide is obtained by performing molecular dynamics simulations of the peptide in explicit water. Interactions between an N-myristoylated form of the <b>folded</b> peptide <b>anchored</b> to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine fluid phase lipid membranes are studied at different applied surface tensions by molecular dynamics simulations. The lipid membrane environment influences the conformational space explored by the peptide. The overall secondary structure of the anchored peptide is found to deviate at times from its structure in aqueous solution through reversible conformational transitions. The peptide is, despite the anchor, highly mobile at the membrane surface with the peptide motion along the bilayer normal being integrated into the collective modes of the membrane. Peptide anchoring moderately alters the lateral compressibility of the bilayer by changing the equilibrium area of the membrane. Although membrane anchoring moderately affects the elastic properties of the bilayer, the model peptide studied here exhibits conformational flexibility and our results therefore suggest that peptide acylation is a feasible way to reinforce peptide-membrane interactions whereby, e. g., the lifetime of receptor-ligand interactions can be prolonged...|$|R
40|$|A {{lattice model}} of {{membrane}} proteins with a composite energy function is proposed to study their folding dynamics and native structures using Monte Carlo simulations. This model successfully predicts the seven helix bundle structure of sensory rhodopsin I by practicing a three-stage folding. Folding dynamics of a transmembrane segment into a helix is further investigated by varying the cooperativity {{in the formation}} of α helices for both random folding and assisted folding. The chain length dependence of the folding time of a hydrophobic segment to a helical state is studied for both free and anchored chains. An unusual length dependence in the <b>folding</b> time of <b>anchored</b> chains is observed. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{intensive}} {{investigation for}} decades, {{the principle of}} higher-order organization of mitotic chromosomes is unclear. Here, I describe a novel model that emphasizes a critical role of interactions of homologous DNA repeats (repetitive elements; repetitive sequences) in mitotic chromosome architecture. According to the model, DNA repeats are assembled, via repeat interactions (pairing), into compact core structures that govern the arrangement of chromatins in mitotic chromosomes. Tandem repeat assemblies form a chromosomal axis to coordinate chromatins in the longitudinal dimension, while dispersed repeat assemblies form chromosomal nodes around the axis to organize chromatins in the halo. The chromosomal axis and nodes constitute a firm skeleton on which non-skeletal chromatins can be <b>anchored,</b> <b>folded,</b> and supercoiled...|$|R
40|$|Peptide amphiphiles are {{class of}} protein mimics and model systems. Especially, the {{assembly}} behavior of peptide amphiphiles has attracted much attention. Not only could the self-assembly behavior provide {{a starting point}} for peptide based structures, but the peptide amphiphiles could also be co-assembled with other components in order to introduce additional functionality and/or biocompatibility, leading to a bottom-up fabrication of new nano-materials. Tuning of this self-assembly process should be possible by tuning the hydrophobicity of peptide amphiphiles. This thesis describes the influence of added hydrophobicity, achieved by the introduction of alkyl tails of varying lengths, on peptide (self-) assembly and folding. The influence of additional hydrophobic interactions on a peptide that forms amyloid like fibrils, with the sequence Lys Thr Val Ile Ile Glu, was examined. Specifically the effect of the introduction of an alkyl tail at the N-terminus or C-terminus on the stability of fibrils formed by the peptide is investigated. Furthermore, it was examined whether it is also possible to not only stabilize, but also disassemble these fiber assemblies by manipulating the hydrophobic hydrophilic balance. And the possibility of in situ disassembly of peptide fibrils through the introduction of a cleavable hydrophobic moiety is studied. The influence of introduced hydrophobic interactions on the folding and assembly of a non-self assembling peptide, with the sequence Gly Ala Asn Pro Asn Ala Ala Gly (GANPNAAG), was examined to contrast the effect on hydrophobic interactions of the already fibril forming peptide. These alkyl modified peptides were anchored into liposomes. The effect on <b>folding</b> and <b>anchoring</b> is examined, by varying the length of the alkyl tails on the peptide and liposome composition. Finally, the possibilities were investigated to use alkyl modified peptides, either anchored in liposomes or attached to a carrier protein, for the production of vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{the most}} common type of dementia, {{comprising}} 60 - 80 % of all reported cases, and currently affects 5. 2 million Americans. AD is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of senile plaques (SPs), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and synapse loss. The early stages of memory loss associated with AD have been studied in a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), arguably the earliest form of AD. In spite of extensive research across a variety of disciplines, the cause of AD remains elusive. Proteomics techniques have helped to advance knowledge about AD by identifying irregularities in protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in AD brain. Glycosylation is a less studied PTM with regards to AD and MCI. This PTM is important to study because glycosylation is involved in proper protein <b>folding,</b> protein <b>anchoring</b> to cell membranes, and the delivery of proteins to organelles, and these processes are impaired in AD. Concanavalin-A (Con-A) binds to N-linked glycoproteins, but hydrophobic sites on nonglycoproteins are also known to bind Con-A. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine Con-A-associated brain proteins in MCI and AD with focus on the hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) brain regions. Proteins found in AD hippocampus with altered levels are glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tropomyosin 3 (TPM 3), Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor XAP- 4 (XAP 4), and heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90). Proteins found with altered levels in AD IPL are alpha-enolase, gamma-enolase, and XAP- 4. MCI hippocampal proteins with altered levels are dihydropyrimidase- 2 (DRP 2), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP- 78), protein phosphatase related protein Sds- 22 (Sds 22), and GFAP and the only protein found with altered levels in MCI IPL was beta-synuclein. These results are discussed with reference to biochemical and pathological alterations in and progression of A...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} an {{open reading frame}} with homology to prokaryotic rubredoxins (rds) on a nucleomorph chromosome of the cryptomonad alga Guillardia theta. cDNA analysis let us propose that the rd preprotein has an NH 2 -terminal extension that functions as a transit peptide for import into the plastid. Compared to rds found in non-photosynthetic prokaryotes or found in bacteria that exhibit an anoxigenic photosynthesis apparatus, nucleomorph rd has a COOH-terminal extension, which shows high homology exclusively to the COOH-termini of cyanobacterial rds {{as well as to}} a hypothetical rd in the Arabidopsis genome. This extension can be divided into a putative membrane anchor and a stretch of about 20 amino acids with unknown function linking the common rd <b>fold</b> to this <b>anchor.</b> Overexpression of nucleomorph rd in Escherichia coli using a T 7 RNA polymerase/promotor system resulted in a mixture of iron-containing holorubredoxin and zinc-substituted protein. Preliminary spectroscopic studies of the iron form of nucleomorph rd suggest the existence of a native rd-type iron site. One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of recombinant Zn-rd suggests the presence of a stable tertiary fold similar to that of other rd structures determined previously...|$|R
40|$|The Lec 35 {{gene product}} (Lec 35 p) is {{required}} for utilization of the mannose donor mannose-P-dolichol (MPD) in synthesis of both lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) and glycosylphosphatidylinositols, which are important for functions such as protein <b>folding</b> and membrane <b>anchoring,</b> respectively. The hamster Lec 35 gene is shown to encode the previously identified cDNA SL 15, which corrects the Lec 35 mutant phenotype and predicts a novel endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. The mutant hamster alleles Lec 35. 1 and Lec 35. 2 are characterized, and the human Lec 35 gene (mannose-P-dolichol utilization defect 1) was mapped to 17 p 12 - 13. To determine whether Lec 35 p was required only for MPD-dependent mannosylation of LLO and glycosylphosphatidylinositol intermediates, two additional lipid-mediated reactions were investigated: MPD-dependent C-mannosylation of tryptophanyl residues, and glucose-P-dolichol (GPD) -dependent glucosylation of LLO. Both were found to require Lec 35 p. In addition, the SL 15 -encoded protein was selective for MPD compared with GPD, suggesting that an additional GPD-selective Lec 35 gene product remains to be identified. The predicted amino acid sequence of Lec 35 p does not suggest an obvious function or mechanism. By testing the water-soluble MPD analog mannose-�- 1 -P-citronellol in an in vitro {{system in which the}} MPD utilization defect was preserved by permeabilization with streptolysin-O, it was determined that Lec 35 p is not directly required for the enzymatic transfer of mannose from th...|$|R
