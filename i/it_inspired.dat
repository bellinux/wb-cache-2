5|$|The {{seeds of}} modern AI were planted by {{classical}} philosophers {{who attempted to}} describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in {{the invention of the}} programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind <b>it</b> <b>inspired</b> a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.|$|E

5|$|Defender {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling shooters. <b>It</b> <b>inspired</b> the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.|$|E
5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and <b>it</b> <b>inspired</b> me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

5|$|The Corps was {{effectively}} an active military reserve of the Romanian Land Forces, and regularly dispatched new units to the Romanian front after June 1917. It helped defend the last stretches of Romania against the Central Powers' unified offensive, and met {{success in the}} Battle of Mărășești, but it still lacked a unitary command structure. When the October Revolution in Russia and the Romanian armistice took Romania out of the Entente camp, the Corps was left without backing and purpose. However, <b>it</b> <b>inspired</b> the creation of similar units in Entente countries, most successfully the Romanian Legion of Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} {{part of the}} Manor of Hyde, which was given to William the Conqueror by Geoffrey de Mandeville. Joseph Damer acquired it in the 18th century and a large building was constructed in 1751. It was named Dorchester House in 1792 after Damer became the Earl of Dorchester. In the early 19th century it became the Hertford House after it was purchased by Francis Seymour-Conway, the 3rd Marquess of Hertford, and alterations were made to <b>it,</b> <b>inspired</b> by the Villa Farnese of Rome. Following the death of Hertford, it was converted into a mansion by Captain Robert Stayner Holford.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{while the}} rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up a {{constitution}} which provided for a federal layout, much of <b>it</b> <b>inspired</b> by the American example. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the Council of States, two representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council, with representatives elected from across the country). Referendums were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution. This new constitution also brought a legal end to nobility in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Despite this recognition, the {{increasing}} debts of the MDHB meant {{that by the}} 1960s the company was eager {{to get rid of}} the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to <b>it</b> (<b>inspired</b> at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.|$|E
