50|$|The Picts {{are often}} {{said to have}} practised matrilineal kingship {{succession}} {{on the basis of}} Irish legends and a statement in Bede's history.

40|$|Melanosis {{can affect}} {{various parts of}} the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract. Melanosis of the colon is not uncom-mon, while melanosis of the ileum is extremely rare. We report a case of melanosis <b>ilei</b> associated with chronic ingestion of oral iron (256 mg of ferrous sul-fate once or twice daily for approximately 5 years) in a 32 -year-old woman with end-stage renal disease. The findings of a colonoscopy, which was performed as a part of her medical checkup, were normal up to the cecum; however, numerous brownish-black punctu-ate pigmentations of the ileal mucosa were observed. Microscopic examination revealed hemosiderosis in the lamina propria of the ileal mucosa, particularly at the tips of villi. The diagnosis of melanosis (hemoside-rosis) <b>ilei</b> was made based on the endoscopic and histological findings. (Gut and Liver 2009; 3 : 315 - 317...|$|R
50|$|Historians {{differ on}} who {{was likely to}} have been interred in the sarcophagus. Although it is {{generally}} presumed that it was commissioned by the Pictish King Óengus, or Onuist, a Christian who died in 761, whether it was actually used for his corpse, for his predecessor, Nechtan mac Der <b>Ilei,</b> or for a later personage is unclear.|$|R

50|$|The Irish annals speak {{relatively}} rarely of the Cenél Comgaill. A recent interpretation suggests, however, {{that the}} kindred {{may have been}} important in the Gaelicisation of the Picts, as a certain Dargart mac Finguine of the Cenél Comgaill married the Pictish princess Der-Ilei, and the Pictish kings Bridei and Nechtan mac Der <b>Ilei</b> {{were the result of}} this marriage.|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{melanosis}} {{is observed}} most {{frequently in the}} colon it also can develop in the ileum, duodenum and esophagus very rarely. Melanosis <b>ilei</b> was thought that causative materials such as aluminum, magnesium, silicate, titanium and other compounds entered the body through the ingestion of agents. We experienced a case of melanosis in the terminal ileum that a 65 -year-old female patient ingested 10 g edible charcoal everyday for 3 years to address symptoms of chronic abdominal pain. In Korea, edible charcoal has been {{considered to be an}} effective folk remedy for patients with diarrhea or chronic abdominal pain. In our case, a follow up colonoscopy was performed 3. 5 years after the termination of the ingestion of edible charcoal, at which point pigmentation was faded color intensity. In conclusion, it is thought that melanosis <b>ilei</b> is a rare disease by ingestion of causative materials and is discontinuous, local and reversible disease...|$|R
25|$|Large {{intestinal}} <b>ileus</b> is {{most commonly}} seen in horses following orthopedic surgery, but its risk is also increased {{in cases where}} post-operative pain is not well-controlled, after long surgeries, and possibly following ophthalmologic surgeries. It is characterized by decreased manure output (<3 piles per day), rather than nasogastric reflux, as well as decreased gut sounds, signs of colic, and the occasional impaction of the cecum or large colon. Cecal impactions can be fatal, so {{care must be taken}} to monitor the horse for large intestinal <b>ileus</b> after orthopedic surgery, primarily by watching for decreased manure production.|$|E
25|$|Backing up {{of fluid}} through the {{intestinal}} tract is usually {{due to a}} downstream obstruction, <b>ileus,</b> or proximal enteritis, and its presence usually indicates a small intestinal disease. Generally, the closer the obstruction is to the stomach, the greater amount of gastric reflux will be present. Approximately 50% of horses with gastric reflux require surgery.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{experience}} frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities {{as well as}} chronic pain in the abdomen. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, <b>ileus,</b> intussusception, hypoganglionosis, and encopresis in children {{have been associated with}} porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and vagal nerve dysfunction.|$|E
30|$|Many {{advanced}} laparoscopic {{procedures have}} been observed {{to be safe and}} feasible in women with a high BMI [1]. The safety of these procedures have also been established in most gynaecological surgeries in the form of reduced intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, rates of wound infection or dehiscence, hospital stay and financial costs when compared to laparotomy. The patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery have also been known to have fewer postoperative <b>ileuses,</b> urinary tract infections and febrile morbidity [2, 3].|$|R
5000|$|Restenneth Priory was a monastic {{house of}} Augustinian canons founded by Jedburgh Abbey, with the {{patronage}} of King Malcolm IV of Scotland, in 1153. Although {{there is little}} literary evidence, archaeological evidence strongly indicates {{that there was a}} monastery at Restenneth from very early times. There is also speculation that Restenneth may even have been the Pictish church dedicated to St Peter (mentioned in Bede) built in 710 for Nechtán mac Der <b>Ilei,</b> King of the Picts.|$|R
50|$|Pictland was {{not solely}} {{influenced}} by Iona and Ireland. It also had ties to churches in Northumbria, {{as seen in}} the reign of Nechtan mac Der <b>Ilei.</b> The reported expulsion of Ionan monks and clergy by Nechtan in 717 may have been related to the controversy over the dating of Easter, and the manner of tonsure, where Nechtan appears to have supported the Roman usages, but may equally have been intended to increase royal power over the church. Nonetheless, the evidence of place names suggests a wide area of Ionan influence in Pictland. Likewise, the Cáin Adomnáin (Law of Adomnán, Lex Innocentium) counts Nechtan's brother Bridei among its guarantors.|$|R
25|$|Except in {{the most}} severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with {{supportive}} care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to eat or drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an <b>ileus</b> is present.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{conditions}} {{affecting the}} bowels include infectious diarrhoea and mesenteric ischaemia. Causes of constipation may include faecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn {{be caused by}} <b>ileus,</b> intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing enterocolitis.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{prenatal}} and newborn screening, {{cystic fibrosis}} was often diagnosed when a newborn infant {{failed to pass}} feces (meconium). Meconium may completely block the intestines and cause serious illness. This condition, called meconium <b>ileus,</b> occurs in 5–10% of newborns with CF. In addition, protrusion of internal rectal membranes (rectal prolapse) is more common, occurring {{in as many as}} 10% of children with CF, and it is caused by increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and increased intra–abdominal pressure due to coughing.|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the article}} we present laparoscopic {{procedures}} of colon at Slovenj Gradec General Hospital. Patients and methods: From 1999 to 2005 we performed 71 laparoscopic procedures of colon: segmental resections, {{left and right}} hemicolectomies, low anterior resections, total colectomy, anus preters and restoring continuity of the bowel, rectopexies, and adhesiolysis. Results: We had 11 conversions and 9 complications we had to operate again. Among them there were 3 dehiscences, 2 <b>ileuses,</b> rectovaginal fistula, peritonitis, intraabdominal abscess and stenosis. Conclusions: The main advantages of laparoscopic operations are faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and less pain.

50|$|The Bishop of Ross was the ecclesiastical {{head of the}} Diocese of Ross, one of Scotland's 13 medieval bishoprics. The first {{recorded}} bishop appears in the late 7th century as a witness to Adomnán of Iona's Cáin Adomnáin. The bishopric was based at the settlement of Rosemarkie until the mid-13th century, afterwards being moved to nearby Fortrose and Fortrose Cathedral. As far as the evidence goes, this bishoric was the oldest of all bishoprics north of the Forth, and was perhaps the only Pictish bishopric until the 9th century. Indeed, the Cáin Adomnáin indicates that in the reign of Bruide mac Der <b>Ilei,</b> king of the Picts, the bishop of Rosemarkie was the only significant figure in Pictland other than the king. The bishopric is located conveniently close to the heartland of Fortriu, being just across the water from Moray.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the arteria mesenterica cranialis and its branches in the porcupine (Hystrix cristata). Nine adult porcupines (5 males, 4 females) were each injected with a coloured latex mixture from the aortic arch for demonstration of the arteria mesenterica cranialis. The results indicated that the arteria colica dextra was anastomosed with the arteria colica media and the ramus colicus. The arteria pancreaticoduodenalis caudalis separated from the arteria mesenterica cranialis as a third branch after the arteria colica media and the arteria colica dextra. Vascularization of the jejenum was made by the jejunal arteries, which originated from the arteria mesenterica cranialis and truncus jejunalis. The arteria ileocolica was continuous with the arteria mesenterica cranialis after giving off the jejunal arteries. Vascularization of the ileum was supplied by the ramus ilealis and the ramus <b>ilei</b> mesenterialis. The arteria ileocolica ended by separating into the rami colici and arteria cecalis. In summary, in the present study the branches of the arteria mesenterica cranialis were studied for the first time in porcupines. The results of this study may contribute to the data in this area of science. Istražena je arteria mesenterica cranialis i njezine grane u dikobraza (Hystrix cristata).

25|$|Vancomycin by {{mouth is}} {{preferred}} for severe disease. Additionally, vancomycin {{may be used}} to treat mild-to-moderate disease if diarrhea persists after a course of metronidazole. Since metronidazole has the potential to cause birth defects, pregnant women with Clostridium difficile infection may be treated with vancomycin regardless of disease severity. Vancomycin may be more effective than metronidazole. Typical vancomycin dosage is taken four times daily for 10 days. Vancomyin may be given rectally if the person develops an <b>ileus</b> and cannot take medications by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ileus</b> is {{the lack}} of {{motility}} of the intestines, leading to a functional obstruction. It often occurs postoperatively following any type of abdominal surgery, and 10–50% of all cases of surgical colic will develop this complication, including 88% of horses with a strangulating obstructions and 41% of all colics with a large intestinal lesion. The exact cause is unknown, but is suspected to be due to inflammation of the intestine, possibly a result of manipulation by the surgeon, and increased sympathetic tone. It has a high fatality rate of 13–86%.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a {{syndrome}} {{caused by}} a malformation of the digestive system, characterized by a severe impairment {{in the ability of}} the intestines to push and assimilate.

There is no cure for intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Different types of surgery and treatment managing life-threatening complications such as <b>ileus</b> and volvulus, intestinal stasis which lead to bacterial overgrowth, and resection of affected or dead parts of the gut may be needed.

5000|$|Early Pictish {{religion}} {{is presumed to}} have resembled Celtic polytheism in general. The date at which Pictish kings converted to Christianity is uncertain, but there are traditions which place Saint Palladius in Pictland after leaving Ireland, and link Abernethy with Saints Brigid and Darlugdach of Kildare. Saint Patrick refers to [...] "apostate Picts", while the poem Y Gododdin does not remark on the Picts as pagans. Conversion of the Pictish élite seems likely to have run over a considerable period, beginning in the fifth century and not complete until the seventh. Recent archaeological work at Portmahomack places {{the foundation of the}} monastery there, an area once assumed to be among the last converted, in the late sixth century. This is contemporary with Bridei mac Maelchon and Columba. The process of establishing Christianity throughout Pictland will have extended over a much longer period. Pictland was not solely influenced by Iona and Ireland. It also had ties to churches in England, as seen in the reign of Nechtan mac Der <b>Ilei.</b> The reported expulsion of Ionan monks and clergy by Nechtan in 717 may have been related to the controversy over the dating of Easter, and the manner of tonsure, where Nechtan appears to have supported the Roman usages, but may equally have been intended to increase royal power over the church.

40|$|Background and Aim: <b>Ileuses</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} after abdominal surgery including cesarean section (CS) which leads to inability to start feeding. Several studies have been performed on the effects of liquid diet in the postoperative period on the recovery of bowel movement but there has been no perfect study on the effect of gum chewing on this subject. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of early oral feeding with liquid diet on the recovery of bowel movements with that of gum chewing in primiparous women after (CS) in Hajar Hospitral in Shahrekord in 2007. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 180 patients scheduled for elective cesarean section were randomly divided into three groups: gum-chewing group (n= 30), early feeding group (n= 30) and control group (n= 30) postoperatively. The patients in the gum-chewing group chewed postoperatively sugar free gum four times daily, each time for 15 minutes, as soon as they recovered from anesthesia. In the early oral feeding group the women received a liquid diet within six hours after surgery, and control group received routine post operative dietary regimen. Data were analyzed by x 2, paired and independent t tests and one way ANOVA. p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Recovery of bowel movements in the gum chewing and early oral feeding groups was significantly faster than that of control group and was faster in gum chewing group in comparison to early oral feeding group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Gum chewing after CS is safe, inexpensive and beneficial which is well tolerated by the patients and associated with rapid resumption of intestinal function and rapid recovery of the patients after cesarean-section...|$|R
25|$|Inflammation along any {{portion of}} the GI tract can lead to colic. This leads to pain and {{possibly}} stasis of peristalsis (<b>Ileus),</b> which can cause excessive accumulation of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract. This is a functional rather than mechanical blockage of the intestine, but like the mechanical blockage seen with simple obstructions, it can have serious effects including severe dehydration. Inflammation of the bowel may lead to increased permeability and subsequent endotoxemia. The underlying cause of inflammation {{may be due to}} infection, toxin, or trauma, and may require special treatment in order to resolve the colic.|$|E
25|$|This form of colic {{is usually}} managed medically. Because {{there is no}} motility, {{intestinal}} contents back up into the stomach. Therefore, periodic decompression of the stomach though nasogastric intubation is essential to prevent rupture. Horses are monitored closely following abdominal surgery, and a sudden increase in heart rate indicates the need to check for nasogastric reflux, as it is an early indication of postoperative <b>ileus.</b> The horse is placed on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance and prevent hypovolemic shock, and rate of fluids {{is calculated based on}} daily maintenance requirement plus fluid lose via nasogastric reflux.|$|E
25|$|Surgery poses {{significant}} {{expense and}} risks, including peritonitis, {{the formation of}} adhesions, complications secondary to general anesthesia, injury upon recovery of the horse which may require euthanasia, dehiscence, or infection of the incisional site. Additionally, surgical cases may develop post-operative <b>ileus</b> which requires further medical management. However, surgery {{may be required to}} save the life of the horse, and 1–2% of all colics require surgical intervention. If a section of intestine is significantly damaged, it may need to be removed (resection) and the healthy parts reattached together (anastomosis). Horses may have up to 80% of their intestines removed and still function normally, without needing a special diet.|$|E
25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic <b>ileus,</b> bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|Like other TCAs, doxepin {{is highly}} toxic {{in cases of}} overdose. Mild {{symptoms}} include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic <b>ileus),</b> hyperthermia (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of doxepin overdose. Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a gastric lavage so as to reduce absorption of the doxepin. Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable. Antiarrhythmic agents may be an appropriate measure to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from doxepin overdose. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects. Haemodialysis is not recommended due to {{the high degree of}} protein binding with doxepin. ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after doxepin overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} food is usually {{introduced}} {{as soon as}} possible after surgery, usually within 18–36 hours, to encourage motility and reduce the risk of <b>ileus</b> and the formation of adhesions. Often horses are stall rested with short bouts of hand walking to encourage intestinal motility. The incision site is carefully monitored for dehiscence, or complete failure of the incision leading to spillage of the abdominal contents out of the incision site, and the horse is not allowed turn-out until the incision has healed, usually after 30 days of stall rest. Abdominal bandages are sometimes used to help prevent the risk of dehiscence. Incisional infection doubles the time required for postoperative care, and dehiscence may lead to intestinal herniation, which reduces the likelihood of return to athletic function. Therefore, antibiotics are given 2–3 days after surgery, and temperature is constantly monitored, to help assess if an infection is present. Antibiotics are not used long-term due to the risk of antimicrobial resistance. The incision usually takes 6 months to reach 80% strength, while intestinal healing following resection and anastomosis is much faster, at a rate to 100% strength in 3 weeks. After the incision has healed adequately, the horse is turned out in a small area for another 2–3 months, and light exercise is added to improve the tone and strength of the abdominal musculature.|$|E
