5000|$|Levi Spear Parmly, {{a dentist}} from New Orleans, is {{credited}} with inventing the first form of <b>dental</b> <b>floss.</b> In 1819, he recommended running a waxen silk thread [...] "through the interstices of the teeth, between their necks and the arches of the gum, to dislodge that irritating matter which no brush can remove and which is the real source of disease." [...] He considered this {{the most important part}} of oral care. Floss was not commercially available until 1882, when the Codman and Shurtleft company started producing unwaxed <b>silk</b> <b>floss.</b> In 1898, the Johnson & Johnson Corporation received the first patent for <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> that was made from the same silk material used by doctors for silk stitches.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> are {{commonly}} available. Floss {{is available in}} many forms including waxed, unwaxed monofilaments and multifilaments. <b>Dental</b> <b>floss</b> that is made of monofilaments coated in wax slides easily between teeth, does not fray and is generally higher in cost than its uncoated counterparts. The most important difference between available <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> is thickness. Waxed and unwaxed floss are available in varying widths. Studies have shown {{that there is no}} difference in the effectiveness of waxed and unwaxed <b>dental</b> <b>floss,</b> but some waxed types of <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> are said to contain antibacterial agents and/or sodium fluoride. Factors to consider in choosing a floss include the amount of space between teeth and user preference. Dental tape is a type of floss product which is wider and flatter than conventional <b>floss.</b> <b>Dental</b> tape is recommended for people with larger tooth surface area.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Due to the {{inadequate}} of {{a toothbrush}} in cleaning of interdental areas and further advanced developing {{of the disease}} in this area, <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> seems essential. However, the developing of peopleâ€™s using <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> as a habit is difficult. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine the use of <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> frequency in reducing plaque and the optimal <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> daily use frequency in people with a healthy periodontium. METHODS: In this study, 44 dental students of School of Dentistry, Kerman, Iran, with healthy periodontal or at most a few bleeding on probing (BOP) areas were investigated. Scaling and root planning was performed for all subjects at baseline as well as necessary trainings about how to use the toothbrush and <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> were instructed. In terms of using <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> frequency, participants were divided into four groups of 22 each G 1, G 2, G 3, and G 4 which were meant to be used <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> in every second day, a day, 2 or 3 times a day, respectively. At baseline, total plaque index (TPI), internal plaque index, and internal bleeding index were evaluated after 3 and 6 weeks. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS, statistical tests ANOVA, and paired t-test. RESULTS: In this study, there was a significant reduction in plaque index after 6 weeks (P < 0. 050) however there was no significant difference between groups in terms of the interdental bleeding index (IBI). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, if a person with normal periodontal tissues uses the toothbrush and <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> properly, using <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> in every other day is sufficient to maintain the gingival healthy.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{residual}} content of tetrasodium pyrophosphate released by two different anticalculus <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> (Reach PP(r) - entangled polypropylene floss and Reach NT(r) - texturized nylon) in the oral cavity. Ten healthy individuals (aged between 18 and 30 years) were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. Participants received instructions on daily <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> and the interventions were randomly performed in 2 different groups (NT or PP) of five individuals each according to the <b>dental</b> <b>flosses.</b> Individuals were instructed to use each <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> with a total of six slides on the two interproximal aspects of target teeth (3 slides on each interproximal aspect). A washout period of one week was used before start flossing interventions and after each type of <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> to prevent any bias related to the exposure to any product that contained the active ingredient. Samples were collected by # 35 sterilized absorbent paper points from interdental fluid after flossing and assessed by ion chromatography. The levels of residual tetrasodium pyrophosphate were evaluated by means of binomial generalized linear model proportions and canonical link function. Both <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> were effective in tetrasodium pyrophosphate release at therapeutic levels in the interdental gingival crevicular fluid for a period of up to 2 h after use. No significant differences were found between both groups (p> 0. 05).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> on oral hygiene and gingival health in an effort to assess its value in impeding the development and progress of periodontal disease. FINDINGS Proper use of <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> in conjunction with other home care procedures aided in achieving and maintaining a higher level of oral hygiene and gingival health than was attained in an identical regimen without <b>dental</b> <b>floss.</b> Serially recorded oral hygiene indices suggested that sustained maintenance of improved oral hygiene and gingival health apparently require periodic reinforce-ment of motivational stimuli.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of two toothpicks and two <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> on demineralized enamel and dentine and on plaque composition, using an in situ model with simulated approximal spaces within dentures. Fifteen subjects with full dentures were recruited and 14 completed the study. It consisted of two crossover periods, the first comparing a birch toothpick with AmF and a birch toothpick with NaF, and the second comparing a <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> with AmF + NaF and a <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> without F. Between these four periods, there was a control period without any approximal cleaning. In small, rectangular sample holders, one enamel and one dentine specimen were embedded, forming a triangular, approximal-like space. Two sample holders were mounted in the premolar-molar region of the upper or lower dentures. The subjects used the toothpicks or <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> 3 times/day for 4 weeks. The results showed that all toothpicks and <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> inhibited further demineralization compared to the control period (p < 0. 001). The <b>dental</b> <b>flosses</b> were somewhat more effective in this respect than the toothpicks, especially in dentine. There were relatively small numerical differences between AmF and NaF toothpicks, but in favour of NaF regarding mineral gain (p < 0. 05). The fluoridated floss gave somewhat less lesion depth in dentine than the non-fluoridated floss (p < 0. 01). Toothpicks and flosses resulted in lower counts of microorganisms in plaque compared to the control period (p < 0. 001); the AmF toothpick gave a more pronounced reduction than the NaF toothpick (p < 0. 001). ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Some inter-proximal {{areas of}} teeth are not {{available}} to brushing thus <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> for eliminating plaque is needed. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the determining factors based on trans-theoretical model (TTM) among high school students. Methods: This descriptive, analytical, cross- sectional study was conducted during April and May 2012. 653 high schools students of Pakdasht in Iran were selected through multi-stages cluster-sampling method and participated in this study. A Researcher-designed questionnaire, including demographic information, stage of change, self efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers parts for collecting data was used. Data were collected based on TTM framework. Content validity of the questionnaire was determined using Lawsche's formula and CVI= 0. 97 and its reliability was specified through Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0. 83). Data were then analyzed by SPSS software V 15. Logistic Regression, spearman Correlation, ANOVA and nonparametric tests were used as the statistical methods. Results:The majority of students 73 % (n= 477) in <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> were in pre-contemplation and contemplation stages of change. Self efficacy and perceived benefits scores were lower in primary stage of change and perceived barriers were higher at the primary stage (p< 0. 000). Moreover, it was found that increase in perceived self efficacy enhances chance of <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> and maintaining this behavior more than six month, and increase in perceived barriers of people declines this chance (p< 0. 000). Conclusion:The findings showed a high percentage of students were in pre-contemplation and contemplation stages in <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> behaviorthus probably will expose with inter-dental decays in the future. Self efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers are determinant factors of <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> which should be considered in educational programs.

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} in vivo {{pilot study}} was to {{determine}} the concentration of fluoride retained intra-orally in saliva after <b>flossing</b> with <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> impregnated with stannous fluoride (SnF 2). Methods. Participants flossed their teeth ad libitum with 2 premeasured lengths of fluoridated <b>dental</b> <b>floss.</b> Expectorated saliva samples were collected in vials before flossing (PF), immediately postflossing(IPF), at 30 minutes (30), and 1 hour (60) after flossing for analysis with a fluoride-specific electrode and an Orion millivoltmeter. Postflossing samples were compared to the preflossing samples using ANOVA and Tukey's HSD. Results. Differences between the PF and IPF group means were found to be statistically significant at p< 0. 01. No other significant differences were found between or among any of the groups. Salivary fluoride levels at 60 minutes (60) were similar to those prior to flossing (PF). Conclusions. It can be concluded that fluoride can be released from flossing with the tested SnF 2 -impregnated <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> elevating salivary fluoride levels for at least 30 minutes. Use of this fluoride-containing <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> offers an option for delivery of fluoride to individuals at risk for dental caries...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to test the effects of interdental {{cleansing}} with <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> on supragingival biofilm removal in natural dentition during a 3 -week period of experimental biofilm accumulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was performed as a single-blind, parallel, randomised, controlled clinical trial using the experimental gingivitis model (LÃ¶e et al, 1965). Thirty-two students were recruited and assigned to one of the following experimental or control groups: Group A used a fluoride-containing dentifrice (NaF dentifrice) on a toothbrush for 60 s twice a day, Group B used an unwaxed <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> twice a day, Group C used a waxed <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> twice a day in every interproximal space and Group D rinsed twice a day for 60 s with drinking water (control). RESULTS: During 21 days of abolished oral hygiene, the groups developed various amounts of plaque and gingivitis. Neither of the cleansing protocols alone allowed the prevention of gingivitis development. Toothbrushing alone yielded better outcomes than did any of the flossing protocols. Interdental cleansing with a waxed floss had better biofilm removal effects than with unwaxed floss. CONCLUSIONS: Toothbrushing without interdental cleansing using <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> and interdental cleansing alone cannot prevent the development of gingivitis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Although an aspirated toothpick is a well-known cause of traumatic injury to the respiratory tract, a similar device called a <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> pick, which is much larger than a toothpick, has never {{been described as a}} tracheobronchial foreign body. Case presentation We report a case of massive hemoptysis in a 32 -year-old man due to a <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> pick in the left main bronchus. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was successful in removing the foreign body. Conclusion Tracheobronchial foreign body can be a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention and massive hemoptysis may be the presenting symptom. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is recommended as the first-line treatment modality for tracheobronchial foreign body removal. A <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> pick may present as a tracheobronchial foreign body and can reside in the airway asymptomatically for many years. </p...|$|R
