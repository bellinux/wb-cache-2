40|$|Circuits for cyclic load-sequences can be {{designed}} {{on the basis of}} different concepts. In general the type or class of cyclic loads will {{play an important role in}} the design of such circuits. The design is usually not only based on a number of trivial demands on flow- and pressure-sequences, but also based on demands on efficiency of the system. Optimal circuits can {{be designed}} for a certain loadsequence if this load-sequence is known or can be measured. In a number of cases it is desired that the hydraulic circuit can adapt to different cyclic loads without deterioration of efficiency. In this paper the design of two different concepts for cyclic load-sequences is investigated. One of the concepts is based on a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> <b>system.</b> The second concept is based on an adaptable fixed displacement pump-accumulator system (Learning Hydraulic System or LHS for short). For such systems the type or class of load-sequences has to be characterised or specified. As was shown in the research for the LHS the characterization of the cyclic load-sequence can be quantified by the mean power in combination with the standard deviation of the power. In this research attention is paid to the determination of the useful boundaries of the adaptable performance of the two concepts of the designs with respect to the class of load-sequences. Some interesting conclusions in respect of the mean efficiency and adaptable performance can be drawn from the comparison of the two different concepts. This study is based on theoretical research and partly on experimental research...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of hydraulic systems are controlled using a metering valve {{or the use}} of variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Metering valve control is compact and has a high control bandwidth, but it is energy inefficient due to throttling losses. Variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are far more efficient as the pump only produces the required flow, but comes with the cost of additional bulk, sluggish response, and added cost. In a previous paper [1], a hydromechanical analog of an electronic switch-mode power supply was proposed to create the functional equivalent of a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> This approach combines a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) on/off valve, a check valve, and an accumulator. The effective <b>pump</b> <b>displacement</b> can be varied by adjusting the PWM duty ratio. Since on/off valves exhibit low loss when fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is potentially more energy efficient than metering valve control, while achieving this efficiency without many of the shortcomings of traditional variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> The <b>system</b> also allows for a host of programmable features that can be implemented via control of the PWM duty ratio. This paper presents initial experimental validation of the concept as well as an investigation of the system efficiency. The experimental apparatus was built using available off-the-shelf components and uses a linear proportional spindle valve as the PWM valve. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve variable control function more efficiently than a valve controlled system, and that by increasing the PWM frequency and adding closed-loop control can decrease syste...|$|R

Current valves designs both produced commercially and in research were investigated to study design tradeoffs. Modeling methods were also researched to understand the tradeoffs between accuracy, computational cost, and complexity. A design criterion was determined and from this, a prototype was developed. Modern numerical analysis tools were used to optimize the valve for on/off applications. Once the valve geometry was determined, a lumped parameter model was created of the valve. The analytical model focused on accurately modeling and connecting the fluid, electrical, and mechanical domains {{that resulted in a}} fast accurate model. This model was organized into a graphical blockset to assist in implementation. ^ After completing the analytical model, a prototype was manufactured to verify the model and validate the design of the valve. A laser test apparatus was used to measure valve stroke, and it was determined the valve had a minimum transition time less than one millisecond.

High-speed valves, {{when used in}} virtually variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> (VVDP), increase <b>system</b> bandwidth and reduce output pressure ripple by enabling higher PWM frequencies. Our approach to achieving high speed and large flow area with low actuation power is a unidirectional rotary valve designed specifically for PWM. In comparison to conventional valves, the rotary valve reduces valve actuation power from a cubic dependence on PWM frequency to a square dependence by eliminating motion reversals during transition. This paper presents experimental data that validates the rotary valve concept, valve design equations, and dynamic model of a rotary valve based VVDP.

40|$|The {{variable}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> control <b>system</b> {{has greater}} energy-saving advantages and application prospects than the valve control system. However, the variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> control of differential cylinder is not concurrent {{with the existing}} technologies. The asymmetric pump-controlled cylinder is, therefore, used to balance the unequal volume flow through a single rod cylinder in closed-circuit system. This {{is considered to be}} an effective method. Nevertheless, the asymmetric axial piston pump (AAPP) is a constant <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> In this study, variable-displacement asymmetric axial piston pump (VAPP) is investigated according to the same principle used in investigating AAPP. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the characteristics of VAPP. The variable-displacement output of VAPP is implemented by controlling the swash plate angle with angle feedback control circuit, which is composed of a servo proportional valve and an angular displacement sensor. The angular displacement sensor is connected to the swash plate. The simulation model of VAPP, which is set up through the ITI-SimulationX simulation platform, is used to predict VAPP’s characteristics. The purpose of implementing the experiment is to verify the theoretical results. Both the simulation and the experiment results demonstrated that the swash plate angle is controlled by a variable mechanism; when the swash plate angle increases, the flow of Port B and Port T increases while the response speed of Port B and Port T also accelerates. When the swash plate angle is constant, the flow of Port B and Port T increases along with the increase of pump speed, although the pressure-response speed of Port B is faster than that of Port T. Consequently, the flow pulsation of Port B and Port T tends to decrease gradually along with the increase of pump speed. When the pressure loaded on Port B equals to that of Port T, the flow ripple cycle of Port B is longer than that of Port T, whereas the peak flow of Port B is higher than that of Port T. Since the flow ripple of Port T is bigger than that of Port B, Port T should be connected to the low pressure sides or the oil tank so that it does not affect VAPP’s performance. Further, to avoid the backflow of VAPP from Port T to Port B, Port T cannot be loaded alone, and the loading pressure of Port T also cannot exceed that of Port B...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} in auto-motive {{transmissions}} to provide pressurized fluid to various hydraulic components in the transmission and also lubricate the mechanical components. The output flow of these pumps increases with speed, almost linearly, but the flow requirements often saturate at higher speeds resulting in the excess flow draining back to the sump. This represents a parasitic loss in the transmission leading to a loss in fuel economy. To overcome this issue, variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have been used in}} the transmission, where the output flow is reduced by controlling the <b>displacement</b> of the <b>pump.</b> The use of these pumps in automatic transmissions, has resulted in better fuel economy as compared to some types of fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> However, the literature does not fully explore the benefits of variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> to a specific type of transmission namely, dual-clutch transmission, that has different pressure & flow requirements than an epicyclic gear-train. This paper presents an analysis on the effect of pump selection on fuel economy in a five speed dual clutch transmission of a commercial vehicle. Models of the engine, transmission & vehicle are developed along with the models of two different types of pumps: a fixed <b>displacement</b> gerotor <b>pump</b> and a variable <b>displacement</b> vane <b>pump.</b> The models are then parameterized using experimental data and the fuel economy of the vehicle is simulated on a standard driving cycle. The results suggest that the fuel economy benefit obtained by the use of the variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> in dual clutch transmissions is comparable to that of automatic transmissions.

Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions.

The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures.
