25|$|In 1952, Camron {{organised}} independent Israel’s first rugby match, {{between a}} group of South Africans, {{and a team of}} parachutists in the IDF. The South Africans won 18-6. The match ball was somewhat unusual, being a shoe wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel.</b> The game proved fairly popular in the IDF, thanks partly to its emphasis on aggression and team tactics. Camron soon organised other games, mainly between soldiers, and immigrants from the British Commonwealth. Rugby had been played in Israel before, but had more or less died out with the departure of the British.|$|E
25|$|Amateur boxing {{is both an}} Olympic and Commonwealth Games {{sport and}} is a common fixture in most {{international}} games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel,</b> or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards {{at the end of}} the contest. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, the fight is considered a draw (professional boxing). In Olympic boxing, due to the fact that a winner must be declared, in the case of a draw - the judges use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the bout.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, Vince McMahon began to resent Stephanie's {{attempts}} {{to stop him from}} pursuing an affair with Sable. The feud culminated in the controversial first ever [...] "Father–Daughter 'I Quit' match" [...] at No Mercy. McMahon was accompanied by her mother, the CEO of WWE Linda McMahon, and Sable accompanied Vince McMahon in their match. McMahon lost when Linda, at ringside threw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> on her behalf because Vince would not release a choke he had on her with a lead pipe. As a result of losing the match, McMahon disappeared from WWE television for two years.

500|$|Anthony Dawson, {{who played}} Professor Dent, met {{director}} Terence Young {{when he was}} working as a stage actor in London, but {{by the time of the}} film's shooting Dawson was working as a pilot and crop duster in Jamaica. Dawson also portrayed Ernst Stavro Blofeld, head of SPECTRE, in From Russia with Love and Thunderball, although his face was never seen and his voice was redubbed by Austrian actor Eric Pohlmann. Zena Marshall, who played Miss Taro, was mostly attracted by the humorous elements of the script, and described her role as [...] "this attractive little siren, and at the same time I was the spy, a bad woman", who Young asked to play [...] "not as Chinese, but a Mid-Atlantic woman who men dream about but is not real". The role of Taro was previously rejected by Marguerite LeWars, the Miss Jamaica 1961 who worked at the Kingston airport, as it required being [...] "wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel,</b> lying in a bed, kissing a strange man". LeWars appeared as a photographer hired by Dr. No instead.|$|E
500|$|Bret Hart's {{feud with}} Bob Backlund dated {{back to the}} July 30, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. Backlund {{believed}} that he had won the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund slapped {{him in the face}} and locked him in a crossface chickenwing. After that Backlund began acting in a completely different manner than he had before, demanding respect from his fellow wrestlers insisting that they call him [...] "Mr. Backlund" [...] and using the crossface chickenwing, a hold he said was unbreakable, on them if they did not adhere to his wishes. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to The Iron Sheik's camel clutch. Playing off of this, a rematch between Hart and Backlund was signed for Survivor Series. The match was signed as a submission match, but with the stipulation that the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the other person throw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel.</b> Since this required a wrestler to have a cornerman, each of the participants chose one. The challenger chose Owen Hart, while the champion went with Davey Boy Smith.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{a three-day}} period between June 22 and June 25, 2007, Chris Benoit, a 40-year-old veteran {{professional}} wrestler employed by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), {{killed his wife}} Nancy Benoit and strangled their 7-year-old son Daniel before hanging himself. Autopsy results showed that Benoit's wife was murdered first as she was bound at the feet and wrists and died of asphyxiation on Friday. Nancy was found wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> and with blood under her head, although Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard reported no other signs of a struggle.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, June 22, Chris {{killed his}} wife Nancy in an upstairs bedroom. Her limbs were bound, and her body was wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel.</b> A copy of the Bible was left by her body. Injuries {{indicated}} that Benoit had pressed a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck, causing strangulation. Blood was also found under her head, suggesting {{that she may have}} tried to fend off Benoit. Officials said that there were no signs of immediate struggle. Toxicologists were unable to determine whether alcohol found in her body was there before death or a decomposition product. Decomposition also made it difficult to estimate pre-death levels of hydrocodone and alprazolam, found in [...] "therapeutic levels" [...] in her corpse. In any case, her medical examiner saw no evidence that she was sedated like her son.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{the corner}} is {{responsible}} for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw <b>in</b> <b>a</b> white <b>towel</b> to signify <b>a</b> boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase [...] "to throw in the towel", meaning to give up, derives from this practice). This {{can be seen in}} the fight between Diego Corrales and Floyd Mayweather. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.|$|R
2500|$|Garcia {{experienced}} several tragedies {{during his}} youth. At age four, while {{the family was}} vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains, two-thirds of Garcia's right middle finger was accidentally cut off. Garcia and his brother Tiff were chopping wood.

After his mother wrapped his hand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel,</b> Garcia's father drove him over 30 [...] miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia — who had not looked at his finger since the accident — was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the five}} weeks between 2 May and 8 June 616 sick men (one {{third of the}} 4th Light Horse Brigade) were {{evacuated}} from the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance. During the same period, the field ambulance treated almost {{an equal number of}} patients needing dressings and for minor ailments. Some were kept in hospital for a few days. In five weeks, the field ambulance cared for the equivalent of two regiments or two-thirds of the total brigade. According to Falls, [...] "in general, however, the Force's standard of health was very high." [...] These minor ailments included very painful boils which were inevitable in the dust, heat and sweat of the Jordan Valley. They often started where shirt collars rubbed the backs of necks, then spread {{to the top of the}} head and possibly the arm pits and buttocks. These boils were treated by lancing or hot foments sometimes applied hourly and requiring a day or two in hospital. Foments were made from a wad of lint wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> heated in boiling water, wrung as dry as possible then quickly slapped straight on the boil. Other maladies suffered during the occupation included dysentery, a few cases of enteric, relapsing fever, typhus, and smallpox along with sand-fly fever.|$|E
2500|$|On February 3, 2002, a video {{surfaced}} allegedly showing Kelly {{engaging in}} sex with, and urinating on, an underage girl. The story, which {{was released by}} an unknown source, {{was sent to the}} Chicago Sun-Times, the newspaper that broke the story on February 8, 2002. This news surfaced as Kelly was to perform at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics. In interviews with WMAQ television of Chicago and MTV News, Kelly said that he was not the man in the video. In June 2002, Kelly was indicted in Chicago on 21 counts of child pornography. That same month, Kelly was apprehended by Miami Police Department on a Chicago arrest warrant, and Polk County Sheriff's Office conducted a search of Kelly's residence in Davenport, Florida. During the search, officers recovered 12 images of an alleged underage girl on a digital camera– wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> in a duffel bag – which allegedly depicted Kelly [...] "involved in sexual conduct with the female minor." [...] According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the girl in the images obtained from Kelly's Florida home also appears in the videotape which got Kelly indicted in Chicago. Kelly was arrested in January 2003 on those charges. In March 2004, these charges were dropped {{due to a lack of}} probable cause for the search warrants.|$|E

2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E
