40|$|The use of {{tragacanth}} as a <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> {{material on}} rnedici-nal tablets {{has been investigated}} in this study. Different methods and materials {{have been used for}} the <b>coating</b> of medicinal <b>tablets.</b> <b>Tablets</b> are <b>coated</b> for various reasons. Some of these are; the ability of coatings to mask unpleasant taste and odor and to pro-tect from atmospheric gases, to control the disintegration site of tablets and provide sustained release action, to prevent incompati-bilities between the ingredients, to facilitate product identifica-tion and to improve product appearance. Because of certain drawbacks of sugar coating, studies on compression and <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> have been carried out.

30|$|Another {{issue with}} oral KCl therapy is its very {{unacceptable}} taste which {{often leads to}} nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, sudden availability of large dose of KCl also leads to gastric irritation which further exacerbates nausea and vomiting (Mcmahon et al., 1982). The <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> and extended release capsule and tablet formulations minimize this side effect (Wu et al., 2003; Graham et al., 1990; Chang and Rudnic, 1991; Kumar et al., 2011). However, these formulations are not very suitable for paediatric and geriatric patients. Furthermore, in India, only KCl syrup and solutions are available to the patients (CIMS, 2017) and these formulations have very unacceptable taste. Here, we report the development of KCl dry syrup with improved palatability. To improve the palatability of KCl, we directly coated pure KCl crystals with Eudragit E 100, a pH sensitive amino alkyl methacrylate copolymer by means of fluid bed processing. This strategy masked the salty taste of KCl and prevented its instantaneous release in the stomach. This simple and commercially viable approach is expected to significantly improve compliance and acceptability of KCl syrup formulations in the patients especially in the paediatric and geriatric population.|$|R

40|$|Summary. At {{present the}} {{pharmaceutical}} industry and academia are focusing {{on the use of}} natural materials and resources for development of pharmaceutical product. In previous study, neem gum (NG), obtained from Azadirachata indica plant revealed satisfactory film forming ability. The present study evaluates the application potential of neem gum, as an aqueous <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> material, using ciprofloxacin hydrchloride (drug) as a model drug. Initial study of physical mixture indicated absence of chemical interaction in between drug and NG. Aqueous coating solution of NG was optimized and consisted of neem gum (13. 34 %w/w), triethyl citrate (1. 25 %w/w), talc (0. 25 %w/w) and titanium dioxide (0. 17 %w/w). The coating parameters such as pan revolutions (rpm), inlet air pressure, inlet temperature, and pan load were optimized. The uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> were evaluated for hardness, disintegration time, dissolution, drug content. The <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> were subjected to accelerated stability conditions for 1 month and the results were compared with marketed drug <b>tablet.</b> Any <b>coating</b> defects, except surface roughness, were absent in case of NG <b>coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> NG <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> depicted satisfactory mechanical strength. Dissolution study of NG <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> depicted 90 % of drug release in 10 minutes and 100 % of drug release at 30 minutes. Accelerated storage conditions didn’t affect the tablet hardness and % drug release. The coating process efficiency, coating uniformity and loss on drying confirmed that the coating solution was optimum and coating parameters were robust. Industrial relevance. A paradigm shift, from organic solvent-based to water-based <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> of pharmaceutical dosage forms, apparent in pharmaceutical industries, is due to Government regulation, high cost of the organic solvents, safety issues {{associated with the use of}} organic solvents. Currently, the commercially available edible coatings utilize synthetic cellulosic polymers namely, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polydextrose. A particular disadvantage of HPMC coating is hardening of the coating over time and thereby prolonged tablet disintegration time. Neem gum is a promising natural, biodegradable, cheap and eco-friendly film former which can be employed for aqueous <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> of <b>tablets,</b> containing bitter taste or moisture sensitive drug. Moreover neem gum is an effective film former in lower concentrations (10 - 15 % w/w) and may be a cost-effective alternative over conventional film formers. Keywords.

Materials and Methods: Patients (N= 316) with at least moderate baseline postsurgical dental pain were randomized to 400 mg IBUNa, Advil (IBUAdv), Motrin (IBUMot), or placebo. Primary endpoints were time-weighted sum of pain relief (PR) and pain intensity differences over 8 hours (SPRID 0 - 8) and time to onset of meaningful pain relief (TMPR) measured by the double-stopwatch method. Results: SPRID 0 - 8 was significantly greater for IBUNa and the other active treatments versus placebo (P< 0. 001). IBUNa had a significantly earlier TMPR versus placebo, pooled IBUAdv/IBUMot, and IBUMot (P< 0. 001 for all), and a marginally faster TMPR (P= 0. 075) versus IBUAdv. Results for secondary endpoints were similar. Adverse events were comparable across treatment groups, with gastrointestinal disorders being most frequently reported. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. Discussion: This novel formulation of IBUNa provided superior overall PR compared with placebo and more rapid onset of anal-gesic effect compared with standard IBU tablets. Rapid PR is important in the treatment of acute pain, including dental pain, and this IBUNa formulation represents a new treatment option for rapid PR.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} formulation of amoxicillin trihydrate dispersible tablets of 320 mg in a low production value, using cheap amoxicillin trihydrate raw materials available in the market, with direct compression or wet granulation method. Amoxicillin trihydrate is a semisynthetic antibiotic, an analogue of ampicillin with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against gram +ve and gram –ve organism. Dispersible tablets are uncoated or <b>film</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> intended to be dispersed in water before administration giving a homogeneous dispersion. The WHO prefers dispersible dosage form for the elderly and paediatric patients due to its ease in the administration. Amoxicillin trihydrate dispersible tablet was manufactured with the different disintegrants such as maize starch, crospovidone, croscarmellose, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose. The powder blend was evaluated for angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index and hausner’s ratio. After compression the tablets were subjected to weight variation, %drug content, buoyancy studies and in-vitro release studies. The wet granulation was excluded from the formulation due to its high cost if production, direct compression was selected due to its low cost and ease of production. The optimized formulation F 10 had showed 99. 11 % of drug release in 40 min and disintegration of tablet was 25 seconds. The result of FTIR analysis of pure drug alone and drug with excipients there was not showed any physical and chemical interaction. F 10 had undergone DTA, which shows the thermal stability of the formulation.

The term unit measurements can now and then envelop non-reusable bundling too (particularly when every medication item is exclusively packaged. Different measurements structures might exist for a solitary specific medication, since various medicinal conditions can warrant distinctive courses of organization. For instance, steady queasiness and heaving might make it hard to utilize an oral dose structure, and in such a case, it might be important to use a backup course of action, for example, inhalational, buccal, sublingual, nasal, suppository or parenteral.

The objective {{is to develop a}} platform technology that is suitable for a broad range of drug compounds. We developed a <b>coated</b> <b>tablet</b> with a delayed, pulsatile release profile based on a pH-sensitive coating technology (ColoPulse). The production process was validated, and the effect of core composition on the in vitro release and water uptake investigated. The release profile of the standard tablet core composition, based on the use of cellulose as a filler, was independent of the coat thickness in a range of 9. 013. 2 mg/cm 2. The release profile of a <b>coated</b> <b>tablet</b> was strongly influenced when cellulose was partly replaced by the model substance glucose (loss of sigmoidal release), citric acid (stabilization), sodium bicarbonate (destabilization) or sodium benzoate (destabilization). The <b>film</b> <b>coating</b> takes up water when below the pH-threshold. However, this did not cause early disintegration of the coating. The ColoPulse technology is successfully applied on tablets.
