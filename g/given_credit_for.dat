It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The 7. Staffel, and {{elements}} of the support ground personnel, were relocated to Grottaglie airfield near Taranto in Apulia on 5 April 1941. Here the pilots learned that the Wehrmacht would invade Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April. In support of this invasion, the pilots attacked the airfield at Podgorica. Müncheberg claimed a Yugoslav Hawker Fury biplane of Independent Fighter Eskadrila, 81 (Bomber) Grupa, Jugoslovensko Kraljevsko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo (JKRV—Yugoslav Royal Air Force) on 6 April 1941.

5|$|The {{isolation}} of metallic zinc in the West {{may have been}} achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass {{paved the way for}} the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection. In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving {{the abuse of}} the protection afforded by icons of the princeps, in which the emperor's images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Stanford's defense {{improved}} {{under new}} defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who was <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> {{much of the}} team's success in that department. At {{the end of the}} regular season, Stanford was first in the Pac-10 and 11th of 120 teams nationally in scoring defense (allowing an average of 17.83points per game) and 24th in total defense (permitting 326yards per game). In 2009, Stanford was 69th in scoring defense (26.5) and 90th in total defense (403yards per game). A prominent player on Stanford's defense was Owen Marecic, the only person in major league college football that season to play both offense and defense. On defense, Marecic accrued 45 tackles and 2 interceptions as a linebacker; on offense, he gained 117yards and 4 touchdowns as the team's fullback.|$|E

5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control the {{imported}} giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 2002, McMahon {{returned}} to the WWE (formerly WWF until a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund) as {{the general manager of}} SmackDown. In contrast to her McMahon-Helmsley era villain character, Stephanie became a fan favorite, as she began to favor fan favorite wrestlers at that time. She feuded with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown! at a Halloween party, Stephanie McMahon and Eric Bischoff shared a kiss while McMahon was dressed as a witch and Bischoff was disguised as her father underneath a mask. McMahon was <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the return of the WWE United States Championship and for the creation of the WWE Tag Team Championship. She was also credited with signing Hulk Hogan back to SmackDown!, which caused friction between herself and her father.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Emerald Bowl {{began with}} a 1:35p.m. PST kickoff time in SBC Park. Because the field had been {{converted}} from the baseball diamond typically used by the San Francisco Giants, both teams shared the same sideline during the game. Rainy conditions caused the field's natural grass surface to become muddier as the game progressed. Although 30,563 tickets were sold, an increase of 19 percent from the 2003 game, official in-stadium attendance was listed at 28,856, an increase of 28 percent over the previous year. Despite New Mexico's closer proximity to the bowl site, Midshipmen fans comprised {{a large portion of}} the crowd; Navy directly sold 18,000 tickets prior to the game and was <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> 22,000.

5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland began on 1 September 1939, and {{marked the beginning}} of World War II in Europe. Philipp's unit was tasked with bomber escort and ground attack as well as combat air patrol missions. He was credited with his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 without firing a single shot. Philipp maneuvered himself into a favorable attack position and aimed carefully. Just {{as he was about to}} open fire, the enemy pilot bailed out. Nevertheless, he was <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the destruction of the aircraft and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, which was presented to him on 10 October 1939.

5|$|Schnaufer had to {{wait two}} months to achieve another victory, {{claiming}} the destruction of two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar on the night 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. On the night of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed a claim for another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had guided him into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band airborne radar. His next claim was made on the night of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. On the night of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible for the destruction of another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was <b>given</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the destruction of the Lancaster.|$|E
