50|$|In 1827, the French chemists Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Colin began {{producing}} <b>garancine,</b> the concentrated {{version of}} natural madder. They then found that madder lake contained two colorants, the red alizarin {{and the more}} rapidly fading purpurin. Purpurin is only present in the natural form of madder and gives a distinctive orange/red generally warmer tone that pure synthetic alizarin does not. Purpurin fluoresces yellow to red under ultraviolet light, while synthetic alizarin slightly shows violet. Alizarin was discovered before purpurin, by heating the ground madder with acid and potash. A yellow vapor crystallized into bright red needles: alizarin. This alizarin concentrate comprises only 1% of the madder root.|$|E
40|$|In the 19 th century, {{synthetic}} dyestuffs replaced {{natural materials}} {{that had been}} used for thousands of years. This research examined the transition of one dyestuff, madder, found in plant roots, to its synthetic counterpart, alizarine, discovered in 1868. Records of ten American dye or print works were located in five museums, libraries, and historic associations in Delaware, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Dye inventories, color superintendent journals, swatch books, payroll records, and company correspondence of 1870 to 1890 were investigated to analyze the transition. Variables including economic factors and chemical technologies were explored to ascertain when, and possibly why, the transition occurred. Results suggest alizarine replaced madder 6 to 15 years after its introduction in the companies studied. <b>Garancine,</b> a chemically treated madder product acted in an intermediary role. Common auxiliary ingredients also served to bridge the transition. Alizarine was cheaper, easier to use because it was purer, gave more consistent results, and provided a greater variety of colors than madder. The replacement of madder, {{one of the most important}} dyes in the American textile industry, by alizarine seems to have persuaded dye superintendents of the value in synthetic dyes. Documenting the use of madder, <b>garancine,</b> and alizarine in the American textile coloring industry perserves an important link in textile history. Further research might include documenting the transition from other natural dyestuffs to their synthetic replacements, and determining what factors influenced the much greater number of yards of printed cottons produced after the discovery of alizarine...|$|E
30|$|Although a {{complete}} picture can only be achieved when the chromatographic data are integrated with those obtained by elemental analysis and vibrational spectroscopies, as in [26], thanks to the chromatographic analysis, specific recipes to obtain selected hues were hypothesised for several samples, namely to obtain <b>garancine</b> and Kopp’s purpurin. Written sources are currently being studied by art historians {{in the framework of}} the Futurhama project, since the interpretation of the information within the laboratory notebooks related to the archive materials can be exploited to complement the analytical results. So far this aspect of the research has been hampered due to the incompleteness and ambiguity of these notebooks [38].|$|E
30|$|Four tube colours had {{trade names}} for variant shades of red madder i.e. “Madder lake golden rose”, “Madder lake deep rose”, and “Madder lake rose”. In the first {{mentioned}} HPLC-analysis identified the organic colourants to be purpurin and pseudopurpurin, {{which could be}} interpreted as Kopp’s purpurin [27] precipitated onto a substrate containing calcite and talc. Purpurin and alizarin were identified in the latter two, confirming a madder-based product best described as <b>garancine</b> [27, 28]. In the tube labelled “Carmine lake ordinary”, carminic acid was identified (Fig.  10 c) showing that this lake was actually prepared from cochineal insect [29]. Together with carminic acid, another unknown red dye compound was found, which perhaps indicates the extraction method of cochineal, but its significance is unclear.|$|E
40|$|Nineteenth-century Turkey red, {{a cotton}} textile dyed by a {{peculiar}} and unique process, {{is found in}} many collections around the world. It was known for its bright colour and remarkable fastness to light exposure and washing. Light fading is a significant concern in the display of historical textiles, and understanding more about the properties of these objects may increase the accessibility of collections. This research explored the identification of historical Turkey red through non-invasive Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to detect the presence of oil – a necessary {{step in the process}} – on the fibres. Around 1869, Turkey red dyers began to transition from using madder and <b>garancine</b> to synthetic alizarin, which was investigated through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The chemical profiles of 19 th-century samples and references of known dye source were used to predict whether Turkey red of unknown date was dyed with natural or synthetic dye...|$|E
30|$|A typical {{example is}} madder. At {{the end of}} the 18 th and during the 19 th century, German and English chemists tried to imitate Turkey red, also known as Rouge d’Andrinopole [4], based on madder. Various {{extraction}} methods from the raw material were tested, yielding products with slightly different names, such as Brown Madder (obtained in 1840 by using copper and iron sulphates instead of alum and potassium/sodium carbonate as a substrate for the precipitation of the lake pigment). The availability of sulphuric and sulphurous acids allowed further experiments to be performed, leading to the isolation of alizarin and purpurin in 1826. By modulating the extraction process, it became possible to obtain different modified madder-based products, e.g. <b>garancine</b> (1828), enriched in alizarin and purpurin, and Kopp’s purpurin (also known in France as “purpurine commerciale”), enriched in both purpurin and pseudopurpurin [4]. Fermenting madder prior to treatment in diluted sulphuric acid yields the so-called “carmine de garance”, supposedly pure madder dyestuff without the addition of an inorganic salt.|$|E
40|$|The dyed cotton {{textiles}} called Turkey red {{are a significant}} part of Scotland’s cultural heritage and the legacy of its textile manufacturing industry, and were known for their exceptional colour and fastness to light and wash fading. This thesis is a multi-disciplinary investigation of the chemistry of these unique textiles in the context of 19 th c. Scotland using historical material re-creations and modern analytical chemistry, situating the dyeing process in a historical context. This research is a significant contribution toward the continued preservation of historical Turkey red textiles. Through a detailed, chemistry-focused examination of Turkey red methods published in English and French between 1785 - 1911, the key ingredients and steps for the process from a chemical perspective are identified (Chapter 1). The significance, chemistry, and previous research {{on the role of the}} oil (Chapter 2) and dye sources used (Chapter 3) are discussed to form the basis of the material re-creations and analysis. The oil is fundamental to and characteristic of the process, which is also noteworthy for being the first to replace a natural dye source (madder or <b>garancine)</b> with a coal-tar derived analogue (synthetic alizarin). Re-creations of dyed Turkey red, Turkey red oil, oiled calico, and synthetic alizarin provide experiential data and reference materials to test analyses prior to application on historical objects (Chapter 4). The analysis of Turkey red oils by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) (Chapter 5) provides information used to characterise, for the first time, how the oil and cotton fibres bond to form the basis of the Turkey red complex. This is studied using conservation-based diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) on replica and 19 th c. pieces of Turkey red (Chapter 6). Dyes analysis of these samples by ultra high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array (UHPLC-PDA) identifies chromatographic profiles of textiles dyed with natural or synthetic dye based on synthetic chemical markers. The presence of pigments on printed Turkey red is confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) (Chapter 7) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterisation}} of atelier {{materials and}} of the historical commercial formulation of paint materials has recently gained new interest {{in the field of}} conservation science applied to modern and contemporary art, since modern paint materials are subjected to peculiar and often unpredictable degradation and fading processes. Assessing the composition of the original materials purchased by artists can guide not only their identification in works of art, but also their restoration and conservation. Advances in characterisation methods and models for data interpretation are particularly important in studying organic coloring materials in the transition period corresponding to the late 19 th-early 20 th century, when many such variants or combinations were hypothetically possible in their formulations. There is thus a need for reliable databases of materials introduced in that period and for gaining chemical knowledge at a molecular level related to modern organic pigments, by state-of-the-art protocols. This paper reports on the results of a study on 44 samples of historical colorants in powder and paint tubes, containing both lake pigments and synthetic organic pigments dating from 1890 to 1926. The samples were collected at the Lefranc Archive in Le Mans (France) as a part of Project Futurahma "From Futurism to Classicism (1910 - 1922). Research, Art History and Material Analysis", (FIRB 2012, Italian Ministry of University and Research), and were investigated using an analytical approach based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques. The focus of the chemical analyses was to reveal the composition of the historical organic lake pigments including minor components, to discriminate between different recipes for the extraction of chromophore-containing molecules from the raw materials, and ultimately to distinguish between different formulations and recipes. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) or electrospray-Quadrupole-Time of Flight tandem mass spectrometry detector (ESI-Q-ToF) were chosen given their considerable capacity to identify such complex and widespread organic materials. Although the inorganic components of the pigments were not taken into account in this survey, the specific molecular profiles provided invaluable information on the extraction procedures or synthetic strategy followed by the different producers, at different times. For instance, the use of Kopp's purpurin and <b>garancine</b> was highlighted, and synthetic by-products were identified. The results provided evidence that the addition of synthetic organic pigments to paint mixtures started from 1910 onwards, but they also suggest that in the formulation of high quality (surfin) colorants, natural products were still preferred. Moreover, in one of the samples the use of murexide as the colouring material was confirmed. This paper presents the first systematic and comprehensive survey on organic lakes and pigments belonging to an historical archive, by both HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF. Specific by-products of synthetic production of pigments, which can act as specific molecular markers for dating or locating a work of art, were also identified for the first time...|$|E
