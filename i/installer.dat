5|$|Many {{operating}} systems include Python {{as a standard}} component; the language ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and macOS, {{and can be used}} from the terminal. Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity <b>installer,</b> while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda <b>installer.</b> Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.|$|E
5|$|Debian offers {{different}} network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian {{is available}} via the netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed {{with just a}} base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. Another option is to boot the <b>installer</b> from the network.|$|E
5|$|The real minimum memory {{requirements}} {{depend on}} the architecture and may be {{much less than the}} numbers listed in this table. It is possible to install Debian with 60MB of RAM for x86-64; the <b>installer</b> will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a swap partition. The <b>installer</b> for z/Architecture requires about 20MB of RAM, but relies on network hardware. Similarly, disk space requirements, which {{depend on the}} packages to be installed, can be reduced by manually selecting the packages needed. , no Pure Blend exists that would lower the hardware requirements easily.|$|E

5|$|Debian {{supports}} {{a variety of}} ARM-based NAS devices. The NSLU2 {{was supported by the}} <b>installer</b> in Debian 4.0 and 5.0, and Martin Michlmayr is providing installation tarballs since version 6.0. Other supported NAS devices are the Buffalo Kurobox Pro, GLAN Tank, Thecus N2100 and QNAP Turbo Stations.|$|E
5|$|From version 2.0 to 9.0, FreeBSD {{used the}} sysinstall program as its main <b>installer.</b> It {{was written in}} C by Jordan Hubbard. It uses a text user interface, and is divided {{into a number of}} menus and screens {{that can be used to}} {{configure}} and control the installation process. It can also be used to install Ports and Packages as an alternative to the command-line interface.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Bruce Perens {{assumed the}} project leadership. Perens was a {{controversial}} leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship {{in the midst}} of the free software vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of the project from a.out to ELF. He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian <b>installer</b> on a single floppy, and wrote a new <b>installer.</b> By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left the project in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Several {{parts of}} Debian are {{translated}} into languages other than American English, including package descriptions, configuration messages, documentation and the website. The level of software localization {{depends on the}} language, ranging from the highly supported German and French to the hardly translated Creek and Samoan. The <b>installer</b> is available in 73 languages.|$|E
5|$|A {{fund-raising}} experiment, Dunc-Tank, {{was created}} to solve the release cycle problem and release managers were paid to work full-time; in response, unpaid developers slowed down their work and the release was delayed. Debian 4.0 (Etch) was released in April 2007, featuring the x86-64 port and a graphical <b>installer.</b> Debian 5.0 (Lenny) was released in February 2009, supporting Marvell's Orion platform and netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC. The release was dedicated to Thiemo Seufer, a developer {{who died in a}} car crash.|$|E
5|$|Debian offers DVD and CD {{images for}} {{installation}} {{that can be}} downloaded using BitTorrent or jigdo. Physical disks can also be bought from retailers. The full sets {{are made up of}} several discs (the amd64 port consists of 13 DVDs or 84 CDs), but only the first disc is required for installation, as the <b>installer</b> can retrieve software not contained in the first disc image from online repositories.|$|E

5|$|The 3.1 Sarge {{release was}} made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of the {{software}} and included over 9,000 new packages. A new <b>installer</b> with a modular design, Debian-Installer, allowed installations with RAID, XFS and LVM support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Upgrading through Windows Store {{requires}} each {{machine to}} download an upgrade package {{as big as}} 2–3.6 GB. Unlike the traditional Windows service packs, the standalone <b>installer,</b> which could be downloaded once and installed {{as many times as}} needed, requires a Windows 8.1-specific product key. On July 1, 2014, acknowledging difficulties users may have had through the Windows Store update method, Microsoft began to phase in an automatic download process for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of {{demolition}} was completed in March 2004, and two months later, stand piling on the West, East and North stands had been concluded. Two bridges over the Northern City railway line connecting the stadium to Drayton Park were also built; these were completed in August 2004. The stadium topped out in August 2005 and external glazing, power and water tank installation was completed by December 2005. The first seat in the new stadium was ceremonially installed on 13 March 2006 by Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby. DD GrassMaster {{was selected as the}} pitch <b>installer</b> and Hewitt Sportsturf was contracted to design and construct the playing field. Floodlights were successfully tested {{for the first time on}} 25 June 2006, and a day later, the goalposts were erected.|$|E

25|$|<b>Installer</b> bits are {{a type of}} {{twist drill}} bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. <b>Installer</b> bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an <b>installer</b> bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The <b>installer</b> bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.|$|E
25|$|A {{component}} {{is the basic}} unit of a product. Each {{component is}} treated by Windows <b>Installer</b> as a unit. The <b>installer</b> cannot install just part of a component. Components can contain program files, folders, COM components, registry keys, and shortcuts. The user does not directly interact with components.|$|E

50|$|As {{with almost}} any spyware or adware program, the CAS can be <b>installed</b> by <b>installing</b> a program. Also, {{the program can}} be <b>installed</b> from the manufacturer's website for {{packaging}} with a different program's file. This is also a common way of <b>installing</b> spyware or adware.|$|R
50|$|APT {{front-ends}} can {{list the}} dependencies of packages being <b>installed</b> or upgraded, ask the administrator if packages recommended or suggested by newly <b>installed</b> packages should be <b>installed</b> too, automatically <b>install</b> dependencies and perform other operations {{on the system}} such as removing obsolete files and packages.|$|R
50|$|Two {{advantages}} of Zero <b>Install</b> over more popular packaging systems {{are that it}} is cross-platform and no root password is needed to <b>install</b> software; packages can be <b>installed</b> in system locations writable by that user instead of requiring administrator access. Thus, package installation affects only the user <b>installing</b> it, which {{makes it possible for}} all users to be able to <b>install</b> and run new software.|$|R
