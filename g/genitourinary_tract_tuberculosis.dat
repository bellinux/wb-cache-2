40|$|Infertility is an {{uncommon}} manifestation of <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Anatomic obstruction by granulomas or {{distortion of the}} normal anatomy by fibrosis surrounding the reproductive tract structures is the commonest cause of infertility. The diagnosis is usually based on a suggestive history along with evidence of granulomatous infection on a tissue sample. The management depends {{on the site of}} obstruction and surgery is usually helpful only in cases with discrete ejaculatory duct obstruction. However, most other patients are candidates for in-vitro fertilization and have a prognosis similar to that in men with other causes of obstructive azoospermia...|$|E
40|$|An {{extremely}} rare form of <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) is TB of the glans penis. Here, {{we report on}} two men with TB of the glans, both occurring secondary to their wives having genital TB. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of this nature from Iran. One case is a 48 year-old blind male with an asymptomatic papulo-pustular eruption over the glans and, the other is a 51 year-old male who had kidney transplantation in March 2004, and was referred to our transplantation clinic nine months later with papulonecrotic ulcer on the glans which did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Both patients responded well to anti-TB treatment. Our cases suggest that every papulonecrotic lesion on the glans must raise the suspicion of TB, and an underlying active or healed focus of TB should be thoroughly searched. Also, it is very important, particularly in endemic areas, that prior to transplanting a male patient, his female partner must be examined for TB of the genitalia...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-level}} community {{study was}} carried out among the Peul and Dogon populations of the Bandiagara plateau (Mall). For {{the purpose of the}} study the Questionnaire pour le depistage en sante mentale (QDSM), a 23 -item screening questionnaire derived from the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), was adapted and validated; internal consistency and accuracy were evaluated. In the first phase of the study, 466 subjects randomly selected on a residential basis were evaluated by means of the QDSM. In the second phase all subjects who were ''positive'' at the screening, as well as a sample who were ''negative'', were examined by means of a semistructured interview. When necessary, clinical and laboratory investigations were performed. The estimated prevalence of psychiatric cases was 6. 4 %. A significant risk was associated with age and education. Somatic diseases frequently associated with psychiatric disorders were <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> disorders, <b>tuberculosis</b> and disabling cardiopathies. The main factor determining the seeking of medical help either through traditional or conventional health systems was the presence of a somatic disorder.

40|$|An {{important}} {{cause of}} male infertility is the bacterial infections of the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract.</b> These infections affect sperm cell function and whole spermatogenesis and also cause deterioration in spermatogenesis, obstruction of the seminal tract, and impairment of spermatozoa function.

Inappropriate or delayed therapy of the bacterial infections of the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> {{will lead to}} reduced fertility and, subsequently in severe cases, infertility. In other words, {{a good understanding of}} the interaction between bacterial infections and the reproductive system {{plays an important role in}} the treatment of infertile men.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} genital and urinary tract infections in pregnant Aboriginal women and low birth weight. DESIGN [...] Retrospective case-control study controlling for potential confounding variables. SETTING [...] Western Australia from 1985 to 1987. SUBJECTS [...] All Aboriginal women (n = 269) who {{had given birth to}} singleton infants weighing 2250 g or less (cases), and 269 randomly selected Aboriginal women who had given birth to singleton infants weighing 3000 g or more (controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Proportions of women in case and control groups who had had genital and urinary tract infections; odds ratios for low birth weight when <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection was present; population attributable fraction of low birth weight to <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection. RESULTS [...] At the time of delivery 51 % of women in the case group (109 / 215) had <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections compared with 13 % of controls (35 / 266). After controlling for potential confounding variables the odds ratio for giving birth to infants weighing 2250 g or less when <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection was present was 4. 0 (95 % confidence interval 2. 3 to 7. 0). The proportion of infants with low birth weight attributable to <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection in the whole population of Aboriginal women was 32 % (95 % confidence interval 17 % to 49 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] There was a strong association between low birth weight and the presence of <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections in Aboriginal women both during pregnancy and at the time of delivery.

40|$|AbstractHaemophilus {{species are}} known to colonize the upper {{respiratory}} tract and can cause infections. However Haemophilus influenzae has been rarely described {{as a cause of}} <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infection. We report a 44 -year-old nonimmunocompromised Japanese man with bacteremic pyelonephritis caused by a nontypable H. influenzae associated with a left ureteral calculus. The organism was isolated from both blood and urine cultures. Treatment consisted of 14 days of intravenous ceftriaxone and oral amoxicillin one after than other and insertion of a left ureteral stent. After discharge, he underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotrity for the left ureteral calculus. He had no recrudescence of the symptoms. H. influenzae should be considered as a genitourinary pathogen among patients with certain risk factors such as anatomical or functional abnormality of <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract.</b> Collaboration between clinicians and microbiology laboratory personnel is essential for correct identification of the organism and appropriate therapy for <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections due to this organism...|$|R

40|$|An agar growth {{inhibition}} method for serotyping Ureaplasma urealyticum is described, {{and the results}} of applying this method to serotyping 338 strains of the organism are presented. The serotyped strains consisted of cloned isolates from male patients with primary and recurrent nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), isolates from symptomatic patients with other <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections and disorders, and isolates from asymptomatic carriers of U. urealyticum in the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> (controls). Among 122 male patients with NGU, serotype 4 was associated most frequently (52 %) with this disease at Camp Lejeune, N. C. Seventeen percent of the isolates were type 2. The remaining isolates consisted of types 1, 3, 6, and 8 and accounted for 6 to 9 % each of the serotypes isolated from the NGU group. Types 5 and 7 were not isolated. Among 91 symptomatic patients with other <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> infections and disorders, U. urealyticum type 4 also was associated most frequently (37 %) with these disorders. The remaining isolates, represented by types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8, accounted for 9 to 15 % each of the types isolated from this group. Type 5 was not isolated. Among 125 symptomfree carriers of U. urealyticum in the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract,</b> type 8 was recovered most frequently (30 %), whereas type 4 was isolated next most frequently (24 %). The remaining isolates consisted of types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 and accounted for 2 to 15 % each in this asymptomatic control group. Type 7 was not isolated. Of the present eight serotypes of U. urealyticum studied in this investigation, type 4 was associated most frequently with disease (NGU) and certain other disorders of the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> at Camp Lejeune.

40|$|The {{criteria}} {{that need to}} be fulfilled before regarding a mycoplasma as a cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) are outlined. Of the seven mycoplasmas that have been isolated from the human <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract,</b> most cannot be considered as contenders for causing NGU. Although {{there is no evidence to}} support an etiological role for Mycoplasma hominis, it may be unwise to ignore this mycoplasma in view of its known pathogenicity in other situations. The cumulative weight of evidence indicates that strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum (ureaplasmas) cause NGU in some patients. The reason for their occurrence in the urethra of some men without disease needs to be established. Ureaplasmas do not seem to cause postgonococcal urethritis. The role in NGU of M. genitalium, newly discovered in the male urethra, is unknown, but its biological features, morphological appearance, and ability to cause genital disease in marmosets suggest that it may be pathogenic for man. There have been several publications recently in which the part played by mycoplasmas in human disease [1] and, particularly, in genitourinary disease [2 - 4] has been reviewed. In this communication the role of mycoplasmas in the etiology of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is discussed. OCCURRENCE OF MYCOPLASMAS IN THE <b>GENITOURINARY</b> <b>TRACT</b> Twelve mycoplasma species constitute the normal flora or are pathogens of humans. Nine of these mycoplasmas have been found in the respiratory tract and seven in the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract</b> (Table 1), four having been isolated from both anatomical sites. Because Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum organisms (ureaplasmas) are found frequently in the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tract,</b> especially in disease, they are the main mycoplasmal candidates for causing NGU...|$|R
