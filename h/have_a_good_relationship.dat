5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, he hit his wicket when setting off for a run, but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom he did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship,</b> Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go for a run.|$|E

25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came as no surprise that the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
25|$|Akbar was a Mughal emperor, {{was known}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with the Roman Catholic Church {{as well as with}} his {{subjects}} – Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains. He forged familial and political bonds with Hindu Rajput kings. Although previous Sultans had been more or less tolerant, Akbar took religious intermingling to new level of exploration. He developed {{for the first time in}} Islamic India an environment of complete religious freedom. Akbar undid most forms of religious discrimination, and invited the participation of wise Hindu ministers and kings, and even religious scholars to debate in his court.|$|E

25|$|Data {{indicate}} that the diagnosis of BPD is more variable over time than the DSM implies. Substantial percentages (for example around a third, depending on criteria) of people diagnosed with BPD achieve remission {{within a year or}} two. A longitudinal study found that, six years after being diagnosed with BPD, 56 percent showed good psychosocial functioning, compared to 26 percent at baseline. Although vocational achievement was more limited even compared to those with other personality disorders, those whose symptoms had remitted {{were significantly more likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with a spouse/partner and at least one parent, good work/school performance, a sustained work/school history, good global functioning and good psychosocial functioning.|$|E
25|$|During that 1999–2000 {{campaign}} {{there was}} speculation about Roberts's future as his contract {{was due to}} expire {{in the summer of}} 2000. Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club and was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2–0 win at Portman Road against City's rivals Ipswich Town F.C. on 19 March 2000. However, Roberts and Hamilton did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> during the Ulsterman's short spell in charge and after Hamilton left the club during the 2000–01 season, Roberts intimated that if he had known that Hamilton was going to succeed Rioch then he would not have signed his contract extension.|$|E
500|$|What {{is known}} about Thored's time as ealdorman {{is that he did}} not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with Oswald, Archbishop of York (97192). In a {{memorandum}} written by Oswald, a group of estates belonging to the archdiocese of York was listed, and Oswald noted that [...] "I held them all until Thored came to power; then was St Peter [...] robbed". One of the estates allegedly lost was Newbald, an estate given by King Edgar to a man named Gunnar, suggesting to historian Dorothy Whitelock that Thored may just have been reclaiming land [...] "wrongly alienated from his family".|$|E

500|$|On March 24, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home. Three days later, it {{was reported}} that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid. Mathis' lawyer also told the press, [...] "My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhys {{tries to}} make things up to Elaine by taking her to the {{hospital}} to meet his colleagues, but when she questions his motives for [...] "going public" [...] and admitting who she is, Rhys has to look at himself and his attitude towards her. In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. It would certainly create a lot of interesting dilemmas".|$|E

Ever since the late 1980s, Jackson and the press did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship.</b> In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process, {{with a picture of}} him lying down in a glass box; Jackson stated that the story was untrue. When Jackson bought a pet chimpanzee Bubbles, the media viewed it as evidence of Jackson's increasing detachment from reality.|$|E

500|$|Eve's {{character}} and storylines initially elicited {{a positive response}} from Passions cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of [...] "a full African American family" [...] on daytime television with serious storylines, not [...] "just a flash in the pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said {{the chance to work}} with Tracey Ross, who he called the it girl for the African American community following her appearance on Star Search, influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go where you need to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Enid Blyton {{was born}} on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ( [...] Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth Enid almost died from {{whooping}} cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he [...] "loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated {{when he left the}} family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship,</b> and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.|$|E
500|$|Marshall based her {{understanding}} of Liz on the character's relationship with Eve, which served as the primary focus for her character development and story arcs. Liz was initially {{not included in the}} show's descriptions of Eve's past. In the 2001 tie-in novel , Eve is characterized as the only child of [...] "too-busy Harvard history Professor Warren Johnson and journalist Tanya Lincoln Johnson". Marshall felt Liz was irredeemable for her actions against Eve and her love interest Julian Crane. Interpreting the character as having a form of mental illness due to her repeated sexual abuse, Marshall said that [...] "very emotion she has it twisted". Ross added to Marshall's commentary by recommending that Liz should get [...] "some serious electroshock therapy". Marshall found Liz's rivalry with Eve to be absurd, particularly a scene in which they fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise her working relationship with Ross, saying: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go where you need to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E

500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through.

But my brother and I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship,</b> and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
