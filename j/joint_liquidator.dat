The <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators</b> applied to a Provincial Division for a declaratory order that, on a proper construction of the contract of cession, no security had been conferred on the bank in respect of retention money certified in terms of the contract for payment by the employer subsequent to 10 June 1991.|$|R

50|$|On 21 July 2009, Fairfield Sentry {{was ordered}} by the High Court of the British Virgin Islands to be wound up and Mr Kenneth Krys and Ms Joanna Lau were {{appointed}} as its <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators.</b> Shell submitted a proof of debt in the liquidation for US$63,045,616.18. This amount was said to represent the redemption price of Shell's shares, calculated by reference to the NAV per share published by the directors of Sentry at 31 October 2008. It was claimed as a debt due under Shell's redemption notice of 12 December 2008. The <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators</b> rejected Shell's proof on 21 August 2014, {{as a result of}} Bannister J's direction of 14 August, subject to Shell's right if it objected to the assets being distributed in accordance with that direction to put forward its objection in writing by 17 October 2014.|$|R

The information is repeated and the forms are at http://www.sibliquidation.com/claims-administration/ (the URL denoted in the email was erroneous {{in as much as}} the [...] "-" [...] was missing between the words [...] "claims" [...] and administration").|$|R
5000|$|Former Vantis {{executives}} Nigel Hamilton-Smith and Peter Wastell {{were the}} <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators</b> of Stanford International Bank Limited and Stanford Trust Company Limited, [...] a high-profile appointment which, at the time, was reported {{as contributing to}} the collapse of Vantis, although subsequent analysis of the fees due on the Stanford case reveal that this was hugely inaccurate. Hamilton-Smith and Wastell transferred to FRP Advisory and continued to act on the liquidation, and FRP Advisory fought to have them reinstated as liquidators of Stanford after a court decision to remove them, but the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal confirmed their removal in May 2011, passing the case to Grant Thornton.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2007, Carl Freer {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with the Swedish-American journalist Hans Sandberg that he was interested in starting up production of the Gizmondo again. In April 2008, a press release was issued that an agreement had been reached between the <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators</b> of Gizmondo Europe Ltd in Liquidation and one of the company's ex-Directors, Carl Freer. The press release originated as a low quality copy of a letter purported to be from one of the accounting firms handling the insolvency, posted to a file sharing site. According to Mr Freer, “the shareholders of Tiger Telematics will now be able to prosper on the re-introduction of the Gizmondo into the market." ...|$|R
50|$|On 8 March 2011, {{shortly after}} the District Court of Amsterdam {{rejected}} Fairfield Sentry's challenge to the attachments, the <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators</b> applied in the High Court of the British Virgin Islands for an anti-suit injunction restraining Shell from prosecuting its proceedings in the Netherlands and requiring it to take all necessary steps to procure {{the release of the}} attachments. The application was heard inter partes by Bannister J in July 2011, who rejected it in a judgment delivered on 9 August. His main reason, in summary, was that as a matter of principle the BVI court would not prevent a foreign creditor from resorting to his own courts, even if he was amenable to the BVI court's jurisdiction. The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and made an order in substantially the terms which the <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators</b> had asked for in their notice of appeal. The order restrained Shell from taking any further steps in the existing Dutch proceedings against Fairfield Sentry or commencing new ones, but did not refer in terms to the attachments. The Court of Appeal's reasons, in summary, were (i) that Shell was subject to the personal jurisdiction of the BVI court by virtue of having lodged a proof in the liquidation, (ii) the assertion by the Dutch courts of a jurisdiction to attach assets on the sole ground that it consisted in a debt owed to the insolvent company by a Dutch entity was exorbitant; and (iii) Shell {{should not be allowed to}} avail itself of that jurisdiction so as to gain a priority to which it was not entitled under the statutory rules of distribution applying in the British Virgin Islands.|$|R

5000|$|Bilta (UK) Ltd ("Bilta"), {{a company}} {{incorporated}} in England, seeks through its <b>joint</b> <b>liquidators,</b> Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram, to recover damages or equitable compensation {{in respect of}} its alleged loss. As against the directors, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty. The conspiracy {{is alleged to have}} been an unlawful means conspiracy, and the unlawful means are the directors' alleged breach of their fiduciary duties. As against Jetivia and Mr Brunschweiler, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or compensation for dishonest assistance in the directors' breach of their fiduciary duties. Since the matter comes before the court on Jetivia's and Mr Brunschweiler's application for the claims against them to be summarily struck out or dismissed, it is to be assumed for present purposes that the factual allegations made in Bilta's amended particulars of claim are capable of proof, and {{there is no need to}} repeat the word [...] "alleged" [...] whenever referring to the defendants' conduct. The liquidators also pursue a separate claim for fraudulent trading under section 213 of IA 1986. Jetivia is a Swiss company and Mr Brunschweiler, who is resident in France, is its sole director.Bilta had two directors, Mr Nazir and Mr Chopra ("the directors"), who are the first and second defendants. Mr Chopra owned all the issued shares. Bilta was registered for the purposes of VAT. Its only trading activity, which took place between 22 April and 21 July 2009, was trading in European Emissions Trading Scheme Allowances ("EUAs"), which are commonly known as carbon credits. EUAs were treated as taxable supplies under the VAT Act 1994 until 31 July 2009. Since then they have been zero-rated. The VAT status of supplies of the EUAs at the relevant time explains Bilta's activities.In short, Bilta bought large numbers of EUAs from overseas suppliers, including Jetivia, free of VAT, and sold them in the UK with VAT to companies described as [...] "first line buffers", which immediately sold them on. The price for which Bilta sold the EUAs was lower before VAT than the price at which it bought, and Bilta was therefore never going to be in a position to meet its liabilities to HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC"). Bilta had minimal capital and was insolvent virtually from the outset. The money payable to Bilta, including the VAT due to HMRC, was either paid to Bilta and paid on by it to its overseas supplier, or was paid by the first line buffer (or a later company in the chain) directly to Bilta's supplier, or was otherwise paid to offshore accounts. At the end of the chain the EUAs would be resold to a company outside the UK, generating a right to a VAT refund. It is a familiar kind of carousel or missing trader fraud.Bilta was insolvent throughout the period of its trading in EUAs. In that three-month period, Bilta sold more than 5.7m EUAs for about £294m. Its liability for VAT on those transactions amounts to £38,733,444. It did not submit any VAT returns to HMRC. On the application of HMRC Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram were appointed provisional liquidators of Bilta on 29 September 2009. They commenced the company's claim against the defendants who were its directors and other parties, including the appellants. The company was compulsorily wound up on 25 November 2009. The proceedings were amended on 13 October 2011 to include the liquidators' claims under section 213 of IA 1986.|$|R
