According to producer Joshua Safran, {{the creators}} planned to revisit their relationship once {{the timing was}} right. Safran also stated that the outcome wasn't necessarily decided ahead of time. [...] "One thing we are very conscious of—and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> fans get upset about this—is we really try to treat the characters as living, breathing, well-rounded individuals. And we're often surprised by where their journeys take them; they open new doors for us all the time." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1943, Phleps became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} his Italian allies to cooperate with German operations, which was demonstrated in his reputation for forthright speech. During a meeting with his Italian counterpart in Podgorica, Montenegro, Phleps called the Italian corps commander General Ercole Roncaglia a [...] "lazy macaroni". Phleps scolded his Wehrmacht interpreter, Leutnant Kurt Waldheim for toning down Phleps' language, saying, [...] "Listen Waldheim, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> Italian and you are not translating what I am telling this so-and-so". On another occasion, Phleps threatened to shoot Italian sentries who were delaying his passage through a checkpoint. On 15 May 1943, Phleps handed over command of the division to SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS Karl von Oberkamp.|$|E
500|$|Some {{well-known}} British actors, {{who have}} not appeared in the series, were asked in jest why {{they had not been}} cast. When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy (who knew Yates personally) said that he hoped the director would cast him in Harry Potter. [...] "But nobody called", Nighy added. However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh film. Nighy said, [...] "I am no longer the only English actor not to be in Harry Potter and I am very pleased." [...] Jude Law once quipped, [...] "Nobody's asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry." [...] When a reporter compared Potions professor Horace Slughorn's obsession with famous names to the series' connection to [...] "every notable British actor" [...] in 2009, Jim Broadbent (who plays Slughorn) said, [...] "Well, not every actor gets invited. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> who are still waiting." ...|$|E

"I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Essentially, the key {{components}} to Parker's pedal setup is a Holy Grail reverb into a Blues Driver into a Carbon Copy delay into a Dyna Comp into a Small Stone phaser into a Fuzz Face {{and then into}} a Diamond Vibrato (vibrato added during Lonerism-era). The reverb into a fuzz and phasers set to a slow rate are the hallmarks of Parker's guitar sound, which has influenced many modern psychedelic rock bands to have a similar setup, which Parker says [...] "it’s the most flattering {{thing in the world}} to hear a band ripping you off. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> people get pissed off by it, but if I ever hear an artist and I can tell they’re using a phaser pedal the way I do, it’s a massive compliment. It makes you feel like you’re making an impression, having an impact on people, which is really humbling, flattering".|$|E
2500|$|Former Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd vocalist John Lydon {{alluded to}} sordid conduct by Savile, {{as well as}} {{suppression}} of widely held knowledge about such activity, in an October 1978 interview recorded for BBC Radio 1. Lydon stated: [...] "I'd like to kill Jimmy Savile; I think he's a hypocrite. I bet he's into all kinds of seediness {{that we all know}} about, but are not allowed to talk about. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>some</b> rumours." [...] He added: [...] "I bet none of this will be allowed out." [...] As predicted, the comment was edited out by the BBC prior to broadcasting, but the complete interview was included as a bonus track on a re-release of Public Image Ltd's 1978 debut album [...] in 2013, after Savile's death. In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: [...] "By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children... I'm disgusted at the media pretending they weren't aware." ...|$|E
