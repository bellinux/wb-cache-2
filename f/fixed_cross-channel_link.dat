2500|$|Ideas for a <b>cross-Channel</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> {{appeared}} {{as early as}} 1802, but British political and press pressure over the compromising of national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel. An early attempt at building a Channel Tunnel {{was made in the}} late 19th century, on the English side [...] "in the hope of forcing the hand of the English Government". The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994. At £5.5 billion (1985 prices), it was at the time the most expensive construction project ever proposed. The cost finally came in at £9 billion ($21 billion), well over its predicted budget.|$|R

Ideas for a <b>cross-Channel</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> appeared as early as 1802, but British political and press pressure over compromised national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel. The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and was opened by British Queen Elizabeth II and French President François Mitterrand in a ceremony held in Calais on 6 May 1994. The same year the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Channel Tunnel as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{optimality}} of separable encoding and decoding over parallel channels (fading states) for ergodic fading twouser interference channels (IFCs) is studied using {{a one-sided}} IFC as a model. For an ergodic fading one-sided IFC with nonfading direct links and a fading <b>cross-channel</b> <b>link,</b> it is shown that separability can be strictly suboptimal {{except for the}} cases where all the parallel channels are of the same type, i. e., {{all of them are}} either strong but not very strong or very strong channels. A recent result on the sum-capacities of the classes of ergodic strong and very strong IFCs is used to show that encoding and decoding jointly over all parallel channels is optimal when either the strong or very strong interference conditions hold on average over all channels.

5000|$|Chaine was {{influential}} {{in developing the}} <b>cross-channel</b> <b>links</b> between Larne and Stranraer, Scotland. He {{was the director of}} the Larne and Stanraer Boat Company, and was the key figure behind the building of the Port and Harbour of Larne. He promoted and financed construction of railroad lines from Larne to Ballyclare and from Larne to Ballymena (the Ballymena and Larne Railway). He was elected at the 1874 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Antrim, and held the seat until his death at the age of 43 in May 1885. Chaine, James Porter Corry and William Ewart formed a minority of Irish MPs from [...] "the world of the big business" [...] while the majority were either landowners or descendants of the landed families. Chaine himself became a major landowner by the purchase of a ₤64,000 estate in Carncastle followed by a £22,000 estate in Killead.|$|R

The blocks are transmitted between each channel {{and all of the}} channels over <b>cross-channel</b> data <b>links,</b> each channel receiving the data blocks and determining the validity thereof by counting the number of data words received and comparing that number to the word count transmitted for that block.

40|$|URL] audienceIn GNSS receivers, {{the ability}} of guaranteeing {{continuous}} position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions is linked with their capacity of maintaining lock with the satellite signals. However, {{this is not always}} possible and in degraded environments the received signals can be strongly attenuated or affected by errors that cause the tracking loops to lose lock and the navigation processor to be unable to produce a useful positioning solution. A particularly challenging environment is represented by the presence of ionospheric scintillations that combine signal fading and fast phase variations. These effects can severely test receiver tracking loops and their capacity to follow the received signal changes. Carrier tracking through phase lock loops (PLL) is especially susceptible to losing lock. Amplitude scintillations may in fact generate deep fades in the received signal power that in worst cases can cause the signal to drop below the lock threshold; on the other hand, phase scintillations cause rapid carrier phase changes that might produce cycle slips and even cause loss of lock. This lack of robustness strongly impacts receiver performance as it reduces carrier phase measurements availability, the capability to demodulate the navigation message data and the ability to perform carrier-smoothing. This is the motivation behind the study of innovative architectures to improve receiver robustness and aid the phase tracking process. Ionospheric scintillation mitigation can in fact be achieved by improving carrier tracking ability to sustain rapidly changing received signals. Different tracking schemes could be envisaged; in this paper a Vector Frequency Lock Loop (VFLL) assisted PLL is described. Vector tracking loops are interesting as they allow implementing <b>cross-channel</b> aiding by <b>linking</b> together all received signals through the receiver position and velocity. The aim of this paper is therefore to present the VFLL-assisted PLL receiver architecture describing the system model and feedback generation process and to test its feasibility in scintillation scenarios. To reproduce the scintillation effect, the Cornell Scintillation Model (CSM) has been used and simulations that quantify the performance in terms of phase tracking error variance, cycle slips and loss of lock are conducted...|$|R
