40|$|Content {{from social}} media {{sites such as}} Twitter, YouTube, <b>Facebook</b> <b>and</b> <b>Instagram</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming}} {{an important part of}} modern journalism. Of particular importance to real-time breaking news is amateur on the spot incident reports and eyewitness images and videos. With breaking news having tight reporting deadlines, measured in minutes not days, the need to quickly verify suspicious content is paramount [1] [3]. Journalists are increasingly looking to pre-filter and automate the simpler parts of the verification process. Current tools available to journalists can be broadly categorized as dashboard and in-depth analytic tools. Dashboard tools display filtered traffic volumes, trending hashtags and maps of content by topic, author and/or location. In-depth analysis tools use techniques such as sentiment analysis, social network graph visualization and topic tracking. These tools help journalists manage social media content but unverified rumours and fake news stories on social media are becoming both increasingly common [2] and increasingly difficult to spot. The current best practice for journalistic user generated content (UGC) verification [1] follows a hard to scale manual process involving journalists reviewing content from trusted sources with the ultimate goal of phoning up authors to verify specific images/videos and then asking permission to use that content for publication...|$|E

Over the past two years, the University of North Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Thomas G. Carpenter Library has used its social media presence (@unflibrary) to listen and then engage with students. This practice has led the Carpenter Library to build a reliable, friendly, and helpful online community that has inspired other departments on campus to do the same. By monitoring keywords, hashtags, and geotags, library staff has kept tabs on what students have to say about the library’s various services, resources, spaces, employees, and more. Sometimes the tweets or posts are lighthearted and positive; for example, recent tweets include “The unf library is the MVP of finals week!” and “Love spending time at the UNF Library”. Other times real concerns or complaints are voiced, allowing the library staff to reach out online and address as best they can. The act of listening has also allowed the Carpenter Library to begin fun and engaging conversations with students, which many times leads to that individual liking the library’s reply, retweeting/reposting, and often following the library account. Over the past two years, follower counts on Facebook and Twitter have almost doubled, as have engagements such as likes and shares. This presentation will share a variety of exchanges and informal data points that have been generated by using social listening, how other libraries can easily follow suit, and ways in which the Carpenter Library plans to move forward...|$|E

40|$|Many major sports leagues {{including}} the National Football League, Major League Baseball, and Ultimate Fighting Championship have consistently used the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) to remove user-created GIFs, Vines, and related content that {{make use of}} the leagues’ copyrighted broadcast material on Twitter. This Article analyzes Twitter users’ right of fair use in the leagues’ copyrighted material, while suggesting that sports leagues and their agents may not be following the Ninth Circuit’s Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. decision, which requires copyright owners to consider fair use before submitting DMCA takedown notices. Sports leagues’ protocol and actions towards GIFs and Vines on Twitter are the backdrop used to examine Twitter’s conflicted role and inconsistent history in complying with an array of DMCA takedown notices across varied forms and industries. On Twitter, the DMCA has not served to successfully strike a balance between the rights of the copyright holder and user. Instead, the law adversely impacts users making fair use of copyrightable material and makes that use fundamentally impractical on a social media service that exists in and mirrors, the real-time lives of its users. Whether a user posts material that is eventually found to be infringing or not, that material may easily be blocked {{for a period of time}} that would make its eventual reinstatement to the service effectively meaningless. Barring a court ruling on the issue of fair use in GIFs, Vines, and similar material, changes should be made to section 512 of the DMCA in order to strike a more equitable balance between copyright owner and fair user. The DMCA must reflect the truth that popular social media platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, <b>Facebook,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Instagram,</b> <b>are</b> each utilized for distinctive purposes and that the laws that achieve fairness in digital copyright on one service may also serve to suppress free speech and the right of fair use on another...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{development}} of, and the opportunities that social media provides for different groups in society, companies and organizations are encouraged to be present on, and {{be a part of}} the new social media landscape. This research examines how five companies and five organizations use social media as a tool to create relationships with individuals, and what role social media plays in the daily communication work. The social media platforms discussed in this research companies and organizations can utilize not only to create an identity and work with branding, but also to apply two-way communication with individuals. The research applies qualitative interviews with representatives from each company and organization. The main findings revealed surprisingly that there are not any significant differences between companies’ and organizations’ way of using social media, but that it differs more between different kinds of companies and organizations. Most companies and organizations use different social media platforms for different purposes or to reach different target groups. <b>Facebook</b> <b>and</b> <b>Instagram</b> <b>are</b> the two platforms that most companies and organizations from the research use. Facebook is generally used to share information and Instagram to inspire. Furthermore, social media provides different possibilities to reach out to people than more traditional ways of communication such as print advertising and newsletters. Hence, social media plays an important role in the work with communication in order to reach out to people and can have a decisive effect for companies and organizations. The advantages of social media that the participating companies and organizations emphasized are that they get to have their own voice, they can themselves create interest and commitment, rather than using a PR-firm for example, and it enables two-way communication which in turn foster relationships with individuals. Finally, one of the biggest advantages highlighted is the fast communication that is enabled on social media platforms which keep the companies and organizations closer to the publi...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The many {{natural and}} human-induced {{disasters}} and dramas {{of recent years}} now automatically feature an avalanche of social media. Imagining major public events without Twitter, <b>Facebook</b> <b>and</b> <b>Instagram</b> <b>is</b> actually becoming difficult, although these things are still so new. Think of the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney in December 2014, or Cyclone Marcia that hit central Queensland in February 2015. While mainstream media (MSM) were there in droves, {{much of what we}} saw, heard and read came from the immediate first-hand accounts of people on the scene, using their smartphones and tablets to flood the social media spaces with material eagerly consumed by a hungry and switched-on audience. 'Trending' (that is, to become the subject of many posts online within a comparatively short period of time) has become something not only desirable and but also keenly followed by individuals and institutions around the globe. Some would argue that digital and social media have democratised and invigorated the media; others that they have sent them into a downward spiral.

A survey was created to corral information about the youth’s experience. The survey was sent to two schools in Stockholm, the junior high school Rålambshovsskolan and the high school Thorildsplans gymnasium.
