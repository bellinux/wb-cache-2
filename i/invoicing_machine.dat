5000|$|Following the Second World War, the Sömmerda factory {{then found}} itself in the newly formed East Germany, with {{development}} and production now continuing as a state-run enterprise, but using the pre-war Rheinmetall name and logo. In 1957, {{a group of young}} electronics engineers under the collective direction of Heinz Skolaude brought Volkseigener Betrieb Büromaschinenwerk Sömmerda into being and into the age of electronics. In 1960 the name was changed to [...] "Supermetall" [...] and then in 1962 to the [...] "Soemtron" [...] name, when they exhibited at the Leipzig trade Fair of that year an electronic Fakturierautomaten (Automatic <b>Invoicing</b> <b>machine)</b> - the model EFA 380. 1963 saw the next model the EFA 381 with magnetic core memory.|$|E

Furthermore, Naïve Bayes Algorithm and the advantages of using it will be discussed.   With information gathered from theory and previous research, I will show how to classify images into a receipt or an invoice. Also, it includes pre-processing images {{using a variety of}} pre-processing methods and text extraction using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Moreover, the necessity of pre-processing images to reach a higher accuracy will be discussed. A result shows a comparison between Tesseract OCR engine and FineReader OCR engine. After embracing much knowledge from theory and discussion, the results showed that combining FineReader OCR engine and Machine Learning is increasing the accuracy of the image classification...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the article is a classification of calculating machines together with a discussion on those features of each group of machines important to operators. The different groups are: I mechanical machines (two and four operational, and accounting and <b>invoicing</b> <b>machines),</b> II calculating machines — analitical (with auxilliary, basic and complimentary partitions), III computers (analogical and digits, among which are machines for converting data numerical calculations and machines for operating and controlling processes). After a general review of various types of machines {{we come to the}} point of discussion — economical application of calculating machines, the term economical being in the sense of economize. Statics show the advantage of using various types of machines, an advantage which grows, with the increasing degree of mechanism and automation. The difficult in gauging all the economical effects gained must be emphasized. The economical application of calculating machines can also be understood in the sense applied in economy or as used by economists. The second part of this article is devoted to this problem. Whereas non-electronic machines are used mainly in mechanization of records in enterprises, with electronic machines macroeconomics can be differentiated from microeconomics. In each of them a different approach is necessary to convert data in comparison to numerical calculations. By specifying the concrete applications, within these four groups, in the work in enterprises and institutes, we can asses the posibilites of applying the latest achievements in automatization of calculations. In discussing the anticipated trends of development of electronic digit machines the author portrays the perspectives in this field and the -tasks facing economists.
