This alteration, if true, would strengthen the case for Swedenborg’s work being viewed by Kant, in the last analysis, positively. However, the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> difficult to determine since the key date involved is that of the original of the Knobloch letter, which is lost.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that we’re in our thirties now {{and that}} breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We {{did a lot of}} shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like {{to think of it as}} unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

[...] That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that George G.

500|$|Zappa {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of Guitar World, Jon Swenson declared: [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that [...] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such." [...] His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of Guitar Player magazine wrote: [...] "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." [...] The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by [...] "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth legato technique, while Zappa's right was [...] "one of the fastest pick hands in the business." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video game}} version of Mona Sax was {{critically}} acclaimed for {{being one of}} [...] "relatively complex, non-stereotypical female game characters". She was included on the 2007 list of 50 greatest female characters in video game history by Tom's Games, where she was described as [...] "a stone-cold killer who's incredibly tempting but not entirely trustworthy" [...] and [...] "the perfect female accomplice to Max Payne." [...] In 2008, PC Games Hardware also listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video games. In 2012, David Sanchez of GameZone proposed that Mona appear in her own spin-off game, calling her [...] "one of the sexiest femme fatales in all of gaming", and added, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that Mona Sax is one hell of a character — one that hasn't starred in her very own game, but one that could very well do so and deliver an unforgettable experience." [...] That same year, Austin Yorski of Blistered Thumbs listed Mona among his personal favorites while discussing the portrayals of video game female characters. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the 20th-best supporting character in video games.|$|E

[...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E

[...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television.

[...] "And {{if you look at the}} cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year.

Historian David Dumville summed up his position: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought...

Between December 1848 and March 1850, he wrote several influential essays, some of them quite lengthy. He also spent much of this time working out detailed scenarios for several other operas on a variety of historical and mythical figures: Jesus Christ, Achilles, Friedrich Barbarossa and Wieland der Schmied. None of these operas ever saw the light of day, though one musical sketch survives for Jesus von Nazareth.|$|E
